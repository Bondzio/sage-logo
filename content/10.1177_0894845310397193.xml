Moderation effects of mother–adolescent relation quality on the linkage between maternal socialization messages and adolescents' outcomes were also examined. Participants were 245 single African American mothers and their seventh- and eighth-grade children. Results showed that for boys, greater frequency of conventional messages (e.g., importance of discipline, hard work, and skills for job success) was associated with stronger endorsement of hard work for success, whereas for girls, this association was found only for those who perceived positive relations with their mothers. Race-related messages (e.g., the notion that African Americans have to work harder than Anglo Americans to get ahead) predicted girls' effort in schoolwork, but only among those who had less positive relations with their mothers. The importance of mother–child relations in the transmission of mothers' socialization messages to children is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>career</kwd><kwd>race socialization</kwd><kwd>African American families</kwd><kwd>adolescents</kwd><kwd>single parent</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Adolescence is a period of transition from school to the world of adult work. In this developmental stage, one is socialized to develop occupational interests and values, attitudes, beliefs, and expectations that are thought to ease the school-to-work transition. Work orientations developed during early or middle adolescence are considered important because of their potential to influence occupational aspirations and choices in late adolescence or early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894845310397193">Diemer &amp; Hsieh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894845310397193">Goldstein &amp; Oldham, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845310397193">Mortimer &amp; Kumka, 1982</xref>). In his psychosocial development theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894845310397193">Erikson (1968)</xref> proposed early to mid-adolescence is a time when youth come to identify themselves with workers in society, understand the roles of certain occupations, and develop a sense of work ethic and interests in future occupations.</p><p>Family is considered one of the most important contexts in which work socialization occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894845310397193">Vondracek, Lerner, &amp; Schulenberg, 1986</xref>). Within the family context, parental influence is regarded as particularly significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894845310397193">Super (1957)</xref> asserts that adolescents' work-related values and attitudes develop through interaction and identification with socializing agents, particularly parents and significant others. Although there is evidence that adolescents of color from low-income families tend to have lower occupational self-efficacy and expectations than Anglo American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845310397193">Constantine, Erickson, Banks, &amp; Timberlake, 1998</xref>), remarkably little is known about how families of color socialize their children for the world of work. The present study assessing the relation between maternal work socialization and adolescents' work-related values in a sample of low-income African American families is a small step toward redressing this gap.</p><sec id="section2-0894845310397193"><title>Work Socialization in African American Families</title><p>For a substantial proportion of African American families, familial socialization of African American children into the world of work occurs within the context of several employment-related disadvantages. First, African Americans have long been disadvantaged in the labor market. Compared to their Anglo American counterparts, African American adults typically are twice as likely to be unemployed and are substantially more vulnerable to layoffs and job displacements because of structural changes in the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845310397193">James, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894845310397193">Wilson, 1987</xref>). Parallel race disparities exist among adolescents. In both inner cities and the general U.S. population, African American youth are more likely to be unemployed than Hispanic or White youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845310397193">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894845310397193">Entwisle, Alexander, &amp; Olson, 2000</xref>). In 2007, 29.4% of 16- to 19-year-old African Americans were unemployed, compared to 15.7% of their Anglo American counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894845310397193">U.S. Department of Labor, 2008</xref>). Helping adolescents successfully transition from a student role to an adult worker role is challenging when youth employment opportunities are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894845310397193">Bowman, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, parents who are unemployed or have a history of unstable employment may not exemplify the value and rewards of employment as prominently as stably employed parents and therefore may be weaker models of the worker role. These circumstances may have consequences for adolescent children’s orientation toward the future. Prior research indicates that adolescents are more optimistic about their economic and occupational futures if their parents are employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894845310397193">Quane &amp; Rankin, 1998</xref>), if they perceive their families as experiencing less financial strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845310397193">Flanagan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894845310397193">Larson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894845310397193">McLoyd &amp; Jozefowicz, 1996</xref>), and if they perceive their parents as having more favorable work experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845310397193">Neblett &amp; Cortina, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Another employment-related disadvantage disproportionately shared by African Americans is residence in poor neighborhoods. African Americans who are poor are much more likely than their Anglo American counterparts to live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. Living in such neighborhoods may lower adolescents' occupational aspirations, expectations, and choices and even their motivation to work or seek employment because of fewer role models of adult workers/mentors, fewer opportunities to gain work experiences and less access to information about jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845310397193">Constantine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845310397193">Diemer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894845310397193">Smith, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894845310397193">Wilson, 1987</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894845310397193">Cook et al. (1996)</xref> reported that as early as second grade, the occupational expectations of urban African American boys living in poor neighborhoods mirror existing race and class differences in adult job holdings when compared to those of middle-class Anglo American boys.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0894845310397193"><title>Parental Race-Related Messages About Work</title><p>The literature suggests that many African American parents emphasize to their children that education and hard work are core prerequisites for upward mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894845310397193">Stevenson, Chen, &amp; Uttal, 1990</xref>). Together with the emphasis on the value of education and hard work, many African American parents impart messages to their children about racial barriers and inequalities in society and teach or model coping strategies for dealing with negative race-related experiences. This race socialization appears to be a significant part of the child rearing of African American parents in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845310397193">Bowman &amp; Howard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894845310397193">Coard &amp; Sellers, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have investigated the types of race-related socialization messages that African American parents communicate to their children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845310397193">Boykin &amp; Toms, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894845310397193">Hughes, Rodriguez, Smith, Johnson, &amp; Stevenson, 2006</xref>), while others have examined the linkages between parents' race-related socialization messages and children’s and adolescents' outcomes, such as socioemotional adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894845310397193">Harris-Britt, Valrie, Kurtz-Costes, &amp; Rowley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894845310397193">McHale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894845310397193">Stevenson, Reed, Bodison, &amp; Bishop, 1997</xref>), identification with their own ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894845310397193">Hughes &amp; Chen, 1997</xref>), ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894845310397193">Hughes &amp; Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894845310397193">McHale et al., 2006</xref>), cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894845310397193">Spencer, 1983</xref>), and school achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894845310397193">Marshall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894845310397193">Thomas &amp; Speight, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Although research on the nature and correlates of racial socialization has burgeoned during the past 15 years, surprisingly little empirical study has been devoted to the nature, extent, and correlates of African American parents' discussions with their adolescent children specifically about employment and career issues. In one of the few studies of these issues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894845310397193">McCabe and Barnett (2000)</xref> found that the frequency with which African American mothers discussed children’s future careers was positively associated with the level of salience and detail of children’s thinking about their futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894845310397193">McCabe &amp; Barnett, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding African American parents' emphasis on education as a vehicle for upward mobility, low-income African American youth tend to develop beliefs that academic strivings and school achievement will not lead to fulfillment of their occupational aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845310397193">Graham, Taylor, &amp; Hudley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845310397193">Jackson, Kacanski, Rust, &amp; Beck, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845310397193">Mickelson (1990)</xref> contends that African American youths hold dual value or belief systems, specifically, abstract attitudes and beliefs on one hand and concrete attitudes and beliefs on the other. The system of abstract attitudes and beliefs is consistent with the mainstream ideology of valuing education and hard work, whereas the system of concrete attitudes and beliefs is shaped by African American youths' daily experiences and observations of racial discrimination, prejudice, and the unequal opportunity structure. Given this dual belief system, African American adolescents, compared to their Anglo American counterparts, may perceive fewer occupational and financial returns on education. Drawing on Mickelson’s conceptualization, the present study focuses on two types of socialization messages race-related messages and conventional messages that are analogous to Mickelson’s abstract versus concrete attitudes/beliefs, respectively. We hypothesized that both types of messages about work would positively predict adolescents' endorsement of work-related values and that race-related messages would be related more strongly than conventional messages to adolescents' endorsement of work-related values.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0894845310397193"><title>Mother–Adolescent Relations as a Context for Work Socialization</title><p>Whether children internalize the values and messages that parents communicate to them is conditional on several factors. Scholars suggest that one of the important factors influencing children’s acceptance of parental messages is the affective quality of parent–child relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845310397193">Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894845310397193">Schulenberg, Vondracek, &amp; Crouter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894845310397193">Smalls, 2009</xref>). Previous studies report a negative association between college students' conflictual interactions with their opposite-sex parents and vocational identity (i.e., having a clear and stable sense of work-related goals, interests, and abilities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845310397193">Lopez, 1989</xref>) and a positive relation between the quality of family relations and adolescents' career planning attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894845310397193">Hargrove, Inman, &amp; Crane, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Research testing the occupational linkages hypothesis also speaks to the role of parent–child relations in the transmission of parents' work values to their children. This hypothesis states that the characteristics of parents' occupations will result in the acquisition of personality characteristics and work values that are needed to meet their occupational roles, which in turn, will influence their socialization orientations, including parenting practices and parent–child communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845310397193">Mortimer &amp; Kumka, 1982</xref>). The major assumption in the hypothesis is that the values and beliefs that children consider important for success in the adult world of work are transmitted through relations with their parents who have acquired those values and beliefs in meeting their occupational demands. Testing this occupational linkage hypothesis, Mortimer and Kumka found a statistically significant and positive relation between sons' reports of supportive relations with their fathers and sons' endorsement of their fathers' work values. The study also found a distinctive pattern of work socialization such that a supportive relation with fathers predicted sons' intrinsic and people-oriented work values if the father had a professional occupation (e.g., physicians, lawyers, and college professors) but extrinsic work values if the father had a business occupation (e.g., store managers and sales persons).</p><p>Drawing on these findings, and evidence that the affective quality of parent–child relations influences children’s acceptance of parental messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845310397193">Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894845310397193">Schulenberg et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894845310397193">Smalls, 2009</xref>), we predicted that increases in positive mother–adolescent relations would covary with increases in adolescents' endorsement of work-related values. We also predicted that mother–adolescent relationship quality would moderate the association between mother’s socialization messages and adolescents' work-related values with a stronger association existing when the quality of mother–adolescent relations is more positive.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0894845310397193" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="section6-0894845310397193"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 245 single African American mothers and their seventh- and eighth-grade children recruited for a study of the impact of economic conditions on African American families. Data were collected between 1990 and 1991 from families living in predominantly lower socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods in Flint, Michigan. Because the city is characterized by a cyclical economy based primarily on the automobile industry, the city’s unemployment rate typically exceeds the national and state averages during recessions, with the city’s unemployment rates of 10.1% and 16.6% in 1988 and 2009, respectively, as compared to 5.3% and 9.3% for the national averages in 1988 and 2009, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845310397193">Ananich, Leighton, &amp; Weber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845310397193">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Given the city’s economic history, the present study should be viewed as one providing information about parental work socialization and its relation to adolescent work-related values within the context of high unemployment and macroeconomic decline.</p><p>The sample was recruited through a multiple-step screening procedure. First, the names were obtained of all seventh- and eighth-grade African American students in two public middle schools. If the contact parents on the school lists were female, a letter that explained the purpose of the study was mailed. A telephone screening interview was conducted with 715 mothers and legal guardians. Through this interview, 377 families in which the mother or female guardian was not married and not living with a partner were selected. Among the selected families eligible for the study, interviews were completed with 268 mothers or female legal guardians and one focal adolescent child (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894845310397193">McLoyd, Jayaratne, Ceballo, &amp; Borquez, 1994</xref> for a more detailed description of the sampling technique and recruitment procedures of the present study).</p><p>Using listwise deletion, 23 of the 268 mother–adolescent pairs were excluded from subsequent data analysis due to missing cases, leaving a total of 245 mother–adolescent pairs.

Approximately one third of mothers (37%) were employed (28% full-time and 9% part-time). Sixty-three percent were unemployed or received public assistance.

Mothers and focal children were interviewed separately, although this was not always possible. During the interview, questions were read aloud to the participant.

Using this booklet, participants provided their response to each question, which was then recorded by the interviewer. Interviews averaged about 2 hr for the mother and 1 hr and 20 min for the child.

Adolescents responded to each item on a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Cronbach’s alpha was .54.

Because the pattern of bivariate correlations among our major study variables differed for boys and girls (discussed above), we conducted separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses for boys and girls. Prior to regression analyses, multivariate assumptions were checked based on tests for normality of residuals and pairwise lineality. Results showed that there was no violation of the assumptions. In addition, a collinearity test based on variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance was conducted to examine multicollinearity among the predictor variables.

Then, mother’s conventional and race-related messages and adolescent reports of mother–adolescent relation quality were entered simultaneously to investigate the main effects of the variables. Finally, to test the moderating hypothesis, two interaction terms were entered into the regression equation. The interaction terms were created by multiplying each type of socialization message and quality of mother–adolescent relations.

Although a rich body of research documents determinants of students' achievement motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845310397193">Eccles, Wigfield, &amp; Schiefele, 1998</xref>), research has identified relatively few antecedents of children and adolescents' internalization of the work ethic, that is, the notion that hard work is essential to occupational and economic success. The present study represents a step toward filling this gap.</p><p>Although we found no main effect of maternal race-related messages on either adolescents' school effort or endorsement of hard work, an important contribution of the present study is its expansion of racial socialization to encompass messages pertaining specifically to work life. Previous studies of racial socialization have tended to focus on broad race-related messages that are not context specific. The lack of relationship in the present study between maternal race-related messages and adolescents' work-related values may signal that the strength and nature of the association is conditional on factors not examined in the present study. Alternatively, our null finding may have resulted because the seventh and eighth graders in our study are too immature cognitively to process the messages their mothers are imparting about the potential impact of racial barriers on future job opportunities. With increased maturity and growth in racial identity processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894845310397193">Phinney, 1990</xref>), these adolescents may become more susceptible to the messages their mothers are sending them about racial barriers in the labor market.</p><p>The present study found partial support for our hypothesis that derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845310397193">Mickelson’s (1990)</xref> conception of concrete and abstract attitudes. Conventional work socialization messages did not predict adolescents' reported work-related values, except for boys' value in hard work as a determinant of work success. This pattern of null findings suggests that accentuating education, skills, and good work habits as prerequisites for job success may not be sufficient to enhance the school efforts of African American adolescents from low-income families. In this regard, mothers' conventional socialization messages, similar to the abstract attitudes conceptualized by Mickelson, may not fit their children’s perceptions of their realities, and therefore, may not be viewed as useful in preparing them for work or career success.</p><p>However, consistent with prior research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845310397193">Mortimer &amp; Kumka, 1982</xref>), we found that African American adolescents with more positive relations with their mothers reportedly made greater efforts to do well academically. Moreover, among girls, but not boys, quality of mother–adolescent relations moderated the link between maternal conventional messages and adolescent school effort. This moderating effect suggests that girls devote greater efforts to academic endeavors when conventional messages about the importance of skills, education, and training needed to obtain good employment are imparted in the context of higher levels of maternal support, encouragement, and affection. In short, girls are more likely to internalize conventional values about the importance of education and behave in accord with those values when they have good relations with their mothers. The reason that a comparable moderating effect was not found among boys is unclear and a question that warrants further study.</p><p>Another perplexing finding in the present study is the moderating effect of quality of mother–adolescent relations on the link between race-related messages and girls' efforts in schoolwork. Contrary to prediction, it was in the context of less positive mother–daughter relations, not in the context of more positive mother–daughter relations, that race-related messages were associated with stronger school effort among girls. A possible explanation can be that girls who are devoting little effort to their schoolwork or who are not doing well in school may have strained relations with their mothers precisely for these reasons. By emphasizing the special challenges that await African American youth who do poorly in school, mothers may attempt to dissuade this pattern of behavior and cultivate more conscientiousness about schoolwork in their daughters. These girls may be most responsive to messages about racial barriers because their level of effort in schoolwork was low to begin with. These speculations, however, need to be examined in future research.</p><sec id="section19-0894845310397193"><title>Implications for Career Development Theory and Counseling</title><p>Our findings underscore the role of parents in the development of adolescents' work-related values, as more harmonious mother–adolescent relations predicted stronger endorsement of hard work as a determinant of work success among boys and greater willingness to invest in academic work among both boys and girls. One implication of these findings pertains to parental involvement in adolescents' preparation for future employment and careers. Career counselors working in prevention and intervention programs and other contexts may be more effective in helping low-income adolescents identify career goals, identify plans for reaching those goals, and develop a more positive future orientation when they actively involve parents in this process, especially if the parent–adolescent relationship is close and harmonious.</p><p>Involving low-income parents in their adolescents' explorations of employment and career options and in the subsequent planning process offers opportunities not only to develop beneficial alliances with parents but to positively affect parents' work-related perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge to increase parents' awareness of their influence on the adolescent’s future orientation and career development and to discuss strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood that youth will receive the messages that parents intend to impart. Having single mothers become involved successfully in career counseling for their adolescent children can be achieved through individual guidance sessions or in a group format such as workshops, evening parent meetings, or short-term parent programs. Regardless of the format that may be adopted, however, in order to create opportunities to work with these mothers, the career counselor needs to become sensitive to a variety of life situations and negative experiences that single-mother African Americans tend to face. For example, single-mothers' lives tend to be significantly influenced by their severe financial and job situations, which could cause the mothers to lack time in interacting with their children actively for school matters and develop negative physical (e.g., chronic fatigue) and psychological health (e.g., depression and anxiety). The counselor also needs to consider the significant influences that those experiences have on these mothers' ability to become actively involved in activities held at their child’s school. Many single parents may experience unfavorable reactions at school, such as prejudice from teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845310397193">Colpin, Vandemeulebroecke, &amp; Ghessquiere, 2004</xref>). These negative experiences that single-mothers tend to have are considered barriers for these parents to have involved at school and a source of their unwillingness to involve in activities at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845310397193">Colpin et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>African American parents, particularly from impoverished families, are less involved in their child’s school, compared to European American parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894845310397193">Hill &amp; Craft, 2003</xref>). Therefore, single-mother African Americans may particularly be less willing to approach or collaborate with career counselors regarding their children’s career issues. It is imperative for career counselors to enhance sensitivity to single-mother African Americans' experiences in order to encourage their active involvement.</p></sec><sec id="section20-0894845310397193"><title>Study Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>Caution must be exercised in interpreting the findings of the present study because of several limitations. First and most significantly, the current study is limited in terms of the psychometric properties of our measures. Measures with higher reliability and established validity would provide a more rigorous test of the study’s hypothesis, as would use of different informants about mother–adolescent relationship quality, and multiple indicators of adolescent outcomes. Second, data were collected from single mothers and their adolescents residing in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. The study’s findings may not apply to African American households that have different family structures and higher SES. Besides, the data for the present study were collected several years ago. The demographic make-up of the city in which the data were collected and the schools from which participants were recruited has been fairly stable over the years. In addition, the city’s economic climate continues to be unfavorable, relative to other cities in Michigan and to the nation as a whole. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the opportunity structure within the employment sector has changed fundamentally. For these reasons, we believe that our findings are generalizable to low-income, single-mother African American families currently residing in the city, but caution is warranted nevertheless. Finally, the present study’s cross-sectional design does not allow us to claim any causal relations among variables. Experimental methods would be useful in determining the impact of different types of work-related messages on youth’s beliefs and attitudes and identifying the mechanisms through which different types of messages exert their influence.</p><p>In summary, the present study examined the effect of single-mother African Americans' socialization messages regarding work on adolescents' work-related values of hard work and effort in schoolwork. The results indicated the effects of mothers' socialization messages on adolescents' work-related values were moderated by adolescents' sex and their perceptions of relationship quality with their parents. These findings suggest that single-mother African Americans' socialization messages may have different effects on adolescent’s values of work, depending on the context in which those messages are communicated to adolescent children. More studies are needed to better understand processes through which adolescents from single-parent families, including African American families, may be socialized through socialization messages from parents regarding not only values, beliefs, and motivation in their future work life but also their career aspirations and significant decisions regarding career choice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0894845310397193"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0894845310397193"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article: The data used in the study were collected with support from grant R01MH44662 from the National Institute of Mental Health awarded to the second author.
