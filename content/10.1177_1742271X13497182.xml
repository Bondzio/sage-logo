<p><bold>How acute kidney injury is investigated and managed in UK intensive care units – survey of current practice.</bold> Jones S, Devonald M. <italic>Nephrol Dial Transplant</italic> 2013;<bold>28</bold>;1186–90</p>
<p>Results from this survey indicate that methods of managing acute kidney injury vary enormously in UK intensive care units. It seems that few are following recommendations. However, my main surprise here is that the authors state that 'only 46.4%' of units have 24 hour access to a renal ultrasound service. I would have expected the figure to be much lower.</p>
<p><bold>A review of computer-based simulators for ultrasound training.</bold> Blum T, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Simul Healthcare: J Soc Med Simul</italic> 2013;<bold>8</bold>;98–108</p>
<p>This excellent review from Munich discusses the merits and drawbacks of simulators available for ultrasound training. Physical phantoms, computer-based phantoms and haptic devices are considered within the context of the clinical domain for which they were developed. Concepts on how simulators facilitate novices to start to mentally map 2D images with 3D anatomy are explored. Cost considerations, supervision time and the possibility of improving standardisation of training are included. This is essential reading for any educator thinking of investing in a simulator.</p>
<p><bold>Ultrasound for diagnosing acute salpingitis: a prospective observational diagnostic study.</bold> Romosan G, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Hum Reprod</italic> 2013;<bold>28</bold>:1569–79</p>
<p>The sample size is small here at just 52 women; however, the researchers found that ultrasound is very good at identifying moderate to severe salpingitis, and therefore aids decisions on whether or not to proceed to laparoscopy. It's the women with mild salpingitis who remain difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p><bold>How do national guidelines frame clinical ethics practice? A comparative analysis of guidelines from the US, the UK, Canada and France.</bold> Gaucher N, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Soc Sci Med</italic> 2013;<bold>85</bold>:74–8</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper. It shows that Clinical Ethics Committees (CECs) have quite different roles and functions depending on the country in which they exist. Developed within a highly litigious environment, CECs in the United States have a strong decision-making role, whereas those in the UK, driven by clinicians, have a more supportive role. The point of this paper is to highlight the fact that it is very difficult to develop any kind of international regulation policy for CECs.</p>
<p><bold>Reliability of manual and semi-automated measurements of nuchal translucency by experienced operators.</bold> Pruksanusak N, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Intl J Gyn Obst</italic> 2013;<bold>121</bold>:240–2</p>
<p>As with similar previous studies, this paper finds that nuchal measurements obtained manually and with a semi-automated package are comparable. It suggests that both methods have similar reliability although the semi-automated software measures slightly larger. This too matches other papers and, indeed, my own experience. In summary, such software systems don't help alleviate the graft required to obtain the right section but they may save some time and effort with calliper placement.</p>
<p><bold>Safety and tolerability of a focused ultrasound device for treatment of adipose tissue in subjects undergoing abdominoplasty: a placebo–control pilot study.</bold> Shalom A, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Dermatol Surg</italic> 2013;<bold>39</bold>:744–51</p>
<p>Not only is HIFU showing great promise for destroying tumours, this pilot study of six people also shows that it may soon be recognised as a new, non-invasive 'body sculpting' method. Who knows? Its fat-busting properties may one day condemn good old liposuction to the history books.</p>
<p><bold>Wearable long duration ultrasound therapy in rotator cuff tendinopathy.</bold> Lewis G, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>J Acoust Soc Am</italic> 2013;<bold>133</bold>:3587</p>
<p>This pilot study from Ithaca, New York found that its subjects experienced a significant reduction in shoulder pain by wearing a 'pager-sized' therapeutic ultrasound device for three to four hours a day over 12 sessions.</p>
<p><bold>Ovarian tumor characterization and classification using ultrasound – a new online paradigm.</bold> Acharya U, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>J Dig Imaging</italic> 2013;<bold>26</bold>:544–53</p>
<p>As applications of computed aided diagnosis (CAD) continue to grow, this team looks at developing CAD in the context of classification of ovarian tumours using 3D ultrasound images. The tool yields impressive results with an accuracy of 97%, sensitivity of 94.3%, and specificity of 99.7%.</p>
<p><bold>Irreversible electroporation ablation of the liver can be detected with ultrasound B-mode and elastography.</bold> Au J, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Surgery</italic> 2013;<bold>153</bold>:787–93</p>
<p>Using an animal model (Yorkshire pigs to be precise), this study found that tissue destruction caused by ablative techniques can be identified accurately using both B-mode and ultrasound elastography. The size of the area destroyed correlated well with histological findings. Therefore, elastography may be a useful method for monitoring liver ablation.</p>
<p><bold>A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of radiology in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia.</bold> Robinson A, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Surg Endoscopy</italic> 2013;<bold>27</bold>:11–18</p>
<p>Based on the results of their meta-analysis, this team recommends herniography as the first line investigation in cases of occult inguinal hernia. I'm not sure how many centres still offer herniography today or, indeed, what the radiation dose is to all those young male groins, but they say ultrasound should be considered as second choice due to its inferior sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p><bold>Is groin ultrasound scan prior to hernia repair a useful diagnostic tool?</bold> Wells A, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>Surg Endoscopy Other Interventional Tech</italic> 2013;<bold>27:</bold>S150</p>
<p>Oh dear! Here’s another study on inguinal hernia detection, this time suggesting that ultrasound is worse than clinical examination for diagnosing inguinal hernia. Maybe it’s time for technique and training to be revisited?</p>
<p><bold>Misdiagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas of the lower limb associated with deep venous thrombosis: report of two cases and review of the literature.</bold> Perisano C, <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>BMC Musculoskel Disord</italic> 2013;<bold>14</bold>:64</p>
<p>This is neither original research nor an in depth review but, nevertheless, this report serves as a reminder to always consider the rare and unexpected. It describes two cases of persistent DVT and PE where the underlying cause was a leiomyosarcoma in the thigh. The authors' take-home message is that, although soft tissue sarcomas are rare, they may present initially by causing DVT.</p>
