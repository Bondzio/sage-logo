<p>The scope of <italic>AERJ</italic>’s Section on Social and Institutional Analysis (<italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA) is intentionally broad, focusing on “significant political, cultural, social, economic, and organizational issues in education.” The section’s contributors bring both the empirical social sciences and the humanities to bear, and its past editorial teams have done a remarkable job of including scholarship from across a wide spectrum of perspectives and methods. These include longitudinal analyses of groups’ educational trajectories across different types of institutions and under different kinds of policies, qualitative studies that focus on the institutional contexts of teaching and learning, studies of leadership practices under contemporary accountability regimes, and historical analyses of educational systems and practices. The methodological diversity of the SIA section is a strength, embracing a range of contributions, such as secondary analyses of nationally representative data sets, mixed-methods approaches that incorporate new techniques for analysis (e.g., social network analysis), and case studies that reveal new dimensions and dynamics of enduring concerns within policy research (e.g., equity). Most recently, under the leadership of outgoing editor Lois Weis, <italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA has increased its emphasis on higher education, immigrant education, and global perspectives in ways that broaden the range of the section.</p>
<p>The aforementioned areas of inquiry will remain staples of <italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA under the direction of the incoming editorial team. This team seeks also to attract scholarship from other perspectives that, although not altogether new to <italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA, have had a somewhat minor presence.</p>
<p>Anthropology is one such perspective. Anthropological work in education does much to illuminate the mismatch that so often occurs between practices of educational institutions and the practices of various social and cultural groups—for example, groups defined by race, class, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Such mismatches can result in poor performance in terms of the goals that educational institutions adopt and the denial of equality and justice more generally. Anthropological research in education also explores how educational institutions may themselves be implicated in producing inequality by incorporating and fostering norms that may be harmful, as in heterosexism, for example. Neither these kinds of issues nor the methodology used to address them is unique to anthropology, of course, and a number of sociological analyses published in recent years directly address inequality. The point of placing more explicit emphasis on anthropology is to expand the intellectual spectrum from which to draw illuminating analyses appropriate to the domain of <italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA.</p>
<p>Another perspective, actually a cluster of perspectives, is the genre of “humanities-oriented research,” for which AERA recently developed its “Standards for Reporting on Humanities-Oriented Research in AERA Publications” to complement its “Standards for Reporting on Empirical Social Science Research in AERA Publications.” Most central among humanities-oriented education research with respect to <italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA are history, law, and philosophy. Beyond being useful in analyzing the organizational and institutional levels, these perspectives can be particularly illuminating from the broader societal level, which importantly impinges on the organizational and institutional levels. Educational history situates educational organizations and institutions within the larger course of events and intersections of cultural and political change at different timescales than do many analyses of contemporary policies. Historical perspectives, of course, are essential to gaining an understanding of how organizations and institutions came to have the features they do. But history also sheds light on what kinds of reforms might be feasible, what the promising leverage points for reform might be, and how initiatives for change have remained the same or altered over time.</p>
<p>U.S. educational policy, particularly regarding equity, is highly interpenetrated by the law. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any important educational policies having to do with equity for which legislation and/or court rulings have not played a prominent role, from desegregation to women’s athletics. To be sure, education researchers and policy makers can use the findings of education research to push for more equitable educational practices, and not without some success. But surely the power of education research to effect progressive change is enhanced when it is combined with an understanding of the scope and limits of what educational organizations and institutions can do as circumscribed by the law and, when obstructive, what changes in law might be worth pursuing.</p>
<p>More so than is typical of other disciplines, philosophy focuses explicitly on the normative epistemological and moral-political commitments of education research and the policies and practices it examines. Whether education research focuses on human agency, statistical regularities, or both, it makes assumptions about the nature of knowledge about human activity. And educational policies currently at the forefront, such as school choice and accountability regimens, assume certain conceptions of democracy and justice that frame the central question of “What works?” By exposing these kinds of (often tacit) assumptions and subjecting them to critical examination, philosophy contributes to a clearer understanding of the conduct of education research and the policies and practices it investigates. It can also point the way toward improvement.</p>
<p>Looking to emerging research interests and approaches, new perspectives have been developed for analyzing the effects of the changing landscapes of educational systems. For example, researchers have explored the effects of public school choice from a complex systems perspective on educational policy. Their analyses illuminate thresholds within complex social systems that can help account for unexpected effects of policies. Other researchers are employing geographical perspectives to consider how educational opportunities are spatially organized to limit choices of some while expanding choices for others. Both of these perspectives are ones that are likely to advance policy research in education in ways that could lead to better informed policy making at multiple levels of educational systems.</p>
<p>Finally, the incoming editorial team envisions the need for interdisciplinary research in education that can address the most persistent challenges that policies are intended to address, from equity to accomplishing systemic improvements to teaching and learning at scale. Interdisciplinary perspectives complement what deep grounding in particular theories and methods of sociology, anthropology, history, and philosophy can illuminate about these challenges. Of particular importance are perspectives that blend the methods and foci of the two sections of <italic>AERJ</italic>. A number of learning scientists are collaborating with policy researchers on how to design and study supports for scaling up ambitious instructional practices linked to standards. These projects integrate the design-based research methods of learning scientists with the institutional perspective more typical of policy analysts and sociologists. Although historically isolated from one another, these scholars are beginning to form a new area of research, for which <italic>AERJ</italic>-SIA provides a suitable, important venue for publication.</p>
