<p><italic>Objective</italic>: Dexamethasone (Dex) is a synthetic glucocorticoid that has pro-anabolic and anticatabolic effects in cartilage tissue engineering systems, though the mechanisms by which these effects are mediated are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of Dex to chondrogenic medium would affect matrix production and aggrecanase activity of human and bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) cultured in self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels. <italic>Design</italic>: We cultured young bovine and adult human BMSCs in (RADA)<sub>4</sub> self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels in medium containing TGF-β1±Dex and analyzed extracellular matrix composition, aggrecan cleavage products, and the effects of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 on proteoglycan content, synthesis, and catabolic processing. <italic>Results</italic>: Dex improved proteoglycan synthesis and retention in agarose hydrogels seeded with young bovine cells but decreased proteoglycan accumulation in peptide scaffolds. These effects were mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Adult human BMSCs showed minimal matrix accumulation in agarose, but accumulated ~50% as much proteoglycan and collagen as young bovine BMSCs in peptide hydrogels. Dex reduced aggrecanase activity in (RADA)<sub>4</sub> and agarose hydrogels, as measured by anti-NITEGE Western blotting, for both bovine and human BMSC-seeded gels. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: The effects of Dex on matrix production are dependent on cell source and hydrogel identity.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissue engineering using bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) is an attractive strategy for healing cartilage defects. BMSCs have been shown to differentiate to a cartilage lineage in a variety of scaffolds and create cartilage-like extracellular matrix (ECM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947603512455196">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947603512455196"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947603512455196">4</xref></sup> These cells can be extracted without the need for further damage to the joint and expanded for several passages without losing differentiation potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947603512455196">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947603512455196">6</xref></sup> Additionally, BMSCs have been found to synthesize ECM with higher dynamic stiffness, longer sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) chains, and longer aggrecan core proteins than matrix synthesized by chondrocytes, regardless of donor age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603512455196">7</xref></sup> Despite progress in cartilage tissue engineering, further optimization is needed to improve integration with native tissue, mechanical function, and maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603512455196">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947603512455196">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>One strategy for improving our understanding of these complex systems is to investigate the specific effects of chemical factors added to the cellular microenvironment. Dexamethasone (Dex) is a synthetic glucocorticoid frequently added to culture medium for chondrogenesis studies, motivated by research demonstrating pellet cultures of rabbit BMSCs stimulated with TGF-β1 and Dex (TGF + Dex) grew larger than those cultured with TGF-β1 alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947603512455196">2</xref></sup> Additional studies found that TGF + Dex increased aggrecan biosynthesis and gene expression in bovine and human BMSCs over TGF-β1 alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947603512455196">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603512455196">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dex also has anticatabolic properties. The aggrecanases ADAMTS-4/5 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-4/5) are key destructive enzymes in human osteoarthritis progression and are involved in cytokine-induced aggrecanolysis in cartilage explants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603512455196">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947603512455196"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947603512455196">14</xref></sup> ADAMTS-4/5–generated aggrecan fragments are also found in BMSC-seeded hydrogels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> Recently, Dex was found to reduce sGAG loss and rescue proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage explants exposed to inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603512455196">15</xref></sup> The mechanisms through which Dex mediates pro-anabolic and anticatabolic effects is not well understood, though evidence that the glucocorticoid receptor mediates the increase in aggrecan mRNA levels caused by Dex has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603512455196">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have used self-assembling peptide hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering because they support TGF-β1-induced chondrogenesis of BMSCs <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> and have been successfully used for studies of cartilage repair in animal studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947603512455196">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603512455196">18</xref></sup> Additionally, self-assembling peptides have been used to deliver growth factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603512455196">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947603512455196"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947603512455196"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947603512455196">21</xref></sup> which is important for designing an optimal chondrogenic microenvironment as well as controlling sustained, local delivery of growth factors. Although scaffold-free, or pellet, cultures offer important culture systems for studying chondrogenesis, our objective was to investigate BMSC matrix production and catabolism in hydrogel scaffolds motivated by the long-term translational challenges of growth factor delivery and integration between neocartilage and adjacent native cartilage. We tested the hypothesis that chondrogenesis of human and bovine BMSCs in self-assembling peptide hydrogels, as well as subsequent matrix production and aggrecanase activity, would be responsive to chondrogenic medium supplemented with Dex. We compared the influence of Dex on chondrogenesis of young bovine BMSCs and adult human BMSCs in (RADA)<sub>4</sub> self-assembling peptide hydrogels and agarose hydrogels. By analyzing accumulation of sGAG, DNA, and collagen, the effects of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486, and aggrecan cleavage products, we found that cell source and scaffold environment changed the BMSC response to Dex, emphasizing the importance of optimizing these variables for neocartilage generation. Dex reduced ADAMTS-4/5 activity in (RADA)<sub>4</sub> self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels for both cell types.</p>

<sec id="section3-1947603512455196">
<title>Bovine BMSC Isolation and Expansion</title>
<p>Bovine BMSCs were extracted from the femora and tibiae of four 1- to 2-week-old calves (Research 87, Marlborough, MA) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> Briefly, marrow was isolated aseptically, homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged, and the cell fraction was plated on tissue culture plastic for 30 minutes to remove rapidly adhering cells. The remaining cell population was plated into flasks at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> mononuclear cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Remaining red blood cells were removed by a medium change 2 days after plating. Colonies were expanded in low glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Mediatech, Inc, Manassas, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, or ThermoScientific, Logan, UT), penicillin streptomycin amphotericin (PSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperzaineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (Invitrogen), and 1 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) until reaching 80% confluence as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> Cells were then removed by 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Invitrogen) and frozen for future use (passage 0, P0). After thawing frozen P0 aliquots, cells were seeded at 6,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and expanded two passages consisting of 3 days each in expansion medium with 5 ng/mL bFGF. BMSCs were then seeded into hydrogels for chondrogenesis studies.</p>

<sec id="section4-1947603512455196">
<title>Human BMSC Isolation and Expansion</title>
<p>Human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were isolated from intramedullary aspirate generated using a Reamer Irrigator Aspirator device during surgical procedures performed at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947603512455196">22</xref></sup> The three patients whose cells were used in this study (two males, one female, ages 81, 51, and 37) granted informed consent, and surgical procedures were preapproved by the local institutional review board. The bulk aspirate was centrifuged, the red blood cell fraction lysed briefly in a buffer of 155 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 10 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.2), and BMSCs isolated from the remaining nucleated cell fraction by differential adhesion to tissue culture plastic as above. These donor cell populations have been confirmed to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in pellet cultures in response to TGF-β1 and Dex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947603512455196">23</xref></sup> Frozen aliquots of P1 or P2 cells were thawed and seeded at 1,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in expansion medium with 5 ng/mL bFGF. Cultures received supplements of bFGF on day 4, passaged on day 6, given more bFGF on day 9 or 10, and were seeded into hydrogels on day 12. One patient’s cells required further expansion and were passaged on day 12, given more bFGF on day 14, and cast on day 17.</p>

<sec id="section5-1947603512455196">
<title>Hydrogel Encapsulation and Culture</title>
<p>Following BMSC expansion in monolayer, cells were encapsulated in one of two hydrogel materials: (RADA)<sub>4</sub> self-assembling peptide hydrogel (RAD, also known as PuraMatrix, a gift from 3DM, Cambridge, MA) and low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen, catalog number 15517-022). BMSCs were encapsulated in 0.5% (w/v) RAD or 2% (w/v) agarose at 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. These hydrogel concentrations were chosen to match previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947603512455196">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603512455196">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947603512455196">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947603512455196">25</xref></sup> The cell/hydrogel mixture was cast as disks (~6 mm diameter, 1.5 mm thickness) into the center of rings of acellular agarose pre-equilibrated in chondrogenic medium consisting of high glucose DMEM, 1% ITS+1 (Sigma-Aldrich; insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite, bovine serum albumin, and linoleic acid), proline (Sigma-Aldrich), ascorbate-2-phosphate (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), HEPES, PSA, nonessential amino acids (NEAA) (Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> The cell-seeded hydrogel disks were cultured in chondrogenic medium with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&amp;D Systems) with or without 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), labeled TGF + Dex or TGF, respectively. Hydrogels were cultured for up to 21 days with medium changes every 2 to 3 days. Some hydrogels were immediately cast into buffer containing 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to measure day 0 DNA levels.</p>

<sec id="section6-1947603512455196">
<title>Viability Staining</title>
<p>To assess viability of BMSCs for all culture conditions, hydrogels were viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 fluorescence microscope at approximately day 4 with 4 µg/mL fluorescein diacetate (live cells) and either 0.875 µg/mL ethidium bromide or 35 µg/mL propidium iodide (dead cells).</p>

<title>Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Culture</title>
<p>RU-486 (Mifepristone; Sigma-Aldrich), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist with partial agonist activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1947603512455196">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947603512455196">27</xref></sup> was added to the culture medium to determine whether observed responses to Dex were mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. A dose–response study confirmed that 1 µM RU-486 would not interfere with BMSC viability or sGAG synthesis.

<title>Aggrecan Extraction and Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Additional hydrogels were cultured for 21 days, soaked in PBS with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche) for ~2 hours, and frozen at −20 °C until extraction. Hydrogels were rotated in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride with 100 mM sodium acetate plus protease inhibitors for 2 days at 4 °C to extract proteoglycans. After centrifugation at 13,000<italic>g</italic> for 30 minutes, the supernatant was removed and its sGAG content was measured by DMMB. Aggrecan extract was then run through microcentrifuge tubes with a 10,000 MW cut-off (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Retained protein was washed twice with buffer containing 0.05 M Tris, 0.05 M sodium acetate, and 0.01 M EDTA and resuspended in this buffer at a concentration of 1 µg sGAG/μL. The aggrecan was then deglycosylated using protease-free chondroitinase ABC (30 mU/100 µg sGAG), keratanase II (0.5 mU/100 µg sGAG), and endo-β-galactosidase (0.5 mU/100 µg sGAG) (Seikagaku Biobusiness Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). sGAG was loaded into a 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and run at 200 V for 45 minutes. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed with the anti-NITEGE monoclonal antibody AGG-C1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947603512455196">34</xref></sup> (a gift from Dr. Carl Flannery, Pfizer) and the anti-G1 antibody G1-2 (a gift from Dr. John Sandy, Rush University).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947603512455196">35</xref></sup> Some membranes were stripped following anti-NITEGE imaging and reprobed with anti-G1 antibody.

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Results are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean. A linear mixed model of variance with animal/patient as a random factor and medium condition and time point as fixed effects was used to analyze data for experiments testing the effects of Dex on sGAG content, DNA content, proteoglycan synthesis, DNA synthesis, sGAG retention, and hydroxyproline content for bovine and human BMSCs. Data from the agarose and RAD scaffolds were analyzed separately and not compared statistically. Data from experiments with RU-486 were analyzed using the same model with only the medium condition as a fixed effect. Residual plots for all of the above comparisons were investigated and data were transformed as necessary to ensure normality. Apoptotic cell data were analyzed using a general linear model with medium condition as an independent variable. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to ensure normality and data were transformed as necessary. Tukey post hoc tests with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were used to evaluate statistical significance for all pairwise comparisons. Statistical tests were performed using Systat 12 software.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We hypothesized that Dex would improve matrix production and reduce ADAMTS-4/5 activity in agarose and RAD hydrogels seeded with adult human and young bovine BMSCs. We tested this hypothesis by comparing sGAG, DNA, and hydroxyproline accumulation, apoptosis, and ADAMTS-4/5-generated NITEGE fragments for self-assembling peptide and agarose hydrogels cultured in TGF-β1 ± Dex. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that Dex affects ADAMTS-4/5 activity in a tissue engineering system. We found that Dex reduced ADAMTS-4/5 activity across both hydrogel types and cell sources, but the overall effects of Dex on chondrogenesis depended on the donor species/age and the type of hydrogel. We have demonstrated chondrogenic differentiation through cartilage-like matrix production, including aggrecan and type II collagen. Others have investigated the effects of Dex on TGF-β-induced chondrogenesis at the gene expression level for both bovine and human BMSCs and have found evidence of the pro-anabolic effects of Dex that are consistent with our results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603512455196">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603512455196">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1947603512455196">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>For young bovine BMSCs in agarose, Dex caused a twofold increase in sGAG content, consistent with previous literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603512455196">11</xref></sup> This increase was because of the increase in proteoglycan synthesis per cell caused by Dex. Although statistical comparisons were not made between agarose and RAD hydrogel results, as this was the focus of our previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> it is interesting to note one additional finding. Bovine BMSCs proliferated to a greater extent in RAD than agarose, which ultimately resulted in the accumulation of more total sGAG even though sGAG per cell (as measured by sGAG normalized to DNA) was lower in RAD than agarose for the TGF + Dex condition (<bold>Fig. S1A</bold>). sGAG was better retained in bovine BMSC-seeded agarose hydrogels with TGF + Dex compared with TGF alone. A trend of decreasing apoptosis was found in the presence of Dex for young bovine BMSCs in agarose at day 21, whereas RAD hydrogels with bovine BMSCs showed very little apoptosis in either condition. RAD gels seeded with young bovine BMSCs had reduced sGAG and hydroxyproline content in the presence of Dex compared with TGF-β1 alone, but the overall levels of these matrix components were still higher than in agarose hydrogels in the presence of Dex at day 21. An increase in proteoglycan synthesis with Dex was observed on day 21; therefore, it is possible that longer culture duration with TGF + Dex could have resulted in increased sGAG accumulation. The effects of Dex on sGAG accumulation and synthesis in both scaffolds were mediated by the signaling of Dex through the glucocorticoid receptor, which correlates well with the ability of RU-486 to reverse Dex-induced aggrecan gene expression and type II collagen production by human mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603512455196">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hydrogels seeded with adult human BMSCs showed less matrix production overall compared with young bovine-BMSC-seeded gels. In RAD hydrogels with hBMSCs, the addition of Dex increased DNA and hydroxyproline content, but not sGAG content. We were surprised to find very little evidence of chondrogenic differentiation by hBMSCs in agarose. A previous study of hBMSCs in agarose showed evidence of proteoglycan and type II collagen production at the protein level, but only one cell cluster was shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947603512455196">25</xref></sup> hBMSCs have been successfully cultured in other scaffold materials, though pellet culture remains one of the most common culture methods for these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947603512455196">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603512455196">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1947603512455196">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1947603512455196"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1947603512455196"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1947603512455196">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>ADAMTS-4/5 activity, as measured by anti-NITEGE Western blotting, was decreased by Dex in RAD and agarose hydrogels seeded with young bovine BMSCs and for RAD gels seeded with adult human BMSCs. It is exciting that this finding was consistent across scaffold type and cell species/age. A recent study has shown that Dex does not regulate ADAMTS-4/5 activity at the gene expression level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603512455196">15</xref></sup> but suggests the possibility that Dex could be involved in regulating the activation of latent ADAMTS-4/5 enzymes. This is an exciting research area that is the focus of ongoing studies. Use of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 confirmed that the decrease in ADAMTS-4/5-generated NITEGE fragments was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. This is an interesting finding that should be investigated further.</p>
<p>There were several limitations to this study. First, apoptosis was only investigated at early time points to ensure high viability, and at day 21 to compare with other histology samples. Further study of cell death over the entire culture duration comparing across conditions could aid in optimizing tissue engineering systems. Second, proteoglycan and DNA synthesis data were normalized to DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603512455196"><bold>Figs. 1</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603512455196"><bold>3</bold></xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1947603512455196"><bold>5</bold></xref>), which underestimates the synthesis levels in agarose, as the DNA levels include live and dead cells. Third, hydroxyproline content reflects multiple collagen types and the type present in agarose gels seeded with bovine BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603512455196"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref>) was not determined in this study. As the matrix in agarose was largely pericellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603512455196"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>) and the pericellular matrix (PCM) of primary chondrocytes cultured for 21 days in agarose was found to be rich in type VI collagen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1947603512455196">45</xref></sup> we believe this is an abundant constituent of the PCM. Finally, our results encompassing young bovine and adult human BMSCs do not allow us to conclude whether differences in outcomes were associated with donor age or species. Both of these factors are important, and given the conflicting evidence about the importance of donor age for BMSC therapies, further studies are warranted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1947603512455196">46</xref></sup> Recent work by Erickson <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that BMSCs from young bovine tissue produce cell aggregates with higher sGAG and collagen content than BMSCs from skeletally mature adult donors, bringing forth the hypothesis that the difference in cell donor ages could be a contributing factor in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1947603512455196">47</xref></sup> Despite the limited number of human donors used in this study, we did find reproducible trends, which allowed us to find the statistically significant differences between conditions presented here. The differences we found between the cell types used here highlight the importance of considering the effects of species and age differences when translating in vitro studies into a clinical setting.</p>
<p>Several questions for future work remain, including how cell interactions with the scaffold microenvironment affect differentiation, proliferation, matrix production and remodeling, and cell death. This question is especially interesting given the lack of cartilage-like matrix produced by human BMSCs in agarose. Variables that may affect the response of BMSCs to Dex in different scaffolds include scaffold mechanical properties, scaffold interactions with newly synthesized matrix, and cell-mediated scaffold compaction. We previously reported that BMSCs maintain a rounded morphology in agarose throughout the culture duration, whereas BMSCs in RAD spread and elongate to achieve a networked morphology with extensive cell–cell contact early in culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603512455196">3</xref></sup> This is likely an important factor because cell–cell contact is an essential aspect of chondrogenesis in limb bud formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1947603512455196">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dex does affect matrix production by BMSCs in agarose and RAD peptide scaffolds, but the specific results depend on the cell source and the scaffold type. These findings highlight the importance of choosing a scaffold, cell type, and growth factor combination carefully since the interactions between these variables can change the outcome. Dex reduced ADAMTS-4/5 activity in both types of hydrogels and both cell sources, suggesting an exciting new avenue for investigating interactions between Dex and ADAMTS-4/5.</p>
