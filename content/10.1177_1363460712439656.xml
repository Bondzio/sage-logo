<abstract>
<p>This article analyzes the development of school-based sex education programs in Croatia to identify the role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in shaping government policy outcomes. We trace the history and recent activities of faith-based and pro-comprehensive education CSOs to identify the political advantages and cultural challenges in advocating systematic sexuality education. Focusing our analysis on the 2004–2008 negotiation process over sexuality and health education programs in Croatian public schools, we aim to make transparent the state reluctance in handling controversial issues, as well as its covert privileging of faith-based initiatives. This decision-making process, we argue, exposes political links between heterosexual values and national culture. It also highlights how sex education policy became a site for reinforcing and challenging heteronormative values, and reveals complex relationships between sexuality, religiosity, and national culture.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460712439656" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sex education in public schools has become a significant arena for protecting and promoting the sexual rights, health, and well-being of young people in the 21st century. The global rise in HIV infection rates, teenage pregnancy and sexual violence is making school-based sex education a growing concern both to national policy makers involved in improving local conditions and international health organizations. Recent efforts by UNESCO and the World Health Organization to universalize sex education standards across Europe represent a momentous turn toward maximizing comprehensive school-based teaching. These initiatives emphasize the need to improve young people’s access to unbiased and scientifically accurate information in order for them to develop the skills necessary to determine their own sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363460712439656">UNESCO, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363460712439656">WHO, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite heightened global attention to the importance of sex education, the development of national school-based programs has been far from universal. Over the last several decades, sex education has been highly controversial in many countries, including Eastern European nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712439656">Kon, 2005</xref>), EU countries in the Balkans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712439656">Gerouki, 2008</xref>), African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712439656">Bloom, 2004</xref>), Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712439656">Gibson, 2007</xref>), and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712439656">Irvine, 2002</xref>). The available analyses describe the clash between the proponents of abstinence-only and those of comprehensive sex education, arguing that in most of the countries where battles over sex education have been fought, religious values played an important role in shaping one of the contesting positions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712439656">Parker, Wellings, and Lazarus (2009)</xref> recently observed, a combination of national ideology and religious values was particularly influential in framing sexuality education policies in the postcommunist European countries.</p>
<p>This article is a case study of the Republic of Croatia, a European nation in which intersecting political interests have stalemated plans to implement a comprehensive sex education program in public schools. Croatia represents an intriguing case study. In many countries, for example the USA, religion is quite powerful but religious groups must minimize their visibility in sex education debates because of the separation of Church and State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712439656">Irvine, 2002</xref>). However, not only is Croatia a largely Catholic nation, but Catholicism is essentially a part of the ethno-national identity. There is, as we will show, an alignment between government (in)action and religious doctrine that has been glaringly apparent in sex education debates.</p>
<p>On 18 December 2008, the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education, and Sport (MSES) abruptly ended plans to introduce Health Education into the national curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439656">Dukić and Lučin, 2008</xref>). Although the MSES had intended to make Health Education a compulsory subject in all primary and secondary schools, the initiative was abandoned after a government commissioned evaluation study reported no significant difference in health-related knowledge between students taking single subject sex education classes, and those in the standard program. By dropping the Health Education requirement, the MSES was arguing that sex education is already present in schools through a so-called ‘integrative educational model,’ and therefore satisfied a broad EU call for universal access to sexual and reproductive health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712439656">European Union, 2005</xref>). As an MSES official affirmed, ‘health education is no less present in Croatian schools than in the EU’ (Dukić and Lučin, 2008). All government impetus for advancing a comprehensive national sex education plan stalled when the Ministry suddenly staked out this new position.</p>
<p>The Croatian government’s decision to abandon plans for school-based sex education raises important questions about its commitment and capacity to develop policy to meet the sexual health needs of young people. The fact that this outcome came on the heels of a public debate between proponents of abstinence-only approaches and those in favor of a pro-comprehensive model underscores the inherent difficulties facing the Croatian government in proscribing a systematic sex education program. Pressure from religious authorities, it would seem, played an important role in shaping government action and reaction to such public policy debate and outcome.</p>
<p>Previous research on Croatian post-socialist transition has highlighted the importance of the Catholic Church in influencing government policy outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712439656">Škrabalo and Jurić, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712439656">Vrcan, 2001</xref>). These studies have documented agreements between the Church and the educational system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712439656">Zrinščak, 2004</xref>), and have specifically addressed the privileging of religious instruction within sex education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712439656">Bijelić, 2008</xref>). Yet while this research provides critical information about the constraining impact that religious institutions have on Croatian public life, less attention has been given to the dynamics of civil society.</p>
<p>Our article attends to this gap by illustrating how Croatian civil society organizations (CSO) attempt to circumvent non-responsive government practices by generating public agendas of their own. The emergence of CSO agendas, however, is not only symptomatic of government (in)action. These agendas often represent conflicting and incompatible features within civil society itself, and as we will show, sometimes have overlapping interests with government and church officials. This perspective illuminates how the uneven relationship between CSOs and the government facilitates very different strategies by faith-based and pro-comprehensive CSOs, and suggests that CSO initiatives <italic>do</italic> have direct consequences in government decision-making practices, even though these actions are not always transparent.</p>
<p>In centering our analysis on civil society’s role, we will demonstrate how widely disparate understandings of sexuality between faith-based and pro-comprehensive groups produced conflicting discourses over which school-based plan best represented young people’s needs. Claims made by these opposing sides triggered tense discussion among government policy makers, and stirred public debate about the meaning of sexuality education and its relation to traditional Croatian culture. In these disputes, faith-based CSOs privileged an abstinence-only approach to sexuality education, relying on the discourse of Catholic morality to uphold heteronormative values. On the other hand, pro-comprehensive groups combined human rights and evidence-based claims to argue for safe and responsible education practices. By focusing on the interplay of CSO moves, we illuminate how sex education policy at times became a resource for introducing new ideas about sexuality, and at other times fortified a ‘Croatian system’ of heteronormative religious values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712439656">Nagel 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our interpretation of the role that CSO initiatives played in the context of heated debates, cultural controversies, and recent educational policies focuses on three distinct phases. First, we analyze how the civil sector initiated the debate over the importance of school-based sexuality education. Second, we trace the activities that various CSOs employed during the 2004–2008 negotiation process to identify how educational policy became a pivotal site for both challenging and reinforcing traditional and heteronormative values. Finally, we focus on the legal and discursive strategies implemented by faith-based and comprehensive CSOs in the aftermath of stalemated government policy. In doing so, we highlight new possibilities for circulating scientifically accurate information about sexuality to Croatian youth. The case we present is situated within the framework of post-socialist democracy development to further contextualize how increasingly vocal and engaged CSOs serve to bridge the gap between public need and state policy.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1363460712439656"><title>Religion and civil society in contemporary Croatia</title>
<p>Sex education debates unfold in Croatia within the tension between state religion and civil society. Like other countries emerging from real-socialism in Eastern Europe, Croatia experienced a resurgence of religious ideology and expression. The political and social influence of the Catholic Church rapidly increased during the first half of the 1990s, a time of war and post-socialist transition marked by rising insecurity, inequality, and a wide range of other social costs (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712439656">UNDP, 1998</xref>). In an attempt to mobilize Croatian ethnic nationalism, the new government, led by former partisan general Franjo Tuđman, focused on establishing strong ties with the Vatican. One expression of this collaboration was the introduction of religious education in primary schools. At the end of 1996, following bilateral accords with the Holy See, the State granted the Catholic Church a number of legal, cultural, and financial privileges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712439656">Škrabalo and Jurić, 2005</xref>). This agreement laid the foundation for religious instruction to become institutionalized in public secondary schools by 1997.</p>
<p>The process of de-secularization was not, however, only institutional. Public display of religious symbols and church-going were popularized during the war and continued to gain momentum in the aftermath. The reasons were often not so much spiritual or self-appeasing, but political. Conspicuous identification with the Catholic faith frequently signaled strong patriotic pride and signified ‘true’ Croatian ethnic identity. In effect, Catholicism became a powerful ethno-national marker; a symbolic boundary that could be conveniently displayed. One outcome of this popular shift toward Catholicism was the increase of religious identity among younger generations. For example, in 1992, 66% of individuals between 18 and 28 identified themselves as religious, which was 12% more than in 1990, and by 1995, this increased to 77% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712439656">Ilišin, 1999</xref>). Although it seems that church attendance among young adults somewhat decreased during the 1998–2008 period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460712439656">Landripet et al., 2011</xref>), a majority of adults in the country still remain religious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712439656">Črpić and Zrinščak, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A vital aspect of post-socialism in Eastern Europe, however, has been the rise of new forms of political participation – an amalgam of social groups, initiatives, and political space referred to as civil society. As social researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712439656">Gal and Kligman (2000)</xref> point out, ‘civil society’ itself is an ambiguous term that has been put to varied use by different groups in the region at different historical moments. The nuances of debate over this term are beyond the scope of this article. We use the term, however, to refer to a range of voluntary organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and social movements that are independent of the State.</p>
<p>CSOs first emerged in Croatia in the early 1990s, partially through humanitarian war-related activities and partially through human rights and democratization efforts. Yet despite the abundant growth of CSOs, Croatia’s civil sector still faces challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712439656">Bežovan et al., 2005</xref>). As in many other post-socialist nations, public disappointments with transitional governments, coupled with reluctance of civic volunteering, have slowed the development of civil society activism to some degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439656">Mudde, 2007</xref>). While these factors certainly pose obstacles for Croatian CSOs, one of the major successes of civil society has been the cooperation between CSOs and government in implementing policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712439656">Anheier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712439656">Bežovan and Matančević, 2011</xref>). In particular, CSOs have been instrumental in preventing violence against youth, fostering youth volunteering, and advocating non-discrimination policies. Today, there are more than 41,700 registered CSOs in Croatia, a figure that has more than doubled since 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712439656">Vidačak, 2010</xref>). These developments reflect a thriving and evolving CSO culture, and suggest an increased public awareness of their causes. Croatian CSO initiatives include independent media development, conflict resolution/peace studies training, efforts to create accountable and transparent governance, and reform of public education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712439656">Doerfel and Taylor, 2004</xref>). In this article, we will examine the political strategies of two types of CSOs involved in sex education debates: faith-based CSOs, who advocate for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs; and comprehensive CSOs, who advocate programs that teach a broad range of topics including birth control, safer sex, masturbation, and non-normative sexualities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712439656"><title>Reproductive and sexual rights in post-socialist Croatia</title>
<p>In the context of this increase of religiosity and pressures from the Catholic Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460712439656">Mežnarić, 1997</xref>), reproductive and sexual rights have evolved since the 1990s, albeit at a slow and uneven pace. Still, government response to religious influence has created a challenging legal climate for political debates over sexual and reproductive health issues. Abortion – legal under real-socialism – remains legal, although threatened. A new bill on medically assisted reproduction, approved in 2009, contains a number of restrictions – including a ban on cryopreservation of embryos – which were insisted upon by the Church, leading one critic to wonder if the ‘government’s next step is to ban abortions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712439656">Ivić, 2009</xref>). In 2003, same-sex couples were granted the right to claim some of the legal benefits reserved for cohabitating individuals, but as of 2005 the Same-Sex Partnership Act had been used only once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712439656">Jugović et al., 2007</xref>). In practice, the bill remains irrelevant, as no necessary legal procedures were established for its enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712439656">Bagić and Kesić, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712439656">Štulhofer, 2006</xref>). Further, proposed legalization of same-sex marriage was swiftly rejected in the parliament (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712439656">Bagić and Kesić, 2006</xref>). These various legal outcomes imply that religious discourse and Church authority have a heavy hand in shaping government policy (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460712439656">Perica, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of CSOs dedicated to expanding sexual and reproductive rights has been an exciting development since Croatia declared independence in 1991. Political organizations such as Lesbian Group Kontra (Zagreb), Lesbian Organization LORI (Rijeka) and Iskorak – Centre for the Rights of Sexual and Gender Minorities (Zagreb) have advocated LGBT rights, along with Woman’s Room (Zagreb), and Croatian Women’s Network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712439656">Jugović, et.al., 2007</xref>). Queer Zagreb, founded in 2003, sponsors a vibrant, festival of queer international cultural events in the city. A myriad of women’s and feminist CSOs, for example the Croatian Women’s Network, have been active critics of the Catholic Church’s imposition of religious morality on state matters. As we will see with the sex education debates, comprehensive CSOs have played a crucial political role in challenging the government’s acquiescence to religious doctrine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363460712439656"><title>School-based sex education (and its absence) in Croatia: A brief history</title>
<p>Conflict marked the earliest discussion about school-based sex education in Croatia, dating back to 1918. In a number of newspaper and magazine articles, two distinct positions were outlined and contested. These competing perspectives set a precedent for strong debate over interpretations of sex education along scientific vs. moralistic lines. The first confined the subject of human sexuality to health facilities and medical doctors’ offices; the other approached the subject in a more systematic manner, and advocated moral development of human sexuality through literature and art history classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363460712439656">Thaler, 1918</xref>). The debate was brief and had no impact on the educational policy of that time.</p>
<p>It took almost half a century for the next significant event, which came about in 1965 with the publication of a book on modern sex education by Marijan Košiček (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712439656">Košiček, 1965</xref>). A psychiatrist and the first Croatian marital and sex therapist, Košiček was inspired by US sex researchers Alfred C. Kinsey, William Masters, and Virginia Johnson, as well as by Swedish sex education policy. His book was a passionate call for a comprehensive sex education that emphasized a liberal approach to sexuality with strong roots in socialist gender equality and sexual rights of young people. The text resonated well with the pedagogical elite of the time, and Košiček was asked to develop and organize a national school-based sex education program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712439656">Maleš, 2000</xref>). By 1973, Košiček and his collaborators published a teacher’s manual and everything seemed ready for implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439656">Košiček et al., 1973</xref>). However, the initiative failed because of the plan’s inherent practical problems. The main reason was the novel teaching mode pressed for by Košiček himself, which recommended an integrated approach to sexuality education. Theoretically, his emphasis on a multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary curriculum was at odds with the strategy of presenting sex education as a separate school subject. In practice, this unfortunately meant that no teacher was specifically assigned to sex education. Thus without clear responsibility, most teachers – too embarrassed to feel enthusiastic about including sexuality issues in their teaching – silently boycotted the initiative. The resulting impediment was justified by teachers arguing that their teaching plan was already packed.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, a group of medical school practitioners and gynecologists inspired by the international family planning movement initiated reproductive health lectures in schools and health facilities servicing secondary school and college students. Even so, educational professionals remained only marginally concerned with transforming sexual education practices, as shown in an edited volume published at the time. Their contributions mainly restated and repeated the imperative to embed sexuality in ‘humanistic’ gender relations perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363460712439656">Vukasović, 1981</xref>). Neither medical, nor educational professionals argued for a systematic approach to youth sexuality. For many, the issue was too controversial due to fears that such programs would promote western hedonism and lifestyles incompatible with the idealized (collectivist) spirit of socialist youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712439656">Fenemore, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>After 1989, the socialist morality was rapidly replaced by a more traditional, faith-based moral system that reflected the rising political power of the Church. This political leaning, coupled with openly nationalistic governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712439656">Štulhofer and Sandfort, 2005</xref>), created an intolerable climate for the pursuit of comprehensive sex education programs. When talk about sex education did eventually emerge, it marshaled intense debate among the polity. In these new circumstances, as we will see, the clash between proponents of comprehensive sex education and groups that proclaim the primacy of national tradition and family values generated volatile culture wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712439656">Bijelić, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712439656">Kon, 2005</xref>). Today, the topic remains marginal within the Croatian public school system.</p>
<p>In light of these struggles, however, some initial strides in developing a more comprehensive-based approach were achieved. Certain elements of sex education – mostly information on anatomy and reproductive sexuality – are provided as a part of the biology curriculum for elementary and secondary schools. Secondary school students who enroll in programs that include psychology and sociology subjects receive lessons that cover adolescence, family, marriage and ‘non-nuclear family lifestyles.’ With the exception of these mandatory subjects, the majority of students in Croatian schools (90% of primary and nearly 75% of secondary schoolchildren) receive rudimentary sex education primarily through elective Catholic instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712439656">Zrinščak, 2004</xref>). This course includes discussion of sexuality firmly anchored within the context of marriage. When masturbation and the use of contraceptives are mentioned, they are discussed as obstacles to a meaningful and committed relationship. The topic of ‘love, sexuality, marriage and family’ is also emphasized in an elective ethics course offered in secondary schools. Students attending vocational schools do not have biology courses and therefore receive no information on human reproduction.</p>
<p>More recently, Croatian students have had access to two very different extra-curricular sex education programs: MemoAIDS and TeenSTAR. Both programs were CSO initiatives and reflect conflicting understandings of the meaning and purpose of sexuality education. The uneven adoption of these programs in public schools produced rivalry between faith-based and pro-comprehensive CSOs, and shaped public dialogue. Tensions between these two programs also set the foundations for two more recent competing programs, which were also developed by CSOs, Forum for the Freedom of Education (FFE) and Parents’ Voice for Children (GROZD)<italic>.</italic> The contests over these programs highlight ongoing tensions not just between supporters and opponents of comprehensive sexuality education, but also between state-sponsored religion and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>Challenges to the effective implementation of school-based sexuality education, which seem to be present throughout the southeastern European region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712439656">Gerouki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712439656">Parker et al., 2008</xref>), are vividly present in the Croatian case. The absence of prior sex education programs fostered the conditions for culture wars that significantly contributed to the government decision to abandon school-based sex education. This apparent state indifference further impacted upon the current limits for public and political debates over sexual and reproductive health and rights issues on the national level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712439656"><title>Civil society organizations and sexuality education (2002–2004)</title>
<p>School-based sexuality education in Croatia has almost invariably been a process of negotiations between state politics and local CSO interests. Two types of CSOs have been politically active in the conflicts over sexuality education: faith-based CSOs and comprehensive-based CSOs. The privileged relationship between Church and State grants faith-based CSOs an enormous advantage in influencing government action to maintain, if not promote, traditional heterosexual values. But the legacy of strong ties between Catholicism and the State does not prevent comprehensive CSOs from initiating agendas that challenge and complicate understandings of these faith-based principles. In fact, comprehensive-based CSOs have long been at the forefront of identifying new ideas about health education policies. These groups have been instrumental in directing government attention toward enacting systematic educational programs that address topics such as STIs and sexual risk-taking among Croatian young adults.</p>
<p>In May 2002, the first concerted effort to introduce school-based sex education began with the Initiative for the Implementation of School-Based Sex Education. This movement was led by a group of 15 experts, including academics, medical doctors, and activists from pro-comprehensive and feminist CSOs. The group aimed to introduce sex-positive, scientifically accurate and effective sexuality education in Croatian schools, which included a presentation of non-normative sexual relations as healthy and natural behaviors. The Initiative advocated dismantling gender stereotypes, gender (in)equality, and differences between sex and gender. Promoting positive attitudes toward sexuality as an integrated and healthy part of young people’s development was central to the program. All these proposed goals challenged the heteronormativity and traditional morality embedded in Croatian society.</p>
<p>During the next two years, some of the members of the Initiative, together with the representatives of the Education and Teacher Training Agency, an independent public institution, developed and submitted a rough proposal of a comprehensive school-based sex education program to the MSES.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712439656">1</xref></sup> The plan, however, was rejected in 2005 by an MSES commission, which was specifically appointed to oversee what should be done in Croatian schools in regard to sex education. According to the commission, the overall proposal was ‘too liberal and Scandinavian’ for Croatian society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712439656">2</xref></sup> What the commission made clear was that no matter how evidence-based or effective the school-based sex education programs developed in Northern Europe (particularly in the Netherlands) may be, it saw the situation in Croatia as different. The ruling was unanimous in declaring the program too explicit and controversial<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712439656">3</xref></sup> for a national culture that favors a more traditional approach to teaching sensitive topics. Government discussions about sex education were effectively suspended, and the commission recommended that school-based education be placed within a wider context of health education.</p>
<p>The discourses produced and reasoning applied by the commission during the decision-making process illustrate a conflation of national culture and traditional values that renders comprehensive-based plans seemingly incompatible with Croatian society and lifestyle, in effect establishing heterosexuality as the ‘national sexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712439656">Berlant, 1997</xref>). This is a fundamental problem for any interest groups advocating approaches conflicting with faith-based mores and values.</p>
<p>One particular event at a public school helped catapult sexuality education into national controversy. In February 2004, media reported about the screening of <italic>The Silent Scream</italic>, the provocative American pro-life documentary from 1984, during a Catholic instruction class in a secondary school in Zagreb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712439656">Bijelić, 2008</xref>). The film includes explicit footage of fetus curettage at the later stage of pregnancy, and has been criticized for having doctored footage. The MSES commission declared the film unsuitable for educational purposes and removed it from public schools, but media attention had already provoked public reaction. Since the story captured public interest, journalists continued to explore the subject primarily by reviving debates over two extra-curricular CSO programs that were taught in some public schools: MemoAIDS and TeenSTAR.</p>
<p>MemoAIDS is a peer-led HIV prevention program supported by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MSHW) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712439656">4</xref></sup> From 2003 to 2006, the program was implemented in 104 secondary schools (approximately 30% of all schools) across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712439656">Hiršl-Hećej et al., 2006</xref>). TeenSTAR (Sexuality Teaching in the context of Adult Responsibility), an abstinence-based sex education program for primary and secondary schools developed in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712439656">Klaus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460712439656">Pavlović, 2004</xref>), was introduced in 1997. Since its inception, TeenSTAR has been administered in approximately 100 primary and secondary schools in Croatia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363460712439656">TeenSTAR, 2006</xref>). The stark differences and incompatibility between the two approaches raised disputes within the CSO sector, and captured the attention of the broader public. Contestation over program implementation was provoked by religious authorities and prompted a flurry of CSO actions.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Croatian Bishop’s Conference publicly criticized MemoAIDS, denouncing its alleged ‘promotion of promiscuity’ through the advocacy of condoms and demonstration of their use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712439656">Condoms4Life, 2005</xref>). Given this assessment, the Catholic Church declared the program unacceptable because it did not require approval from parents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712439656">5</xref></sup> At the same time, the Bishop’s Conference expressed its unconditional support for ‘the continuation of TeenSTAR implementation in the Croatian school system.’ These claims were echoed in the public statements issued by a variety of faith-based CSOs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712439656">6</xref></sup> The overlapping discourses produced by both faith-based parties reinforced the containment of public sexuality by religious principles and positioned comprehensive initiatives as feminist and homosexual lobbies that undermined Catholic instruction. Through these strategic naming practices, faith-based advocates placed comprehensive-based claims ‘outside’ and ‘against’ homegrown cultural values. Such opposition led to a substantial drop-out of schools implementing MemoAIDS.</p>
<p>Within this same timeframe, pro-comprehensive CSOs began taking action against TeenSTAR, after the legal team of the LGBT organizations Iskorak and Kontra submitted a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsperson for children and the Office of the Ombudsperson for gender equality, as well as pressing charges with the State Attorney's Office. This filing was supported by a number of sex education experts and pro-comprehensive CSOs who strongly criticized the program for providing biased information on the topics of homosexuality, masturbation, contraception and gender. Pro-comprehensive CSOs used this legal filing to publicly call TeenSTAR into question. They revealed, for example, that the curriculum identifies masturbation as a form of severe moral disorder and equates same-sex intimacy with sexual harassment. Both Ombudspersons deemed various aspects of the TeenSTAR program to be inconsistent with Croatian law and in violation of both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712439656">Gender Equality Ombudsperson, 2006</xref>; Ombudsman for Children Republic of Croatia, 2005). They requested that MSES revise the problematic content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363460712439656"><title>Health education pilot programs (2005–2008)</title>
<p>In response to this building pressure from the Ombudspersons, CSOs, and the media, the MSES established a commission in January 2005, to assess the existing school-based sex education programs and to recommend a nationwide program. In May 2005, the commission reported that none of the reviewed programs were adequate, once again submerging sex education within the broader health education program. However, pressure for the government to take action began to mount as public criticism and CSO momentum continued to build.</p>
<p>The widely broadcasted public rhetoric surrounding MemoAIDS and TeenSTAR had located sexuality education as a cultural battleground over moral obligations and ethical values. The faith-based camps argued for the preservation of traditional heterosexual culture values, while comprehensive supporters advocated open discussion about human sexuality and the right to evidence-based information in Croatian schools. With the elimination of both extracurricular programs from public schools, the demand for the government to develop an effective policy that was representative of these competing interests grew. The commission advised the MSES to issue a call for program proposals.</p>
<p>A call for proposals regarding the development of five health education modules (including a human sexuality module) was designed by a new and much smaller commission appointed by the MSES and publicized in February 2006. After a long procedure, two programs were finally selected in November 2006. The successful applicants to be piloted in secondary schools were the Forum for Freedom in Education (FFE), a CSO founded in 1992 with the principal objective of improving the educational standards in Croatian schools, and Parents’ Voice for Children (GROZD),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712439656">7</xref></sup> a CSO formed by leading figures of TeenSTAR program.</p>
<p>As a prerequisite to this trial programming, the commission requested that both CSOs modify certain parts of their curricula. A majority of the commission members argued that the GROZD module ignores and misrepresents a number of scientific facts about masturbation, contraception, and adolescent sexual activity, and includes biased and discriminatory information about homosexuality. Notwithstanding, in December 2006, the MSES agreed to pilot both programs for one semester, and began experimental implementation in 13 primary and secondary schools (14 schools were selected in the control group), of which a majority opted for the program proposed by GROZD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712439656">National Center for External Evaluation of Education, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to advance the faith-based GROZD program made it clear to the pro-comprehensive CSOs that the government did not entirely support the need to provide sex education that would include various perspectives on sexual ethics. Furthermore, it suggested that the government was partially complicit in marginalizing non-normative sexualities and in reinforcing homophobic and gendered stereotypes. Rather than settling for the initiation of both programs, pro-comprehensive CSOs switched gears and mobilized actions to halt the spread of the abstinence-only approach to sexuality education.</p>
<p>In 2007, a group of advocacy organizations, including the US-based Center for Reproductive Rights, filed a human rights legal challenge against Croatia with the European Committee of Social Rights. The complaint argued that the TeenSTAR program, which has been a part of extracurricular teaching in a number of schools, endangered the lives of young people, and therefore put Croatia in breach of its obligations under the European Social Charter. Following these highly critical public opinions, only five primary schools remained in the TeenSTAR program during 2007 – 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712439656">Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In January 2007 the civic coalition Stop High-Risk Sex Education was founded as a response to the MSES announcement that the GROZD program will be piloted in schools. The coalition consisted of 130 pro-comprehensive CSOs and 350 individuals opposed to the GROZD sex education module. Using various advocacy strategies they tried to block the introduction of the GROZD program in order to quash the ‘reactive, irresponsible, inefficient, and non-transparent’ government policy. The coalition made the GROZD program syllabus publicly available via their website, where they also posted a critical analysis of the GROZD sex education module, a comparative analysis of TeenSTAR and GROZD programs, as well as an analysis of the MSES policy implementation. All these actions were framed within a strong affirmation of sexual and reproductive health, as well as international and national standards of children’s and human rights and gender equality. In their attempts to prevent the implementation of the GROZD’s program, the coalition’s efforts were more broadly directed against the expansion of heteronormative values and faith-based morality.</p>
<p>On the national level, the coalition held numerous press conferences, wrote open letters, lobbied parliament members, and sought opinions both from experts and relevant governmental institutions, including Ombudspersons for Children and for Gender Equality. Moreover, in 11 cities in Croatia a Sex Education Week action was organized in March 2007 in cooperation with local CSOs, teachers and secondary school students, and included research activities, round tables and public discussions.</p>
<p>In addition, comprehensive CSOs reached out for transnational support to circumvent national level barriers and boundaries. International support was received from 100 international organizations with expertise in international human rights and public health issues. Lobbying activities at the European level produced a letter campaign to Croatian governmental bodies expressing concern over the content and potential instruction of the GROZD program. They also called for a more serious consideration of the Ombudspersons’ opinions. These efforts to exert international pressure culminated with the submission of a collective complaint to the European Committee of Social Rights against the Republic of Croatia in October 2007. The complaint, filed by the International Center for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (London), with support from the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York and the Center for Education, Counseling and Research (CESI) in Zagreb, was concerned with the failure of the Republic of Croatia to provide mandatory and comprehensive school-based sex education, as well as with the State’s support of scientifically inaccurate, biased, and discriminatory programs.</p>
<p>In its final decision delivered in August 2009, the European Committee of Social Rights – for the first time in the area of international human rights – articulated detailed standards on countries’ obligations to provide accurate and science-based sex education. With respect to the range and substance of sexual and reproductive health topics in the current curriculum, the Committee opined that the number of hours and the information taught in the existing program are limited, but did not deem them as ‘sufficiently deficient,’ arguing that pregnancy and STI rates among Croatian adolescents are generally not worse than in other European countries. However, the Committee did find that Croatia’s limited sex education curriculum discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, citing the use of a biology textbook that contained homophobic statements. In response, the MSES immediately pulled and replaced the textbook in question. These legal actions and subsequent reactions by the State indicates that a human-rights-based approach grounded in international treaties, such as the European Social Charter, may be a fruitful strategy for advancing comprehensive-based education and challenging heteronormativity.</p>
<p>In contrast to comprehensive sex education CSOs, faith-based supporters consistently deployed strategies at a national level to criticize the validity of comprehensive-based claims. Their initiatives mostly focused on the issue of parental rights over children’s education and what they called the ‘Croatian system of values.’ These included GROZD’s action <italic>Appeal to Croatian Citizens</italic> through which they gathered 20,000 support signatures; <italic>Statement by</italic> <italic>the Croatian Bishop’s Conference’s Commission ‘Iustitia et pax’</italic> which strongly disregarded opinions of the Ombudsperson for Children and questioned her competence on health education; and a S<italic>tatement by 255 Academics and Scientists</italic> which reiterated claims that parental value systems and the national cultural context should be respected, and that parents should have the right to choose a sex education program according to their beliefs and worldview.</p>
<p>Targeting parents’ rights in relation to state policy was a gateway for faith-based CSOs to uphold traditional cultural morals. Whereas comprehensive CSO strategies opted for expansion to meet their needs, faith-based tactics relied on a politics of containment to achieve their goals. By championing parents’ rights in the decision-making process, GROZD advocates contained matters of sexuality within a traditional national context. This tactic also served to confine choices regarding sexuality education to the private sphere. The resulting advocacy efforts diminished claims of sexuality as a public concern, and created a formidable barrier against the disruption of traditional hetero-cultural values.</p>
<p>For example, GROZD circulated an email message in 2009 to warn parents about remaining inactive and complacent even after Health Education was abandoned by the MSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712439656">GROZD, 2009</xref>). The note cautioned against allowing globalizing influences to infiltrate Croatia. In particular, they expressed concerns that the powerful lobbying of ‘homosexual and feminist groups’ could lead to a development of the ‘Spanish scenario’ in Croatia (the Spanish Supreme Court recently rejected a parental petition against the new civic education program, accusing it of promoting homosexuality, sexual permissiveness, and anti-marriage and anti-family values, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712439656">Motos, 2010</xref>). GROZD’s call for collective action to combat the influence of western sexual permissiveness employed a discourse which reflected some characteristics of resistance identity, a strategic position associated with social groups that feel marginalized or threatened by dominant discourses, cultural trends, and/or power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712439656">Castells, 1997</xref>). This ‘resistance’ tactic positioned GROZD as the protector and arbitrator of national interests, and reinforced their claims of honoring parents’ rights in the midst of encroaching global influence. For the opponents of comprehensive sex education, such globalizing socio-cultural influences are akin to western individualism and human rights discourse. Thus, any critical re-examination of the traditional marriage and family was framed as a threat to national identity and cultural tradition (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363460712439656">Tomlinson, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1363460712439656"><title>Aftermath (2009–2010)</title>
<p>After the MSES decision to abandon plans to introduce health education in primary and secondary public schools at the end of 2008, comprehensive CSOs had to find an alternative route to educate Croatian youth about sexuality issues. Framing comprehensive sexuality as a human right and a vehicle for medical information concerned with protection and well-being of young people, they shifted their focus from public schools to public health. It was a reasonable maneuver given the socio-historical context of Croatia and the long legacy of public health policies and a healthcare system. This transition to a health discourse also made sense since sex education was never positioned high up on the policy agenda, yet improvement of healthcare standards was always present in public discourse and policy.</p>
<p>Following in this direction, CESI, a leading comprehensive CSO, developed and implemented the <italic>Sex na ex</italic> initiative in 2009 and 2010, which primarily targeted young experts and CSO activists working on the promotion of adolescents’ sexual health and reproductive rights. Since a lack of government will and ineffective policy implementation are substantial obstacles to the achievement of comprehensive CSO goals in Croatia, the initiative also targeted a smaller number of medium-level officials in the MSES, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and the Directorate for Family of the Ministry of the Family, Veterans' Affairs and Intergenerational Solidarity.</p>
<p>In this phase, comprehensive CSO strategies shifted away from sex education as school-based policy, and focused on giving young people voice to express their own views on sexual health and reproductive rights. Thus, the <italic>Sex na ex</italic> project started off as a youth-based group designed to analyze policies and practices related to sexual health and reproductive rights. Working in consultation with experts, policy-makers and public administration, the group produced an advocacy tool kit to enhance the capacity of young activists to carry out grass-root actions. This manual takes a human rights approach to sexuality and sexual education and puts forward key advocacy techniques, issues and recommendations related to policy development in the following three areas: (a) information/prevention/sexuality education; (b) policy framework setting; and (c) initiating counseling/youth friendly services. In addition, it also presented arguments against comprehensive sex education and suggested various counterarguments to be used in advocating sexual health and reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Apart from policy analysis and development in the three identified areas, the project also included advocacy and direct action campaigns, accompanied by TV clips, leaflets, brochures and posters. Emphasis was again placed on young people’s voices, while direct-level advocacy strategies put pressure on relevant governmental bodies, this time the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. As part of a national campaign entitled Good Advice – Wise at All Times, 4000 signed postcards were delivered to the Minister of Health demanding the establishment of youth-friendly counseling centers and clinics in all Croatian counties. This action, together with other CESI’s advocacy activities, prompted the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to establish an expert commission for the development of such centers. To that end, a CESI representative, a representative of the Croatian Youth Network, and an alliance of 59 civil society youth organizations acting as the National Youth Council were appointed as commission members. CESI’s alliance and co-operation with the Croatian Youth Network enabled direct involvement of young people in the very process of developing a public health policy that specifically concerns them.</p>
<p>Regarding faith-based CSOs, the MSES’s conclusion that health education is unnecessary in Croatian schools provoked another type of reaction. GROZD advocates critiqued the MSES interpretation of the evaluation findings, and after several press conferences, launched an action entitled, Parents Choose. The resulting campaign produced 6300 emails targeting the MSES and the Prime Minister with a demand to resurrect the GROZD health education program. The messages stressed parents’ unequivocal right to decide about their children’s education. In addition, GROZD activists organized a round table at the Croatian parliament and a meeting at the MSES, where strong support of their goals was voiced by some invited EU parliamentarians, as well as by representatives of Catholic and Islamic religious communities in Croatia. In September 2010, GROZD announced that they had trained 27 teachers from all school centers in predominantly Catholic parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The teachers are expected to implement the health education program in five primary and nine secondary schools in this country neighboring Croatia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712439656">GROZD, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1363460712439656"><title>Conclusion: Comprehensive CSOs moving forward</title>
<p>Public attention toward sex education has drastically diminished since the government’s 2008 decision to abandon the national school-based program. Currently, no sexual health or sexual rights-related issues are publicly debated. This lack of public discourse, however, is not demonstrative of a decrease in interest or need among young people.</p>
<p>A review of the epidemiological situation related to STIs and sexual risk-taking among Croatian youth groups suggests a need for systematic sex education and dedicated sexual health services. According to recent studies, HPV infections seem to be most prevalent among women in their late teens and early 20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712439656">Marijan et al, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712439656">Milutin-Gašperov et al., 2007</xref>). The finding is hardly surprising, given that condom use in this population is at best inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712439656">Hiršl-Hećej and Štulhofer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363460712439656">Štulhofer et al., 2000</xref>). Although there is evidence that condom use increased among young people during the last 10–15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712439656">Landripet et al., 2010</xref>), only a small majority of these men and women report consistent use despite a standard of multiple, sometimes concurrent, sexual partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363460712439656">Štulhofer, Graham et al, 2007</xref>). The need for comprehensive, school-based sex education, it is argued, should not be restricted to sexual and reproductive health topics. A number of other important issues, such as violence and sexual coercion in adolescent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712439656">Hodžić, 2007</xref>), stigmatization and harassment of non-heterosexual youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712439656">Pikić and Jugović, 2006</xref>), gender equality questions, and the role of pornography in sexual socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363460712439656">Štulhofer, Buško et al., 2010</xref>) provide additional arguments in favor of a more holistic, system-wide approach.</p>
<p>Despite the described problems with implementing systematic sex education in Croatia, there are several comprehensive advocacy strategies that could bring about positive results. In a 2010 large-scale study carried out on a national probability sample of young adults aged 18–25, 83.8% of participants stated that sex education should be implemented in Croatian schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712439656">Modrić et al., 2012</xref>). This widespread interest toward sexuality education among younger generations is one fruitful area for CSOs to start developing. Framing CSO discussion on sexuality and healthcare issues from the perspective of young people may potentially reboot advocacy efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712439656">8</xref></sup> The move toward assessing and addressing young people’s needs through their own voices could work to strategically circumvent stalemated MSES policy and the cultural wars that contributed to its failure. Moreover, emphasis on young voices has the potential to foster greater youth empowerment, and to facilitate new grass roots initiatives. Offering young activists a role in pursuing their own sexual and healthcare needs is an important consideration for Croatian policy makers interested in cultivating a participatory democracy.</p>
<p>Media influence is another effective tool for comprehensive sex education CSOs. Comprehensive-based CSOs could take advantage of the media’s current liberal stance to attract public interest over the intersecting issues of youth and sexuality. As a recent public campaign by CESI demonstrates, the media are interested in covering such topics. CESI’s <italic>Sex na Ex</italic> direct street action, in which pro-comprehensive youth activists distributed flyers, pamphlets and condoms in public spaces, was prominently featured in television and print media. Building on this momentum, a continuation of this direct-action strategy may effectively raise public awareness about safe sexual health practices.</p>
<p>The growing concern over human rights issues, a salient theme in Croatian news media, also works to support civil society initiatives. Current comprehensive CSO advocacy might take advantage of this situation by positioning sex and reproductive rights as part of a broader, global human rights health agenda. Maintaining focus on young people’s voices fortifies connections between youth-orientated activism and the pro-human rights discourse already present in the media. This discursive opportunity, coupled with the international agenda of universalizing sex education standards across Europe, affords CSOs a suitable environment for achieving their goals. Collectively, these approaches represent timely ways to maximize comprehensive CSOs’ ability to engage public interest and bring about sexuality-related youth services in Croatia.</p>
