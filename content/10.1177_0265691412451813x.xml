<p>Historians have produced countless accounts of the First World War’s opening stages. However, we have given significantly less thought to the consequences of demobilization. Adam R. Seipp’s comparative study of demobilization in Manchester and Munich integrates the story of the First World War’s conclusion into the wider history of the conflict. Seipp contends that the ‘end of the First War was not an event, but rather a process’ (3). Britain and Germany began bureaucratic preparations for war’s end as early as 1917, he argues, and numerous wartime institutions and arrangements remained a part of daily life until roughly 1921. Leaders in both victorious Britain and defeated Germany faced what Seipp refers to as a ‘crisis of reciprocity’, and efforts to manage the crisis largely shaped the demobilization process.</p>
<p>After discussing the development of the urban landscape in Munich and Manchester, the book’s first section details the ‘remobilization’ process that occurred in 1917 as combatant powers took greater control of citizens’ lives. Munich and Manchester generally faced the same challenges during this period, with food rationing and labour negotiations most frequently leading to public protests. Nonetheless, Seipp’s comparative analysis reveals fundamental differences in the relationship between officials and citizens in the two cities. Despite labour disputes, Mancunians largely resisted radical action due to the government’s decision to involve local agencies in the mobilization process and promises that citizens would reap the benefits of their sacrifices. Accordingly, the people of Manchester held faith in the principle of reciprocity and remained willing to negotiate with officials even as conditions worsened in 1918. In Munich, conversely, the state failed to cooperate with civic agencies and declared absolute authority in matters related to the war and the politics of everyday life. As in Manchester, Munich’s population expected to be rewarded for its struggles. When the state failed to deliver even basic necessities, Seipp explains, officials who had claimed absolute authority lost legitimacy with the people.</p>
<p>The consequences of the approaches taken in Munich and Manchester during the war are the subject of Seipp’s second section. The war’s end brought new waves of discontent, particularly regarding housing and unemployment. Although there was some sympathy for the Russian Revolution in Manchester, Mancunians remained confident that working within the system, rather than attempting to overthrow it, offered the best prospect for claiming the compensation promised in exchange for wartime sacrifice. In Munich, the government’s loss of legitimacy hastened its destruction, but even the Kaiser’s removal did not soften demands that previous sacrifices be rewarded. To a large extent, prospective successors based claims to power on their capacity to follow through on wartime guarantees. By making the ‘crisis of reciprocity’ a focal point of the unrest that gripped Munich in 1919, Seipp offers a new perspective on a familiar story of political turmoil and violence.</p>
<p>The book’s final section illustrates the remarkable extent to which patterns established in wartime continued to dictate the nature of later demands that citizens be rewarded for their hardships. Public dissatisfaction was widespread in Manchester throughout 1920–21, but even citizens who questioned the state’s willingness to honour its promises remained devoted to a concept of ‘common purpose’ (230). Accordingly, Mancunians demonstrated their ultimate loyalty by attempting to effect change through the reform of established programmes. During the same period, the notion of common citizenship ceased to exist in Munich, where many Germans embraced radical movements in the hope of finally obtaining the rewards they had been promised for their wartime sacrifices.</p>
<p><italic>The Ordeal of Peace</italic> reminds us that despite the termination of combat that followed the armistice, the First World War did not come to an end in November 1918. Seipp is to be commended for encouraging readers to consider the muddled ‘boundaries between war and peace’ (266). This book is thoroughly researched and makes use of a wide variety of archival and published sources. Although Seipp’s conclusions are generally sound, his contention that victory did not make the demobilization process significantly easier for Britain is debatable. Whereas British prisoners of war returned home almost immediately in November 1918, for example, demobilization in Germany was complicated by the delayed homecoming of more than 800,000 prisoners who remained abroad for months, if not years, following the armistice. A discussion of the significant pressures associated with this phenomenon may have further sharpened Seipp’s already impressive comparative examination. Nonetheless, this minor point does not detract from the overall importance of this contribution. Seipp’s perspective on the ways that wartime institutions and cultures influenced the post-war years is a welcome addition to the field of First World War studies and deserves a wide readership.</p>
