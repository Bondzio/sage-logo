<abstract>
<p>A growing number of proxy, historical and instrumental data sets are now available from continental Africa through which past variations in temperature can be assessed. This paper, co-authored by members of the PAGES Africa2k Working Group, synthesises published material to produce a record of temperature variability for Africa as a whole spanning the last 2000 years. The paper focuses on temperature variability during the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA), ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) and late 19th–early 21st centuries. Warmer conditions during the MCA are evident in records from Lake Tanganyika in central Africa, the Ethiopian Highlands in northeastern Africa, and Cango Cave, the Kuiseb River and Wonderkrater in southern Africa. Other records covering the MCA give ambiguous signals. Warming appears to have been greater during the early MCA (c. <sc>ad</sc> 1000) in parts of southern Africa and during the later MCA (from <sc>ad</sc> 1100) in Namibia, Ethiopia and at Lake Tanganyika. LIA cooling is evident in Ethiopian and southern African pollen records and in organic biomarker data from Lake Malawi in southeastern tropical Africa, while at Lake Tanganyika the temperature depression appears to have been less consistent. A warming trend in mean annual temperatures is clearly evident from historical and instrumental data covering the late 19th to early 21st centuries. General warming has occurred over Africa since the 1880s punctuated only by a period of cooling in the mid 20th century. The rate of temperature increase appears to have accelerated towards the end of the 20th century. The few long high-resolution proxy records that extend into the late 20th century indicate that average annual temperatures were 1–2°C higher in the last few decades than during the MCA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the exception of the equatorial zone, arid and semi-arid conditions prevail over much of the African continent. Consequently, continuous or intermittent drought plagues many African countries and the majority of studies on past climatic variability and change have focused on long- and short-term fluctuations in rainfall. At the same time, temperature is assessed at far fewer contemporary meteorological stations than rainfall and the observational record of temperature is much shorter than that for rainfall. Palaeoclimatic records from Africa are similarly biased, with the vast majority reflecting primarily variations in available moisture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683613483618">Chase and Meadows, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683613483618">Gasse, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483618">Gasse et al., 2008</xref>). For these reasons, there have been relatively few investigations of past temperature change over Africa beyond analyses of instrumental records from the last few decades. Those studies that are available generally do not provide information for the continent as a whole.</p>
<p>This paper, co-authored by members of the PAGES Africa2k Working Group, synthesises published data on past temperature change in Africa to produce a record of temperature variability for the continent as a whole, spanning the last 2000 years. We focus, in particular, on evidence for temperature variability during the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA), the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) and the late 19th to early 21st centuries. For general reference, the MCA is defined here as spanning the period c. <sc>ad</sc> 950 to c. <sc>ad</sc> 1250 and the LIA from c. <sc>ad</sc> 1300 to c. <sc>ad</sc> 1850 (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683613483618">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483618">Matthews and Briffa, 2005</xref>). We also aim to highlight some of the shortcomings within both the proxy and instrumental temperature records, and point to possible ways forward. We first consider palaeoenvironmental reconstructions covering all or part of the past two millennia with adequate (century-scale or better) resolution and time control. This is followed by a review of annually resolved historical and instrumental records for the last two centuries.</p>
<p>On multidecadal to centennial timescales, several climate proxy records from East African lakes (most notably Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi) provide relatively high-resolution palaeotemperature information. Additionally, a limited number of pollen records have been interpreted as containing temperature signals, and oxygen isotopic records (δ<sup>18</sup>O) from cave speleothems in southern Africa and ice-cores in East Africa have also been proposed as potential palaeothermometers. Of coarser resolution, borehole records from southern and East Africa yield equivalent temperature information at the centennial scale. Lake-sediment cores and historical indicators provide some information for the last two centuries, but the instrumental record of temperature generally covers only a fraction of the last century.</p>
<p>As this paper shows, the reconstruction of Africa’s temperature history is difficult. First, the interpretation of proxy indicators is complex and factors other than temperature have exerted considerable influence upon some records (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683613483618">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683613483618">Gasse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0959683613483618">Verschuren, 2004</xref>). Second, the majority of palaeotemperature records are from East and southern Africa, with the remainder of the continent poorly represented. Third, the distribution of modern instrumental records is very uneven, making it difficult to adequately assess spatial variations in temporal patterns across the whole continent. With these limitations in mind, we describe African temperature trends over the last 2000 years based on a consideration of the best data currently available.</p>

<title>Proxy records of temperature variability for the last two millennia</title>
<p>Much of what we know about long-term, pre-instrumental, temperature variability in Africa has been derived from geological proxy records such as lake sediments, speleothems and ice-cores (the locations of key palaeoenvironmental records are indicated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683613483618">Figure 1</xref>). However, the majority of temperature proxies extracted from these archives are also influenced by changes in precipitation. Since the expected magnitude of temperature variations over the last 2000 years is close to the sensitivity limits of the proxy indicators employed, obtaining unambiguous reconstructions is challenging. As a result, our understanding of the temperature history of Africa over this time period is limited to a select group of reconstructions. While these lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to fully characterise continental-scale temperature variability, their similarities provide some indications that temperature changes have been coherent on fairly large spatial scales.</p>

<p>Continuous records of temperature variability for the last two millennia in East Africa have been obtained from Lake Tanganyika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2008, 2010a</xref>) and from Mt.

<p>The most continuous, high-resolution and unambiguous temperature reconstructions currently available from Africa have been generated from measurements of molecular fossil palaeotemperature proxies (specifically the TEX<sub>86</sub> index) in the large East African lakes Tanganyika and Malawi. The TEX<sub>86</sub> index is based on differences in the relative degree of cyclisation in glycerol-diakyl-glycerol tetraether (GDGT) molecules produced in the membranes of the aquatic Thaumarchaeota, which show a strong correlation with temperature in modern surface-sediment samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683613483618">Kim et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683613483618">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483618">2005a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683613483618">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683613483618">Schouten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2010a</xref>) and in mesocosm experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683613483618">Schouten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0959683613483618">Wuchter et al., 2004</xref>). Although it was first developed for marine palaeotemperature reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683613483618">Schouten et al., 2002</xref>), the TEX<sub>86</sub> index was subsequently found to be applicable in lake systems, albeit with additional complexities associated with the occurrence of methanogenesis or large contributions of terrigenous organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483618">2005a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683613483618">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683613483618">Sinninghe Damsté et al., 2012</xref>). Because of these complexities, it has been suggested that TEX<sub>86</sub> is most appropriate for use in large, deep stratifying lakes, such as Malawi and Tanganyika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683613483618">Blaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2010b</xref>). Records from these lakes are considered in detail here. A TEX<sub>86</sub> record has also been published recently for the relatively shallow (c. 35 m average depth), well-mixed and hydrologically closed Lake Turkana in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483618">Berke et al., 2012</xref>). Chronological uncertainty on the floating, <sup>14</sup>C-dated piston-core section of the data series prevents us from considering this part of the Turkana TEX<sub>86</sub> record; only data from the freeze-cored and <sup>210</sup>Pb-dated uppermost sediment section are discussed.</p>
<p>The TEX<sub>86</sub> record from Lake Tanganyika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2008, 2010a</xref>) shows a progressive decline of lake-surface temperature of nearly 1.5°C (from c. 24°C to 22.5°C) between <sc>ad</sc> 500 and c. <sc>ad</sc> 950. A brief warming around <sc>ad</sc> 1000 is followed by brief cooling, and then an abrupt temperature increase starts an extended warm period from c. <sc>ad</sc> 1100– 1400, which partly overlaps with, but appears to slightly lag, the MCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>). Temperature falls abruptly by c. 1°C around <sc>ad</sc> 1450, with more variable temperatures during the LIA extending to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Cooler mean LIA conditions relative to the MCA are not clearly evident from the Tanganyika TEX<sub>86</sub> record, but a marked warming since c. <sc>ad</sc> 1880 is apparent, suggesting that modern temperatures are the warmest of at least the last 1500 years. Lake-surface temperatures have risen from c. 23°C to c. 25.8°C in the last two centuries, a change that is distinctly anomalous in comparison with any period over the last 1500 years. The main long-term trends in reconstructed lake-surface temperature broadly parallel Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683613483618">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483618">Moberg et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that temperatures in East Africa were forced by the same factors which control global temperature variation.</p>

<p>The strength of evidence for a ‘lagged’ MCA at Lake Tanganyika is uncertain. The compound uncertainty of the <sup>14</sup>C-based portion of the age model, which involves a variable old-carbon age offset correction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683613483618">Blaauw et al., 2011</xref>), will almost certainly constitute a sizable part of the apparent time lag in MCA-period warming. However, whereas the principal long-term temperature trend of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483618">Moberg et al. (2005)</xref> NH reconstruction broadly conforms to the traditional timing of the MCA (<sc>ad</sc> 950–1250), other NH-wide reconstructions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683613483618">Mann et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that medieval warmth (relative to mean annual temperature from 1961 to 1990) was common throughout the period between c. <sc>ad</sc> 600 and 1450. A real possibility exists, therefore, that the warming inferred to have occurred at Lake Tanganyika between c. <sc>ad</sc> 1100 and 1400 may represent a distinct regional African, or even a more widespread tropical, dynamic. For example, a synthesis of South American proxy temperature data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683613483618">Neukom et al., 2011</xref>) reveals a sustained anomaly of medieval warming similarly dated to between c. <sc>ad</sc> 1150 and 1400.</p>
<p>A second TEX<sub>86</sub>-based record of lake surface temperatures, spanning the last c. 700 years, was generated from Lake Malawi, another large, deep rift lake in East Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2011</xref>). To facilitate comparison with the Lake Tanganyika record, we recalculated the Lake Malawi temperatures using the TEX<sub>86</sub>-lake surface temperature calibration of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al. (2010a)</xref>. This calibration has a much smaller error (0.4°C) and is more conservative at the high temperature end of the calibration than the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483618">Powers et al. (2011)</xref> lake calibration. Using the same calibration for both data sets eliminates any uncertainties in the comparison of absolute temperature estimates, as any errors in the calibration would have an equivalent effect on both records. The recalculated Lake Malawi data series is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The TEX<sub>86</sub> palaeotemperature reconstruction from Lake Malawi indicates that lake-surface temperatures fluctuated between c. 24°C and 25.8°C over the past 700 years. The warmest temperatures occurred at around <sc>ad</sc> 1320, 1575, 1730, 1800 and since c. 1900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>). Although there are broad similarities between temperature fluctuations in Lake Malawi and variations in reconstructed solar irradiance, the direction of temperature changes associated with these variations is inconsistent. Colder conditions are inferred coincident with the Spörer Minimum (<sc>ad</sc> 1450–1550) and warmer conditions coincident with the Maunder (<sc>ad</sc> 1645–1750), Wolf (<sc>ad</sc> 1280–1350) and Dalton (<sc>ad</sc> 1790–1820) minima. The degree to which the Lake Malawi and solar records can be correlated is debatable. It may be either that the time resolution and age uncertainty of the lake record masks a stronger relationship, or that the temperature record is also reflecting other factors, such as wind-induced upwelling and/or precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, the Malawi record does not extend back to the MCA, and thus any relative warming associated with this period is unrecorded.</p>
<p>As with the Lake Tanganyika record, the Lake Malawi record shows a trend towards warmer temperatures since <sc>ad</sc> 1880. Lake-surface temperatures were at c. 24.2°C by <sc>ad</sc> 1800, fell by approximately 1°C in the late 19th century, but have risen progressively since, only punctuated by a brief cooling event in the 1950s. The highest reconstructed temperatures in the entire record are from recently deposited core-top (surface) sediments (i.e. <sc>ad</sc> 1996; 25.5°C). The inferred magnitude of the 20th century temperature rise (1.3°C) is slightly less than that recorded in Lake Tanganyika (2°C). However, the temperature change in the Malawi record is closer to that observed in instrumental records, which indicate a warming of Lake Tanganyika surface water of 1.3°C over the last century. It is not clear whether these differences are real, or if they merely reflect the analytical limitations of the proxy calibration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al. (2010a)</xref> point out that core-top sediments from Lake Tanganyika yield a TEX<sub>86</sub>-inferred temperature (25.7°C) that is indistinguishable from lake-surface water temperatures (25.5–26.3°C) today, and that reconstructed temperature changes since 1960 (1°C) are similar to changes in local air temperature (0.8°C), suggesting that the TEX<sub>86</sub> proxy is capable of reconstructing temperature changes of this magnitude and resolution with reasonable reliability. Similarly, at Lake Malawi, the reconstructed temperature change of 0.7°C over the last 60 years is close to instrumental air temperature change over the same time period (0.6°C), i.e. fully within the uncertainty of the proxy calibration. Regardless, the data suggest significant warming of the large East African lakes over the last century. Warming is also evident in the uppermost portion of the TEX<sub>86</sub> record from Lake Turkana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483618">Berke et al., 2012</xref>). Using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683613483618">Kim et al. (2010)</xref> marine TEX<sub>86</sub> calibration on account of the lake’s brackish modern-day conditions, Burke et al. reconstructed a rise in lake surface temperature from c. 25°C to c. 26.7°C during the 19th and early to mid 20th century. However, a return to cooler conditions is inferred after <sc>ad</sc> 1950, with temperatures similar to those in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Another East African record that has been used to determine past temperature variability is δ<sup>18</sup>O in Mt. Kilimanjaro ice-cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959683613483618">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>), although the interpretation of this proxy has been somewhat controversial (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683613483618">Gasse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683613483618">Kaser et al., 2004</xref>). A recent comparison with δ<sup>18</sup>O variability in diatom silica from nearby Lake Challa shows an inverse relationship throughout the Holocene, suggesting that, at least on the millennial timescale, changes in rainfall are not the dominant control on ice-core δ<sup>18</sup>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483618">Barker et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike the records from lakes Malawi and Tanganyika, the Kilimanjaro δ<sup>18</sup>O record shows no sustained multicentury trends over the past 1500 years, but it is marked by several 50–100 year long isotopic depletions of 2–4‰, including events at c. <sc>ad</sc> 800, 1400 and 1800. A comparison with the Tanganyika TEX<sub>86</sub> record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2010a</xref>), indicates, if anything, a broadly inverse relationship between lake-surface temperature and the ice-core δ<sup>18</sup>O signal, i.e. inferred cooling on Kilimanjaro correlates with a warmer Lake Tanganyika. This apparent contradiction suggests that the influence of temperature on ice-core δ<sup>18</sup>O may be restricted to longer-term trends, and that use of this proxy record for inferring regional temperature variability at shorter timescales must be considered carefully.</p>
<p>There is abundant documentary evidence that the alpine glaciers in East Africa (Ruwenzori, Mt. Kenya, Mt. Kilimanjaro) have been retreating almost without interruption since the early 20th century. Geomorphological proxy evidence that glacier recession started even earlier is consistent with regional warming from the end of the LIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683613483618">Hastenrath, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683613483618">Mölg et al., 2003</xref>). However, the dominant causes of this early retreat and of accelerated glacier melting in recent decades are strongly debated (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683613483618">Hastenrath, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683613483618">Hastenrath and Kruss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683613483618">Mölg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959683613483618">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0959683613483618">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Comparison of historical sedimentation patterns in Rwenzori lakes that are currently situated in glaciated and unglaciated catchments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683613483618">Russell et al., 2009</xref>) indicates that post-LIA glacier retreat was underway by <sc>ad</sc> 1870, notably during a regionally wet phase which can be expected to have enhanced, rather than limited, high-mountain snowfall. This study also confirmed that the Rwenzori glaciers have stood at extended LIA positions for several centuries prior to their late 19th-century recession, notwithstanding a regionally dry climate regime (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683613483618">Russell and Johnson, 2007</xref>). This finding supports the combined evidence for (at least modest) LIA-period cooling in the African great lakes region.</p>
<p>Other direct and indirect palaeotemperature reconstructions broadly support the trends observed in the East African lake records. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683613483618">Bonnefille and Umer (1994)</xref> interpreted pollen-inferred altitudinal shifts of vegetation belts in the Ethiopian Highlands, dated to <sc>ad</sc> 1500–1800, as indicating that mean annual temperature was c. 2°C colder than today. Consistent with the Tanganyika TEX<sub>86</sub> record, warmer temperatures are inferred for the period prior to <sc>ad</sc> 1500, including the latter part of the MCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>). Dramatic warming is evident over the last two centuries, although the low sampling resolution and limited age control of this proxy record limit our ability to constrain its rate and exact timing.</p>
<p>Recent warming is also evident in the different species composition of larval chironomid assemblages extracted from surface and basal short-core sediments in 16 Rwenzori lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683613483618">Eggermont et al., 2010</xref>). Although the episodic nature of these data does not constrain the exact timing of warming, it shows that modern-day Rwenzori lake-water temperatures are on average 0.38 ± 0.11°C higher than they were between c. 85 and c. 645 years ago, depending on the time period covered by each short core.</p>
<p>In southern Africa, δ<sup>18</sup>O speleothem records from the Cold Air (northeastern South Africa) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683613483618">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683613483618">Lee-Thorp et al., 2001</xref>) and Cango caves (south coast of South Africa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959683613483618">Talma and Vogel, 1992</xref>) have been used to either calculate or infer palaeotemperatures. Regional reviews based largely on these data have concluded that relatively warmer conditions prevailed during the MCA, and that the LIA was notably cooler than the present day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959683613483618">Tyson and Lindesay, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0959683613483618">Tyson et al., 2000</xref>). Applying the most up-to-date age models, however, and considering the variability between the records – sometimes from within the same cave – it becomes less clear whether the MCA and LIA can be so simply characterised and/or whether the records can be considered as reliable temperature proxies. At Cold Air Cave, δ<sup>18</sup>O depletions thought to be indicative of cooling occur during both the MCA and LIA. Furthermore, variations within the Cango Cave record show no coherency with the Cold Air Cave record, the trends observed in East Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>), or the NH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483618">Moberg et al., 2005</xref>). These inconsistencies may be a result of the complex factors that influence δ<sup>18</sup>O in speleothems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683613483618">Asrat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683613483618">Baker et al., 2007</xref>). In southernmost Africa, these include not only temperature and amount effects, but also the significant variability in moisture source and moisture-bearing systems that may bring rainfall to the region (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683613483618">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Greater consistency is observed in the lower-resolution pollen records from the Kuiseb River, Namibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483618">Scott, 1996</xref>), and Wonderkrater, near Cold Air Cave, South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683613483618">Scott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683613483618">Scott and Thackeray, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683613483618">Scott et al., 2003</xref>). At the Kuiseb sites especially, the prevalence of frost-prone <italic>Salvadora</italic> during the MCA, and their sharp decline in the LIA, would seem to indicate a pattern of temperature change similar to the East African sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>). This pattern is also expressed, albeit to a lesser extent, at Wonderkrater, and it may be that inconsistencies in the age model (which we have recalculated here using the most up-to-date calibration data), and/or the low sampling resolution, are masking a greater degree of regional coherence. It is also possible that the PCA-based method does not adequately capture what are subtle variations in pollen data. Inferences of significant post-LIA warming in these records are supported (accepting shortcomings in the chronological control of the pollen records) by palaeotemperature reconstructions derived from 85 borehole records from across Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683613483618">Huang et al., 2000</xref>), which indicate relatively cooler temperatures during the LIA in southern Africa, and substantial warming during the 20th century(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>A final palaeoenvironmental proxy, derived from the methylation index and cyclisation ratio of branched tetraethers (MBT and CBT, respectively) based on branched GDGTs, offers potential to reconstruct past temperature. To date, the MBT/CBT proxy has been applied to basin-scale, 20,000-year temperature reconstructions from marine sediments off the Congo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0959683613483618">Weijers et al., 2007</xref>) and Zambezi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683613483618">Schefuß et al., 2011</xref>) river mouths. First-order coherence is observed between the Congo Basin record and global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683613483618">Dansgaard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683613483618">EPICA Members, 2004</xref>) and other African palaeotemperature trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2008</xref>). The Zambezi record, however, is remarkable in that it is reported to indicate continental temperatures during the Younger Dryas cold reversal as being c. 5°C higher than Holocene averages, and a temperature decline (rather than increase) of c. 9°C during the glacial–interglacial transition. Beyond calling the reliability of the Zambezi record into question, this suggests that the MBT/CBT proxy may require further evaluation and development before it can be applied reliably to the finer-scale temperature reconstruction required for studies of the last 2000 years.</p>

<p>Bridging the proxy/instrumental gap in temperature reconstructions/data is an annually resolved chronology of 19th-century cold season variability for Lesotho in southern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483618">Grab and Nash, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483618">Figure 3</xref>). This chronology, constructed using a variety of historical documentary sources, is not calibrated against instrumental data but rather gives an indication of winter severity that can be compared against other records. The overall trend identified in this record indicates more severe and snow-rich cold seasons during the early to mid 19th century (1833–1854) compared with the latter half of the 19th century. However, a series of severe cold seasons are identified during the mid 1880s, including a run of four winters with unusually high numbers of snowfall events immediately following the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. A reduction in the duration of the frost season by over 20 days during the 19th century is also identified. The latter half of the Lesotho record agrees well with the Southern Hemisphere composite land-based time series for cold season temperature since <sc>ad</sc> 1858 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683613483618">Jones et al., 1986</xref>) and may be used to extend this record back to the 1830s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483618">Grab and Nash, 2010</xref>).

<title>Overview of instrumental records</title>
<p>A large number of investigations of temperature changes exist for the instrumental period, so the remainder of this section provides an overview of the most important studies. The regions of the continent for which temperature trends have been examined most intensively are East Africa, including the highland areas, the Sahel, and South Africa. Several studies have evaluated temperature changes in detail for individual countries, such as Cameroon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683613483618">Molua, 2006</xref>), Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683613483618">Domroes and El-Tantawi, 2005</xref>), Libya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683613483618">Kenaway et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683613483618">Mantimim et al., 2011</xref>), Republic of the Congo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683613483618">Samba et al., 2008</xref>), Senegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683613483618">Fall et al., 2006</xref>), Uganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683613483618">Nsubuga et al., 2011</xref>) and Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0959683613483618">Unganai, 1997</xref>). Only a handful of studies have examined larger regions of the continent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613483618">Aguilar et al. (2009)</xref>, for example, described temperature trends across several countries, primarily in Central Africa, including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Gabon, Guinea Conakry, Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683613483618">Funk et al. (2012)</xref> additionally examined the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. The majority of investigations cover 40 years or less; the analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613483618">Aguilar et al. (2009)</xref> of temperature extremes, for example, considers only the period 1971 to 1995.</p>
<p>The longer time series, such as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683613483618">Jones and Moberg (2003)</xref> from 1861 onward, are strongly biased by a few individual countries, such as South Africa, where temperature records begin in the 1840s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683613483618">Hulme, 1996</xref>). Africa is included in the global temperature analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483618">Alexander et al. (2006)</xref>, but that analysis is likewise dominated by a few regions, most notably southern and East Africa. Many of the long-term stations lie relatively near the coast. These may be influenced strongly by sea-surface temperature variability and hence may be unrepresentative of land temperatures over the continent. This is particularly relevant for records from the countries of the western Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Seychelles, Mauritius), where land temperatures are strongly correlated with sea-surface temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0959683613483618">Vincent et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Continent-wide analyses of instrumental data</title>
<p>Of the continent-wide analyses of instrumental data, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683613483618">Jones and Moberg (2003)</xref> is perhaps the most comprehensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483618">Figure 4</xref>). The analysis, which extends back to the 1860s for Africa, is based on a gridded data set and examines various time periods. During the period 1920 to 1945, a warming trend of up to 0.5°C/decade occurred. However, fewer stations were available during these years. A weak cooling trend was also apparent during the period 1945 to 1976. Between 1977 and 2001, temperature records were relatively plentiful and well distributed, although gaps remained in Angola, Zaire, and the east-central Sahara. During this period, a warming trend was observed in all available African grid boxes. The trend was evident on an annual basis and for all seasons except December–January–February (DJF), during which months many grid boxes indicated cooling.</p>

<p>The few studies of instrumental data that extend back to the 19th century generally show that the lowest temperatures occurred in the 1880s, supporting the document-derived cold season chronology for Lesotho described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483618">Grab and Nash, 2010</xref>). According to the Jones and Moberg curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483618">Figure 4</xref>), decadal average temperatures were in the order of 0.6°C below the mean for 1961–1990, then rose to roughly 0.8°C above the mean by 2001. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683613483618">Hulme (1996)</xref> presents temperature time series commencing in 1881 for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region (most of Southern Hemisphere Africa) and the Nile Basin. These similarly show that lowest temperatures occurred in the late 19th century. In the SADC region, temperatures generally continued to rise, with abrupt warming occurring as of the mid 1970s. Some of the warming could be attributed to drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0959683613483618">Unganai, 1997</xref>). The late 20th century rise was not apparent in the Nile Basin series, but the evaluated time series ended in 1986.</p>
<p>The only study to examine very recent temperature variability over a large part of Africa is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683613483618">Collins (2011)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483618">Figure 4</xref>). This assessment is based on the Microwave Sounding Unit that provides estimates of lower-tropospheric temperature during the period 1979 to 2010. The following regions were examined: all of Africa, Northern Hemisphere Africa, Southern Hemisphere Africa, tropical Africa, and subtropical Africa. Significant rising trends were apparent in all of these regions during June–August, but during December–February the warming was concentrated in Northern Hemisphere sectors only. Warming accelerated over the continent during the period 2001 to 2010.</p>

<title>Select regional analyses of instrumental data</title>
<p>The regions of Africa that have been examined in greatest detail for recent decadal-scale temperature trends include South Africa, Zimbabwe, East Africa, Cameroon and Senegal, and the Sahel overall. Temperatures over South Africa have risen considerably between 1960 and 2003, with significant positive trends at 18 of the 24 stations evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483618">Kruger and Shongwe, 2004</xref>). Positive trends were greatest in autumn and at interior stations, and smallest in spring and at coastal stations. The monthly trends show little uniformity, either between stations or between months. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683613483618">Muhlenbruchtegen (1992)</xref> showed little evidence of trends in the preceding half century, again suggesting that the greatest warming occurred in recent decades.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959683613483618">Stern et al. (2011)</xref> examined temperature trends in East Africa, using different versions of the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit data base. They emphasised that the presence of trends depended on which version of the data base was utilised, underscoring the importance of evaluating uniform time periods for comparative studies. Positive temperature trends were generally evident in East Africa in the latter decades of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959683613483618">Stern et al., 2011</xref>), a conclusion extended by recent studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683613483618">Nsubuga et al., 2011</xref>). The analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683613483618">Funk et al.

<p>Other investigations, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683613483618">Pascual et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683613483618">Alonso et al. (2011)</xref>, have also confirmed warming across the East African highlands. Such findings are supported by analyses of surface-water temperatures in Lake Victoria, which have increased by over 1°C between 1927 and 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683613483618">Sitoki et al., 2010</xref>). Water temperatures in Lake Tanganyika have also increased by c. 1°C between 1913 and 2000; this magnitude of warming was evident from the surface to some 200 m in depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0959683613483618">Verburg et al., 2003</xref>). Warming of Lake Malawi by c. 0.7–1.4°C over the past 50 years is indicated by water temperature measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0959683613483618">Vollmer et al., 2005</xref>) and, as already noted, by the TEX<sub>86</sub> analysis of a sediment core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2010</xref>). However, the reasons for lake warming are complex, so that the lake temperature cannot be assumed to be fully representative of air temperatures over the surrounding land.</p>
<p>In West Africa, 12 stations in Senegal recorded a positive and significant warming trend throughout the country (except in the southeast) for the period 1971 to 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683613483618">Fall et al., 2006</xref>). The trend was strongly correlated with sea-surface temperatures, again raising the question of the representativeness of these stations. In addition, a strong positive trend for the months of July, August and September has been identified for select stations in Cameroon over the period 1960–2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683613483618">Molua, 2006</xref>).</p>

During the period 1960 to 2009 there was a consistent increase at nearly every station evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483618">Figure 5</xref>).

<title>Maximum/minimum temperatures and temperature extremes</title>
<p>The most comprehensive study of African daily temperature extremes is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683613483618">New et al. (2006)</xref>, who analysed daily temperatures during the period 1961–2000 in 13 southern and West African countries (Botswana, Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). A large proportion of stations indicate statistically significant trends for the majority of temperature indices evaluated. For example, the occurrence of hot days and nights (95th percentile) increased by over 8 days/decade. The occurrence of extreme cold decreased at the same time. The greatest trend was in the positive tail of the frequency distribution of daily maximum temperatures.</p>
<p>A similar analysis was performed using data from 38 stations across six equatorial African countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, the DRC, Guinea Conakry, Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe), spanning the period 1971 to 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613483618">Aguilar et al., 2009</xref>). Nine temperature indices were used to identify extremes: warmest day and night, coldest day and night, diurnal range, cold day and night frequency, warm day and night frequency. Statistically significant warming of c. 0.1–0.2°C/decade was evident in both the cold and warm extremes.</p>
<p>Regional analyses of diurnal temperature ranges for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe were presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683613483618">Hulme et al. (2001)</xref> and compared against similar analyses for South Africa and the Sudan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683613483618">Jones and Lindesay, 1993</xref>). In all cases except Zimbabwe, the diurnal range decreased from the mid to the late 20th century. For the period 1901 to 1995, temperature trends were positive over most of the continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683613483618">Hulme et al., 2001</xref>). Temperature increases over this period were generally small (&lt; 0.5°C), but much more intense warming was apparent in parts of southern and northwestern Africa (≥2°C). A few areas exhibited cooling trends: coastal sectors of extreme southern Africa and far West Africa; eastern equatorial sectors of the Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Somalia; and over the highlands of Cameroon and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Surface temperature variations up to 1993 for the entire country of Zimbabwe, and for the stations Harare and Bulawayo, were examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0959683613483618">Unganai (1997)</xref>. The record commenced in 1897 for the two city stations, but only began in 1933 for most other stations. The national average recorded a warming trend in maximum temperatures, but minimum temperatures indicated either slight cooling or no trend. Harare and Bulawayo both record a warming trend in maximum and minimum temperatures since records began.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the study of temperature variability over the period 1960 to 2003 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483618">Kruger and Shongwe (2004)</xref>, noted previously, included analyses of minimum and maximum temperatures. The majority of stations (23 out of 26) showed positive trends in annual mean maximum temperature, whilst positive trends in annual mean minimum temperature were apparent at 21 stations. In both cases, although most trends were significant, there was no clear pattern in the trends in diurnal temperature range. However, days and nights with relatively high temperatures generally increased over the analysis period, whilst days and nights with relatively low temperatures decreased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683613483618">Muhlenbruchtegen (1992)</xref> also studied South African temperatures and concluded that minimum temperatures had increased over a 50 year period, while maximum temperatures decreased at the same time. The results are not directly comparable with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483618">Kruger and Shongwe (2004)</xref>, since the latter study covered a later time period.</p>
<p>Variations in maximum and minimum temperatures in East Africa have been analysed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683613483618">Christy et al. (2009)</xref>, using 60 stations in Kenya and 58 stations in Tanzania. Data were gridded and the analysis period and data density differed among the grid points. At the most data-rich five latitude-longitude degree cells, which included areas around Nairobi, the record commenced in 1905. In this cell the trend in maximum temperatures was not significant, but a significant rise in minimum temperatures was measured.</p>

<title>The combined temperature record</title>
<p>The preceding sections illustrate the limitations of both proxy indicators and the instrumental record for analysing temperature variability across Africa during the last 2000 years. Proxy temperature records covering at least a few centuries are limited to East and southern Africa and there are few high-resolution reconstructions. Furthermore, few proxies appear to give a completely unambiguous temperature signal. Instead, most are influenced to some extent by other climatic and non-climatic factors, making calibration problematic. The most notable shortcomings of the instrumental record are the unevenness of the station distribution in both space and time, and the fact that most studies are based on only 25 to 50 years of data. Few stations have records approaching even a century. The lack of a consistent analytical approach between studies further hinders the assessment of trends. However, by considering the proxy, documentary and instrumental temperature records as a whole, some general conclusions about temperature variability across Africa during the last 2000 years can be drawn. We now focus on conditions during three key time periods – the MCA, LIA and the late 19th to early 21st centuries.</p>
<p>The most important records from continental Africa covering the MCA give ambiguous signals. Warmer conditions during the MCA are clearly evident in Lake Tanganyika, the Ethiopian Highlands and in the Cango Cave, Kuiseb River and Wonderkrater records from southern Africa. Evidence from the Mt. Kilimanjaro ice-core δ<sup>18</sup>O record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959683613483618">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>) is less clear. The warming, within the limits of dating, appears to have been greater during the early MCA in some parts of southern Africa (e.g. Cango Cave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959683613483618">Talma and Vogel, 1992</xref>); Wonderkrater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683613483618">Scott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683613483618">Scott and Thackeray, 1987</xref>)) and during the later MCA in Namibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483618">Scott, 1996</xref>), Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683613483618">Bonnefille and Umer, 1994</xref>) and at Lake Tanganyika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2008, 2010a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>LIA cooling is evident in Ethiopian and southern African pollen records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683613483618">Bonnefille and Umer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483618">Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683613483618">Scott et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483618">Figure 2</xref>). According to the Lake Malawi record, coolest conditions occurred during the middle of the LIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483618">Powers et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483618">2011</xref>), but LIA-period temperature depression at Lake Tanganyika appears to have been less persistent through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959683613483618">Tierney et al., 2008, 2010a</xref>). The LIA record from Lake Malawi also indicates several periods of intermittent warming, but without data from the MCA, these fluctuations remain without good context. The Mt. Kilimanjaro ice-core record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959683613483618">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>) shows decadal–centennial isotopic depletions at the start and end of the LIA, but δ<sup>18</sup>O values similar to those from the MCA during the remainder of the LIA.</p>
<p>Instrumental temperature data for the late 19th to early 21st centuries show a clear warming trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483618">Figure 4</xref>). The few available instrumental records that extend back beyond 1900 suggest that this warming started at least as early as the 1880s (the last cold decade of the 19th century across the continent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683613483618">Jones and Moberg, 2003</xref>). This is consistent with documentary reconstructions from southern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483618">Grab and Nash, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483618">Figure 3</xref>). The proxy record of African alpine glacier recession suggests that post-LIA warming was already underway by the 1870s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683613483618">Russell et al., 2009</xref>). The 20th century warming pattern is also evident in TEX<sub>86</sub> records from lakes Tanganyika and Malawi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483618">Figure 4</xref>) and in borehole records from southern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683613483618">Huang et al., 2000</xref>). A brief period of cooling occurred in the mid 20th century, but warming has been nearly continuous from the 1970s to the present day.</p>
<p>The rate of temperature increase appears to have accelerated during the past two decades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483618">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683613483618">6</xref>), and is evident in all seasons. Analyses of extreme temperature and diurnal range do not show uniform results. However, radiosonde data from South Africa suggest that a cooling trend is evident in the upper troposphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683613483618">Bencherif et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with surface warming resulting from the trapping of radiation by greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that the average temperature trends identified in compilations of instrumental and satellite data are not necessarily representative for all regions of Africa. Global warming is expected to alter the patterns of atmospheric circulation, including the meridional (i.e. north–south) airflow. Thus, some areas, particularly in the extra-tropical extremes of Africa, could conceivably experience relatively lower temperatures within a warmer world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our analysis has revealed the limited but growing number of data sets available to assess temperature variability across Africa over the last 2000 years. The most promising proxy for reconstructing longer-term temperature fluctuations appears to be the TEX<sub>86</sub> organic biomarker. Provided that lake-specific confounding factors can be properly controlled, studies in other deep East African lakes may permit powerful comparisons with the Lake Malawi and Tanganyika records. Geographically, much more focus is needed on production of new high-resolution proxy temperature records from North and West Africa, and on the development of better temporally resolved records from new and existing sites in southern Africa, to allow continent-wide patterns of temperature variability to be revealed. Efforts are also required at national and international level to ensure that the network of meteorological stations recording temperature data is maintained and, if possible, expanded. Only in this way will the scale of temperature change already identified across Africa during the late 20th and early 21st centuries be adequately monitored, and data made available for future modelling investigations.</p>
