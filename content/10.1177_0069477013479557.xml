<title>Neurologic Adverse Reactions</title>
<p>An 81-year-old female patient experienced new-onset dysarthria, dysmetria, hallucinations, worsening tremors, and difficulty with word finding 48 hours after a dose increase of ranolazine to 1000 mg twice daily. The patient’s home medications included aspirin (81 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), rosuvastatin (5 mg/day), sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg as needed for chest pain), citalopram (40 mg/day), omeprazole (40 mg twice/day), and allopurinol (300 mg/day). The patient was initially admitted to the hospital for chest pain, wherein she then underwent cardiac catheterization and subsequent medical management with a continuous heparin infusion, a dose increase of aspirin to 325 mg/day, rosuvastatin to 10 mg/day, and addition of ranolazine 500 mg twice/day. Two days later, the ranolazine dose was increased to 1000 mg twice/day and isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg 3 times/day was added for continued chest pain. A day later, the patient started displaying mild confusion and word finding difficulty. Treatment included trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg once daily) for empiric treatment of a recurrent urinary tract infection. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was discontinued after a 3-day course due to a serum creatinine increase (1.6 mg/dL to 1.9 mg/dL) and in light of her worsening neurologic symptoms. Acute stroke was excluded as a possible cause. Ranolazine was suspected as a possible cause and was discontinued after a total of 5 days of therapy. Within 2 days of discontinuation, neurologic signs and symptoms markedly improved. Four weeks after hospital discharge, the patient reported no recurrence of dysarthria, dysmetria, tremors, or hallucinations during follow-up visits.</p>
<p>The authors speculated that the neurologic effects associated with ranolazine in this patient may be related to similar reactions observed with other structurally related antipsychotics and lidocaine. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine are considerably affected by age and hepatic or renal impairment. In this case report, the authors noted that other contributors may have included the contrast dye and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole administration.</p>

<title>Comparison of Active Surveillance Programs in a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital</title>
<p>A retrospective study was conducted to compare the performance between active and spontaneous surveillance pharmacovigilance programs at Severance Hospital, a 2100-bed tertiary care general teaching hospital in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 1593 adverse drug events were identified from October 2009 to July 2010 using spontaneous reporting, active ward rounds and chart reviews, or analysis of the clinical data repository. A total of 1055 (66.2%) of collected adverse drug events were obtained by spontaneous reporting, 309 (19.4%) by ward rounds, and 229 (14.4%) by clinical data repository. Median patient age was 51.3 years, and females (52.5%) predominated males (47.5%). Opioids (30.1% and 11.5%, respectively) and antibiotics (17.4% and 37.2%, respectively) were the most common causative drugs of adverse drug events in both spontaneous reporting and active surveillance programs. Active surveillance programs detected additional serious adverse drug events compared with those of spontaneous reporting programs. The adverse drug events identified by clinical data repository (22.9%) were more likely to be classified as “serious” than those reported by ward rounds (10.3%) or spontaneously (5.2%). Gastrointestinal involvement (35.4%) was the most frequent adverse drug event identified by spontaneous reporting, followed by skin (30.5%) and neurologic reactions (14.8%). Adverse drug events associated with laboratory values including hematologic (14.9% vs 0.6%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), hepatobiliary toxicity (5.2% vs 0.6%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and nephrotoxicity (9.9% vs 0.3%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) were more reliably identified by active surveillance compared to spontaneous reporting.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that active surveillance programs detect more serious adverse drug events and laboratory abnormalities compared with spontaneous reporting and clinical data repository analysis. Spontaneous pharmacovigilance systems are insufficient; thus, active surveillance programs should be implemented in the hospital setting to ensure patient safety.</p>

<title>Adverse Neuropsychiatric Events</title>
<p>Four cases of neuropsychiatric adverse effects associated with varenicline treatment for smoking cessation were described. Patient age ranged from 39 to 58 years, and 3 of the 4 cases assessed were in males. In all cases a comorbid psychiatric condition was present but was stable or in remission for 3 of the 4 patients. One patient developed worsening mood with suicidal ideation within 30 days of initiating varenicline therapy. The second patient developed thoughts of death within 35 days of initiation, which progressed to feelings of isolation after 12 weeks of therapy. The third patient experienced racing thoughts and agitation within 7 days of varenicline initiation. The last patient experienced depressed mood 2 weeks after therapy initiation. He self-discontinued therapy for the same reason and self-rechallenged 5 weeks later. Three weeks after reinitiating therapy he experienced worsening mood. Varenicline was discontinued in all cases, resulting in resolution of neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>
<p>Through assessment via the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, the authors concluded varenicline was either the probable or definite cause of the neuropsychiatric events experienced by these patients.</p>

<sec id="section8-0069477013479557">
<title>Motor Tics in Pediatric Patients</title>
<p>Two cases of fluticasone inhaled associated tics are described in pediatric patients.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 6-year-old male patient developed transient motor tics 2 months after the initiation of inhaled fluticasone propionate (50 µg, 2 puffs, twice daily) for the treatment of asthma. Eight weeks after replacing fluticasone with ciclesonide (100 µg, 1 puff, daily), his motor tics resolved.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 10-year-old male patient with Tourette’s syndrome developed a worsening in motor tics 5 days after starting fluticasone (125 µg, 2 puffs, twice daily). The tics returned to baseline once fluticasone was discontinued. Rechallenge with inhaled fluticasone (50 µg, 2 puffs, twice daily) resulted in the worsening of symptoms. However, once fluticasone was removed, the tics returned to baseline level.</p>
<p>The authors speculated that the patients’ exacerbation of motor tics was due to a link between fluticasone and tics, although the pathogenic mechanism is unknown. A decrease in nocturnal cortisol production has been discovered in patients after the use of fluticasone. Similarly, pediatric patients with Tourette’s syndrome have been found to have lower levels of evening cortisol levels when compared with those without Tourette’s syndrome. In contrast, another study showed that patients who were changed from an inhaled corticosteroid to ciclesonide had complete recovery from adrenal suppression as evidenced by a cosyntropin stimulation test.</p>

<title>Hypersensitivity (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013479557">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 40-year-old female patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction within 5 minutes of the first intravenous tacrolimus infusion after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. No other concurrent medications were noted. After 5 minutes of the infusion, symptoms included pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and diffuse urticaria. The infusion was stopped within 15 minutes and intravenous diphenhydramine (50 mg) was administered with complete resolution of symptoms. It was suspected that the hypersensitivity reaction resulted from the intravenous carrier and not to tacrolimus itself; thus, the patient was challenged with oral tacrolimus, which was tolerated without any complications.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the solubilizer, polyoxyl-60 hydrogenated castor oil, contained in the intravenous formulation of tacrolimus was the culprit in this hypersensitivity case. This carrier is contained in several medications including vitamin K, cyclosporine, paclitaxel, and diazepam and has been associated with many hypersensitivity reactions. The oral formulation of tacrolimus, however, does not contain polyoxyl-60 hydrogenated castor oil.</p>

<title>Levetiracetam, Phenytoin No. 36</title>
<sec id="section12-0069477013479557">
<title>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms</title>
<p>An 18-year-old African American male patient developed a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 35 days after initiating phenytoin extended release (100 mg daily) and levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) for the treatment of seizures. Five days prior to presentation at the hospital, the patient noted pruritis and rash that progressed to the chest, back, and face. On admission, symptoms included fever (104.4°F) with profound periorbital edema. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count within normal limits with 4.0% eosinophils. The free phenytoin level was 0.4 µg/mL (therapeutic range = 1.0-2.0 µg/mL). Liver function tests were elevated, including aspartate aminotransferase (778 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (1274 U/L). Acetaminophen and salicylate levels were below detectable limits and other differential diagnosis were excluded. After discontinuation of levetiracetam and phenytoin, the patient’s condition worsened. Oral dexamethasone (4 mg, 4 times daily) was initiated and symptoms markedly improved over the next few days. The patient was discharged home on an oral prednisone taper and has been without symptoms or hepatic sequelae during follow-up of an unspecified period.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that clinicians should be aware of the potential for this severe hypersensitivity reaction especially when initiating any new antiepileptic medication. Although aromatic antiepileptic medications have been most commonly implicated in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, caution should be taken when initiating nonaromatic antiepileptics as well. Early recognition of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and immediate initiation of aggressive therapy is key in limiting morbidity.</p>

<title><italic>Ralstonia mannitolilytica</italic> Peritonitis (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013479557">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 6-year-old girl with end-stage renal disease developed peritonitis caused by <italic>Ralstonia mannitolilytica</italic>, contaminated during peritoneal dialysis (). Symptoms included nonlocalized abdominal pain with cloudy effluent. Empiric treatment included intraperitoneal vancomycin (30 mg/L) and ceftazidime (125 mg/L). Peripheral blood showed 9410 leukocytes/mm<sup>3</sup> with 74% neutrophils. Abnormal laboratory values included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (84 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (11.5 mg/L). No infection was observed at the exit site and tunnel of the peritoneal dialysis catheter. Within 76 hours of starting empiric therapy with vancomycin and ceftazidime, the peritoneal dialysis fluid was clear and cell count was 0/uL. A sample of peritoneal effluent was cultured and the organism was identified as <italic>Ralstonia mannitolilytica</italic>. In addition, cultures taken from the patient’s hands were positive for <italic>Ralstonia mannitolilytica</italic>. Treatment with intraperitoneal ceftazidime (125 mg/L) was continued for a total of 21 days and the patient recovered without needing catheter replacement.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the probable source of infection and the portal of entry was likely via contamination from the hands. This case report confirms the fact that this opportunistic pathogen can cause rare but serious infections.</p>

<title>Rhabdomyolysis</title>
<p>Twenty case reports of rhabdomyolysis without neuroleptic malignant syndrome in pediatric patients treated with an antipsychotic for a range of psychiatric disorders were described. All patients experienced abdominal pain and muscle cramps as common symptoms preceding a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. This adverse drug reaction was reported most frequently with olanzapine use, although the authors recognized that this could be a result of coincidence. Peak creatinine kinase levels in these patients ranged from 858 to 95 000 U/L. The time of drug start to onset of rhabdomyolysis was determined in 16 of the 20 reports and ranged from 2 days to 1.5 years. The adverse drug event was more commonly associated with higher dose ranges for the patient’s age group. Underlying risk factors were identified in several patients and included strenuous physical activity, seizure/hysterical seizure, intramuscular injection, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcohol use, hyperthermia, and possible infection.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that monitoring of pediatric patients needs to be amplified during dose increases, when an antipsychotic is added or switched in their drug regimen, and when they are exposed to known risk factors for rhabdomyolysis. Although abdominal pain is a frequent occurrence and may be construed as a less serious event in the youth population, it should still prompt physicians to investigate the possibility of emerging rhabdomyolysis in a child undergoing treatment with an antipsychotic.</p>

<title>Psychosis and Serotonin Toxicity (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013479557">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 42-year-old-female patient demonstrated bizarre behavior and agitation after increasing inhalation of bath salts over the preceding weeks from 20 to 30 mg to 200 mg per night. Vivid hallucinations occurred causing an anxious appearance with a labile affect. Physical examination revealed restlessness, tremors, generalized hypertonicity, shivering, and diaphoresis. Significant vital signs included elevations in blood pressure (154/95 mm Hg), heart rate (118 bpm), and body temperature (38.8°C). Laboratory analysis revealed elevated creatine kinase (2114 milliunits/mL) and creatinine (3.3 mg/dL). Treatment included lorazepam (2 mg every 2-4 hours), haloperidol (1 mg every 4 hours), and hydration. Symptoms improved the following day with normalization of vital signs. Repeat laboratory analysis revealed improved creatine kinase (114 milliunits/mL) and creatinine (1.3 mg/dL). On the fourth day after ingestion, psychotic symptoms resolved completely and discharge occurred.</p>
<p>The authors concluded this was the first report of bath salt–induced psychosis with a connection to serotonin toxicity. The proposed mechanism for psychosis was elevated dopamine and for neurovegetative symptoms elevations in serotonin and norepinephrine and induced by mephedrone, the active ingredient in bath salt products.</p>

<title>Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura with Intravenous Abuse</title>
<p>A case–control study of 15-case patients and 28 controls was conducted to identify an association between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura–like illness and injection of reformulated Opana ER. The case patients were identified as having thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura–like illness, which was defined as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in a person with a hospital admission platelet count of ≤50 000/µL in the absence of certain known causes of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Of the case patients, 14 reported injecting reformulated Opana ER within either intravenously or subcutaneously 21 to 120 days before admission to the hospital (median 60 days). Control patients were identified as injection-drug abusers and had to have used within the previous 6 months. Of the controls, 8 reported injecting reformulated Opana ER within the preceding 6 months (odds ratio = 35.0; 95% confidence interval = 3.9-312.1). None of the case patients reported using quinine, a risk factor for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, patients did report using other thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura risk-associated drugs including intravenous abuse of hydromorphone or oxycodone (n = 5), oxycodone (n = 1), and intravenous morphine (n = 18).</p>
<p>The authors conclude that health care providers prescribing or dispensing Opana ER should inform patients of the risks associated with using this drug in ways other than what it is prescribed. The Food and Drug Administration released a statement regarding intravenous abuse of reformulated Opana ER and its relation with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura–like illness. Additionally, the Center for Disease Control released a health advisory to warn against intravenous use of this drug and to help in the identification of cases.</p>

<p>A review was performed on 19 cases of delayed hemolytic anemia after receipt of artesunate therapy for severe malaria in nonendemic countries outside the United States. Seven patients received artemether-lumefantrine and 10 received nonartemisinin antimalarial therapy either prior to or following completion of artesunate therapy. All patients except 1 were adults. Eighteen patients had traveled to sub-Saharan Africa and 1 to India. In only 12 patients documentation of parasitemia was reported and all were hyperparasitemic (greater than 5% of red blood cells infected). For all cases hemolysis and worsening anemia were reported after parasite clearance and completion of artesunate therapy. Mean hemoglobin nadir was 6.2 g/dL. When reported, other laboratory parameters were consistent with hemolysis. Resolution of hemolysis and improvement of hemoglobin occurred in all cases within 4 to 8 weeks after discontinuation of artesunate therapy. While 39 cases of severe malaria treated with artesunate therapy have been reported in the United States, none have reported delayed hemolytic anemia.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to attribute the reports of delayed hemolytic anemia to artesunate therapy. Alternative mechanisms proposed included a direct effect of severe malaria and direct toxicity resulting from production of artesunate not adhering to good manufacturing practice when produced outside the United States.</p>

<title>Pancreatitis</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis of 62 cases of pancreatitis associated with tigecycline use was performed to determine the comparative occurrence of pancreatitis and elucidate characteristics to identify patients at increased risk. All reports of pancreatitis associated with tigecycline in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System were evaluated and compared with reports associated with all agents listed. Disproportionality was determined via calculation of a relative reporting ratio and was considered significant if the fifth percentile (RRR<sub>05</sub>) was at least 2. Sex was reported in 52 cases, of which 34 (65%) were women. Duration of tigecycline exposure prior to development of pancreatitis ranged from 1 to 47 days (mean 13 ± 12 days). A fatal result due to pancreatitis occurred in 4 cases. Three of these were women. Two of the 3 women in which pancreatitis resulted in fatality were 65 years old. Age was not reported in the last case. RRR<sub>05</sub> for tigecycline as compared to all other agents was 10.4. RRR<sub>05</sub> score was 10.38 and 2.87 when tigecycline was compared to all other systemic antibiotics and other commonly used tetracyclines, respectively. A sex-based RRR<sub>05</sub> score was higher in women than men (14.432 vs 3.125, respectively).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this analysis suggested as association between tigecycline use and pancreatitis. They also concluded that significantly more women than men experienced this adverse event and resulted in higher mortality rates. Proposed mechanisms included high biliary concentration, hypertriglyceridemia, and formation of a toxic metabolite; however, the authors acknowledged the need for further studies to establish the mechanism and determine causality.</p>

<title>Asymptomatic Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Lateral Uveitis</title>
<p>Three case reports of rare adverse effects associated with methotrexate were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 40-year-old male patient developed asymptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis after treatment with methotrexate (10 mg weekly) for arthritis. A chest X-ray and computed tomography showed miliary shadows in the left upper lung in the absence of fever and sputum production. He had no history of pulmonary tuberculosis, and chest X-ray was normal before administration of methotrexate. Culture of bronchial washing was positive for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, but the polymerase chain reaction was negative. Methotrexate was discontinued and antituberculosis medications were given, resulting in clearing of the pulmonary shadows.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 28-year-old female patient developed clear cell renal cell carcinoma approximately 7 years after treatment with methotrexate (10 mg weekly) for arthritis mutilans. Computed tomography revealed a mass with a 2 cm diameter in the right kidney. The mass was surgically removed and subsequently identified as a clear cell renal cell carcinoma by histopathology.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 56-year-old male patient developed blindness in his right eye 1 month after commencement of methotrexate (7.5 mg weekly) for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Cyclosporine was coadministered with methotrexate after trials of oral etretinate, cyclosporine, and prednisolone failed to slow the progression of joint destruction and deformity. Fundoscopy revealed a retinal infiltrate with bleeding associated with anterior chamber inflammation and keratitis in the right eye. Viral uveitis was suspected but no virus was detected in the anterior chamber. Methotrexate was discontinued and the patient’s right-sided vision recovered 2 weeks later without any treatment.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that methotrexate treatment predisposes to primary tuberculosis as shown in case 1, although the mechanism is unknown. The relation of methotrexate treatment with renal cell carcinoma in case 2 is unknown. The use of methotrexate may predispose patients to opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster, which are causes of viral uveitis.</p>

<sec id="section30-0069477013479557">
<title>FDA Safety Alert</title>
<p>On January 25, 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration notified health care professionals of significant liver injury associated with the use of tolvaptan. This alert was based on results from a double-blind, 3-year, placebo-controlled trial enrolling approximately 1400 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Three patients treated with the drug developed significant increases in serum alanine aminotransferase with concomitant, clinically significant increases in serum total bilirubin. The maximum daily dose administered in the trial was higher than the maximum daily dose approved for the treatment of hyponatremia (120 mg vs 60 mg). Most of the liver enzyme abnormalities were observed during the first 18 months of therapy, but all 3 patients improved after discontinuation of the drug. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends that health care providers should perform liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, and if hepatic injury is suspected, the drug should be promptly discontinued.</p>
