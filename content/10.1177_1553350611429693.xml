<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Abdominal closure, especially in critically ill patients, is a major challenge for surgeons and may be a major insult for patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611429693">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611429693">3</xref></sup> The treatment paradigm has moved from a single, definitive operation toward an abbreviated, or damage control, laparotomy, with initial stabilization of the patient followed later by a reparative surgery. Although this method improves patient survival, the surgeon is left with the associated challenges of treating an open abdomen (OA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> The main difficulties in managing an OA are “control of intra-abdominal fluid secretion, facilitation of abdominal exploration, and preservation of the fascia for abdominal wall closure.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611429693">2(pC2)</xref></sup> OA complications include fistula formation, infection (eg, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis, etc), bleeding, loss of bowel function, decreased core temperature, loss of domain, and hernia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup> OA mortality rates are greater than 30%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup> with fistula rates between 2% and 25%, intra-abdominal abscess rates as high as 83%, and hernia rates of 25%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611429693">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611429693">7</xref></sup> Therefore, management of patients with delayed primary closure is complex and involves comprehensive medical teamwork and experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgeons may not close the OA immediately for a variety of reasons. During laparotomy, expansion of bowel secondary to edema, or bowel distension, may necessitate delayed closure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup> Secondary peritonitis may occur with infection, causing bowel edema, which makes the OA difficult to close. Management of the OA in the presence of massive intestinal swelling can be problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611429693">8</xref></sup> Posttraumatic or nontraumatic bleeding (eg, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, tumor resection, etc) may also prevent abdominal closure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611429693">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611429693">10</xref></sup> At times, the abdomen remains open to facilitate reexploration after trauma or abdominal sepsis (especially in association with abdominal packing), washout for infection, and reduce risk for development of primary or secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> In patients with ACS as well as abdominal sepsis, delayed abdominal closure may be required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611429693">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In cases where the abdominal fascia cannot be closed primarily, a temporary abdominal closure (TAC) technique may be used. A quality TAC should provide the following: coverage and protection of abdominal contents, prevention of evisceration, assistance in fluid management, reduction in loss of domain and complications, and allowance for reoperation and abdominal exploration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611429693">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611429693">12</xref></sup> More important, the TAC should also reduce the effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure, which can lead to ACS development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Different methods of TAC include skin-only closure methods, mesh products, Bogotá bags, Barker’s vacuum pack closure, and negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Skin-only closure techniques include towel clips or running sutures and can be used for rapid closure in patients in need of reexploration within 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref></sup> These closure methods are generally not recommended because they do not provide for expansion of abdominal contents and relief of intra-abdominal hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> Mesh products have served as fascial replacements and have provided increased circumference for the abdominal wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref></sup> However, the use of the mesh has been associated with high rates of fistula formation and intra-abdominal abscess. Granulation tissue may also traverse through the mesh, so that the mesh adheres to the wound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> The Bogotá bag technique uses a large intravenous bag to cover the abdomen and can be secured to either the skin or fascia. Although the materials are widely available, inexpensive, and minimize fluid loss, use of this bag may result in loss of abdominal domain, and it could easily tear with subsequent evisceration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611429693">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611429693">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both the Barker’s vacuum pack technique and commercial NPWT dressings use negative pressure to manage the OA. The Barker’s vacuum pack technique uses a fenestrated, nonadherent polyethylene sheet that is placed over the viscera and beneath the peritoneum and then covered with moist surgical towels. Two silicone drains are placed over the towels and sealed with a polyester adhesive drape with continuous wall suction applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> Although studies have shown Barker’s vacuum pack closure to be effective in the immediate postoperative phase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611429693">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611429693">17</xref></sup> it is commonly not used beyond the first or second dressing change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> With the introduction of commercially available devices, such as NPWT delivered by V.A.C. Therapy or the V.A.C. Abdominal Dressing System (KCI USA, Inc, San Antonio, TX), several studies have demonstrated successful closure of the OA with NPWT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611429693">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611429693">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611429693"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611429693">21</xref></sup> NPWT applies negative pressure uniformly to the OA through the dressing and promotes healing by removing exudate and infectious material, reducing edema, and approximating the wound edges. Previously, Barker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611429693">16</xref></sup> reported fascial closure of the OA using the vacuum pack technique as late as 9 days postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref></sup> However, Miller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611429693">18</xref></sup> have shown successful primary fascial closure as late as 49 days postoperatively using NPWT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The success of NPWT in treating OAs and the need for innovative improvements have led to the development of negative-pressure therapy (NPT; ABThera Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System, KCI USA Inc, San Antonio, TX), which we used in this study. We present a patient case series documenting our use of NPT for the management of the OA in the acute abdomen in nontraumatic surgery.</p>

<sec id="section2-1553350611429693" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We present a prospective case series of 19 consecutive patients in need of immediate exploration of the abdomen for an abdominal catastrophe. Of the 19 patients, only 2 were originally programmed operations: one was an ileostomy reversal, and the other was a diagnostic laparoscopy for invading colon cancer. The rest of the operations were performed in an urgent setting. Two of the patients were transferred to our facility; the rest of the patients had to have emergency operations because of perforation, incarcerated hernia, or cancer obstruction or invasion. Most of the patients presented with chronic diseases: 8 patients were hypertensive, 5 had diabetes, 3 had cardiopathies, and 3 had renal failure. Also, 14 patients had had prior abdominal operations, with 5 patients having had previous abdominal hernia repairs and 3 patients having had diverting stomas. Among the patients, 4 had a history of colon cancer. These patients were deemed to have nonresectable disease and were considered for alternative therapies.</p>
<p>The study was performed between August 2009 and May 2010 at the Texas Endosurgery Institute in San Antonio, TX. All the operations were performed by the same experienced surgeon in a private, community-based hospital. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Director of Surgery, Hospital Administrator, and the Texas Endosurgery Institute ethical review committee.</p>
<p>During the study period, all patients received the new commercially available TAC known as <italic>negative pressure therapy</italic> (ABThera OA NPT System, KCI USA Inc, San Antonio, TX), which was considered as an alternative treatment for OA. The NPT dressing was placed intraoperatively into the OA with the visceral protective layer trimmed to fit the size of the defect and tucked inside the abdominal wall to completely cover the viscera and protect abdominal contents (ie, separate the viscera so that they did not come into contact with the abdominal wall). Continuous negative pressure was initiated at −125 mm Hg.</p>
<p>There were a variety of reasons for using NPT in these patients. One patient had a laparoscopic repair for inguinal hernia that presented with massive diffuse intra-abdominal bleeding 1 day after surgery. A laparotomy was performed, and NPT was applied. Also, 10 patients presented with intestinal obstruction with signs of necrosis caused either by incarcerated ventral or parastomal hernias or intra-abdominal adhesions. The decision to use NPT in these patients was either because the bowel was perforated or a second look was required to ensure bowel viability. Two patients had ruptured diverticulitis with a Hinchey IV classification, and 1 patient had a perforated appendix with fecal peritonitis and massive bowel distension.</p>
<p>Continuous demographic parameters, such as the patient’s age at the time of enrollment, were summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, minimum, and maximum). Categorical demographic parameters, such as patient gender and incidence of complications, were summarized using counts and proportions. Median time to fascial closure was based on the number of days from surgery until fascial closure or hospital discharge, and median time to death was based on the number of days from surgery until mortality (death). Median times to fascial closure and mortality were determined via Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses, and patients not achieving fascial closure or not experiencing mortality (ie, surviving) were censored at the date of hospital discharge for the purpose of the KM analyses.</p>

<p>Out of the 19 patients, 17 (89.5%) achieved fascial closure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611429693">Table 1</xref>). One patient had an advanced tissue transfer. The rest of the patients had closure with sutures (7 of them were reinforced with mesh because of their underlying disease). Two patients did not achieve closure: 1 patient was transferred to another facility because of the family’s decision based on economic problems, and the other patient, with intestinal necrosis, died before the fascia could be closed. Of the patients, 5 had the NPT system in place for ≤ 3 days before the fascia was closed. Most of the patients received NPT dressing changes every 2 to 3 days until the fascia was considered to be clean (eg, negative cultures or free of drainage) before closure. The patient with the longest treatment duration had an OA for a total of 24 days and received 7 NPT dressing changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1553350611429693">Table 4</xref>).

<title>Case Studies</title>
<sec id="section5-1553350611429693">
<title>Case Study 1</title>
<p>A 67-year-old obese woman presented with a colostomy from a previous transverse colon resection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sleep apnea, and a history of multiple hernias. A laparoscopy performed on admission revealed multiple adhesions, wire mesh from a prior incisional hernia repair, and a right parastomal hernia with small-bowel incarceration. Surgeons performed lysis of adhesions, resection of the right colon, creation of end ileostomy, reduction of the right parastomal hernia, and excision of the previously placed wire mesh. The abdomen was left open for reexploration and to prevent ACS.</p>
<p>NPT dressings were placed intraoperatively into the OA. The visceral protective layer was trimmed to fit the size of the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611429693">Figure 3A</xref>) and tucked inside the abdominal wall to completely cover the viscera. The foam was cut to fit inside the remaining abdominal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611429693">Figure 3B</xref>). Additional foam was used to fill the parastomal hernia wound and create a bridge to the OA wound site. The drape and tubing were placed over the dressing to create a seal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611429693">Figure 3C</xref>). Negative pressure was initiated at −125 mm Hg, and dressing changes and washouts were performed every 2 to 3 days.</p>

</fig>
<p>At the first dressing change, an abdominal washout was performed along with debridement of the necrotic hernia sac. At the second dressing change on hospital day 8, the patient was taken to the operating room for a washout and removal of the dressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611429693">Figure 3D</xref>), and primary fascial closure was achieved. Standard NPWT was initiated over the fascia to stimulate granulation tissue formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611429693">Figure 3E</xref>), with dressing changes every 48 hours until discharge 11 days later.</p>
<p>The patient was discharged on hospital day 19 with weekly follow-up. At 5 weeks postdischarge, the patient was admitted for subacute bacterial endocarditis, acidosis, anemia, and diabetes, but her abdominal wound remained closed. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with renal failure, but her abdomen remained closed at the 3-month follow-up.</p>

<sec id="section6-1553350611429693">
<title>Case Study 2</title>
<p>A 68-year-old man presented with status epilepticus and respiratory and renal failure. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes, seizures, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. A laparoscopy performed on admission revealed an intestinal obstruction. The patient was converted to an OA following a culture and lavage. The surgeons found small-intestine necrosis, which required a bowel resection, and the abdomen was left open for reexploration.</p>
<p>The NPT visceral protective layer was trimmed to fit the size of the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350611429693">Figure 4A</xref>) and tucked inside the abdominal wall to completely cover the viscera.

<p>The OA was closed by primary intention 48 hours later. Standard NPWT was initiated over the fascia to stimulate granulation tissue formation, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 20 to a home care facility. At 3 weeks postdischarge, the patient was readmitted for seizures, but his abdominal wound remained clean, and he remained on standard NPWT. At his 5-week office visit, the wound was healing, with good granulation tissue formation. At his 4-month follow-up visit, the wound was completely healed with no signs of hernia.</p>

<sec id="section7-1553350611429693">
<title>Case Study 3</title>
<p>An 81-year-old man presented with a permanent gastrostomy tube and a painful left inguinal hernia. The patient’s prior medical history included fascial trauma and several hernia repairs with a history of recurrence. Following laparoscopic repair of the left inguinal hernia, a relaparotomy revealed massive intra-abdominal loss of blood (4000 mL). Diffuse intraperitoneal bleeding was uncovered, largely in the omentum, and the patient was intubated and antibiotics administered. The omentum was excised, and no specific area of bleeding was identified in the omentum vasculature. Abdominal lavage was performed, and the abdomen was left open for reexploration and to prevent ACS.</p>
<p>The NPT visceral protective layer was tucked deep around the small pelvis, subdiaphragm, and paracolic gutter, and the foam was cut to fit inside the abdomen. The drape and tubing were placed over the foam dressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611429693">Figure 5A</xref>) to create a seal, and pressure was initiated at −125 mm Hg.</p>

<p>On OA day 3, the NPT dressing was removed, and the wound appeared clean, with no signs of fistula formation. The fascia was closed primarily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611429693">Figure 5B</xref>). Standard NPWT was initiated continuously over the fascia at −125 mm Hg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611429693">Figure 5C</xref>) with dressing changes every 48 hours until hospital discharge 8 days later.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study demonstrate the successful use of the NPT for the management of the OA in critically ill patients. As one of the first commercialized negative pressure products for OA management, this system appears to be a convenient, effective, and rapidly placed TAC method, providing a closed wound environment that protects the OA from external contaminants and assisting in edema reduction. The compressed top foam layer functions as a dynamic closure device and helps prevent fascial retraction in the immediate phase.</p>
<p>The majority of patients (17/19; 89.5%) achieved fascial closure in this study. These results are consistent with the NPWT literature that reports rates up to 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611429693">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611429693">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350611429693">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350611429693">24</xref></sup> In a retrospective review by Cothren et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350611429693">24</xref></sup> trauma patients achieved 100% fascial closure with a modified NPWT technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350611429693">24</xref></sup> whereas other studies report fascial closure rates from 71% to 92%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611429693">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611429693">18</xref></sup> These data also appear to demonstrate better closure results compared with other TAC methods. For example, in a study using the Barker’s vacuum packing technique, a total of 62 OA patients (55.4%) went on to primary closure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611429693">16</xref></sup> with a more recent study showing a 68.1% fascial closure rate within 1 to 19 days of the initial OA procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611429693">17</xref></sup> Tremblay et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350611429693">25</xref></sup> reported on the use of skin/towel clips, silo (ie, Bogotá bag), or mesh as TACs for both trauma and nontrauma patients and reported overall fascial closure rates of 66%, 37%, and 12%, respectively. The rates of fascial closure with absorbable mesh, however, appear to be lower (12%-34%) than that achieved using other techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350611429693">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350611429693"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350611429693"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350611429693">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, the days to fascial closure in our study ranged from 2 to 24 days, with a median time to closure of 6 days. This is similar to a 35-patient OA study by Suliburk et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611429693">19</xref></sup> wherein 86% of the patients achieved fascial closure within a mean of 7 days (range = 3-18 days) with NPWT. Garner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611429693">3</xref></sup> also found that fascial closure was achieved in 92% of their NPWT patients at a mean of 9.9 days (range = 3-21 days). In our study, 5 patients had the NPT dressing in place for ≤ 3 days before the fascia was closed. This allowed for reexploration of the abdomen, which was critical for surgeons to determine whether closure was possible in these critically ill patients. This type of damage control surgery is becoming more common for nontraumatic indications and with successful outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350611429693">29</xref></sup> as our study demonstrates. Our experience highlights the importance of an active abdominal therapy, such as NPT, in avoiding the clinical challenges, patient dissatisfaction, and cost considerations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611429693">5</xref></sup> associated with the traditional, planned ventral hernia approach in critically ill patients.</p>
<p>The KM median time to mortality was 53 days, with 5 patients (26.3%) dying during their hospitalization, which is below the 30% mortality rate of leaving an abdomen open.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup> A study by Tremblay et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350611429693">25</xref></sup> showed a 40% mortality rate for skin-only closure, a 53% mortality rate for silo, and a 33% mortality for mesh closure of the OA for both traumatic and nontraumatic patients. For other TAC methods, such as the Barker’s vacuum packing technique, the overall mortality rate has been found to be approximately 26%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611429693">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611429693">17</xref></sup> It is important to note, though, that our patients were critically ill with several comorbidities and had a high probability of expiring as a result of their presenting condition. Thus, an accurate comparison of mortality rates for the different TAC methods is severely limited by differences in patient condition and comorbidities.</p>
<p>Decreasing hospital and ICU stays has been shown to be critical in reducing costs associated with the OA. Our results showed a mean hospital stay of 32.1 days, which is below the reported stay in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350611429693">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350611429693">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350611429693">31</xref></sup> For instance, in a retrospective review of patients with mesh treatment, the mean hospital stay for 88 trauma OA patients was 45 days (range = 11-142 days).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350611429693">28</xref></sup> However, in a study using the Barker’s vacuum packing technique for treating 258 OA patients, the mean hospital stay was 32.64 days (range = 1-290 days), which is similar to our results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611429693">17</xref></sup> In our study, the mean ICU stay was 26.6 days; however, the range spanned from 3 to 90 days because these patients were so critically ill. Although our results parallel other study findings that have demonstrated similar or lower ICU stays with NPWT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611429693">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350611429693">22</xref></sup> our data may not accurately represent typical ICU stays for OA patients treated with NPT. In any case, reductions in prolonged ICU or hospital stays could potentially translate into lower total costs of associated care for OA management.</p>
<p>None of the complications experienced by our patients were proven to be directly related to the placement of NPT. Other studies have also shown relatively fewer complications (eg, fistulae and infection) in OA patients managed by NPWT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611429693">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611429693">18</xref></sup> One current patient did develop multiple fistulae even after fascial closure occurred. This patient, who spent 90 days in the ICU, had a prior history of a lower anterior resection, anastomotic leak, previous hernia repair with biological mesh, development of a large ventral hernia, and a protective ileostomy. Thus, fistula formation might have occurred regardless of the TAC used. In a 2009 review article by Boele van Hensbroek et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup> the authors performed a literature search on all original articles (51) pertaining to OA treatment that mentioned rates of delayed primary fascial closure, fistulae, and abscesses for different TAC techniques (eg, NPWT, vacuum packing technique, and mesh). The results from the review reported an overall fistulae rate of 2.9% with use of NPWT compared with rates of 2% (artificial burr), 5.5% (mesh/sheet), 5.7% (Barker’s vacuum packing), 13.8% (zipper), and 28% (loose packing) and an overall abscess rate of 2.6% with NPWT compared with 2.1% (mesh/sheet), 3.0% (artificial burr), 4.1% (Barker’s vacuum packing), 5.8% (zipper), and 6% (silo).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611429693">6</xref></sup> Based on our results, NPT does not appear to increase the rates of complications, including fistulae and abscesses but, on the contrary, may help prevent these problems.</p>
<p>The rationale for using NPT in this study varied and included reasons such as a second-look laparotomy, damage control, treatment of edematous bowel, and decompression of inspissated stool. An optimal TAC technique would allow surgeons to achieve primary fascial closure earlier, which could potentially reduce the time that the abdomen remains open, the number of operating room trips for repeated closure attempts, and possible complications and morbidities associated with an OA. NPT allowed for improved fluid removal from the abdomen, which could have helped in early fascial closure. This fluid removal is especially beneficial in reducing an inflammatory response that may occur with an OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611429693">4</xref></sup> This is supported by data from a septic/hemorrhagic shock porcine model, which demonstrated that NPWT removed a significantly greater volume of ascites (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) as compared with passive drainage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350611429693">32</xref></sup> Inflammatory markers were also significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) with NPWT as compared with passive drainage, which suggested that NPWT efficacy was partially the result of a reduction in the inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350611429693">32</xref></sup> Clinical studies would be necessary to determine whether this also occurs in humans.</p>
<p>Study limitations include a small sample size of patients and no control group. Although there is a lack of evidenced-based research data to support a systematic evaluation of the optimal TAC approach, conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial is not feasible and may be unreasonable. To date, there has only been 1 prospective, randomized trial comparing mesh and NPWT for OA management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350611429693">27</xref></sup> The primary result showed no difference in primary fascial closure rates between the 2 TAC methods. However, the NPWT group comprised a mix of patients treated with either the Barker’s vacuum packing technique or a commercially available NPWT TAC device, each having different performance characteristics. The authors recognized the limitations of their study, including a static randomization scheme and small study population, and stated that “overall, the optimal method of closure remains patient dependent.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350611429693">27</xref></sup> As an initial user of this new commercially available TAC device, we report that NPT is a viable option for managing the OA, even in the most critically ill population.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, this approach was well tolerated by our continually ill patients and allowed quick and easy access for abdominal reexploration, which occurred in the majority of our patients. ABThera OA NPT may not be suitable for all nontrauma general surgical patients, especially those who cannot tolerate more than 1 surgical/anesthesia procedure. However, the fact that most of the study patients were overweight or obese and usually presented with several other comorbidities speaks to the potential effectiveness of this therapy in patients who might otherwise expire because of the severity of their condition. Our experience has prompted us to incorporate this new system into our general surgery practice as part of our total management of the OA.</p>
