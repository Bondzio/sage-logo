<abstract>
<p>Phototherapy is the most common method used to treat and prevent neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Breastfeeding compared with formula feeding is associated with an increased risk of jaundice and kernicterus. The main mechanism is failure of successful initiation of breastfeeding. Breast failure jaundice usually leads to significant weight loss resulting in hyperbilirubinemia. The aim was to determine the relation between type of infant feeding and the efficacy of phototherapy for treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term newborns. The authors included 90 full-term neonates diagnosed with nonhemolytic, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. According to their total bilirubin level, they received conventional phototherapy for treatment. They were divided into 3 groups according to type of feeding: group 1, mixed feeding (MF; breast and formula); group 2, formula feeding (FF; formula); and group 3, breastfeeding (BF). Rebound bilirubin was checked 24 hours after stopping phototherapy. The mean duration of phototherapy was more in the BF group, followed by the MF and FF groups (P &lt; .01). There was a significant positive correlation between bilirubin level and weight loss at the start of phototherapy in the groups studied (r = 0.635; P &lt; .001). Rebound bilirubin level was higher in BF followed by FF and MF newborns, with significant differences (P = .005). These results indicate that phototherapy effectively reduces bilirubin levels in BF newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. These infants show a significantly slower response to this treatment than FF or MF newborns. Prevention of breast milk failure would decrease weight loss, which is associated with high bilirubin at the start of phototherapy.</p>

<sec id="section1-1941406412455689">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Breastfeeding and human milk are the optimal feeding for infants because of proven benefits for both infants and mothers. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412455689">1</xref></sup> In the breastfed (BF) infant, prolongation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in healthy newborns is a normal and regularly occurring extension of physiological jaundice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412455689">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a strong association between breastfeeding and jaundice in healthy newborn infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412455689">3</xref></sup> Two physiological mechanisms have been suggested for the early onset of jaundice associated with breastfeeding, although the differentiation is not clear, and overlap may exist between them. Breastfeeding-failure jaundice appears to be associated with poor feeding practices, and breast milk jaundice is apparently related to a change in the composition or physical structure of milk. Both types result in an exaggerated enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin—one through starvation and the other through altered milk chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412455689">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Phototherapy is the most widely used form of therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Subsequent follow-up studies revealed no adverse outcome in infants who received phototherapy in the neonatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412455689">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, few studies addressed factors influencing the efficacy of phototherapy. This study highlighted the impact of infant feeding on neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and its response to phototherapy. Rebound bilirubin was studied as well in relation to type of infant feeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1941406412455689" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee at our Children’s Hospital. After getting informed consent from mothers, newborns were enrolled in the study.</p>
<p>This study included 90 full-term neonates receiving phototherapy for nonhemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia from January to May 2010.</p>
<sec id="section3-1941406412455689">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Full-term newborns with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that indicated phototherapy based on criteria recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Hyperbilirubinemia: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412455689">6</xref></sup> All infants were apparently healthy with good suckling and no signs of sepsis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1941406412455689">
<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>The following were the exclusion criteria: (1) any newborn who had evidence of hemolytic jaundice that was confirmed by blood group incompatibility (Rh or ABO); (2) hematocrit value below 40%; (3) abnormal hemogram or abnormal reticulocyte count; (4) newborns who required exchange transfusion for the management of hyperbilirubinemia; (5) any newborn who had or developed complications during the course of the study—for example, asphyxia, respiratory distress, and sepsis; (6) premature newborns; (7) newborns with direct hyperbilirubinemia, excessive bruising, or infection; and (8) newborns with congenital malformation.</p>
<p>The infants studied were divided into 3 groups according to mode of feeding: group 1, mixed fed (MF) infants receiving formula and breast milk (n = 30); group 2, formula-fed (FF) infants (n = 30); and group 3, BF infants (n = 30).</p>
<p>In the MF group 4 formula feeds were given besides breastfeeding. The infants received at least 8 feeds per day in BF and FF. These types of feedings were started at birth and continued throughout the study. The type of feeding was the mother’s preference. Phototherapy was started at the following total serum bilirubin (TB) values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412455689">6</xref></sup>: 24 hours of age, &gt;12 mg/dL; 48 hours of age, &gt;15 mg/dL; 72 hours of age, &gt;18 mg/dL. Conventional phototherapy was delivered using overhead fluorescent lamps (Philips TL18W/54, Philips Lighting Co, Netherlands) that provided an average irradiance on the infant skin of 403 µW/cm<sup>2</sup> in the 400 to 480 nm range, 205 µW/cm<sup>2</sup> in the 425 to 475 nm range, and 107 µW/cm<sup>2</sup> in the 440 to 480 nm range. The unit was placed 35 cm above the naked infant (the eyes and genitalia were shielded). Transcutaneous bilirubin was checked first using a BiliChek noninvasive bilirubin analyzer, then confirmed by serum TB; direct and indirect bilirubin was checked using BioMed-Bilirubin manufactured by Egy-Chem for lab technology (Fax: +202 26240986) imported from Germany (MDSS GmbH, Hannover.) TB was checked every 12 hours or as indicated by the infant’s condition. Phototherapy was terminated when TB reached 10 mg/dL. The weight of infants was recorded at the start of phototherapy and at the end. The efficacy of phototherapy was assessed according to the following criteria: duration of phototherapy in hours, rate of decrease in TB in (mg/dL/d). Bilirubin rebound was measured 24 to 36 hours after phototherapy ended, which was checked by using serum bilirubin analysis. Significant bilirubin rebound was defined as postphototherapy bilirubin level needing reinstitution of phototherapy. If rebound bilirubin concentration exceeded the prephototherapy concentration, phototherapy was started again according to the same guidelines.</p>

<sec id="section5-1941406412455689">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 17 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). For descriptive statistics, we used means, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values (range) for numerical data and frequency and percentage for nonnumerical data. Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was used to analyze intergroup difference. ANOVA was used to determine whether significant differences occurred among the 3 groups. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to examine the relationship between 2 qualitative variables. Correlation analysis was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Informed consent was taken from mothers.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the infants studied, 70% had noneducated mothers who did not complete high school education. The number of educated mothers was greater among BF (46.7%) compared with MF (30%) and FF (16.7%) infants. This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Vaginal labor accounts for 80% of deliveries, and positive family history of jaundice was found in 18% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412455689">Table 1</xref>). The mean duration of phototherapy was more in the BF group, followed by the MF and FF groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412455689">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Infants in the BF group had higher initial bilirubin levels than those in the other 2 groups. Infants in the BF group had initial bilirubin peak levels of 16 to 17 mg/dL, compared with peaks of lower values of 16 and 15 to 16 mg/dL in the MF and FF groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412455689">Figure 1</xref>). Mean weight loss was greater in the BF group, followed by the MF and finally the FF group.

<sec id="section7-1941406412455689" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Jaundice is a very common problem during the early neonatal period in term and preterm newborns, occurring in up to 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412455689">7</xref></sup> It is estimated that about 60% of newborns have jaundice in the first few days of life, and 6% of these newborns may develop unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which can potentially cause unconjugated bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412455689">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>BF infants have higher bilirubin levels than FF infants, often presenting with bilirubin levels &gt;12 mg/dL, with danger of brain damage in severe cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412455689">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, 69% of mothers were not educated. This difference was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). It was found that 50% of educated mothers breastfed their infants versus 25% of uneducated mothers. In this study, we found that the rate of decrease in bilirubin level was higher in FF newborns, with a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .008), followed by the MF group and finally the BF group.</p>
<p>The cause of this delayed response to phototherapy in the breastfeeding group was unclear, but it seemed that factors in breast milk, such as pregnanediol and free fatty acids, inhibit the enzyme hepatic uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase, and because of the increased reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin from the intestine by large amounts of B-glucuronidase enzyme, which is also present in breast milk, this enzyme cleaves the ester linkage of bilirubin glucuronide, making unconjugated bilirubin available for intestinal reuptake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412455689">10</xref></sup> Tan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412455689">11</xref></sup> found that BF full-term healthy newborns with nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia showed slower response to phototherapy and required a longer duration of treatment than newborns fed strictly formula or a mix of formula and breast milk. In a study done by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412455689">12</xref></sup> on neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that examined how to prevent the serum unconjugated bilirubin level from exceeding 20 mg/dL the authors concluded that phototherapy combined with cessation of breastfeeding and substitution with formula was found to be the most efficient treatment protocol. This result is in agreement with that in our study, where the FF group showed the best response to phototherapy. In a study, Gulcan and Kilicdag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412455689">13</xref></sup> compared the response of phototherapy in MF and BF newborns. They found that the duration of phototherapy was significantly longer in the BF group. They suggested that phototherapy was less effective in exclusively BF newborns.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that TSB &gt;12 mg/dL and weight loss were associated with the BF group rather than with the FF or MF groups. The percentage of weight loss was higher in the BF group, accounting for 4.9% versus 1.9% in the FF group, with highly significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .012) between the BF and MF groups, respectively. Our study also showed a strong, positive, highly significant correlation between weight loss at the start of phototherapy and the level of bilirubin.</p>
<p>In fact, Osborn et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412455689">14</xref></sup> as well as Maisels et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412455689">15</xref></sup> found that jaundiced infants did lose more weight than control infants. In a study done by Huang et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412455689">16</xref></sup> they stated that weight loss was independently and strongly associated with exclusive breastfeeding and inversely related to gestational age. The relationship between fasting and hyperbilirubinemia is well known and has been reported both in animal models and in humans. Also, Hintz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412455689">17</xref></sup> confirmed the same associations between weight loss and hyperbilirubinemia that had been documented, and there was an inverse relationship between oral caloric intake and serum bilirubin concentration, particularly in newborns who weigh less than 2000 g. Frishberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412455689">18</xref></sup> demonstrated positive correlation of hyperbilirubinemia with weight loss irrespective of mode of feeding. Other studies had concluded that there is no statistically significant relationship between weight loss and hyperbilirubinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412455689">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study done by Gulcan and Kilicdag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412455689">13</xref></sup> also revealed greater weight loss (relative to birth weight) in the BF newborns than in other groups. The authors suggested that weight loss in BF newborns might contribute to the reduced response to phototherapy observed in hyperbilirubinemic newborns. In that study, they found that phototherapy was highly effective at controlling hyperbilirubinemia in both groups. However, the response to phototherapy was significantly slower in BF newborns than in the MF group.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that the level of bilirubin rebound was higher in the BF group than in the FF or MF groups, with significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .005). Most infants in the BF group had bilirubin levels between 9 and 10 mg/dL, which did not require phototherapy; in comparison, most infants in the FF and MF groups had bilirubin levels of 8 mg/dL. The natural history of bilirubin levels after stopping phototherapy is still unclear. Management of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates is based on the principle of avoiding potentially “neurotoxic” levels of bilirubin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412455689">20</xref></sup> In Bansal et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412455689">21</xref></sup> it was recommended that serum bilirubin levels must be obtained 18 to 24 hours after stopping phototherapy in high-risk neonates (born at less than 35 weeks’ gestation, birth weight &lt;2000 g, or onset of phototherapy within 60 hours of age). Discharge may be delayed for this purpose if follow-up is not ensured. Kaplan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412455689">22</xref></sup> studied the etiological risk factors for significant rebound hyperbilirubinemia. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, they found that these factors are positive direct Coombs test, prematurity, G-6-PD deficiency, ABO blood group incompatibility, and breast feeding.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, our results indicate that phototherapy effectively reduces bilirubin levels in BF newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. These infants, however, showed a significantly slower response to this treatment than FF or MF infants. Supplementation of breastfeeding with formula was shown to enhance the response to phototherapy and shorten the exposure time. Increasing the frequency of breastfeeding to ensure adequate fluid intake would be an appropriate recommendation in BF newborns with excessive weight loss. Rebound bilirubin level is higher in BF newborns followed by FF newborns and MF newborns, with significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .005).■</p>
