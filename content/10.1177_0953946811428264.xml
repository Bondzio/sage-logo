<abstract>
<p>This paper discusses the Victorian idea that sport builds character, which was one of the inspirations for the modern Olympic movement and remains central to policy debates on sport. The argument is that sport, even in the highly moralised context of ‘muscular Christianity’, failed in this character-forming role, and should not be seen as a source of moral regeneration. The paper argues that the tendency to over-moralise sport, like the commercialisation of sport, has the effect of diminishing the ‘play element’. Recovering sport as play, it is argued, is essential to unlocking its potential to lift the spirit—if not to build character, as the muscular Christians believed.</p>

<p>In June 2011 the normally celestial city of Vancouver showed a distinctly infernal side, as cars burned, shops were looted, and police used tear-gas to control angry crowds in scenes that were likened to a war-zone. The cause: an ice-hockey match, in which the home team lost to the unfancied Boston Bruins in the final of the Stanley Cup. This was North America’s most prestigious hockey tournament—the conclusion to a tantalising, seven-game play-off, complete with refereeing blunders and cruel injuries—but it was still a game of hockey.</p>
<p>Watching these scenes with a no-doubt parochial sense of which sports are worth getting upset about, I was persuaded as rarely before of sport’s ability to get under people’s skin and to create a mental world entirely at odds with its mission statement. The riots in Vancouver were greeted with a kind of doublethink familiar to followers of English football, as commentators sought to distinguish the fury of the crowds from the values held to be intrinsic to the game. As Pat Martin, a Canadian MP, insisted: ‘We have to remember those weren’t hockey fans trashing the most beautiful city in the world last night; they were thugs and thieves and lunatics. Hockey is founded on a code of honour that prescribes dignified behaviour in victory and defeat … It’s part of the beauty of the game … we have nothing to fear from real hockey fans.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946811428264">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Stanley Cup riots illustrate an enduring tension in the world of sport: a desire to believe in its moral benefits even as its highest expressions confuse the idea. Modern sports are very much the product of the nineteenth-century movement known as ‘muscular Christianity’. When Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, unveiled a monument at the ruins of Olympia in 1927, he acknowledged his debt ‘to Kingsley and Arnold … the founders of athletic chivalry’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946811428264">2</xref></sup> No matter how far modern sports stray from the original Victorian ethos, a sense of moral purpose remains. When footballers brush with scandal, they acknowledge their responsibilities as ‘role models’ in ways that would be alien to actors or rock stars. And government policy continues to defer to the idealism of the muscular Christians, who believed in sport as a force for healing and reconciliation. Tony Blair said that ‘Sport is the best health policy, education policy, anti-crime policy and anti-drugs policy’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946811428264">3</xref></sup> London Mayor, Boris Johnson, proposes team games as a cure for gang violence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946811428264">4</xref></sup> and the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, recently identified football, hockey and rugby among the ‘better’ games for ‘building character’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946811428264">5</xref></sup> Perhaps most improbably, two Labour MPs recently tabled a Commons motion calling for Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, to be made a Lord, in view of the ‘economic, social, [and] cultural’ importance of football to the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946811428264">6</xref></sup> Quite where Sir Alex would be asked to sit, having berated the Speaker for the thousandth time on some matter of timekeeping or personal bias, is anybody’s guess. But this is sportsworld, where myth too often acts for truth, and no myth greater than the theory that sport builds character.</p>
<p>My contention is not that sport <italic>cannot</italic> contribute to personal or collective moral development. With the right supervision, coaching and administrative culture, it can. The argument is that, by itself, sport nearly always fails to generate virtue—for reasons that are largely intrinsic to it. Sport is an organised form of play. It can provide moments of joy, transcendence and compelling drama; but, like any other art form, it can do this without making either practitioner or spectator a better person. My particular concern with the sport-builds-character discourse, however, is that it is counter-productive. In the attempt to build on sport, sport loses its freedom as play, and it is the demise of the play element that is perhaps responsible for so many of sport’s ethical failings. Far from a straight repudiation of its earnest ancestry, the consuming intensity of modern sport can be seen as an extension of the muscular Christianity that first legitimised it. It is this very seriousness—encompassing a win-at-all-costs attitude in competition, and unyielding partisanship in support—which makes sport such an ethical minefield. I do not suggest that a recovery of play will purge sport of its demons, or set it on the road to de Coubertin’s civilising mission, but it might help sport to reform itself. The dilemmas of modern sport are built into its Victorian ancestry, and those who would turn it to moral or social gain would do well to explore the history of muscular Christianity. Sport has much to offer the desk-bound universe of post-industrial modernity, but the lesson of muscular Christianity is to limit expectations. When sport is asked to work miracles, it usually ends up as just work.</p>
<p>How did sport emerge as moral teacher? The irony is that it all started with play. It is in the German tradition of moralising aesthetics that we find the seed of the Victorian belief that play can ennoble, civilise and effortlessly mediate between duty and desire. The complex reasoning of Kant’s third Critique was simplified by Friedrich Schiller, whose <italic>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</italic> (1794) proposed the ‘play drive’ as a force of reconciliation between the warring spirits of sensual passion and moral reason. Schiller spoke in almost incarnational language of play providing reason with a ‘champion in the empire of phenomena’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946811428264">7</xref></sup> Rather than barking orders from a distance, play allowed reason to enter the world of lived reality, guiding the will via taste and elevated sensibility. For taste could be educated and would shed its coarser instincts in the process. Play stood in for grace in this still-Christian mindset: it was the positive ingredient that enabled virtue to move. If good art conforms to principles of reason and order, the process of creating it would be similarly rational. Hence the Kantian idea that aesthetic experience ‘gives the law to itself’. It <italic>energised</italic> the moral law, making the ‘transition from the charm of sense to habitual moral interest possible without too violent a leap’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946811428264">8</xref></sup> In creating works of art, or in contemplating a glorious landscape, one cannot but be stirred out of the sensual.</p>
<p>It fell to Samuel Coleridge to try to re-Christianise this potentially pagan sacramentalism. The powers of the world are often ‘christened’ but seldom ‘Christianised’, he noted, in his important <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic> (1825). This was a plea for Christians to acknowledge the spiritual value of what he termed the ‘Helps without’—the spiritual sources that lay beyond the religious circle. Regarding Methodism as prime suspect in the crime of dividing the sacred from the secular, Coleridge worked hard to rescue the currency of ordinary living as a means of grace. It was the duty of the church to ‘sow beside all waters’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946811428264">9</xref></sup> This was the text and the idea that rescued Charles Kingsley from a period of existential doubt as a Cambridge student, and inspired the movement of muscular Christianity. Kingsley had found few resources in his evangelical upbringing to articulate his delight in nature, and it was through Coleridge, and F. D. Maurice, that he developed the world-affirming theology from which modern sport would emerge. Where Schiller and Coleridge had envisaged a kind of aesthetic or artistic clerisy, training the young in the ways of virtue, Kingsley and Thomas Hughes opted for an earthier medium. Writing evocatively of the country ‘Veasts’ that united the high and low of the Vale of the White Horse in their timeless rituals, Hughes appealed for a modern educational ‘grapnel’, fit for the cities and their listless young. It was, in a word, sport. No sooner had evangelicalism and Tractarianism burned traditional sports out of the Christian imagination, they were back: wearing blazers and ties, but with the same mischievous glint in their eye. The public schools were the context, and the 1850s the crucial decade.</p>
<p>In a famous ‘Circular to Parents’ of 1853, G. E. L. Cotton, the headmaster of Marlborough, outlined the value of games to control ‘a turbulent community’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946811428264">10</xref></sup> Cotton had served his apprenticeship at Rugby, and was the inspiration for Hughes’s ‘young master’ in <italic>Tom Brown’s Schooldays</italic>, hence the mistaken assumption that it was Thomas Arnold himself who presided over the rise of athleticism. Cotton’s endorsement of sport was more cautious and pragmatic than Hughes’ fictional account would suggest but, as J. A. Mangan has written, ‘For many in the Victorian and Edwardian public schools, games became “the wheel round which the moral values turned”. It was a genuinely and extensively held belief that they inspired virtue; they developed manliness; they formed character.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946811428264">11</xref></sup> Where Arnold confined his involvement to occasional spells on the touchline, young heads such as Edward Thring, of Uppingham, would throw themselves into the fray with manic intensity. Only when he felt that matters had got out of hand did he feel the need to preach on the words of Psalm 147.10: ‘[The Lord] taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946811428264">12</xref></sup> This, however, was a momentary pause in the sporting hurricane. The wind was blowing in one direction in the 1860s and ’70s, claiming even sceptics such as F. W. Farrar for the cause. Farrar eventually likened schoolboy sports to the well from which David drank to revive his strength: a source of life-long inspiration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946811428264">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just as Schiller’s aesthetics proposed that you could not produce good art without encountering moral truths, the muscular Christians endowed <italic>team</italic> sports with thaumaturgic potency. Team sports had no time for selfish individualism or losses of temper, and they left little energy for the besetting vices of youth. At a time when religion was looking more and more like a feminine preoccupation, sport would both re-masculinize Christianity and reclaim the lost. One of Kingsley’s more controversial postures was to define his mission in terms of redeeming ‘Esau’—the rough man of the fields, tricked out of his birthright by the slippery ‘Jacobs’ of the establishment. Muscular Christianity was less a reformation than a declaration of war on ‘pietism’ and all its works. When Kingsley suggested that the nation’s cathedrals could be left open on Sunday afternoons so that the people could take their winter walks, he was not joking. In his bitter duel with that most slippery of Jacobs, John Henry Newman, he set out the vision: ‘Through sport,’ he contended,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>boys acquire virtues which no books can give them; not merely daring and endurance, but, better still, temper, self-restraint, fairness, honour, unenvious approbation of another’s success, and all that ‘give and take’ of life which stand a man in good stead when he goes forth into the world, and without which, indeed, his success is always maimed and partial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946811428264">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If the whole idiom of muscular Christianity sounds male, it is because Kingsley shared with evangelicals a perception that the religious problem of the time was male and, unlike them, believed that the solution had to be equally masculine: a redeeming of physicality rather than a rescue from it. A striking passage came from Kingsley’s semi-autobiographical novel, <italic>Alton Locke</italic>, when a moment of maddening lust was diffused by the miraculous intervention of a rowing eight. Almost overcome by the urge to wade across the Cam to be with the ‘object of his desire’, a woman of great beauty, Kingsley’s character was marvellously distracted by the rowers. As he wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was as proud of the gallant young fellows as if they had been my brothers—of their courage and endurance (for one could see that it was no child’s-play, from the pale faces, and panting lips), their strength and activity, so fierce and yet so cultivated, smooth, harmonious, as oar kept time with oar, and every back rose and fell in concert—and felt my soul stirred up to a sort of sweet madness, not merely by the shouts and cheers of the mob around me, but by the loud fierce pulse of the rowlocks, the swift whispering rush of the long snake-like eight oars, the swirl and gurgle of the water in their wake, the grim, breathless silence of the straining rowers. My blood boiled over, and fierce tears swelled into my eyes; for I, too, was a man, and an Englishman; and when I caught sight of my cousin, pulling stroke to the second boat in the long line, with set teeth and flashing eyes, the great muscles on his bare arms springing up into knots at every rapid stroke, I ran and shouted among the maddest and the foremost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946811428264">15</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sport, one; lust, nil—depending, of course, what you mean by lust. Muscular Christians did not worry about the homoerotic tendencies of their creed. They had an idea, and they ran with it. Thus began what Maurice Cowling termed Kingsley’s ‘reanimation of Protestantism’. Sport became a tool of mission, and the empire acquired its sporting missionaries.</p>
<p>Rev. C. E. Tyndale-Biscoe, a CMS missionary to Kashmir, developed a system whereby anyone who wanted to ‘go Christian’ had to engage his gardener in a short boxing match, and anyone desiring religious conversation would have to pay one rupee for the privilege (the money being returned if the discussion were agreeable).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946811428264">16</xref></sup> Tyndale-Biscoe was a one-off, certainly, but it was only thanks to Kingsley and Hughes that the concept of the sporting missionary was possible. Mocked as the new cultus certainly was, there is no doubt that it filled a gap in the fervent but ‘excarnated’ Christianity of the nineteenth century. As the review which coined the phrase ‘muscular Christianity’ noted in 1857: ‘Certainly nothing can give a stronger notion of the rapid changes which take place in public opinion than to find that original black beast, the hunting parson, held up as the truest type of earthly and saintly excellence.’ And while Kingsley initially regretted this ‘painful’ term, he would have been grateful that the article was quietly positive about this ‘rare but admirable combination’ of the physical and the spiritual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946811428264">17</xref></sup> The Victorians were coming, as Howard Mumford Jones put it, to the ‘profound conviction that the visible world exists’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946811428264">18</xref></sup> and sport was one of the great beneficiaries. Sport appealed to the contemporary passion for action and the ever-practical Victorians put it straight to work.</p>
<p>Church Congress reports of the 1860s and ’70s make entertaining reading, as Anglican clergy vied with one another to take a more radical stance on the matter of ‘recreation’—an important linguistic shift from the damning terminology of ‘amusement’. Some noted the similarity between the concept of re-creation and religion, both meaning to be ‘born again’, while others were willing to speak of sporting interests as moral duties, of neglect of the body as sin. As Canon Lyttleton put it in 1866: while ‘visions far from edifying may rise before our minds of “sporting parsons,” <italic>mere</italic> cricketing or still worse mere <italic>croqueting</italic> clergymen, yet it is most desirable that the clergy should not stand altogether aloof from the sports and pastimes of the people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946811428264">19</xref></sup> Another suggested that the superior morals of his own county of Nottinghamshire was already attributable to the amount of cricket played there. Everywhere, the principle of sport as mediator provided the justification. Just as sport provided the link between the terrifying ‘Doctor’ and the lawlessness of the boys in <italic>Tom Brown’s Schooldays</italic>, healthy recreation was to mediate between religion and the badlands of the cities. Sport would succeed where evangelism and high culture had failed. As Clyde Binfield has noted, attempts to probe darkest London with Wordsworth, Burns and the like were always something and nothing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946811428264">20</xref></sup> Sport was the new solvent, and it sat between its older friends of drink, gambling and vice, and its new patrons, religion and virtue. Pleasure mixed with moralism—or, at least, moralising. Commenting drily on the spread of athleticism in the 1860s, <italic>The Times</italic> remarked: ‘when you can at the same time enjoy yourself and feel the consciousness that you are doing a moral action, it is difficult to refrain.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946811428264">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 1870, Dickens was gently mocking the new style of urban muscular Christian in the character of Reverend Septimus Crisparkle in <italic>Edwin Drood</italic> (1870), ‘whose radiant features teemed with innocence, and soft-hearted benevolence beamed from his boxing-gloves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946811428264">22</xref></sup> And soon even the grave ranks of Nonconformity joined the dance. The <italic>British Weekly</italic> poked fun at the turnaround by reporting on the progress of special ‘services for cyclists’ in a fictional north London chapel. The minister persisted despite the resignation of a deacon over the spectacle of bicycles in the church porch on Sunday. His address dealt with three themes: ‘the necessity and true uses of recreation; how the cyclist may serve his generation; and warnings and encouragements to pleasure-seekers’. He began with an apology to any present who either were not interested in cycling or considered that recreation, as such, was an unsuitable subject for a sermon. ‘As for the former class, it is practically non-existent. <italic>We are all cyclists now.</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946811428264">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Very soon, then, sport was taken for granted, in the church and in the culture—part of that ‘mingled mass of perfectly legitimate pleasures’ that <italic>The Times</italic> considered characteristic of the age. Charles Booth’s survey of the <italic>Life and Labour of the People in London<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946811428264">24</xref></sup></italic> uncovered an astonishing array of cricket, cycling and football clubs of distinctly Apostolic nomenclature, and batteries of Institutes, YMCAs, and Mission Halls, catering for ‘the whole man’. Sport was central to the civilising mission.</p>
<p>The question is: did it work? Did sport build character in the way Kingsley and Hughes promised? Was Esau restored? In one sense, you would have to say yes: the values of public school athleticism were rapidly internalised, and the less imperialist versions that flourished in the YMCAs also set down deep roots. Sport did furnish a kind of chivalry, as Kingsley had hoped. Closely bound to the values of thrift and temperance, the YMCAs generated their own form of ‘physical Puritanism’. The American, Luther Gulick, developed a theory of ‘recapitulation’, whereby repetitive exercise was believed to play a part in disciplining the passions. It is certainly a great mistake to see the spread of sport as a slide into hedonism. The Puritan-baiting Kingsley was far more puritan than he realized; indeed his remedy for sexual temptation was arguably an extension of Richard Baxter’s age-old prescription: ‘Work hard in your calling’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946811428264">25</xref></sup> In muscular Christianity play became work, and the language of ‘expelling the devil of impurity’ echoed the kind of asceticism that Kingsley and Hughes claimed to abhor. Sport was instrumentalised—and never more so than when war approached.</p>
<p>The mingling of athleticism and duty reached its highest expression in the First World War when football clubs were used as recruiting agencies, and when officers sometimes led their troops over the top by kicking footballs. A soldier’s diary records a scene at 7.30 am on 1 July 1916: ‘As the gun-fire died away I saw an infantry man climb onto the parapet into no man’s land, beckoning others to follow. As he did so he kicked off a football; a good kick, the ball rose and travelled well towards the German line. That seemed to be the signal to advance.’ Captain Nevill of the East Surrey Regiment had bought four footballs on his last leave in London, and offered a prize to the first of his platoons to dribble a ball into the German positions. An anonymous elegy was penned to Nevill and the men that fell with him on that first day of the Somme:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On through the heat of slaughter</p>
<p>Where gallant comrades fall</p>
<p>Where blood is poured like water</p>
<p>They drive the trickling ball</p>
<p>The fear of death before them</p>
<p>Is but an empty name</p>
<p>True to the land that bore them</p>
<p>The SURREYs play the game.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946811428264">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whatever emotions Captain Nevill and the Surreys now conjure, here is evidence that the gusto of sport could transfer into real-life situations. Sport played its part in the making of empire; it helped to sustain the war effort.</p>
<p>What is difficult is to assess the positive agency of Victorian athleticism apart from its strongly religious context. Is the link between sport and virtue really a debt to the pervasive religiosity of the times? Does the hardness of the public school boy, or the fatalism of the British soldier, really represent ‘character’? Insofar as sport created its own culture, the results were less than positive. From the later 1860s, Hughes worried about the monster he had created: urging that manliness meant gentleness not roughness. Headmasters moved to curb the ‘immoderate interest in athletics’ that the sporting cult had developed. An American visitor admitted there was no equivalent in his own country to the sporting ‘bloods’ who ruled the English public schools but suggested ‘bully’ would be the nearest match. If the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, was that a good thing?</p>
<p>A number of sources indicate that a revolution premised on sport’s inclusiveness had failed to deliver. Far from creating a single moral community, the intense rivalries of sport created elaborate hierarchies, with precise and exclusive dress codes. An old Harrovian recalled his schooldays with stoic humour: ‘… it was discovered that I was short-sighted and that I was no good at cricket. Naturally enough, I became a person of no account.’ The obituary of an Uppingham boy who died at school read: ‘Not widely known in the school for his feeble health precluded any participation in games.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946811428264">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The irony of attributing the rise of athleticism to Arnold was that he appears to have been sceptical as to its benefits and would almost certainly have resisted the pre-eminence it assumed. In his eloquent account of the changing ethos of public schools, David Newsome laments the drowning of the Arnoldian vision of <italic>Godliness and good learning</italic> in a sea of sporting metaphors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946811428264">28</xref></sup> Instead of making men out of boys, the games cult made perpetual adolescents of men—the sort of people who never get over dropped catches in House Matches or are incapable of reading newspapers from the front page.</p>
<p>Then there was the dark side of athleticism: the corruption of the already questionable idea that gifted competitors make good leaders. Alec Waugh’s novel, <italic>The Loom of Youth</italic> (1917), lifted the lid on the double-standards that operated in the public schools, especially where athletes and sex were concerned. In the book Gordon Carruthers discovers at Fernhurst (based on Sherborne) that ‘blind worship at the shrine of the god of Athleticism’ is the only passport to success. ‘To the athlete all things are forgiven.’ Another character complained as he was about to be expelled for homosexuality that there were worse offenders—protected by their status as athletes: ‘Fernhurst taught me everything; Fernhurst made me worship games, and think that they alone mattered, and everything else could go to the deuce. I heard men say about bloods whose lives were an open scandal, “Oh, it’s all right, they can play football”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946811428264">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>When sport did generate virtue, it seemed to do so on its own terms. Mangan has written of a ‘Stoicism making bland use of Christian phraseology’ in the public schools; and it is sometimes hard to distinguish the muscular Christianity of a Kingsley from the post-Christian muscularity of someone like Leslie Stephen, the great Alpinist and literary critic. Muscular missionaries like Tyndale-Biscoe could sound awfully similar to an unbelieving adventurer such as Frederick Lugard, who ‘abandoned Christianity and became “a hopeless atheist”’ during his African conquests, yet continued to value ‘those qualities of character which religion had done so much to develop’. Religion here meant sport, for his new morality consisted of ‘the ethical value of public school muscularity without the Christianity’—a philosophy for doers not believers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946811428264">30</xref></sup> ‘Atheist’ Lugard and ‘Christian’ Tyndale-Biscoe were united in a belief in the ‘ethical value’ of games. Opposites met at the crease.</p>
<p>Character in this sense could boil down to a certain disregard for danger: an anaesthetised mentality rather than a cultivated one. E. M. Forster’s observations on public school boys with their ‘well-developed bodies, fairly developed minds, and undeveloped hearts’ were probably fair—although one should recall his qualification: that an undeveloped heart is not a cold one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946811428264">31</xref></sup> Nevertheless it was the brittleness of this rather outward model of character that rendered it so vulnerable to real-world rigour. The sporting ethos might have enabled people to sign up for service, it may indeed have helped them serve, as we have seen, but its rosy optimism was horribly exposed by the conflict. As Norman Vance has written, this tradition of Christian manliness was ‘too naïve’ to survive the onset of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946811428264">32</xref></sup> Trench piety moved in very different directions—towards superstition and sacrament, rather than the cigarettes and bonhomie of the muscular Christians. After the War, the Kingsleian creed suffered the indignity of being classed among the ‘priggish cliches’ of Victorian cant that it had always seen itself as opposing. One writer recalled the Victorian regime in which his father ‘used to give us odd little old-fashioned books to read, of an improving kind, like <italic>Philosophy in Sport</italic>, where the poor boy cannot even throw a stone without having the principles of the parabola explained to him, with odious diagrams’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946811428264">33</xref></sup> In the 1920s, Stephen Spender complained of similar advice from his father: ‘If I had to play football, he impressed on me that this was to harden the tissues of my character.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946811428264">34</xref></sup> It is not hard to see why twentieth-century sport lurched so dramatically towards a more hedonistic, free-standing model: sometimes laughing at the older moralism, mostly ignoring it.</p>
<p>The process began much earlier, indeed it was always implicit in a movement that often resembled a farmer trying to muzzle a racehorse. Even when it seemed to stand to attention, sport was a repository of alternative values, which had the honesty to break out formally in the age of commercialism. A symbolic turning point came in 1883 when the working-class outfit of Blackburn Olympic beat the Old Etonians 2–1 in the final of the FA Cup at the Kennington Oval. The Northerners had been training on the sands at Blackpool, courtesy of a wealthy patron, and generally defying the amateur ethos. It was not about character: it was about cups. Two years later, professionalism was sanctioned by the FA, and an era of surging crowds and endangered referees began. When the decision to introduce the penalty kick was made in 1891, C. B. Fry, the great athlete and scholar, considered it an insult to the sport. Why would anyone deliberately foul an opponent? But this view was already looking quaint, as football, especially, started to beat a path away from the protocols of muscular Christianity. Abuse from spectators, deliberate injury of opponents, and an imperialising power over conversation and finances led many patrons of the game to wonder what they had started. One writer likened the situation to a case of savages eating the missionaries who had brought them the gospel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946811428264">35</xref></sup> Others spoke of a re-barbarisation of society, as cases of violence escalated, and the game failed to live up to its vice-busting potential. A Victorian cult of action had become a twentieth-century cult of the spectator. This was not in the game plan.</p>
<p>Clearly there was a class element in the so-called ‘football mania’ but the break with muscular Christianity was not as clean as either side would have liked. YMCA and Sunday school teams were rarely immune to sport’s vices. Lampeter College’s rugby team were branded ‘Fighting Parsons’ by a local newspaper after a mass brawl in one of their games—a symptom of rugby’s slide from sanctity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946811428264">36</xref></sup> Tony Collins has related the remarkable story of Leeds Parish Rugby Club, founded in 1874 with the aim of ‘improving the moral as well as the physical well being of the working man player’. By 1900 the club was attracting crowds of up to 20,000, and the amateur ethos was under strain. Players were effectively paid for their services and the link between the team and church membership evaporated. The team gained a reputation for ‘roughness, tripping, fighting and generally playing in a … manner that was “brutal in the extreme”’. One of the curates of the church was Cosmo Lang, the future archbishop of Canterbury, whose negotiations in the constitutional crisis of 1936 no doubt benefited from his experience of having been ‘hauled before the Yorkshire Rugby Union, charged with violent conduct’ as a young man. The club’s reputation was such that numerous referees refused to officiate. One had to escape the crowd by climbing over a wall and rowing across the canal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946811428264">37</xref></sup> This was an extreme, but it makes the point that the dismantling of the amateur ethos was organic rather than an imposition of ‘professionalism’. For all his protestations about fair play, C. B. Fry himself admitted that ‘It is the barbarian in us that loves football.’ Writing in 1899, he explained: ‘The game is exceedingly civilised and scientific nowadays; but clothe it as you will in law and order, it nonetheless fascinates and appeals to us by reason of that in us, which desires the stress and the excitement of fighting.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946811428264">38</xref></sup> Fry here anticipated one of the great theorists of modern sport, Allen Guttmann, who described it as: ‘The rationalization of the romantic.’ Sport obeys the rules of modern organisation and time-discipline yet it remains rooted in ‘the dark soil of our instinctive lives’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946811428264">39</xref></sup> Even before professionalism institutionalised a win-at-all-costs mentality, promoters of sport were discovering that you cannot build a Christian superstructure on a Nietzschean base. Sport had a life of its own. C. B. Fry’s willingness to play within the rules, and his abhorrence of cheating, were almost certainly values generated outside the sporting arena. The problem with muscular Christianity was the assumption that sport would nurture these values by itself. Case studies from America have shown, however, that the higher the level of competition, the more willingly players will countenance violence to an opponent or various forms of deception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946811428264">40</xref></sup> Sport needs to import values before it can even think about exporting them.</p>
<p>As I have suggested, one of the most remarkable things about sport is that it retained a moralising remit even as it consistently defaulted on its promises. No amount of drug-taking, administrative corruption, abuse of officials, or institutionalised deception can dent the rhetoric of moral transformation that continues to surround sport. In 2001, a Swedish legislator nominated football for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing its capacity for cultivating ‘understanding between people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946811428264">41</xref></sup> Anyone who has been to a Premiership football match will know about the culture shock of passing from the sanitising banter of <italic>Match of the Day</italic> and the realities of the stadium. Yet few will criticise sport. It is a modern ‘sacred’.</p>
<p>The tension is perhaps greater in America, where more pious versions of muscular Christianity arguably lived on in the career of charismatic coaches such as Vince Lombardi, after whom the Super Bowl trophy has been named, and surely the most quotable figure in the history of sport. Lombardi was ever happy to build on Pauline metaphors, to extol the virtues of collective endeavour. Yet he was also happy to mock the Victorian ethos: ‘show me a good loser’, he famously quipped, ‘and I will show you a loser’. ‘If winning isn’t everything, why do they keep score.’ Yet as Shirl Hoffman demonstrates in his excellent book, <italic>Good Game</italic>, the language of virtue and character formation has lost little of its purchase in the hard-nosed world of big-time sports. He quotes the rare dissenting voice of Jay Leno, who recently poked fun at sport’s grave self-image: ‘I see that more NFL players are in trouble with the law’, he told his late-night audience: ‘Imagine how bad it would be if football didn’t develop character.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946811428264">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hoffman laments the way commentators have become complicit in the world of professional fouls and trash talking. He sketches the sporting canvas as a kind of ethical no-man’s-land in which the tiniest decency is treated as something worthy of sainthood, at least where it doesn’t cost you a championship. Sportsmanship within the limits of competition alone! A coach owns up to fielding an unregistered player and it makes the front page of the <italic>New York Times</italic>. Andrew Flintoff consoles an Australian batsman after a Test Match defeat, and the gesture is worthy of editorialising. It is as if we want our sports to be ethical but have got used to them being anything but. Far from civilising us, competitive sports have made us accept hardness as the price of success, Hoffman suggests. One of the reasons we don’t have scores of role models, demonstrating how high-level performance can sit alongside the highest moral standards, is that the conscience-driven athlete rarely makes the grade. Hoffman cites examples of talented athletes whose scruples prevented them succeeding in the zero-sum economy of elite competition. He also argues that many of the abuses of modern sports are wired into their competitive genes. ‘As sport sociologists have pointed out, most of the egregious blemishes on the face of sport come not from <italic>violating</italic> established rules and traditions but from <italic>over-conforming</italic> to the norms and expectations of the competitive ethos.’ And quoting another source, Hoffman argues that: ‘All of the things we hate most about sport … are only the logical outcomes of a social activity in which one person’s success hinges on his or her ability to deny that same success to another.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946811428264">43</xref></sup> Like the paradox of sports evangelism, launching a religion of self-sacrifice from a platform of self-adulation, the attempt to moralise from sport suffers in the very sinews of the beast. Hoffman’s findings reflect earlier critiques of the power of sport to ‘remedy’ urban ‘delinquency’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946811428264">44</xref></sup> and tally with the robust observations of a recent document from the Centre for Social Justice, entitled <italic>More than a Game.</italic> The report notes ‘the profound lack of evidence’ for character-building claims made by politicians and sports administrators, arguing that ‘there is a real difference between using sport as part of a programme to deliver positive social outcomes, and assuming that sport will automatically deliver these on its own’. It quoted the view that ‘sport has the potential both to improve <italic>and inhibit</italic> an individual’s personal growth… Sport, like most activities, is not <italic>a priori</italic> good or bad, but has the potential of producing both positive and negative outcomes.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946811428264">45</xref></sup> Hoffman agrees, and his worry is that the intensity of competition is the essential problem.</p>
<p>Much as I admire Hoffman’s book, I think he goes too far on the deleterious implications of competition. I would agree with Nick Watson and John White in emphasising the positive aspects of competition as providing ‘the opportunity for self-discovery … [and] excellence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946811428264">46</xref></sup> Sport requires a balance of the ludic, or playful, and the agonic, or competitive instincts, and without the latter, it fails to satisfy. I would cite Rafael Nadal as someone who competes at the highest level without abusing opponents, officials, or himself. When pressed on the significance of what he has achieved, Nadal’s uncle and coach emphasised that being good at tennis is nothing more than ‘being able to pass a ball back and forth over a net’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946811428264">47</xref></sup> Famously able to move on after a bad point or a bad set, it seems that much of Nadal’s brilliance derives from an ability to put the game in perspective. He is ultra competitive but he understands that tennis is a game, and that the triumphs and disasters of one encounter remain locked in time. Nadal’s conduct shows that competitive sport does not have to descend to Hobbesian warfare but, again, we are looking at values generated <italic>outside</italic> the sporting arena enabling him to compete within it. Repeated reference to the discipline and security of his upbringing indicate that his stoic qualities were home-grown rather than sport-generated. The contrast between Nadal’s respect for opponents and officials and what has come to be the norm illustrates the wider problem.</p>
<p>Where I agree with Hoffman is the observation that too many competitors and spectators ‘over-conform’ to the competitive ethos—forgetting that sport is bounded activity, and that its charm is its separateness from real life. Like the village yokel, who clambers onto stage to rescue the damsel in distress the first time he sees a play, many sports fans over-identify with their subject. This is what happened in Vancouver earlier this summer, and it is the phenomenon that Nick Hornby described—even <italic>valorised</italic>—in <italic>Fever Pitch</italic>. Hornby was scathing about the idea that the football fan goes to be ‘entertained’. Football is so much more important than that. Perhaps now is the time for football to discover the lighter side. Sport should be cherished, not fetishised.</p>
<p>Sport may not be able to regenerate society but I suggest it can be a kind of leaven—a joyous parenthesis in modern living, if not its fuel. Instead of lamenting the fact that it fails to turn boys into men, perhaps we should embrace the fact that it keeps men in touch with their youth, mocking the aging process with its convulsions of triumph and disaster. In an age of ‘vanishing’ childhood, of relentless economic compulsions, sport can provide a refuge: a suspension of quotidian duty, an inversion of hierarchy, a recovery of the carnivalesque. For this, it needs to recover play. Among those ‘conditions’ that the authors of <italic>More than a Game</italic> consider vital to the generation of positive outcomes in youth sport I would include an attitude that can take sport seriously without turning it into an ultimate value. The moment sport becomes ultimate, it loses its charm, and becomes a form of work. Educators could learn from muscular Christianity and the costs of an over-instrumentalised ethos. I also think that there should be more emphasis on participation and less on the veneration of sporting ‘icons’, many of whom epitomise the ambiguities of sporting success. A distinct play-deficit is evident in both the grinding, risk-free style of much elite competition, and the joyless seriousness of many sporting events. I’m sure Andre Agassi spoke for many professional sportsmen and women when he disclosed in his autobiography that, quite early in his career, he ceased to enjoy playing tennis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946811428264">48</xref></sup> The grave intensity of <italic>Fever Pitch</italic> is no recipe for transcendence. Recreation may have been conceived as a romantic refuge from what Max Weber would term the ‘iron cage’ of the economic cosmos but it too often resembles a new iron cage. Hockey riots and football hooliganism represent the extreme of a culture that promises liberation and rarely delivers. The solution is either to sit more loosely with sport, or to find sports that don’t take themselves so seriously.</p>
<p>The Olympics bid of 2004 was premised on the ability to ‘inspire’ young people and to generate a ‘sporting legacy’. I applaud this, but possibly not through the usual suspects of athletics and cycling. Sport’s charisma is arguably stronger at the fringes, in the alternative games and disciplines that are yet to be routinised into ‘margins’ and ‘percentages’. Elite sport needs to hear from minor sports, about what it is to compete with freedom and abandon. Minor sports need to hear from the amateurs—about pleasure, festivity and fellowship. And when consumption and spectating cease to satisfy, there is always the opportunity for play: for sport in the raw. In his autobiography, <italic>Four Minute Mile</italic>, Roger Bannister related a moment in childhood when he stood alone and barefoot on a beach, and just started to run. This moment of unconstrained exuberance evoked emotions that nothing in his competitive career ever produced. It is a taste of what sport can deliver, unencumbered and free:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In this supreme moment I leapt in sheer joy. I was startled, and frightened, by the tremendous excitement that so few steps could create. I glanced around uneasily to see if anyone was watching. A few more steps—self-consciously now and firmly gripping the original excitement. The earth seemed almost to move with me. I was running now, and a fresh rhythm entered my body. No longer conscious of my movement I discovered a new unity with nature. I had found a new source of power and beauty, a source I never dreamt existed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946811428264">49</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Does sport build character? No. But it can lift the spirit.</p>
