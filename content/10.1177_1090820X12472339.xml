      <p>In “A Plastic Surgeon’s Guide to Applying Smartphone Technology in Patient Care,” Workman and Gupta provide a brief overview of the currently available plastic surgery smartphone applications (“apps”) and discuss their potential impact related to social media. They have classified apps into several categories, including surgeon/practice apps, academic-based apps, patient reference apps, and nonapplicable apps. They identified a total of 161 plastic surgery–related apps, of which 54 were practice-based apps. Twenty-three academic-based apps were identified; however, most were felt to be geared toward residents, medical students, and college students, with no social media benefit. Plastic surgeon locator apps were discussed in the patient reference apps section; these included the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) app, Project Beauty app, and FaceDecide MD app (which is no longer available in the United States). “Nonapplicable apps” included those that allowed for various photo-morphing capabilities but were not patient or practice focused. The authors concluded that smartphone apps have the potential to change the patient-surgeon interaction and will be increasingly important in the future of plastic surgery.</p>
      <p>It is common knowledge that smartphone apps have had an impact in many arenas of everyday life. Apple released data earlier this year stating that more than 650 000 apps are available in their App Store (225 000 specifically for the iPad), with more than 30 billion app downloads.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472339">1</xref>
         </sup> A quick search at the Apple App Store as I was writing this Commentary revealed approximately 200 plastic surgery–related apps. Even if all of them were individual practice apps developed to help engage the potential new patient, less than 5% of all plastic surgeons would have developed a smartphone practice app, so the potential for growth remains great.</p>
      <p>Several years ago, I developed my own practice app. At the time, I felt as though it was a worthwhile endeavor, as apps were “all the rage.” Today, I would argue that it seems as though it is unnecessary to develop a practice app, given the advances with mobile platforms and mobile websites. A practice app adds one more step for potential patients to find you, as they have to search for an app and go through the process of downloading it. It is much easier for the potential patient to find your site with a simple Google search. The key is that your website must be “mobile friendly,” with optimized font size and photos, so that the patient will have a good experience if viewing your site from a mobile device. Having said this, there may be a “cool factor” in displaying your own personalized iPhone/iPad app on your website or in your office.</p>
      <p>In addition to my practice app, I also developed a breast augmentation photo-morphing app, MyBreastAug, which had more than 150 000 downloads when it was offered free of charge (the downloads dramatically decreased when I began charging 99 cents to help cover the development fees). This app may or may not have had any direct impact to my practice, although it did serve a particular marketing purpose and did allow users to easily transfer to my website, visit my photo and video gallery, and find my social media links (Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter).</p>
      <p>Let’s not forget that non–practice-related social media applications can be utilized with smartphones today and do not have to be developed by each individual surgeon. Some examples include apps from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Tout. All of these social media outlets give the plastic surgeon opportunities to reach, market to, and educate potential and existing patients. A surgeon can easily utilize these apps on his or her own smartphone to update (potential) patients about the latest news, trends, and topics in plastic surgery; promote any “daily deals” he or she may be offering or invite patients to upcoming educational seminars or evenings of beauty; and capture/post new procedure videos and patient testimonials. All of these tools allow us to engage with our prospective and current patients in a different manner than the one to which we were accustomed only a few short years ago.</p>
      <p>As you can imagine, there are many potential applications for smartphone apps within the field of plastic surgery.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12472339">2</xref>
         </sup> Some of these apps are primarily designed for the practicing plastic surgeon (ASAPS annual meeting calendar, ASAPS RADAR Resource by Anzu Medical); some may be best geared to the upcoming medical student (Gray’s Anatomy) or resident (Zollinger’s Atlas of Surgical Operations); others are geared to communication with potential patients by educating and assisting in locating a plastic surgeon (ASAPS, Project Beauty) or to other forms of engagement and interaction with potential/current patients (individual practice apps, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). The value of the social media aspect of apps may not be easily quantifiable, but we know for certain that a tremendous number of people are utilizing these different sites today. Some of these people may one day become plastic surgery patients, so we certainly must keep these marketing opportunities in mind.</p>
