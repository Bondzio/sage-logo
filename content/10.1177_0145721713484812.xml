<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition-based shared medical appointment (SMA) intervention in the treatment of prediabetes compared to the individualized counseling standard of care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713484812">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A randomized controlled trial design comparing health outcomes in patients with prediabetes attending either an individualized counseling (control group) or three 90-minute nutrition SMA (intervention group) sessions. Demographic, anthropometric (weight and body mass index), clinical (blood pressure), and biochemical (lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, glycated hemoglobin, albumin-to-creatinine ratio) measures were obtained from all participants at baseline, at 3 months, and at 1 year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713484812">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Ninety-four participants were randomized into the 2 study groups with a 69% completion rate at 1 year (n = 34 SMA, n = 31 control). The average participant was Caucasian (64%), male (54%), 58.3 ± 9.6 years, had a BMI of 30.8 ± 4.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese), and fasting blood glucose of 109 ± 9.5 mg/dL. The SMA and control participants lost a mean of 6.6 pounds and 3.6 pound, respectively; neither group met the 5% modest weight loss expected. The SMA and control group experienced a mean drop in fasting blood glucose of 6 mg/dL.</p>

<sec id="section4-0145721713484812">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>As demands on health care providers continue to rise, finding innovative ways to manage the patient load while providing quality health care is increasingly important. SMA health outcomes were equivalent to individual counseling outcomes, while increasing the provider’s productivity by treating 6 to 8 people with prediabetes in 90 minutes compared to 1 patient in 60 minutes.</p>

<body>
<p>The prevalence of prediabetes in 2010 was estimated at 344 million adults worldwide (7.9%) with an expected increase to 472 million adults (8.4%) by 2030.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713484812">1</xref></sup> In 2007, prediabetes in US adults totaled 57 million, with an associated annual national health care cost of $25 billion, including higher rates of ambulatory visits for endocrine, metabolic and renal complications, as well as hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713484812">2</xref></sup> It is estimated that 83% of US adults with prediabetes will progress to diabetes; however, lifestyle modifications could reduce that figure to 65% or less.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713484812">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713484812">4</xref></sup> Based on the National Health &amp; Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006 results, prediabetes incidence was associated with older ages, males, less education, elevated weight, elevated blood pressure, larger waist circumference, and altered blood lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713484812">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713484812"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713484812">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the prevalence, health care costs, and progression of prediabetes to diabetes continue to rise, strategies to prevent diabetes become increasingly more important. Effective management of prediabetes includes education targeting modifiable risk factors such as weight and physical inactivity and in some cases prescription of oral antihyperglycemic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713484812">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713484812"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713484812">13</xref></sup> Although health education can be disseminated in several venues, individual patient appointments with a primary care physician, a nurse practitioner, and/or a registered dietitian are traditionally the standard of care for prediabetes. Given the magnitude of the prediabetes problem, these individual education sessions can be both costly and an inefficient use of clinician time. Past researchers have estimated the need for 7.4 to 10.6 hours per day to adequately care for patients, depending on the acuity of care needed on a one-on-one basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713484812">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713484812">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Group health care interventions have found an important role in disease prevention and can increase productivity by treating more patients with the same medical condition at the same time. Shared medical appointments (SMAs), incorporating individualized patient attention with a multidisciplinary staff in a group setting, may offer the best solution for personalized care while enhancing efficiency and clinician productivity. The concept was developed by Dr Edward Noffsinger, a psychologist with Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, and has been incorporated into many health care settings, including diabetes, cardiology, osteoporosis, and bariatric surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713484812">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713484812"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713484812">22</xref></sup> The original concept incorporated a multidisciplinary staff led by a primary care or specialty physician. Recent research has expanded the SMA provider role to nursing and may also be effective with ancillary health care providers, such as registered dietitians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713484812">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713484812">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition-based SMA intervention in the treatment of prediabetes compared to the individualized counseling standard of care. The hypothesis is that a nutrition SMA will be as effective as the standard of care in improving health outcomes while enhancing registered dietitian productivity.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721713484812">
<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<p>This study utilized a randomized controlled trial design comparing clinical outcomes in prediabetes patients completing individualized counseling (control group) versus those attending three 90-minute nutrition SMA (intervention group) sessions. The study was approved by the regional institutional review board for human subject research. Prior to enrollment, all participants attended a 3-hour multidisciplinary educational class covering the importance of lifestyle modifications, after which they were invited to stay for a short recruitment brief. Those who volunteered to participate were randomized into 1 of 2 groups: (1) nutrition SMA or (2) standard of care individual counseling. Anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical measures were obtained from all participants at baseline, 3 months and again at 1-year follow-up. The study was conducted between October 2006 and May 2009. Based on the American Diabetes Association’s standard of medical care guidance in 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713484812">25</xref></sup> several health outcome goals were set for the program: fasting blood glucose (FBG) of ≤ 125 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (A1C) at &lt; 6.5%, blood pressure at ≤ 130/80 mmHg, total cholesterol of ≤ 200 mg/dL, low density of ≤100 mg/dL, triglycerides at ≤ 150 mg/dL, and 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145721713484812">
<title>Subjects and Recruitment</title>
<p>The sample population was obtained from Department of Defense beneficiaries enrolled in the TRICARE health care system living in the San Antonio, Texas, area. Inclusion criteria for participation were a minimum age of 18 years, fluent in English, and a diagnosis of prediabetes in accordance with the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria for impaired fasting glucose (IFG; FBG of 100-125 mg/dL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713484812">25</xref></sup> Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of diabetes and those not attending the initial prediabetes education class.</p>
<p>Subjects were recruited immediately following a 3-hour prediabetes education class between October 2006 and May 2008. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were asked to participate in the study. Once the informed consent and HIPAA authorization forms were signed, the volunteers were randomized into either the control or intervention group. Randomization occurred by a computer-generated random-numbers list (SPSS version 15.0.1; IBM Corporation) with assignments placed in sealed envelopes, numbered sequentially, and allocated to participants in the order of recruitment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721713484812">
<title>Sample Size Estimation</title>
<p>Sample size estimation was based on the primary outcome measure of FBG, expected at baseline to be within 100-125 mg/dL. A clinically significant effect would be a mean FBG decrease of 10 mg/dL. An initial sample size estimate was determined by a Kraemer and Theimann table, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, and yielded a need for 34 participants per group (total n = 68) to detect a 0.8 SD effect size with a 95% confidence level and 80% power. To account for an expected 30% attrition rate commonly experienced with outpatient research, the investigators anticipated recruiting an estimated 100 participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721713484812">
<title>Group Assignments</title>
<p>Those randomized to the nutrition SMA participated in a 90-minute appointment on 3 occasions over the next 3 months. SMA sessions were set up to accommodate 6-8 patients and were supported by the following staff: a nutrition technician serving as a screener; a dietitian or nutrition technician as the session recorder; a certified diabetes educator registered dietitian as the provider; and a behavioral specialist, registered nurse, or registered dietitian trained in group dynamics as the facilitator of the sessions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721713484812">Figure 1</xref> depicts the SMA appointment model, process, and flow through each session. The screener received the patients, ensured the patients understood and signed a group visit HIPAA consent form; documented height, weight, and blood pressure measurements; asked each patient to complete an individual questionnaire; and then escorted the patients to the SMA room. The facilitator greeted each patient entering the SMA room, familiarized new patients to the SMA process, covered the ground rules, built group cohesion, and facilitated discussion on topics of interest while the provider reviewed notes and consulted with the recorder between individual sessions. Each patient received 10 minutes of individual focused time with the provider to review their clinical and biochemical measures and challenges, successes, and questions regarding their progress in making lifestyle changes using SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based). All pertinent information discussed during the visit was recorded in each patient’s medical record by the recorder who also scheduled a follow-up SMA appointment.</p>

</fig>
<p>Those randomized to the standard of care control group attended at least one 45- to 60-minute individualized counseling session with a registered dietitian following the initial 3-hour prediabetes education class. During these individual appointments, the dietitian discussed the patient’s clinical outcomes and progress made in achieving lifestyle modifications since attending the prediabetes class and provided additional education, including assistance to develop SMART goals, and scheduled the patient for a follow-up appointment if desired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721713484812">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>A Microsoft Access database (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA) was created by the Information Technology department to minimize questionnaire and medical record transcription errors when exporting the data for statistical analysis. The primary outcome measure was FBG (mg/dL). Secondary outcome measures were weight (WT; kg) measured in duplicate on an electronic scale and averaged; body mass index (BMI) calculated by kg/m<sup>2</sup>; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP; mmHg) measured with an electronic sphygammometer; A1C (%); and the standard lipid profile, collected by a certified phlebotomist, following an 8-hour fast (total cholesterol [CHOL; mg/dL], low density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL; mg/dL]; high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL; mg/dL]; and triglycerides [TG; mg/dL]). All equipment was calibrated per standard hospital policy prior to the start of the study and at specified times. A demographic questionnaire was used to collect gender, age, race, marital status, education level, exercise frequency and duration, smoking status, alcohol consumption, self-monitoring blood glucose habits, and oral antihyperglycemic agent use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721713484812">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The independent variables were treatment group (control, SMA) and time (baseline, 3 months, 1 year). The intervention equivalency to standard of care was assessed by a <italic>t</italic> test of change in primary and secondary outcome measure from baseline to 1-year follow-up. The dependent variables FBG, A1C, WT, BMI, BP, CHOL, TC, LDL, HDL, and TG were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A 1-way analysis of variance with repeated measures for each variable, controlling for age (found significant different between groups at baseline), was performed to compare the change in means between the groups. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Demographic data were reported as frequency and percentage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721713484812" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 301 participants invited to attend, 94 were randomized into the 2 study groups, 80% remained at 3 months, and 69% completed the 1-year assessment (n = 34 SMA, n = 31 control, n = 29 lost to follow-up). The average participant was 58.3 ± 9.6 years, had a BMI of 30.8 ± 4.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese), and had an FBG of 109 ± 9.5 mg/dL. Over half were males (54%), and the majority of the participants were Caucasian (64%). Most participants were married, had a postsecondary education, and were prescribed BP medication but did not self-monitor blood sugar nor use oral antihyperglycemic medications (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713484812">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721713484812">2</xref> for baseline demographics and health outcomes). About 70% of the participants reported exercising, although only 15% met the 150 minutes per week recommendation. Of the 31 control participants, 94% (n = 29) chose to attend both the initial (45-60 min) and follow-up (30 min) individual appointments.</p>

<p>Repeated measures ANOVA of health outcomes, using age as a covariate, from baseline, 3 months, and 1 year follow-up assessed how the groups changed within the group, and paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to assess the difference between the 2 groups. Both groups exhibited significant health outcome improvements over time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721713484812">Table 3</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). However, there were no significant differences following a paired <italic>t</italic> test comparing health outcome between groups (SMA compared to the control), supporting the hypothesis that the SMA group intervention would provide equivalent improvement in health outcomes compared to the current standard of care. The SMA participants lost a mean 6.6 pounds (3.3 kg) at 3 months compared to the 3.6 pound (1.6 kg) weight loss of the control group; neither group met the 5% modest weight lost identified as beneficial for diabetes prevention. Neither group was able to maintain the lost weight; both groups experienced a partial regain by the 1-year follow up.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Impaired glucose tolerance and IFG pose an increased risk for diabetes progression. Therefore, targeting this prediabetes population is critical but can be time-consuming and costly, especially given the magnitude of the problem in the United States. The main focus of prediabetes education and intervention is assisting patients in making changes in their health behavior. Both public health and outpatient care research have explored multiple ways to assist participants in changing health behaviors including a variety of group activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713484812">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713484812">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713484812">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721713484812">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713484812"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713484812"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721713484812">30</xref></sup> The use of SMAs was explored in this nutrition-based study as a creative way to promote behavior change and maximize health care resources, while still providing individualized patient attention and capitalizing on the benefits of group interactions. The study used an innovative SMA group health care intervention with a certified diabetes educator registered dietitian as the provider to target individuals for education and behavior change.</p>
<p>A distinct feature of the SMA compared to the one-on-one appointment is that the SMA is patient-centered with a clear collaboration between patients and the provider team in a group setting. Several researchers have implemented or assessed SMA visits; however, this nutrition-based study is the first to randomize participants between SMA and the usual one-on-one individual appointment with a registered dietitian to look at equivalency in health outcomes.</p>
<p>Sanchez<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713484812">16</xref></sup> implemented SMA visits for diabetes self-management by following the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) performance improvement model and found that SMA visits were more appropriate for those willing to change since those with poor blood sugar control were more likely to neglect follow-up visits. Sanchez reported that the SMA provided a good avenue for self-management education while increasing provider productivity and improving access for individuals in need of acute visits.</p>
<p>Yang and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713484812">7</xref></sup> assessed outcomes of 2853 study participants with prediabetes and found associations with prediabetes and being an older age, nonwhite, male, obese, and physically inactive (fewer than 7% met the 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day). Demographics were similar to this nutrition-based study as participants tended to be older, obese, and physically inactive (15% met the activity recommendations). However, 64% of the sample in this study was Caucasian, and there was nearly an even gender mix.</p>
<p>Almeida et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721713484812">31</xref></sup> conducted 90-minute SMA visits with a tailored action plan for healthy eating, increased physical activity, and focused weight management efforts. Although Almeida et al’s study was not a randomized controlled trial, results showed that participants in the SMA were 1.5 times more likely to lose 5% of their body weight than their matched controls. In the current nutrition-based study, neither SMA nor usual care groups attained 5% body weight loss; however, both groups showed a significant decrease in body weight within groups over time.</p>
<p>The use of SMA visits typically provides a time efficiency factor for both providers and participants (6-8 patients in 90 minutes versus 1 patient in 60 minutes). Researchers have identified additional benefits of SMA sessions, beyond improvements in health outcomes, to include increased patient satisfaction, improved quality of care, decreased number of hospitalizations, and increased productivity, which ultimately enhances patient’s access to care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713484812">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713484812">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713484812"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713484812">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713484812">23</xref></sup> Kirsh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713484812">24</xref></sup> emphasized that the benefit of the SMA transcends beyond just being a multidisciplinary effort, and reflects an interprofessional model because it relinquishes the autonomy of care of the primary care physician by sharing the power among the team members. Watts et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713484812">23</xref></sup> supported the use of a nurse practitioner due to their skills in creating a nurturing environment, promoting patient self-management support, and fostering motivation for lifestyle change and ability to provide care in a holistic patient-centered approach. For this nutrition-based study, a certified diabetes educator registered dietitian provided leadership to the SMA team and was supported by a certified diabetes educator nurse and a behavioral therapist.</p>
<p>Evidence highlighting satisfaction levels with the SMA models has been reported for multiple health issues: satisfaction rates were noted in the 90% range for bariatric and cardiac surgery patients such that 96-97% would recommend a SMA visit to others, 82-91% would or did reschedule another SMA visit, and 92% rated the overall experience as good to excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713484812">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713484812">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713484812">22</xref></sup> Similar to other group studies, the greatest benefit reported regarding coping strategies for self-management came from patient interaction with each other. Patient satisfaction was not officially measured in the current nutrition-based study, except as antidotal positive comments on the variety of benefits noted above.</p>
<p>Harris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713484812">22</xref></sup> defined several lessons learned from SMA implementation to include (1) the need for practice and post-SMA staff debrief to streamline and improve efficiency of the process, (2) the need for an enthusiastic receptionist to promote the group sessions and answer questions to sustain adequate number of SMA attendees for efficient productivity, and (3) the need to monitor health outcomes during SMA visits to enhance patient self-efficacy to sustain positive behavior change. Lessons learned by Ayoub et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713484812">17</xref></sup> regarding SMA visits for osteoporosis detection and treatment included that to improve productivity, a provider would need to see a minimum of 8 patients in 2 hours, not the 3 to 6 initially planned, since they confirmed a 15-minute visit was sufficient for education and risk awareness of osteoporosis unlike other disease states requiring more comprehensive care. Although this literature was not available prior to the start of the authors’ nutrition-based study, rehearsals with volunteer staff were conducted with this nutrition-based study to provide practice measuring outcomes, recording measurements, and identifying the best flow of 6 to 8 participants for time efficiency. These sessions were great learning opportunities for the research staff to hone their skills and discussion points and provided interrater reliability for the study.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study resulted from a high attrition (31%). The power analysis defined the need for a total sample size of 68 (n = 34 each group) to detect statistical significance between the SMA and usual care groups. As with many behavior change interventions, a larger sample size was recruited in anticipation of a significant drop-out rate. Both groups met estimated sample power at the 3-month study midpoint, but the control group dropped to n = 31 by the 1-year study end. The authors acknowledge the risk of obtaining a Type II error when suggesting the SMA is equivalent to the usual care. A Type II error is a false negative and may occur when the researcher does not attain the estimated sample size. It could lead to a false acceptance that there is no significant difference between the groups when in fact there is. In this case, since the SMA health outcomes yielded a greater degree of improvements than the control group, and the authors feel confident that the SMA is at least equivalent to the usual care, even if unable to suggest the SMA is more effective.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Evidence continues to accumulate highlighting the high risk of progression from a diagnosis of prediabetes to diabetes and the significant health burden for individuals and the US health care system, yet there are still limited data available highlighting successful interventions for this prediabetes population. The innovative nutrition-focused intervention used in this study provides a new way to utilize the SMA model with nutrition-led individual focused care combined with group interaction to promote encouragement, feedback, and motivation for change. The SMA intervention increased the provider’s productivity by treating 6 to 8 people with prediabetes in 90 minutes compared to 1 patient in 60 minutes.</p>
<p>As demands on health care providers continue to rise, finding innovative ways to manage the patient load while providing quality health care is increasingly important. SMA visits provide an opportunity to reach out to more individuals in the fight to slow the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Future research should assess if SMA interventions could be effective as a means of primary intervention to reduce the incidence of new prediabetes cases and decrease the advancement to diabetes.</p>
