<abstract>
<p>This study was an examination of the extent to which sixth- and seventh-grade mathematics textbooks incorporated recommended instructional practices for students with learning disabilities to help develop representational ability. Results indicated that the textbooks (a) provided very little explicit instructional information about representations (e.g., how to generate); (b) expected that students use representations to complete math tasks, however, the levels of involvement were varied with a greater number of completed representations being provided rather than student generated representations for solving problems; and (c) provided very little instructional information and support to develop representational ability for teachers of students with disabilities. This was evident in student and teacher materials as well as corresponding supplemental resources designed specifically for students with disabilities.</p>

<p>In mathematics classrooms a core “staple” used by teachers daily to plan and deliver lessons to their students is the textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0731948711429726">Reys, Reys, &amp; Chávez, 2004</xref>). Mathematics curricular materials account for the majority of what drives mathematics instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948711429726">Grouws &amp; Cebulla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711429726">Porter, 1989</xref>). In fact, in some classrooms the only forms of curriculum that exist are textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948711429726">Armbruster &amp; Ostertag, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948711429726">Chandler &amp; Brosnan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711429726">Elsaleh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731948711429726">Remillard, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the extent to which textbooks should be used as the curriculum has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0731948711429726">Sosniak &amp; Stodolsky, 1993</xref>), they clearly are a major source of information and learning for teachers and students alike. For teachers, textbooks have been found to provide three critical features: the sequence of the material presented, suggested content to be taught, and a list of activities and instructional ideas for engaging students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0731948711429726">Reys et al., 2004</xref>). For students, textbooks have been found to be the primary vehicles of knowledge acquisition in school, often replacing teacher discussion and input as the primary source of information in the upper grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948711429726">Garner, 1992</xref>). Given the heavy reliance on textbooks for teachers and students alike, it is essential that the content they contain address and support all learners, in particular learners with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>One important content area that is critical for all students to develop mathematical understanding is representation. The importance of having a strong representational ability or fluency in mathematics, that is, knowledge about representations and facility to use that knowledge appropriately to solve problems, cannot be overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429726">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2000</xref>). First, strong representational ability has been demonstrated as critical for developing mathematical understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429726">Pape &amp; Tchoshanov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0731948711429726">Rittle-Johnson, Siegler, &amp; Alibali, 2001</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429726">Pape and Tchoshanov (2001)</xref> succinctly noted, “the use of representations to develop students’ understanding is related to their ability to operate with the representations” (p. 123). Admittedly, much debate surrounds how the use of representations assists in the process of coming to understand a concept (e.g., the degree to which a learner extracts an idea from a representation such as a diagram, when and how to introduce a representation, best representational format for developing understanding of a concept; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711429726">Ball, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711429726">National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429726">Pape &amp; Tchoshanov, 2001</xref>). However, several studies have found that use of representations can lead to improvement and development of students’ mathematical abilities and understanding (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429726">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, representational ability has been linked as a mechanism for cognitive growth in that if interactions with representations are poor, differential rates of learning and development are to be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0731948711429726">Shafrir, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, content standards for mathematics include an expectation that all students will be able to use representations when doing mathematics. This is particularly evident in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429726">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2000)</xref> Process Standards as they note that all students, prekindergarten through Grade 12, should be able to (a) create and use representations to organize, record, and communicate ideas; (b) select, apply, and translate among representations to solve problems; and (c) model and interpret mathematical ideas (p. 67). These standards are the “mandated drivers” of what is taught and, subsequently, what content should be included in textbooks.</p>
<p>Although various definitions of the term <italic>representation</italic> can be found in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948711429726">Goldin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948711429726">Kaput, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948711429726">Pimm, 1995</xref>), for the purpose of this study a representation itself may be “a combination of something written on paper, something existing in the form of physical objects and a carefully constructed arrangement of idea in one’s mind” (Davis, Young, &amp; McLaughlin, 1982, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0731948711429726">Smith, 2003</xref>, p. 266). Furthermore, a representation refers to both a process and a product, specifically “the act of capturing a mathematical concept or relationship in some form and to the form itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429726">NCTM, 2000</xref>, p. 67). Therefore, although the representation in and of itself is important, one cannot ignore involvement by the creator and the connection between the creator’s ideas and the representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0731948711429726">Smith, 2003</xref>), both of which are important factors for coming to understand the mathematics content presented. Pedagogically, this suggests that not only should students be presented with representations, they must be actively involved in generating and using representations.</p>
<p>A number of different representational systems exist (e.g., mental image, written language, oral language, action movements, symbols; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0731948711429726">Zawojewski &amp; Lesh, 2003</xref>). Although all representational systems are important for developing mathematical understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711429726">Owens &amp; Clements, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429726">Pape &amp; Tchoshanov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731948711429726">Presmeg, 1986</xref>), the focus of this study is specifically on two representation systems, namely, manipulatable or concrete forms (e.g., counters, cuisenaire rods) and image or visually based forms (e.g., tables, diagrams such as a number line, tally marks, charts). Concrete and visual forms are commonly used and recommended for mathematics instruction at all grade levels. However, these forms are also strongly recommended for use with students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429726">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, they have wide and varied applicability across many content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0731948711429726">van Garderen, 2006</xref>) and can be easily located and identified within textbooks.</p>
<sec id="section1-0731948711429726">
<title>Students With Disabilities and Their Representational Ability</title>
<p>Developing an adequate representational ability can be a complex and challenging task, one that many students with disabilities, particularly students with learning disabilities (LD), often struggle to or never develop even by the middle school level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948711429726">Hutchinson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948711429726">Montague, Bos, &amp; Doucette, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711429726">Parmar, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948711429726">van Garderen &amp; Montague, 2003</xref>). In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948711429726">van Garderen and Montague (2003)</xref>, for example, Grade 6 students with LD were found to differ from their typically developing and gifted peers in two major ways when using diagrams to solve novel word problems. First, they typically generated fewer representations when solving word problems than their peers without disabilities. Second, if a representation of the problem was generated, it was often poorer in quality, lacking important relational information needed to understand and, subsequently, to solve the problem. These findings are particularly disconcerting as a connection between poor representational ability and poor word-problem solving performance has been consistently found (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711429726">Hegarty &amp; Kozhevnikov, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948711429726">van Garderen &amp; Montague, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It cannot be assumed that all students with LD achieve adequate levels of representational ability in mathematics. This does not mean that use of representations with students with LD should be avoided. Avoidance would be inadvisable given the importance of representations to develop mathematical understanding. It is interesting that substantial research has demonstrated that the provision of carefully designed, organized, and sequenced instruction involving the use of representations can markedly improve mathematics performance for students with LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429726">Cass, Cates, Smith, &amp; Jackson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429726">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711429726">Miller, Harris, Strawser, Jones, &amp; Mercer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711429726">Miller, Mercer, &amp; Dillon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0731948711429726">Scheuermann, Deshler, &amp; Schumaker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948711429726">van Garderen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0731948711429726">Witzel, Smith, &amp; Brownell, 2001</xref>). Of the many instructional components in that sequenced instruction, two components that are of particular relevance to the current study appear to cut across all the studies: (a) explicit instruction and (b) practice and frequent opportunities to use, consolidate, and master what has been learned. Although definitions of explicit instruction vary, according to the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711429726">NMAP, 2008</xref>, pp. 48–49), explicit instruction typically involves the teacher systematically explaining and demonstrating specific strategies and content procedures within a carefully sequenced progression that highlights the critical features that students are to learn.</p>
<p>Explicit instruction and frequent practice are then two instructional components, which should be regularly applied within textbooks. Textbooks that incorporate explicit instruction would make the instructional content (the “what” of the content) to be learned overt. Specific to developing representational ability, explicit instruction may be evident in the use of models that provide step-by-step examples of how to generate and use representations and clear unambiguous explanations as to what a representation is and how it might be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429726">Carnine, Jitendra, &amp; Silbert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Carnine, &amp; Silbert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Salmento, &amp; Haydt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731948711429726">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>). In addition, textbooks should include sufficient, varied, and relevant opportunities for use and practice to promote skilled application and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731948711429726">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0731948711429726">Woodward &amp; Montague, 2002</xref>). For developing representational ability, this would involve not only exposure to various representations within the content to be learned but also opportunities to generate representations, select among mathematical representations, and apply a representation provided to solve various mathematical tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, &amp; Sczesniak, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0731948711429726">
<title>Mathematics Textbooks and Content Related to Developing Representational Ability</title>
<p>In general, it has been found that textbooks, regardless of instructional perspective, typically do not adequately support learners with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711429726">Bryant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429726">Carnine et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711429726">Jitendra et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429726">Jitendra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731948711429726">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>). Use of key instructional components such as explicit instruction and adequate opportunities for practice are lacking. However, the extent to which textbooks incorporate these components to help students develop representational ability is unclear.</p>
<p>In studies that either entirely or in part focused on representations, the findings are typically more global in nature such as whether representations were included, type and number of representations students are to use, or if the representations were relevant to the mathematics content or were illustrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711429726">Bryant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429726">Carnine et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711429726">Jitendra et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429726">Jitendra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711429726">Mayer, Sims, &amp; Tajika, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0731948711429726">Samimy &amp; Liu, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731948711429726">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>). Findings specific to the use of representations to develop representational ability are much more limited. First, it has been found that textbooks often failed to provide adequate guidance or instructional sequences on how to use representations or make explicit connections between and among representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429726">Carnine et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711429726">Jitendra et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429726">Jitendra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731948711429726">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>). This finding, however, relates primarily to manipulatives. Second, although expectations for students to use manipulatives and/or representations have increased over the past 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711429726">Bryant et al., 2008</xref>), a greater emphasis for student involvement to apply and use representations tends to be restricted primarily to students’ selection among representations provided rather than their own generation of representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to these findings, several limitations need to be noted. First, to date, no study has examined textbooks beyond the elementary school level. It is possible that greater levels of support to develop representational ability may be provided particularly given that the types of representations that students are expected to work with are more complex (e.g., graphs depicting a variety of relationships—linear, quadratic, and exponential growth in algebra). Second, no study has specifically examined the level of explicit instruction provided about representations as opposed to using representations to present mathematics content. As previously noted, it cannot be assumed that all students with LD by the time they have entered middle school have adequately learned to use representations in a flexible and fluent manner thus requiring additional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948711429726">van Garderen &amp; Montague, 2003</xref>). Third, no study has examined the supplemental materials that are often described as containing the resources and recommendations needed to instruct students with special needs. With increasing expectations that all students with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum and state-mandated text programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948711429726">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948711429726">No Child Left Behind Act, 2002</xref>), the need for relevant and effective resources to support their learning becomes ever more important.</p>
<p>Thus, the overall purpose of this study is to determine what information and opportunities for use and practice of representations are provided to both students and teachers within sixth- and seventh-grade mathematics textbooks including supplemental materials to help develop representational ability. The primary focus of this study is to identify and describe what, if any, gaps exist in the textbooks for developing representational ability rather than comparing textbooks against each other to determine which one is necessarily “better than” or the “best.” It is believed that by knowing what the strengths and limitations of a given textbook for developing representational ability are, educators can then enhance or add to their instruction for students with disabilities when and where necessary. Therefore, this study seeks to answer the following questions:</p>

The sources included (a) state published lists of approved textbooks (Texas, Florida, and California), (b) the list of middle school math curricula reviewed by the What Works Clearinghouse (U.S Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences), (c) the list of textbooks examined by the American Association for the Advancement of Science—a Project 2061 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948711429726">2000</xref>), and (d) available curricula at the libraries at two Midwest universities. Textbooks were then organized into two publisher groups: traditionally based and reform based. Reform-based textbooks were identified based on having been developed using National Science Foundation funding. The textbooks were categorized into the two publisher groups to ensure that a representative sample of textbooks reflecting a wide range of perspectives as to how mathematics should be and is currently taught was selected. Overlapping textbooks (i.e., textbooks with the same publisher and content but different titles) were removed and the latest versions available at the time of the study were identified, resulting in textbooks from seven traditionally based and four reform-based publishers. Four textbook series (two traditionally based and two reform based) were randomly selected for each grade. (One textbook that had originally been selected had to be replaced because the latest version was not readily available. Another textbook was then randomly selected.) <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948711429726">Table 1</xref> indicates which textbooks were considered reform- or traditionally based. Textbooks examined at the Grade 6 level were <italic>Saxon Math–5/6</italic> and <italic>6/7</italic> (SAXON; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711429726">Hake &amp; Saxon, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711429726">2004b</xref>), <italic>Mathematics Applications and Concepts–Course 1</italic> (MAC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711429726">Bailey et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Mathematics in Context–Level 1</italic> (MIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711429726">Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 2006</xref>), and <italic>Connected Mathematics 2</italic> (CMP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711429726">Lappan, Fey, Fitzgerald, Friel, &amp; Phillips, 2006</xref>).

<title>Lessons Examined Within Each Textbook</title>
<p>The lessons examined within each textbook (student and corresponding teacher materials) were focused around four (two per grade level) Curriculum Focal Points identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948711429726">NCTM (2006)</xref> as being important mathematics topics specific to each grade level. The focal points were used to determine content to examine for this study. These focal points were selected based on two reasons. First, the content was novel, meaning that the students for the most part have not been introduced to it previously. This content was targeted as it has been strongly recommended that representations be used to help students both learn about and understand mathematical concepts as they are introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711429726">Butler, Miller, Crehan, Babbitt, &amp; Pierce, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711429726">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948711429726">Hudson, Miller, &amp; Butler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0731948711429726">Van de Walle, 2007</xref>). Second, the content was chosen because it presented a progressive sequence of mathematical concepts from one grade to the next and provided an opportunity for students to use graphic representations when solving mathematical problems. The focal points used for Grade 6 textbooks were <italic>Number and Operations</italic> (Focal Point 1): connecting ratio and rate to multiplication and division, and <italic>Algebra</italic> (Focal Point 2): writing, interpreting, and using mathematical expressions and equations. The focal points used in the Grade 7 textbooks were <italic>Number and Operations and Algebra and Geometry</italic> (Focal Point 1): developing an understanding of and applying proportionality, including similarity, and <italic>Number and Operations and Algebra</italic> (Focal Point 2): developing an understanding of operations on all rational numbers and solving linear equations. If a lesson included a section of problems/tasks that involved content outside of the focal point (e.g., “mixed practice problems” from lessons/units previously taught outside of the content scope of this study), that portion of the lesson was not analyzed.</p>
<p>Across all textbooks a total of 168 lessons (592 pages) were analyzed. Of the 168 lessons, 12 were supplemental lessons. Eighty lessons were at the Grade 6 level and 88 at the Grade 7 level. Of the Grade 6 lessons, 51 (63.8%) focused on Focal Point 1, <italic>Number and Operations</italic>, and 29 (36.2%) focused on Focal Point 2, <italic>Algebra</italic>. Of the Grade 7 lessons, 38 (43.2%) focused on Focal Point 1, <italic>Number and Operations and Algebra and Geometry</italic>, and 50 (56.8%) focused on Focal Point 2, <italic>Number and Operations and Algebra</italic>. The number of lessons, supplemental lessons, average number of pages per lesson, and number of lessons by focal points examined for each textbook can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948711429726">Table 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0731948711429726">
<title>Data Coding Criteria and Procedures</title>
<p>Each lesson, including the student text and corresponding teacher materials, was coded independently by either the first or third author of this study and a graduate student on a protocol developed by the first and second authors of this study. To further ensure reliability of data collected, 29.2% (49 out of 168) of all lessons were coded by both coders. The coding criteria used in this study follow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0731948711429726">
<title>Representation Forms in Student Lessons</title>
<p>Two representational forms, concrete and visually based, are the focus of this study. The following concrete and visual representational forms were included as data:</p>
<list id="list2-0731948711429726" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>table or chart in which information is systematically displayed in columns or rows,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>graphs such as line graph, pie graph, histogram, pictogram, and a coordinate plane,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>diagram such as a number line or drawing/photograph that shows the basic shape, layout, or workings of a problem that emphasized relational information, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>physical manipulatives or objects such as counters, 10-frames, Cuisenaire rods, popsicle sticks, and base 10 blocks.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Not included as data were pictures, photographs, or illustrations (e.g., cartoons) that did not address the mathematics content examined.</p>
<p>The number of references to a representational form (image and/or words) on the page were identified and tallied. The following decision rules were used to guide the tally: (a) if the representational form had multiple pieces but contributed to one overall image (e.g., a diagram of three separate cylinders representing barrels but all are a part of a given problem), it was counted as one; (b) if multiple forms are referred to in a given problem (e.g., a diagram and a table for the same problem), each form was counted; (c) when multiple problems referred to one form (e.g., three problems required the use of the same table), it was counted as one; (d) diagrams/pictures of manipulatives received a count of one as a diagram, however, if the students were directed to use it in some manner, it was counted again this time as a manipulative; and (e) representational forms referred to both in word and image were counted as one.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0731948711429726">
<title>Representation Use in Student Lessons</title>
<p>Once identified, each representation was then coded for how it was used: 1 = <italic>instructional</italic> (i.e., a representation that provided information either about a mathematical concept or about a representation itself such as how to generate or use it) and/or 2 = <italic>application</italic> (i.e., requires use of a representation to solve a problem or apply skill being taught for practice). Representation use was tallied for all categories and classifications examined.</p>
<sec id="section9-0731948711429726">
<title>Instructional</title>
<p>If the representation was instructional, it was further analyzed to determine the type of information shared, in particular if it was (a) related to the mathematics content of the lesson or (b) specific to a representation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429726">Figure 1</xref> for examples of instructional representations related to the mathematics content or to the representation itself). Information related to the mathematics content of the lesson included facts (e.g., information to mathematical learning such as population data or an isolated reference to a representation necessary for the content of the lesson), concepts (e.g., mathematical content focused on in the lesson), or processes (e.g., steps to complete a mathematics problem or a worked example related to the mathematical content). Information related to a representation included (a) a definition and/or rationale for use about a representation and/or (b) steps to generate a representation.</p>

<title>Application</title>
<p>If the representation was identified as involving some form of application (e.g., to solve a problem, to find a solution), it was further examined to determine the extent of student involvement for generating the representation to solve the problem. Involvement was determined by the degree of generation of the representation that the student was required to do. Each representation was coded as either being given, partially given (i.e., involved some student input), or student generated. This coding was based on studies conducted by Jitendra and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731948711429726">Figure 2</xref> for examples of representations coded as given, partially given, or student generated applications.</p>

<sec id="section11-0731948711429726">
<title>Instructional Support in Teacher Materials</title>
<p>For each lesson examined, corresponding teacher lesson notes were read to identify (a) instructional information provided about representations and (b) application suggestions highlighted for students with disabilities/struggling learners to support a student’s use of representations to complete mathematical tasks (e.g., solve problems, understand mathematical content). Material noted for “All Learners,” “Individual Needs,” “Struggling Learner,” and “Intervention” and/or students with disabilities (e.g., material noted for “VI [visually impaired],” “PH [physically handicapped],” “LD [learning disabled],” or “Special Needs”) was examined.</p>
<sec id="section12-0731948711429726">
<title>Instructional</title>
<p>If a lesson contained a reference(s) to a definition and/or rationale for using a representation as well as instruction/direction notes that could be used to instruct students as to how to generate and/or use a representation, it was classified as instructional information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0731948711429726">
<title>Application</title>
<p>To determine the type of support that teachers were provided with for helping students apply their knowledge about representations, each reference to a representation that expected some form of application (e.g., solve a problem) was identified and tallied. These references were then categorized into one of the following three areas: (a) “re-representation” of content (i.e., additional task or instruction using a representational form to help students further understand the content presented in the lesson), (b) accommodations (i.e., additional or supplementary devices/equipment/support to complete the <italic>current task</italic> that the student is to complete), and (c) instructional delivery format (i.e., suggestions specifically related to changing or using an additional learning format to complete a task). To ensure rigor of the data analysis, identification and verification of data categorization was completed independently by two of the authors of the study. Once verified, levels of instructional support, for the three categories, were tallied. Note that in some lessons where several suggestions were given (e.g., one accommodation and two re-representation suggestions within one lesson), each was categorized individually and placed in the appropriate category.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0731948711429726">
<title>Interrater Reliability</title>
<p>Two reliability scores were computed for the coding of the lessons: (a) identification of each representational form in the lesson, and (b) whether the representation was instructional or application. Reliability was calculated for each lesson by taking the number of agreements divided by the number of agreements and disagreements multiplied by 100. Across all lessons, the mean interrater agreement for each reference to a representation in a lesson was 88.3% (range = 50–100%). Disagreements for this part of the coding primarily revolved around oversights/missed representations and were resolved by re-counting together for a revised total count. Across all lessons for the use of a representation (instructional vs. application), the interrater agreement was 87.6% (range = 43–100%). Disagreements, primarily related to whether or not a math content representation was stand-alone information or to be use to solve a problem, typically were resolved by coming to a shared consensus on the classification of the representation.</p>

<sec id="section15-0731948711429726" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine Grades 6 and 7 mathematics textbooks to determine (1) the extent to which information about representations was made explicit, (2) the extent to which students had opportunities for use and practice of representations, and (3) the instructional support provided for teachers about or for using representations. Of the 168 lessons (this includes supplemental lessons) examined, 136 (81%) referred to a representation in the lesson whereas 32 (19%) made no reference to a representation. All of the textbooks referred to some form of representation in a majority of the lessons: <italic>Mathematics Applications and Concepts</italic> (100%), <italic>Middle School Math</italic> (96%), <italic>MathScape</italic> (90%), <italic>Mathematics in Context</italic> (86%), <italic>Connected Mathematics 2</italic> (80%), <italic>Holt Middle School Math</italic> (71%), and <italic>Saxon Math</italic> (58%). Within the 12 supplemental lessons identified, only 4 lessons (33%) contained a reference to a representation (HOLT: 75%; SAXON: 8.3%; MAC: 16.4%). Because of the very small number of supplemental lessons that contained a reference to a representation, no separate statistical analyses were conducted; rather, if applicable, percentages for certain aspects of the data were noted for the supplemental lessons.</p>
<p>Each individual lesson contained between 0 and 22 references to representations with the mean number of references to a representation within a lesson of 5.43 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.42) across the 168 lessons. For the supplemental materials (<italic>n</italic> = 12), each lesson contained between 0 and 5 references to a representation, and the mean number of references was 1.17 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.59). The mean number of references to a representation in a lesson varied tremendously across textbooks from MSM with a mean of 9.96 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.89) to SAXON with a mean of 1.81 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.35) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711429726">Table 2</xref> for other textbooks).</p>

<title>Representation Use in Student Lessons</title>
<p>The representations were examined for how they were used (i.e., instructional or application). Overall, the majority of references to representations related to application (75.7%) as opposed to providing instructional information (24.3%). This was also the same for the supplemental lessons, where 71.4% (10 out of 14 references) were application representations and only 28.6% (4 out of 14 references) were instructional representations. Specifically, across the 168 lessons, the mean number of representations within each lesson that was instructional (<italic>M</italic> = 1.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.50) was much smaller than those used for application (<italic>M</italic> = 5.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.79). It is interesting that three textbooks (MS: <italic>M</italic> = 1.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.52; CMP2: <italic>M</italic> = 1.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.55; HOLT: <italic>M</italic> = 1.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.60) had a mean number of instructional representations that was less than 2, whereas one textbook (MIC: <italic>M</italic> = 5.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.47) had a mean greater than 5. With regard to representations used for application, MIC (<italic>M</italic> = 10.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.06) maintained the highest mean whereas SAXON (<italic>M</italic> = 0.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.57) had a mean less than 1. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711429726">Table 2</xref> for a complete breakdown by textbook including means and standard deviations.)</p>

<sec id="section17-0731948711429726">
<title>Instructional Information About Representations Versus Use of Representations for Math Content</title>
<p>A paired samples <italic>t</italic> test was conducted to evaluate whether the instructional information about representations related either to the math content of the lesson in general including facts, concepts, and process or specifically to a representation to help develop representational ability. The results indicated that the mean number of representations within a lesson providing math content (<italic>M</italic> = 1.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.45), although small, was statistically significantly greater than the mean number of representations providing information on representations, <italic>M</italic> = 0.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.27; <italic>t</italic>(167) = 9.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Similarly, statistically significant results were found across all seven textbooks examined when the mean number of representations used to explain math content was compared with the mean number of representations explaining what is or how to create a representation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948711429726">Table 3</xref> for complete breakdown by textbook including means and standard deviations). It is interesting that two textbooks, SAXON and MS, had no instructional information provided about representations themselves or how to generate them. Finally, within the supplemental lessons, all of the instructional references to a representation related to math content alone.</p>

<title>Application of Representations and Student Level of Involvement</title>
<p>Three paired samples <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to evaluate whether there was a difference in the number of lessons that involved the application of representations <italic>given</italic> to the students (<italic>M</italic> = 3.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.54), <italic>generated</italic> (i.e., chosen and created) by the students (<italic>M</italic> = 2.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.13), or <italic>partially given</italic> (i.e., when some portion of a representation was to be completed by the students) (<italic>M</italic> = 0.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.85).

<p>It is interesting that when comparing the means by lesson, five out of the seven textbooks favored giving the students a representation as opposed to having them generate them. The two textbooks that had a higher average of student-generated representations than given per lesson were <italic>Mathematics Application and Concepts</italic> and <italic>MathScape</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731948711429726">Table 4</xref> for details by textbook). When examining the supplemental lessons alone, none of the supplemental lessons required the students to independently generate a representation and 20% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) gave the representation to the students. Thus, the majority of representations in the supplemental lessons were partially given (80%).</p>

<p>To document the instructional information provided about representations within the teacher materials, the number of definitions and/or rationales of representations as well as instruction on the generation or use of a representation within each lesson were recorded.

These definitions were found in two textbooks, CMP2 (2 lessons out of 49, 4.1%) and MIC (1 lesson out of 7, 14.3%). It is surprising that no definitions and/or rationales were provided in the supplemental teacher materials. Seventeen lessons (10.1%) contained some information that teachers could use to instruct students in how to generate a representation. Information as to how to generate a representation was found in five out of the seven textbooks (MAC: 8 lessons out of 24, 33.3%; CMP2: 2 lessons out of 49, 4.1%; MIC: 1 lesson out of 7, 14.3%; HOLT: 2 lessons out of 28, 7.1%; SAXON: 4 lessons out of 26, 15.4%). Only one supplemental lesson (HOLT) provided information related to generating a representation.</p>

<title>Instructional Support for Application of Representations to Complete Math Tasks</title>
<p>Instructional support suggestions connected to application and use of representations for students with disabilities/struggling learners were found in 42 (25%) out of the 168 lessons (including the 12 supplemental lessons). These were found in five of the textbooks examined. <italic>Connected Mathematics 2</italic> and <italic>MathScape</italic> provided no instructional suggestions. Within those 42 lessons, a total of 64 specific instructional suggestions were given. Seventeen (26.6%) were found in the supplemental lessons. The majority of instructional suggestions were in the MSM (<italic>n</italic> = 27) textbook, followed by HOLT (<italic>n</italic> = 18), MIC (<italic>n</italic> = 9), MAC (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and SAXON (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p>
<p>The instructional suggestions were placed in one of three areas. The majority of suggestions, 70% (<italic>n</italic> = 45), related to re-representation of the mathematical content presented using another task or different instruction and a representation. These suggestions were found in four textbooks (MAC <italic>n</italic> = 2, MIC <italic>n</italic> = 7, HOLT <italic>n</italic> = 15, and MSM <italic>n</italic> = 21), with eight of these suggestions coming from the supplemental lessons. Most of the suggestions for re-representation of content revolved around the use of manipulatives such as algebra tiles, counters, cups, pattern blocks, or the use of drawings (93%, <italic>n</italic> = 42). Two suggestions (4%) involved the creation of a record (poster and vocabulary definition) of what was learned. Only one instructional suggestion (2%) was to “think back” to previous work related to a representation as a means of understanding content presented.</p>
<p>Accommodations, that is, the use of additional or supplementary devices/equipment/support to complete the <italic>current task</italic>, was the next largest area of instructional suggestions with 15 (23%) suggestions found in five texts (MAC <italic>n</italic> = 7, SAXON <italic>n</italic> = 1, MIC <italic>n</italic> = 2, HOLT <italic>n</italic> = 1, and MSM <italic>n</italic> = 4). Nine of these suggestions were found in the supplemental lessons. The majority of suggestions (<italic>n</italic> = 8) related to the provision of an additional device such as a chart or number line to complete the task(s). Other suggestions, interestingly all located in the supplemental lessons, were to have another student record the data (<italic>n</italic> = 3), allow more time (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and enlarge the worksheet that contained the representation (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>
<p>Only four suggestions (6%, <italic>n</italic> = 4) related to instructional delivery format to complete a task. Suggestions included to pair students (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or have them work together (<italic>n</italic> = 1). These suggestions were located in two texts: HOLT (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and MSM (<italic>n</italic> = 2). None of these suggestions were found in the supplemental lessons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The percentage of students with learning disabilities receiving 80% or more of their instruction, including mathematics, in the general education classroom continues to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0731948711429726">U.S. Office of Special Education Programs, 2007</xref>). As a result, many students with LD are being exposed to and learning from district-adopted, “general education” textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711429726">Gurganus, 2007</xref>). However, in a survey conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711429726">Maccini and Gagnon (2002)</xref>, a major difficulty that both general and special education teachers had implementing the NCTM standards was a lack of adequate materials. It has also been found that teachers who work with students with disabilities often make few modifications and often do not have the time or expertise to adapt curriculum resources and materials needed to help them learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711429726">Baker &amp; Zigmond, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711429726">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Bishop, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948711429726">Kagan &amp; Tippins, 1991</xref>). It is unfortunate that it has also been determined that many textbooks fail to meet basic criteria known to help support both students with disabilities and teachers who work with these students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>). However, lacking in the research, and the purpose of this study, is an in-depth examination of what instructional support is provided to develop a student’s representational ability. Based on the findings from this study, four main conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>First, examination of the type of explicit instructional information provided about representations revealed that, regardless of textbook, the majority of the instructional representations related to the math content being taught as opposed to helping students develop an understanding of representations. It is not necessarily surprising that more representations were used to present math content, however, what is noteworthy was how little information could be found in the textbooks as it related specifically to representations. Two textbooks (MAC and MS) had no instructional information with the mean number across all textbooks averaged at 0.05 references per lesson. If, as some research seems to suggest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948711429726">van Garderen &amp; Montague, 2003</xref>), many students with LD at the Grade 6 level do not necessarily have a strong representational ability, this rare use of informational representations may be insufficient for helping those students overcome their difficulties.</p>
<p>Second, overall the majority of references in the students’ lessons regardless of textbook were connected to the application of representations as opposed to instructional information about representations. Although this could be construed as being positive in that students had opportunities to use representations, a closer examination of the level of involvement in which students were to use representations reveals a concern related to helping students develop and consolidate their representational ability. For all lessons, the mean number of representations was higher for those given as opposed to having the student generate his or her own representation or complete a partially given representation. Statistically, partially given representations were significantly lower than those given or generated by the students. This finding appears to reflect the findings in studies by Jitendra and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>), where a greater emphasis on students selecting among representations given for solving problems than generating their own representations was also noted.</p>
<p>Even though no research exists as to what level of involvement with representations (e.g., provide completed representations vs. generate their own) best helps students with LD learn to use representations effectively and efficiently to solve problems, based on the findings in this study, two considerations may need to be taken into account. First, a lot of research in special education suggests the importance of scaffolding or carefully sequenced instruction (e.g., Concrete-Representational-Abstract) for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429726">Cass et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711429726">Miller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711429726">Miller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731948711429726">Rosenshine &amp; Meister, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0731948711429726">Witzel et al., 2001</xref>). With this type of instruction, supports are provided to help students move from and integrate prior knowledge to new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711429726">Cole &amp; Washburn-Moses, 2010</xref>). In the current study, limited opportunities to use partially given representations were provided. Yet, these types of representations may be important for helping students move from a given representation to generating their own when solving problems. Second, an important part of mathematics is making sense of what is being learned. One way to do this is to provide students opportunities to come up with their own approach for solving a problem rather than depend on something provided by the teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0731948711429726">Van de Walle, Karp, &amp; Bay-Williams, 2010</xref>). This can also apply to the use of representations. If students are constantly provided with representations that are completely generated to solve problems, a finding supported in this study, it is possible that they may look as though they understand what is going on but in reality are following the steps they are provided and not developing understanding as to how best to solve problems. Furthermore, these representations may be perceived as “answer-getting devices” or products used for one point in time rather than tools to explore, solve, and understand problems critical to coming to make sense of the mathematics content of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429726">Pape &amp; Tchoshanov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0731948711429726">Van de Walle et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, for teachers, instructional information about representations and instructional support for using representations to support student learning was very limited for all textbooks. Instructional information was restricted to only 3 references to a definition and/or rationale and 17 references with information for helping students generate a representation. Furthermore, only 42 lessons out of 168 contained references providing additional instructional support for using representations specifically for students with disabilities or struggling learners. Of the suggestions given, very few addressed how to accommodate and support students with disabilities in their application of representation(s), with a much higher number of instructional suggestions involving the use of another representation to assist students in their understanding of the mathematical content of the lesson. It is interesting that the majority of instructional suggestions tended to be very general in nature (e.g., use a drawing, use algebra tiles), which may be good for most students but not designed to address students with specific needs.</p>
<p>If, as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429726">NCTM (2000)</xref> representation standard notes, “teachers play a significant role in helping students develop meaning for important forms of representation” (p. 284), this limited information, particularly for students with disabilities, could be considered challenging when also considering the limited information provided for students. This places a greater level of responsibility on the teacher. The lack of information to help teachers may hinder them from helping their “middle-grades students develop confidence and competence both in creating their own representations when they are needed to solve a challenging problem and in selecting flexibly and appropriately from an extensive repertoire of conventional representations” (p. 285).</p>
<p>Finally, a unique aspect of this study was the analysis of the supplemental lessons (student and teacher materials). This was done to address a noted limitation in previous textbook studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Deatline-Buchman, et al., 2005</xref>) and to explore a common assumption that these materials contain instructional suggestions and resources designed specifically for students with disabilities. Although the number of supplemental lessons examined was extremely small in number thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn, for the most part the lessons examined did not address the unique instructional needs of students with disabilities. For example, no supplemental lesson for the student or corresponding teacher instructional materials contained any definition or rationale specific to representations, which would provide critical clarification about representations for students with disabilities. Of the 14 representations observed in the supplemental lessons, most were application oriented. However, students were not expected to generate the representation; rather, for a majority of the problems, the representations were partially given. Therefore, if teachers expect to find “answers” in those materials for helping students develop representational ability, the findings from this study suggest that they will be disappointed.</p>
<sec id="section23-0731948711429726">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The findings in this study must be interpreted cautiously given the following limitations. First, the investigation was limited to a select number of available sixth- and seventh-grade textbooks. Furthermore, only a small portion of lessons within each textbook was examined. As a consequence, the rest of the lessons or other textbook series not examined may not support the findings of this study. Second, although supplemental lessons were included in this study, the number examined was small. Given the reliance and expectations that teachers may place on these materials for addressing the needs of students with disabilities, additional research examining a greater number of supplemental lessons is strongly recommended. Third, the definition of representation used in this study was narrowly limited and the “quality” of the activity involving a representation (e.g., whether the representation reinforced conceptual understanding or procedurally based learning) connected to the representation was not examined. For this reason, additional studies focused on other representational forms and/or ways in which representations are presented and used within textbooks are recommended.</p>

<sec id="section24-0731948711429726">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>In mathematics, many students with LD have been found to perform considerably lower than their typically developing peers, often demonstrating very little progress from one year to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711429726">Cawley &amp; Miller, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711429726">Cawley, Parmar, Foley, Salmon, &amp; Roy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711429726">Deshler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0731948711429726">Wirt et al., 2004</xref>). The ability to use representations effectively and efficiently is critical to being able to both do and understand mathematical concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429726">NCTM, 2000</xref>). Therefore, poor representational ability may be one contributing factor to the poor performance of many students with LD in mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948711429726">van Garderen &amp; Montague, 2003</xref>). It is unfortunate that the overall findings of this study suggest that the textbooks examined here may not necessarily provide adequate instructional support, whether information about or opportunities to use representations to solve problems, to help students with disabilities develop representational ability in mathematics. This suggests that additional explicit and focused supplementary instruction beyond what is in the textbook may need to be provided. This extra instruction more than likely will need to focus on helping students understand what a representation is, when and how representations can be used to solve a problem, and how to generate different types of representations for a given task.</p>
<p>It is worth noting at this point that the findings of this study do not necessarily promote the need to include the use of more (e.g., greater number) representations within instruction. More representations will not necessarily help students learn, particularly if they are not used appropriately within instruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429726">Gersten et al. (2009)</xref> strongly recommended expeditious use of representations. For example, an “overemphasis on manipulatives can be counterproductive, because students manipulating only concrete objects may not be learning to do math at an abstract level” (p. 36). Neither do the results of this study suggest the use of multiple forms of representations to teach a concept. It is interesting that there is some evidence to suggest that there may be a need to move away from using multiple representational forms to teach a concept as each representational form requires prior knowledge to correctly interpret it that may interfere with the learning of mathematical content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948711429726">Charoenying, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711429726">NMAP, 2008</xref>). It can be argued, then, that the use of a single representation may be a more valuable tool than having multiple representations presented to understand a concept.</p>
<p>However, the findings of this study support the need for either the continued refinement of existing textbooks or development of additional supporting materials specifically designed to help those students who may have inadequate representational ability. Based on the findings of this study and other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429726">Jitendra, Griffin, et al., 2005</xref>), it is recommended that instructional materials (a) make explicit the different types of representations and their uses for different problem situations, (b) provide rationales and/or definitions for the use of representations, (c) provide guidance on how to generate an effective representation for solving a problem, and (d) include more opportunities for students to generate their own representations to solve various mathematical problems.</p>
