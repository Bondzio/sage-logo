<p>63.1965 AARØE, Lene — <bold>Borgernes følelser over for islam I det offentlige rum: islamofobi eller kontekstbestemt negativitet? (Citizen emotions and Islam in the public space [Denmark]: Islamophobia or context-induced negativity?).</bold> <italic>Política</italic> 44(4), Nov. 2012: 524–543.</p>
<p>The role of religion, and especially Islam, in the public space has become a new conflict issue in public debate. Yet our knowledge of citizens' attitude-formation with respect to the question of Islam and Christianity in the public space in Denmark remains limited. Prior Danish research has mainly focused on the general aversion to Islam. The article extends and nuances this perspective. With data from two survey experiments collected in Denmark, it is demonstrated that affective negativity against Islam is contextual so that the difference in citizens' anxiety and contempt of Muslim as compared to Christian symbols in the dress code in the public space depend on whether the target-group members are private citizens or public representatives.

<p>63.1966 ABNEY, Ronni, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>When does valence matter? Heightened valence effects for governing parties during election campaigns.</bold> <italic>Party Politics</italic> 19(1), Jan. 2013: 61–82.</p>
<p>Empirical election studies conclude that party elites' images with respect to competence, integrity and party unity — attributes that we label character-based valence — affect their electoral support (W. Stone and E. Simas, “Candidate valence and ideological positions in US House elections”, <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic>, 54(2), 2010; 371–388; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 60.7866). We compile observations of media reports pertaining to governing party elites' character-based valence attributes, and we relate the content of these reports to mass support for the governing parties. We present pooled, time-series, analyses of party support and valence-related media reports in six European polities which suggest that these reports exert powerful electoral effects during election campaigns but little effect during off-election periods. This finding, which we label the Election Period Valence Effect, is consistent with previous work concluding that citizens are also more attentive to policy-based considerations and to national economic conditions around the time of elections.

<p>63.1967 ACKERMAN, Gary A.; BALE, Jeffrey M. — <bold>The potential for collaboration between Islamists and Western left-wing extremists: a theoretical and empirical introduction.</bold> <italic>Dynamics of Asymmetric Conflict</italic> 5(3), Nov. 2012: 151–171.</p>
<p>The question of potential leftist-Islamist collaboration is important because if such collaboration were to materialize, Western security agencies could be faced with a new type of terrorist threat. This study identifies the potential strategic and tactical facilitators of such collaboration. While noting the many ideological disparities and antipathies between these two milieus, we also highlight certain ideological pivots around which collaboration between leftists and Islamists might coalesce. Chief among these are a shared hatred for the capitalist “New World Order”, American “imperialism”, Western democratic pluralism, and the state of Israel (if not Jews in general). We then survey the empirical record of such collaboration, finding only 22 cases of leftist-Islamist collaboration or attempted collaboration between 1980 and 2008.

<p>63.1968 AGUILAR FERNÁNDEZ, Susana — <bold>Fighting against the Moral Agenda of Zapatero's socialist government (2004–2011): the Spanish Catholic Church as a political contender.</bold> <italic>Politics and Religion</italic> 5(3), Dec. 2012: 671–694.</p>
<p>Unlike other European churches, the Spanish Catholic Church has acted as a political contender under J. L. [Rodríguez] Zapatero's rule (2004–2011). The new Socialist agenda, with its emphasis on morally-liberal reforms, has triggered a protest in which the church has invested significant resources and helped mobilize the more Conservative quarters of the Catholic society. This adversarial role is distinctive but not unique: the Italian and Polish churches have also opted for confrontational strategies in the face of similar challenges. However, the Spanish case is most relevant because, unlike other predominantly Catholic societies (Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and Poland), it has experienced a most profound and fastest secularization process. Confrontation can then be explained by the supply (a well-endowed Church that enjoys a privileged relationship with a non-confessional state) and not by the demand. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The political triumph of the Islamists in the 2002 elections has greatly impacted the politics and society of Pakistan. For the first time in Pakistan, the Islamists formed a comprehensive political alliance, the Muttahida Majlis-i-Aml (MMA), which comprised all the major religious sects of Islam in Pakistan. The MMA gained substantial electoral victory and subsequently, played an effective role in the Pakistani politics and society. This resulted in the radicalisation of the society as well as the rise of terrorism in Pakistan, as the MMA introduced various Islamisation policies and also patronised militant Jihadi groups. Although, the MMA collapsed a little before the February 2008 elections and faced a political defeat in the elections, the Islamists still play an important role in the Pakistani politics and society.

<p>The July 2011 parliamentary elections in Thailand were significant because they ushered politics away from street demonstrations and into the polling booth. Just about a year after the worst political violence in Bangkok since the 1992 Black May incident, these elections confirmed the dominance of Thaksin Shinawatra-aligned parties and the prominence of social movements in engaging the electoral process. Notable were the Red Shirts who moved from street battle to electoral contestation in supporting Phua Thai and the Yellow Shirts who campaigned against politicians and political parties. No election in Thai history has had such a high degree of social mobilization as that of the 2011 polls. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the redress-centered campaigning activities of the Khulumani Support Group, a South African victim advocacy organization that has cultivated a specific form of agency through its demands for victim reparations. The article explores the efforts of this organization in a manner that pays attention to specific understandings of the power to act enabled by a Foucaultian perspective. More specifically, the article follows in the steps of recent scholarship emphasizing the productive or “positive” dimensions of governmentality taking root in all areas of life and identifiable in the activities of social movements, grassroots organizations and other related groups.

<p>63.1972 AKTAY, Yasin — <bold>The “ends” of Islamism: rethinking the meaning of Islam and the political.</bold> <italic>Insight Turkey</italic> 15(1), Winter 2013: 111–125.</p>
<p>There have been almost regular attempts to declare the “end of Islamism” or “the end of political Islam”. Since the late 1980s, many observers have been quick to pronounce the end of Islamism with every new political development concerning the Muslim world. In countries where authoritarian regimes repressed the Islamists with massive bloody operations, it was claimed that Islamism was ending. However, it was rather the Islamists' defeat by oppressive means as opposed to an end. In a way, proponents of the “end” discourses welcomed the dictators' supremacy over the Islamists. Thus the celebration of the “end of Islamism” represented an acknowledgement of authoritarian, antidemocratic regimes in the Islamic world. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2651]</p>
<p>63.1973 ALCÁNTARA SÁEZ, Manuel — <bold>Partidos políticos en América Latina: hacia una profesionalización de calidad (Political parties in Latin America: towards a professionalization of quality).</bold> <italic>Elecciones</italic> 10, Jan.-Dec. 2010: 11–32.</p>
<p>The article points out the need to assess the professional nature of political activity. The first part addresses the issue of parties in Latin American politics. The second part expounds the professionalization of politics. The third part surveys the quality of politicians. A core component of the quality of democracy is thus linked to the relevance of political parties and to the importance that should be given to the professional nature of their activity.

<p>63.1974 ALLERN, Elin Haugsgjerd — <bold>The contemporary relationship of “new left” and “new right” parties with interest groups: exceptional or mainstream? The case of Norway's socialist left and Progress Party.</bold> <italic>Scandinavian Political Studies</italic> 36(1), March 2013: 67–90.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the new green and left parties that were established in Western Europe during or after the 1960s tend to be characterized by informal but significant links with social movement organizations. In contrast, weak links or virtual lack of such connections is often seen as one of the enduring characteristics of the new populist (radical) right parties. However, there are both empirical and theoretical reasons for examining these conventional wisdom(s) more closely. Examining Norway's successful new left and populist right party, this case study reveals that the socialist left has even closer and more wide-ranging relationships with interest groups than traditionally suggested and that the Progress Party enjoys organized contact with various interest groups.

<p>63.1975 ALLISON, Michael E.; ALVAREZ, Alberto Martín — <bold>Unity and disunity in the [El Salvador] FMLN [Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front].</bold> <italic>Latin American Politics and Society</italic> 54(4), Winter 2012: 89–118.</p>
<p>Problems of unity can affect an armed opposition group at many stages of its existence: during the war, in peace negotiations, and in its transition to political party. This article assesses how internal divisions affected the performance of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador. While the FMLN suffered significant internal divisions in the early years of the war, it remained remarkably unified from 1983 on. Significant divisions appeared later but were not exacerbated until after the war's conclusion, when repeated fracturing occurred. The FMLN began to present itself as a programmatically coherent party only in 2005, and this ideological homogeneity allowed it to establish a series of partnerships with moderate, non-revolutionary sectors of Salvadoran society and to achieve victory in the 2009 presidential elections.

<p>This article analyzes the impact that two terrorism-related matters had on Spanish politics and electoral processes in the country. First, the terrorist attacks perpetrated by jihadists in March 2004, three days before Spain's general election, caused a state of shock, brought the election campaign to a sudden end, and led to the defeat of the party in power. Second, the article analyzes the negotiations entered into with the ETA terrorist organization by the new government during its first term, from 2004 to 2008. Both the Madrid attacks and the negotiations with ETA were responsible for the breakdown of the consensus in regard to terrorism that had existed among the main Spanish political parties. Both events generated an unprecedented level of polarization and tension among political parties and society from 2004 to 2008. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1560]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the dynamics of action of the Syrian National Council (SNC), the main platform of opposition to the regime of Bashar al-Assad since the start of the uprising on 15 March 2011. It describes the Council's relations with local coordinating committees, the Free Syrian Army and independent personalities. It seeks to answer the question whether the Council will be capable to bring together the different sectors of a heterogeneous opposition around a common agenda and to lay the foundations of a civil, plural and democratic state. Despite the creation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the Political Program of the SNC remains valid and could serve as a roadmap for post-Assad's Syria.

<p>63.1978 ANAN, Deniz — <bold>Repräsentations- und Entscheidungskulturen im Vergleich: die Parteitage von FDP und Grünen (Representational cultures and cultures of decisionmaking in comparison. The party conventions of the [German] FDP [Liberal party] and the Greens).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für Parlamentsfragen</italic> 43(4), 2012: 799–815.</p>
<p>The parties in Germany seem to resemble each other more and more in organizational matters. However, an analysis of the charters and the participant observation of the conventions of the FDP and the Greens show that significant differences persist. These differences are related to both the representational cultures and the cultures of decision-making and can be traced back to the different origins and self-concepts. The FDP's roots as a “Honoratiorenpartei” (party of notables) are thus reflected in the dominance of parliamentarians and the perception of the office of a delegate and a board member as an honorary post. In addition, intraparty elections are based on the classical liberal idea of representative democracy. However, with the Greens, where board members and delegates receive money, subdivisions have extensive rights to submit motions and to call meetings, and even the smallest district section is represented at the federal party convention. Furthermore, the self-concept as an antiparty party and the ideal of grassroots democracy continue to have an effect. On the other hand both parties feature partly astonishing similarities, ranging from meetings on weekends to the irrelevance of direct democratic decision-making procedures. [R]</p>

<p>After 30 years of economic reforms, what is the comparative situation of men and women in China? How can we analyze the policies for promoting gender equality? Have inequalities that existed in Mao's China disappeared? Or have factors such as the liberalization of the labor market and the single-child policy merely shifted the boundaries of such inequalities and even created others? This article looks at the ways in which the equality issue is dealt with, both by the government and by the All China Women's Federation and feminist organizations. It shows which inequalities are prioritized and what has been the state's place in contemporary Chinese feminism. [R] [Part of a thematic issue, “Chinese women: becoming half the sky?”.

<p>We analyze the effects of redistricting on the electoral fortunes of incumbent legislators, using voting data on US congressional districts, state legislative districts, and statewide races. We find little evidence that redistricting helps incumbents in US legislative elections. If anything, redrawing district lines reduces the average vote margin of those in districted offices compared with offices that are not districted, reduces electoral security, and increases turnover in the legislature.

<p>63.1982 ARRIOLA, Leonardo R. — <bold>Protesting and policing in a multiethnic authoritarian state: evidence from Ethiopia.</bold> <italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 45(2), Jan. 2013: 147–168.</p>
<p>The antigovernment protests that erupted in one ethnic region of Ethiopia can be attributed to the group's historical grievances or to its access to mobilizing resources. However, conventional explanations are insufficient in accounting for protest patterns in terms of their geographic distribution or varying levels of violence. The likelihood of protest onset was inversely related to local heterogeneity, intra-ethnic as well as interethnic. Protest violence spiraled through the interaction between ethnic homogeneity and the government's policing strategy. Woundings were less likely to occur in localities where protesters were repressed by police forces staffed by their own co-ethnics. [R]</p>
<p>63.1983 ARTES, Joaquín — <bold>Do Spanish politicians keep their promises?</bold> <italic>Party Politics</italic> 19(1), Jan. 2013: 143–158.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the fulfillment of economic pledges contained in the electoral manifestos of the two main Spanish parties, PP and PSOE, during the four electoral cycles that took place between 1989 and 2004. Consistent with previous research on program fulfillment, we find that most promises are fulfilled by the party in government. In addition, we find much lower fulfillment rates for the parties in opposition. Surprisingly, we find no significant differences in fulfillment when the governing party enjoys absolute majority compared to minority governments. This is unexpected because coalition and minority governments constrain the capacity of the winning parties compared to absolute majority governments. [R]</p>
<p>63.1984 ATKINS, Judi; FINLAYSON, Alan — <bold>“… A 40-year-old black man made the point to me”: everyday knowledge and the performance of leadership in contemporary British politics.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61(1), March 2013: 161–177.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the application of rhetorical political analysis in the study of political communication and political ideas and ideologies. Taking the rhetorical use of anecdotes as a case study, we find that their use by mainstream party leaders in Britain has proliferated markedly since the mid-1990s. Drawing on examples from speeches by leaders of all three main parties, we show how these stories are employed as a form of argumentative proof that relies significantly on the elevation of “everyday” experience and knowledge above expert or technical knowledge. We argue that this reflects a more general “valorization of lay knowledge” and, moreover, that it is indicative of a form of populist ideology. [R]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>In Russia and Ukraine, the structure of government parties — United Russia and Party of Regions — reflects political trends in these countries. Comparing the two sheds light on the divergent trajectories of Russia and Ukraine since 1991. Although some similarities still exist, specifically the role of businessmen in the parliamentary groups formed by these parties, other interest groups (such as the police) also carry weight. A network analysis helps us identify, through the connections of MPs with outside social structures, the complex means used by these two parties to wield power and distribute resources. [R]</p>
<p>63.1986 BAFUMI, Joseph, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Alvin Greene? Who? How did he win the United States [Democratic] Senate nomination in South Carolina?</bold> <italic>Election Law Journal</italic> 11(4), 2012: 358–379.</p>
<p>A. Greene surprised the political world when he handily defeated V. Rawl for the US Senate nomination in the 2010 Democratic primary in South Carolina. Greene had not run a campaign during the primary and appears to have been almost completely unknown prior to his victory. Greene's win over Rawl, who had served eight years in the South Carolina House, was previously a circuit judge, and had in fact run a legitimate primary campaign, raised a variety of questions about how Greene could have managed to generate so much voter support. In light of lingering concerns that Greene's victory was due to malfeasance of some sort, we analyze both ballot-level and precinct-level voting data with an eye toward determining whether the 2010 Democratic Senate Primary in South Carolina appears problematic.

<p>Numerous studies indicate that civil society organizations create cultural change by deploying mainstream messages that resonate with prevailing discursive themes. Yet these case studies of highly influential organizations obscure the much larger population that have little or no impact. It is therefore unclear whether civil society organizations create cultural change by deploying mainstream discourses or if they become part of the mainstream because of their success. I present an evolutionary theory of how discursive fields settle after major historical ruptures that highlights framing, social networks, and emotional energy. To illustrate this theory, I use plagiarism-detection software to compare 1,084 press releases about Muslims produced by 120 civil society organizations to 50,407 newspaper articles and television transcripts produced between 2001 and 2008.

<p>This article addresses the growing concern about the EU's “democratic deficit” resulting from the expansion of the EU's competences. It [considers] whether the development of genuine Europarties competing in a European party system could be sufficient to promote and assure democratic government at EU level. It discusses [how] integrated parties and party systems operate in “normal” democracies and perform functions conducive to a correct functioning of the political system. It then examines the current state of affairs at EU level, by assessing the nature and character of Europarties as well as whether a genuine European party system exists in the Euro-arenas in which parties are expected to compete. Finally, the paper analyzes the potential impact of the political and institutional changes induced by and surrounding the Lisbon Treaty on Europarties and their system. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1989 BARTELS, Brandon L.; JOHNSTON, Christopher D. — <bold>On the ideological foundations of Supreme Court legitimacy in the American public.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 57(1), Jan. 2013: 184–199.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom says that individuals' ideological preferences do not influence Supreme Court legitimacy orientations. Most work is based on the assumption that the contemporary Court is objectively conservative in its policy-making, meaning that ideological disagreement should come from liberals and agreement from conservatives. Our nuanced look at the Court's policy-making suggests rational bases for perceiving the Court's contemporary policy-making as conservative, moderate, and even liberal. We argue that subjective ideological disagreement — incongruence between one's ideological preferences and one's perception of the Court's ideological tenor — must be accounted for when explaining legitimacy. Analysis of a national survey shows that subjective ideological disagreement exhibits a potent, deleterious impact on legitimacy. Ideology exhibits sensible connections to legitimacy depending on how people perceive the Court's ideological tenor. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article analyzes popular support for the introduction of a two-tier (dualist) welfare system, and focuses on the interplay between public opinion and party competition. It uses survey data from Denmark and Norway: two similar welfare states where elite politics on migration and welfare dualism has been markedly different over the last decade. It finds that the level and structure of popular support for welfare dualism are fairly similar in the two countries, but that attitudes toward dualism have a stronger impact on left-right voting in Denmark where the politics of welfare dualism has been actively advocated by the populist right party and pursued by a right-wing coalition government.

<p>This article revisits our forecast of the 2012 French presidential election. Although our forecast was generally accurate in seeing the return of the left to the presidency, its point estimate error proved to be large (9.2 points). This article suggests that this forecast error may come from a wrong choice of dependent variable. New empirical tests of our French “proxy model” of forecasting indicate that the dependent variable to use should continue to be total left vote-share, but measured on the second ballot rather than the first.

<p>The authors analyze the response of the Mexican labor movement to democratization and its consequences for labor policies, providing a contribution to the comparative politics debate on the role of labor unionism in democratic change. The system that governs the state-labor relationship, a legacy of Mexico's authoritarian past, helps to explain the calculations made by labor union leaders and government officials regarding the country's democratic transition. This article analyzes the changes in the political representation of labor unions and the electoral behavior of unionized workers, together with the successive failures of proposed reforms in labor law since 2000 and their implications for the labor movement and Mexican society.

<p>In recent years the ANC government has encountered increasing unrest in the form of a wave of community protests and industrial action. Some analysts argue that this reflects widespread antipathy towards the ANC's “exhausted nationalism” and the beginnings of a post-nationalist political era where class politics takes centre stage. This article examines the position of South Africa's powerful organized working class within this context, with reference to the attitudes of ordinary members of the National Union of Mineworkers. Rather than seeing ANC nationalism as a spent force, it highlights the more enduring nature of the ANC's nationalist appeal, which, while not making the party infallible, nonetheless restricts the potential for a new left-wing politics to emerge that can challenge ANC hegemony.

<p>This paper examines the processes of class-formation being augmented by South Africa's democratic transition and the impacts these processes are having on trade union organizing. Through a case-study of the National Union of Mineworkers in the energy industry, it argues that affirmative action and employment equity policies are opening up divisions within the union and eroding its unifying class identity. This poses a great challenge, not only to trade union organization, but also to how we understand the political role of South Africa's trade unions within the post-apartheid era. [R]</p>

<p>We predict that party labels influence attitudes when they provide unexpected in formation. We predict that party labels will increase support for the relevant policy when attached to unexpected policies and will have no effect when attached to policies already associated with the party. Party labels operate as hypothesized by prior work, increasing support among identifiers of the party endorsing the policy and decreasing support among members of the opposite party, when there are no expectations about the party's position on the policy. In a series of three experiments, we find empirical support for each these predictions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Working comparatively, this article analyzes the strategies employed by French trade unions at the time of two major sequences of interprofessional strikes and demonstrations that took place in 2009 and 2010. It analyzes how these social mobilizations took place in a juridical context that had been fundamentally changed by new rules governing representativeness and social dialogue. It also compares what happened in France with mobilizations elsewhere in Europe where multiple social actors, not only unions, grappled with the impact of the crisis. This comparative perspective allows us to question certain commonplace understandings regarding French trade unionism, such as its “structural weakness” and its “culture of protest”.

<p>The degree of psychological engagement in political campaigns is a key factor influencing participation in US elections. Unfortunately, no resources exist that offer comparable over time survey measures of campaign engagement in the electorate. Results from a diverse array of US public opinion surveys administered from 1952 through 2010 are used to explore trends about interest in elections, attention to campaigns, and enthusiasm for the candidates. Trends are examined both over the course of a single campaign and across election cycles. [R]</p>

<p>We argue that Hamas's formation of a party was a logical step, following nearly two decades of participation in local and municipal elections. Hamas's need to attract resources from external donors, who make funding decisions based on civilian support for the movement, best explains why Hamas decided to participate in local elections in the early 1990s, taking Hamas on a path that eventually led to its 2006 legislative victory. Hamas's foray into elections was consistent with its dual strategy of directing violence against Israel and building Palestinian support through welfare services. We demonstrate that changes in political opportunities (Fatah's decline and the increase in Hamas's popularity), institutional incentives (lax electoral laws and the holding of municipal elections), and the rise of moderate voices within Hamas explain the timing of its entry into legislative elections.

<p>Do voters at Danish municipal elections punish and reward the incumbent party for changing the tax rate? We examine the relationship between changes in the tax rate and the support for the incumbent party in the period 1985–2001 and find a strong relationship between income taxes and electoral support. Property tax does not seem to matter, however. The effect of changes in income taxes seems to be most pronounced close to elections, while changes occurring during the first years of an electoral term seem to have only marginal influence. Finally, no relationship is found between changes in taxes in neighboring municipalities and support to the incumbent, though incumbent parties in municipalities with a low absolute tax rate compared to the surrounding municipalities seem to perform relatively well at elections.

<p>Proponents of direct democracy contend that it increases political knowledge, but limited evidence supports this assertion over a single election. Previous studies, however, do not account for the heterogeneous effects of each proposition and employ political knowledge scales that insufficiently rely on information directly related to political campaigns. I address these limitations by looking at the issue content of each ballot measure and using the 2006 and 2008 Cooperative [US] Congressional Election Studies (CCES), which contain numerous voting-relevant and policy-oriented questions from which to construct an improved measurement of actual campaign learning. Although I find no effect attributable to the total number of measures on the ballot, those addressing social issues, because they are well known, highly salient, and tap into existing social cleavages, do exhibit the hypothesized effect on political knowledge.

<p>The paper examines the intergroup-contact hypothesis in a multilevel analysis of 21 countries.

This paper confirms the findings of many single-country studies that intergroup contact increases tolerance toward European immigrants. This paper also tests whether intergroup friendship and perceived symbolic threat mediate the effect of workplace contact on out-group tolerance. Statistical analyses confirm that friendship and perceived symbolic threat account almost fully for the effect of workplace contact. In the final section, the paper discusses some of the major critiques of intergroup-contact research. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2182]</p>

<p>Policy debates on strategies to end extremist violence frequently cite poverty as a root cause of support for the perpetrating groups. There is little evidence to support this contention, particularly in the Pakistani case. Pakistan's urban poor are more exposed to the negative externalities of militant violence and may in fact be less supportive of the groups. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a 6,000-person, nationally representative survey of Pakistanis that measured affect toward four militant organizations. By applying a novel measurement strategy, we mitigate the item non-response and social desirability biases that plagued previous studies due to the sensitive nature of militancy. Contrary to expectations, poor Pakistanis, particularly those in violent districts, dislike militants more than middle-class citizens, suggesting that exposure to terrorist attacks reduces support for militants.

<p>This study tests hypotheses regarding the distribution of beliefs and knowledge about [US] health care reform. The “belief gap hypothesis” suggests that in an era of political polarization, self-identification as a Democrat or Republican would be a better predictor of knowledge and beliefs about politically contested issues than would one's educational level.

<p>As internet use continues to become integrated into the daily lives of average Americans, it becomes necessary to understand the implications of each aspect of that use.

This study considers one such social network site, <italic>Facebook</italic>, and how engaging in specific behaviors that provide personalized information, create community engagement, and generate social capital within that realm impacted users' decision to participate politically in the presidential primary of 2008.

<p>What beliefs do citizens who perceive levels of corruption in their countries to be of significance hold? Do those beliefs arise from their exposure to corruption? Furthermore, do perceptual and experiential corruption decrease the reservoir of legitimacy of a democratic regime? We attempt to answer these questions using the 2012 Americas Barometer survey of 24 Latin American countries. We find that whereas “rational-choice corruptors”, males and, to a lesser extent, individuals with resources are particularly exposed to corruption, perceived corruption originates from a sense of impunity derived from a negative evaluation of the state's ability to curb corruption.

<p>The normative framework of liberal cosmopolitanism provides guiding principles for the organization of a global order and the treatment of foreigners. It proposes a set of human rights, among them the right to free movement. However, state sovereignty and territorial control remain important in reality. We are interested in the way liberal states organize and exercise control over mobility. Do they increasingly adhere to principles such as transparency, impartiality and equal treatment? Are there some means to appeal against negative decisions regarding access? We analyze the visa policies of three well-established democracies — the US, Austria and Finland — with regard to short-term travel. We find some discrepancy between cosmopolitan principles and real political practices. There is a growing rift between those who enjoy extended mobility rights and those who do not.

<p>European elections have provided Euroskeptic parties with an opportunity to get parliamentary representation. While there is a burgeoning literature on the Euroskeptic stances of these parties, there remains relatively little research on their strategies once inside the EP. This article analyzes how Euroskeptic MEPs from the “untidy right” conceive and carry out their representative mandate in an institution they despise. First, it takes an historical perspective to show that despite the persistence of Euroskepticism in the EU's elected chamber, the body of research remains comparatively limited. Second, it examines the institutional constraints faced by Euroskeptic representatives resulting from the institutional environment and the ideological heterogeneity of these actors. The final part proposes a typology of parliamentary roles to account for their attitudes and behaviors inside the chamber. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2246]</p>

<p>By means of a analysis of newspapers in ten countries, this article analyzes the nature of the electoral campaigns for the June 2009 European elections. It assesses the “second-order” character of these campaigns and the degree of Europeanization of the national public spheres. Although these campaigns remained dominated by national actors and themes, “Europe” was not totally absent. The Europeanization of the public sphere remains however limited: the analysis reveals that few references were made to EU issues and to other member states. The supranational actors were hardly involved; the campaigns lacked substantive debates. [R]</p>

<p>The presidential election of 2012 produced a high turn-out. Only 20 percent of the electorate abstained. This significant mobilization, however, hides renewed social inequalities in political participation that seemed to have previously disappeared. Based on national and local data surveys, this paper shows that certain kinds of people are less likely to vote than the average citizen. While traditionally more prone to abstain than other voters, many young, poorly educated, and suburban people participated in the presidential election in 2007, but not in 2012. In this later case, they seem to have not been interested in the electoral campaign. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2256]</p>

A set of logistic regression models is estimated to predict the propensity to overreport using indicators of extensive and intensive commitments to a political identity. Models are tested using vote verification data from five years of the American National Election Studies (1978, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1990). Identity commitments are strongly predictive of overreporting and conventional understandings of social desirability fail to predict overreporting.

<p>Do institutions of citizenship shape public opinion among Muslims in the West? Pitched debates about the future of multiculturalism give strong theoretical reason to think that institutions would cause cross-national variation in minority opinion. Institutions set rules for national integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social views of diversity. Testing these theorized links, however, requires two steps: (1) careful conceptualization of citizenship, both in individual and communal dimensions, categorizes states' citizenship regimes. (2) Unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in France, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US permits analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What purpose do elections serve in authoritarian states? Scholars often describe these elections as “safety valves” to contain opposition groups. Though we often use this safety valve terminology, it remains an abstract concept without sufficient empirical testing. In a study of the 2009 local elections in Morocco, I show how this safety-valve process played out in real politics. This article [argues] that the Moroccan regime undertook activities in an effort to weaken the Justice and Development Party (PJD), an Islamist opposition party. I delineate [how] regime elites manipulated electoral rules and formal institutions, especially loyalist political parties, in an attempt to undermine the Islamists' power between 2007 and 2010. Arab Spring unrest turned back many of these efforts, empowering the PJD to secure a sweeping victory in the 2011 parliamentary elections. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1560]</p>

<p>Although national politics and policies strongly influence how cooperatives function, cooperative organizations and advisors increasingly envision cooperatives as primarily economic organizations and avoid direct political engagement and social mobilization. We discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt-forgiveness law for small farmers. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local decision-making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities.

<p>We deal with the relationship between ETA attacks and electoral support for Batasuna, its political wing. On the one hand, when ETA chooses a location for its attacks, it takes into account the electoral strength of Batasuna. Our results show that the higher the vote for Batasuna in a municipality, the more likely members of the security forces will be killed there. With regard to the targeting of civilians, the relationship is curvilinear. ETA kills civilians in municipalities that are polarized, where support for Batasuna falls short of being hegemonic. On the other hand, our results also show that ETA attacks have an effect on the size of its support community. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1560]</p>

<p>This article examines the degree to which President Obama's public positions are congruent with mass opinion, and compares his position-taking behavior with that of recent administrations. We consider the impact of congressional agenda setting and the electoral cycle on the degree of congruence between Obama's positions and public opinion. Additionally, we investigate whether positions that were only marginally popular early in the term have retained support. The findings indicate that Obama's presidency resembles other recent administrations in terms of policy congruence. First, blame-game politics between the president and opposition party have significantly reduced policy congruence. Second, for recurring issues, electoral proximity appears to be correlated with higher congruence. Finally, as in other recent administrations, the overall level of responsiveness is not significantly greater than one would expect by chance.

<p>The internet offers opportunities for political mobilization that parties are under-exploiting. Drawing on the rational-choice approach to party behavior, this paper builds an argument for why this is the case. If parties are not using new media to mobilize support, it is because the benefits of using it are uncertain while there are very certain costs — communicational and organizational — involved in the decision. I also argue that party characteristics shape incentives to use the internet for political mobilization and hence help to account for observed differences in party behavior online. Using evidence from parties in Spain and Catalonia, the study finds that parties that are large, in opposition, non-programmatic, and non-bureaucratic tend to have greater incentives to use the internet for political mobilization, both because they expect to get the largest benefits and to pay the minimum costs from online mobilization.

<p>This article analyzes the impact of restructuring processes on the organizational structure and lobbying strategies of women's movement organizations (WMOs) in Belgium (Flanders) and the UK (Scotland). We argue that devolution/federalization and the resultant creation of new, intermediary levels of governance offers a devolution/federalism advantage to WMOs. Multilevel governance multiplies access points, allowing for accumulation of funds, limited forms of venue shopping, and avoidance of veto-players. Nevertheless, a set of push and pull factors draws WMOs towards the regional level thereby “abandoning the center”. These changes are driven by centrifugal dynamics that characterize the processes of devolution and federalization in these cases. In the long run, these may erase the devolution/federalism advantage, and also pose questions about statewide women's citizenship and gender solidarity. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1649]</p>

<p>Literature on party factions has investigated the elements that affect factionalism, and particularly the elements that affect the number of factions. Scholars' hypotheses have never been systematically tested. Building on those hypotheses, this work analyzes the determinants of the number of factions in Italian parties from 1946 to 2010. Thanks to a new dataset th at allows the estimation of policy positions of factions through a quantitative text-analysis of motions presented during party congresses, this paper investigates the effects of intra-party polarization as well as the impact of internal rules and the characteristics of party system. The results show that proportional intra-party rules, availability of resources and internal polarization increase the degree of factionalism. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Past research has shown that internet use for news leads to increased political participation levels, both offline and online. Other forms of digital and user-generated media such as blogs have also yielded similar results. However, little is known about podcast users and their role within democratic societies. This article outlines findings from an online survey conducted in the United States that lend support to the notion that podcast use for news leads to political participation, even when controlling for the effects of other media forms. This article also identifies demographic predictors for those who are likely to be podcast users. [R]</p>

<p>This article argues that fusion balloting, or the ability of multiple parties to nominate a single candidate for office, can be viewed as a candidate-centered and incumbent-oriented reform. Using the recent passage of fusion legislation in Oregon [US] in 2009 and its subsequent use in 2010 state legislative elections as a test case, I study the factors behind supporting fusion legislation in both chambers of the state legislature and how these same factors affected, or did not affect, the incumbents that received cross-nominations in the 2010 elections. Overall, I find that party did not play a direct role in determining which legislators supported fusion. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2076]</p>

<p>This article investigates the relationship between religion and the attitude toward direct democracy for the case of Taiwan, an East Asian country where most people are affiliated with Buddhism, Taoism, and folk religions. Unlike Western countries dominated by Judeo-Christianity, some arguments indicate that value systems emphasizing collectivities, social cohesion, and obedience to authorities in East Asian countries are inconsistent with the fundamental value of democratic norms based on individual rights and self-determination. If this is the case, then social and cultural factors are incompatible to democratic development in East Asian societies. Nevertheless, this argument has not been adequately supported by empirical studies. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Which theoretical paradigm should we use to discuss the relationship between the state and civil society in Russia? Academic literature distinguishes two principal approaches to this problem: the East European political tradition, which treats the state and civil society in antagonistic terms; and the West European and Anglo-American strand, which focuses on co-operation between the two entities. A nuanced study of modern Russia indicates that there are areas of successful state-civil society co-operation, as well as intense struggles between the two entities for political and cultural hegemony. Thus, both of these approaches are reasonable, and one should not be deployed at the expense of the other. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2185]</p>

<p>This article argues that the government delivery of distributive aid increases the incumbent party's turnout but decreases opposition-party turnout. The theoretical intuition here is that an incumbent who delivers distributive benefits to the opposing party's voters partially mitigates these voters' ideological opposition to the incumbent, hence weakening their motivation to turn out and oust the incumbent. Analysis of individual-level data on FEMA hurricane disaster aid awards in Florida [US], linked with voter-turnout records from the 2002 (pre-hurricane) and 2004 (post-hurricane) elections, corroborates these predictions. Furthermore, the timing of the FEMA aid-delivery determines its effect [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why is there no large-scale labor movement out of intense labor conflicts in current China? Based on a comparative case study of two groups of workers — state workers vs. temporary workers — this paper explores the concrete processes and mechanisms of workers' struggles: how they navigated amon g street protests, office petitions and court prosecutions through their interaction with state agencies. The argument is that different workers obtained different symbolic rewards instead of material concessions, based on their different social positions and historical trajectories. Unlike the classical “fragmentation” argument which attributes the working class's inaction to its internal divisions, this argument focuses on the interaction between the differentiated workers and the local state agents.

<p>[The author argues] that the immigrants' political participation and protest need to be studied by emphasizing the characteristics of the political context in which they settle. This context is made of a number of strands that cut across the national and local levels, referring to the role of (1) political opportunities in general, impacting upon the behavior of all individuals, (2) field opportunities in terms of individual and group rights, and (3) discourse. We show that the overall participation of immigrants varies considerably across different cities as does their involvement in protest activities. Lastly, we assess the extent to which different types of political opportunities play a key role for explaining political participation of immigrants vis-à-vis the role of other micro- and meso-level variables.

<p>This paper [examines] four paradoxes. (1) China's aggressiveness in initiating the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis set off a series of contretemps that almost certainly made the achievement of Beijing's objectives considerably harder. (2) The polarization in Taiwan over national identity and cross-Strait relations that [recently] erupted was surprising, both because the partisan cleavage on these issues had noticeably de-escalated during the 1990s and because public opinion on them has always been decidedly unpolarized. (3) Despite strident DPP criticism that Ma Ying-jeou has threatened Taiwan by increasing its economic dependency upon the PRC, the huge surge in Taiwan's trade and investment with China this century actually occurred during the administration of this DPP predecessor, Chen Shui-bian. (4) The rapprochement between Taiwan and China after Ma's election in 2008 may not presage long-term stability in cross-Strait relations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article analyzes F.

It argues that an effective campaign, an unpopular adversary and a French party system context unusually conducive to pooling the Left's electoral resources akin to 1981 all aided Hollande's cause. Despite limited ideological renewal, Hollande's internal party coalition promised a scaled-up reformism in the areas of finance, redistributive taxation and ambitious “reindustrialization” policies. However, the Eurozone crisis and degraded French public finances will hinder prospects for such growth-oriented political economic change. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2137]</p>

<p>Overcoming the limits of the New Labour project requires both a re-examination of its strengths and weaknesses relative to those of Old Labour, and a serious reflection on the content of the Miliband-Poulantzas debate that established the international reputation of the present leader's father. From both sources, it is clear that this generation of Labour leaders needs to turn party policy deliberately leftwards again, and to engage in a progressive hegemonic campaign in support of that shift prior to the next election. For only if Labour returns to office with an electoral base mobilized to support a fundamental resetting of power can the party ever hope to escape the “dull logic of Labourism” so criticized by R. Miliband and his academic followers. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2202]</p>

<p>This article examines the patterns of party policy in Anglo-American and Western European countries on three dimensions of left/right disagreement: wealth redistribution, social morality and immigration. The central questions are whether, and why, parties with left-wing or right-wing positions on the economy systematically adopt left-wing or right-wing positions on immigration and social morality. I argue that left/right disagreement is asymmetrical: leftists and rightists derive from different sources, and thus structure in different ways, their opinions about policy. Drawing on evidence from K. Benoit and M. Laver's survey [<italic>Party Policy in Modern Democracies</italic>, Milton Park: 2006] of experts about the policy positions of political parties, the results of the empirical analysis indicate that party policy on the economic, social and immigration dimensions are bound together by parties on the left, but not by parties on the right.

<p>Some political scientists have argued that “countrymindedness”, a set of tenets about the importance of agriculture and rural life, is of decreasing political and social importance. To test this, we conducted an exploratory survey of attitudes to rural industries and people. The results reveal that there are some differences in attitudes according to age, location, country of birth and voting intention, which fit with the “decline of countrymindedness” thesis. However, there is still a tendency to attribute stereotypical countryminded characteristics to rural people, strong support for farmers' production methods, and very strong belief in the importance of agriculture to the future of the nation. Most surprisingly, there is quite strong support for providing more government assistance to agriculture, at odds with the market liberalism of the last 30 years. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article proposes a framework based on three levels of analysis for understanding the 2012 presidential election: the institutional, the partisan and the situational. The 2012 election confirmed the bipolar institutional incentives that structure political competition in the Fifth Republic. The partisan dimension, however, was more fluid than this bipolar reading would lead one to expect. The situational dimensional was highly relevant in terms of the overarching crisis and the loss of trust in N. Sarkozy. The poor quality of fit between underlying partisan choice and political representation does not augur well for a broad-based response to the crisis. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2137]</p>

<p>In the 2012 legislative elections, eleven new deputies were elected representing newly created constituencies for the French expatriate community. The Right-wing <italic>Union pour un Mouvement Populaire</italic> (UMP) that initiated this legislation expected to create a clutch of safe seats for its own party, because expatriate voters have, since extra-territorial voting was introduced in 1981, always given massive support to the Right. Yet, although this trend was maintained for the presidential election, the outcome was unexpectedly reversed for the legislative elections, when only three of the eleven new seats were won by the UMP.

<p>This article sheds light on the magnitude of the phenomenon of legislative voting defections and offering some possible explanations for these defections. Drawing on an original dataset spanning over three legislative terms (13th, 14th, and 15th), the results of this study suggest that the traditional image of Italian politics dominated by strong party organizations overwhelming the individual components of representation is to a large extent still valid, at least in the field of legislative voting. This does not mean that parties are able to perfectly control the parliamentary activity of their members. On the contrary, defections from the official party line are present in Italy as in other parliamentary democracies and here too they are driven by the structure of opportunities in which elected representatives operate.

<p>We consider the relationship between economic interests and immigration preferences by examining how developments in individuals' sectors of employment affect these views. Using survey data across European countries from 2002 to 2009 and employing new measures of industry-level exposure to immigration, we find that sectoral economies shape opinions about immigration. Individuals employed in growing sectors are more likely to support immigration than are those employed in shrinking sectors. Moreover, the economic context matters: we show that sector-level inflows of immigrant workers have little effect on preferences when economies are expanding, but that they dampen support for immigration when economic conditions deteriorate and confidence in the economy declines. When evaluating immigration policy, individuals thus appear to take into account whether their sector of employment benefits economically from immigration. [R, abr.]</p>

The weak and fragile state has not proved up to the expectation of women, creating a developmental gap filled by NGOs.

A re-examination of debates around socialist humanism within the early New Left yields three main arguments.

Second, that the distinctive contribution of thinkers associated with Universities and <italic>Left Review</italic> amounted to an alternative conception of socialist humanism deserving greater recognition.

<p>Next to their well-documented authoritarian cultural agenda, new-rightist populist parties have developed specific views on the welfare state: welfare chauvinism and welfare populism. This article studies the electoral relevance of these views for Dutch new-rightist populist parties by means of survey data representative of the Dutch population (N = 1972). The electorate of those parties shows high levels of both welfare chauvinism and welfare populism. However, only welfare populism underlies support for new-rightist populist parties in addition to well-known cultural motives. Based on these findings, ideological and electoral competition between political parties is discussed, and suggestions for further research are provided. [R]</p>

<p>Coalition governments are the norm in the German multilevel-system. Their existence not only affects the political process and policy-making, but also increases the complexity of voting: the behavior of voters at the polls is not only based on the evaluation of the parties, but also influenced by their opinion on the coalitions that the parties could form after the election. But we still know little about the determinants of voters' coalition preferences. We combine theories of voting behavior, government-formation and policy-learning to derive expectations regarding factors that may impact voters' coalition preferences. We assume that voters adopt the patterns of party competition and anticipate how realistic individual coalitions are — given the existing patterns of government formation. We test our hypotheses by analyzing survey data from 78 election studies from the German state level. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The impact of voters' gender on leader evaluations in parliamentary systems has been largely unexplored, while the impact of female leaders on voter attitudes and preferences remains to be fully established. This paper uses J.

The authors also examine whether Gillard's high-profile candidacy affected women's levels of political interest, awareness and engagement in what had been largely a “man's game”. Their findings confirm that Gillard enjoyed a gender-affinity effect in 2010 in terms of both leader evaluations and vote choice, and women's political engagement was significantly affected by the Gillard candidacy.

<p>This article traces the roots of ideas currently influencing the Labour party relating to the role of the state in Britain's political economy, exploring [how] such ideas have entered contemporary debate and continue to shape the party's agenda. Subsequent sections explore diverse interpretations of New Labour, the economic legacy of the T. Blair and G. Brown governments, the re-imagining of British political economy undertaken by Labour under E. Miliband's leadership, and the interlinking “progressive dilemmas” that have so far emerged. The article suggests that the ambitious rediscovery of interventionism will be realizable only if Labour confronts historical dilemmas relating to the structure and efficacy of the British state. Such a confrontation requires serious engagement between the doctrines of British social democracy and the overlapping and interlinking narratives of liberal political thought.

<p>Scholars need reliable and valid survey measures of the extent to which people have been exposed to various kinds of political content in mass media. Nonetheless, good measures of media exposure, and of exposure to political television in particular, have proven elusive. Increasingly fragmented audiences for political television have only made this problem more severe. We propose a new way of measuring exposure to political television and evaluate its reliability and predictive validity using three waves of nationally representative panel data collected during the 2008 [US] presidential campaign. We find that people can reliably report the specific television programs they watch regularly, and that these measures predict change over time in knowledge of candidate issue positions, a much higher standard of predictive validity than any other measure has met to date.

<p>This article identifies and describes the relationship between the divisions of party system and social structure in Turkey from a historical-institutional perspective by applying the operational logic of cleavage theory to the Turkish case. Turkey has a distinct historical legacy, resulting in the emergence of some significant cleavages. The paper displays the reflection of these societal cleavages and reveals that not all cleavages are directly reflected in the Turkish party system. Thus, a Turkish party system is the institutionalizing of a complex arrangement of alliances between significant societal cleavages, which can also change. Generally speaking, socio-historical approaches like the cleavage theory are appropriate to explain party system developments in non-European regions. [R]</p>

<p>From 1981 to today, diffuse support for democratic principles has remained stable with high scores, whereas support for specific forms of democracy has been much lower and largely dependent on the year considered. On the basis of the four waves of the French European Values Study data (1981–2008), this article investigates the influence of different political factors on attachment or support for democracy by testing three different hypotheses: (1) the level and the type of politicization affects opinions on democracy; (2) high expectations of democracy negatively affect specific support for democracy; (3) the “losers' consent” effect means that political opposition to the government turns into dissatisfaction with democracy but does not affect support for general democratic principles. Our results partly confirm the first two hypotheses. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This investigation is about how Chinese overseas online commentators (COOCs) respond to political discourses on China. COOCs present the ideological heterogeneity of Chinese overseas. Their diverse responses to different ideological debates show patterns that manifest how the Chinese diaspora enact their positional cultural identification. The analysis of the data shows that on both sides of the divide, the debate leads commentators to assume positions of attachment to, or detachment from, their Chinese cultural affiliations not in a set of binary oppositions but as a continuum with varying degrees. Along this division line, internal fragmentation can be further identified by different views of China's external tension with other world powers. The notable internal complexity can arguably represent the nation's maturation. [R]</p>

<p>European and global affairs are typically downplayed at election time in France, as elsewhere, and a rudimentary observation of the French 2012 presidential elections would appear to confirm this hypothesis. However, this article argues that in the case of the 2012 French elections the issues of “Europe” and “the world” were significant and inextricably linked to many of the ostensibly domestic campaign issues raised by candidates, media and voters. With reference to the campaigns, the broader electoral contexts and the results, the analysis of this apparent paradox suggests how global forces both shaped the 2012 domestic contest in France and constitute a broader picture in which France has been deemed by some commentators to be a “flawed democracy”.

<p>For decades, scholars have debated the role of corporations in American politics. To date, th ey have relied on either interviews or publicly disclosed spending and lobbying reports. This article presents new methods and data that enable us to consider the internal processes of corporate political attention instead. Aided by automated content-analysis, this article uses more than 250,000 internal e-mails from Enron to observe its political attention between 1999 and 2002. These e-mails depict Enron's employees as focused on monitoring and formally participating in political processes, including bureaucratic processes. Only a small fraction of their political attention focused on elections. [R]</p>

<p>The article examines if and, if so, why and how political parties opposing the EU have thrived. It looks at the role of national parliaments and nation al media in failing to engage convincingly with the European dimension of politics, and asks why the forces of European federalism have been so relatively ineffective. By analyzing the tensions between national and European political parties especially in the conduct of elections to the EP, the article traces the rise of the nationalist forces within the EP and assesses their impact on the legislative and other work of the institution. It proposes measures to tackle the nationalist challenge to European unification, including more differentiated forms of integration, more direct democracy, the development of federal political parties and the constitutional settlement of a federal union.

<p>The focus of this article is to understand the determinants of negative, positive, or neutral tone in campaign news coverage.

The findings presented herein suggest that corporate, chain, and nonlocal ownership all have consequences for campaign news tone. [R]</p>

<p>The AK Party [Justice and Development party] seeks to respond to four challenges stemming from three confrontations (Islamism, Kemalism, and regional balance of power) that are intertwined and intensely interactive: The potential radicalization of Islamist movements through new sectarian polarization, the extension of the Kurdish Question regionally and internationally, the struggle for greater influence among regional powers, and the repercussions of Israel's aggressive policies. The discourse of civilization that Prime Minister R.

<p>Does the local organizational presence of anti-immigrant parties affect their chances for electoral success? The article explores the potential of a supply-oriented explanation to anti-immigrant party success by examining the electoral advancements the Sweden Democrats (SD) made in the 2006 and 2010 elections. Our results indicate that traditional demand-side explanations to anti-immigrant party success can be successfully complemented by an “internal supply-side argument” to make the electoral fates of these parties more intelligible. Whether the SD had a local organizational presence had a substantial effect on its results in the national election and on the probability of gaining representation in local councils. Thus, the party's fate in the national as well as local elections was largely determined by whether or not it had a local organizational presence in Swedish municipalities. [R]</p>

<p>There is strong agreement among experts on Russian society and politics that protests in defense of abstract, general rights do not appeal to most citizens. This article focuses on groups using protest tactics that have been more successful in gaining support, such as the Defenders of the Khimki Forest. The evidence presented suggests that Russians are more likely to take part in protests by an organized group if it seeks remedies for concrete problems that directly affect them and their families. The appeal to felt needs that are grounded in everyday experiences also seems to be an important factor that helps a group to evoke a favorable response toward its actions among broad circles of the general public.

Using data from the 2009 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we explore the ways in which individual-level sociability affects political engagement in a range of activities, including online political discussions. We find sociability levels affected some activities more than others. [R, abr.]</p>

Although empirically accurate in 2012, there are a number of unknowns in the model's likely fortunes for future elections, in particular, whether the “Marine effect” observable in 2012 will translate into core party support, and the extent to which a party “normalization” strategy will affect its 2017 performance.

<p>Using digital text-analysis methods, we analyze over 3800 newspaper articles covering US Supreme Court judicial appointments between 1981 and 2009 to measure the level of (in)congruence between the Court's agenda and the issues emphasized by the media. We find that newspapers highlight “culture war” issues at the expense of other important issues addressed much more frequently by the Court. Moreover, abortion in particular receives attention in more articles and in much greater depth than any other issue. With a few minor deviations, these patterns are consistent across nominations. These findings raise normative concerns regarding the didactic function of the print media in American democracy and shed empirical light on positive theories of media behavior. [R]</p>

<p>The article presents a comparative and theoretical discussion of Berlusconi's experience with the personalization of politics. That experience is located in the context of the technological transformations that emerged in political communication and electoral mobilization in Europe and the US, transformations that fostered a highly personalized political process. Leaders, not parties, have become the main actors in electoral politics, particularly in Italy, where Berlusconi has been the promoter and beneficiary of those transformations. Such personalization has met formidable obstacles while moving from the electoral to the governmental level in both Europe and the US. It was less so, however, in Italy during Berlusconi's premierships, due to the latter's personal control of his party and parliamentary majority. Under the pressure of the market and the European institutions, Berlusconi finally had to resign. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Around the world, publics confronted with terrorism have debated whether Islamic faith gives rise to a uniquely virulent strain of non-state violence targeted at civilians. These discussions almost always conceive of “Islam” in general terms, not clearly defining what is meant by Islamic religious faith. We engaged this debate by designing and conducting a large-scale public opinion survey in Pakistan that measures multiple elements of religiosity, allowing us to separately consider the relationship between support for militant organizations and (1) religious practice; (2) support for political Islam; and (3) “jihadism”, which we define as a particular textual interpretation common to Islamist groups espousing violent political action.

<p>Classical economic voting theory becomes complicated when applied to second-order elections, because there are two incumbents (national and local) and two economies (national and local). Under these conditions, attribution of responsibility, and therefore, the target of economic sanction, appears unclear. We argue that, at least in unitary states, economic responsibility for local conditions is attributed to the national (rather than the local) incumbent. The implication is that, when the local incumbent and the national incumbent are of the same party, the local incumbent loses votes under bad economic conditions. In contrast, when the local incumbent and the national incumbent are of different parties, the local incumbent gains votes under bad economic conditions. These propositions are tested against a large regional election data-set from France. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Nation-building and encouraging a sense of national identity and political community pose an immense challenge in Papua New Guinea (PNG). With over 830 languages, it is one of the most linguistically and ethnically diverse countries in the world. Since independence in 1975, PNG has experienced high levels of political instability with frequent changes of government and allegations of corruption. Local and traditional obligations to extended family and language groups frequently supersede allegiances to the nation-state. This paper examines the attitudes of tertiary students from the University of PNG to national identity and key issues of nation-building. These students are highly likely to feature strongly among the next generation of leaders. Findings highlight the importance of family, religion and maintaining traditional customs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article argues that ideational and institutionalist approaches to the study of policy continuity and change should be complemented by research into political ideologies, exploring an “intermediate” public sphere in which there is extensive intra-ideological dispute. Ideational change takes place in the context of disputes rooted in ideological tradition, involving the rearrangement of concepts, the emphasizing of some and the marginalization of others. Presently, that debate is marked by what may be thought of, heuristically, as “Keynesian”, “Polanyian”, “Schumpeterian” and “Schumacherian” points of reference. Assessing the likelihood of this debate developing into a coherent “crisis narrative”, I show that the development of the relationship between these poles will be decisive but at present they stumble over the conceptualization of “equality” and “the state”.

<p>Existing studies of Euroskepticism have almost exclusively focused on examining political parties and, as a result, theoretical approaches to understanding opposition to European integration have been strongly influenced by the party-based literature. By drawing from the body of work on both party-based Euroskepticism and European civil society, this article formulates a series of hypotheses and applies them to the case studies of Ireland, the UK and Denmark. Its main conclusion is that civil-society-based Euroskepticism generally conforms to the hard/soft model of opposition to the EU, but that this Euroskepticism is drawn from a more mainstream societal base than its party equivalent. Additionally, it argues that civil-society-based Euroskepticism can be interpreted as a form of grass-roots civic engagement with the EU that mobilizes mainly around the salience of EU-related referendums.

<p>The belief that elected officials are most responsive to the opinions of the wealthiest members of society is often assumed but has only recently begun to be tested. This paper examines a common explanation for why this disparity in political representation occurs: wealthy citizens vote at much higher rates than citizens with low incomes. Utilizing variation across states in voter-turnout levels among the rich and poor, there is little evidence that increased voting among citizens with low incomes improves representation of their political opinions in the Senate. These findings cast doubt on the proposition that increased voter turnout among the poor is an avenue for promoting greater political equality in the US.

<p>This article argues that Spain has been the driving external force in the advancement of LGBT rights in Latin America, from marriage in Argentina to the regional recognition of “sexual diversity rights” as human rights. Acting as “norm entrepreneurs”, Spanish activists and organizations, relying on development aid, have promoted their perspectives through two approaches: strategic consulting and resource transfer. Their diffusion is illustrated primarily by the Argentine case. There, activists have borrowed Spanish strategies to achieve “the same rights with the same names”. Besides broadening our understanding of the struggle for LGBT equality in Latin America, this article deepens the explanation of norm-diffusion, focusing on emergence. In this stage, specific individuals and organizations deliberately select appropriate “targets” for and moments of intervention. But norm “receptors” must also be ready for action. [R]</p>

<p>Political parties in Australia and the UK have begun to experiment with primary elections, similar to those in the US, to select candidates for public office.

I identify the key characteristics of these trials (such as the selectorate, method and turnout), the actors involved in the process and their motivations for advocating change. I adopt a three-level approach, showing that reform is driven by factors at the level of individual parties, party systems and by elite perceptions of changes at the level of the political system.

<p>Discipline and cohesiveness of political parties are essential for legislatures to engage in policy-making. Parties in Brazil have historically been considered ideologically weak and uninvolved in policy issues of national importance. Analyses of roll-call votes, however, have shown that parties can be disciplined government supporters. This paper tests the claim that Brazilian parties have also become programmatic actors in their own right. It uses statutory delegation content to test whether voting discipline translates into greater influence on the substance of legislation. The data-analysis shows that party unity among parties of the government coalition does not affect statutory content. Opposition parties, by contrast, are more likely to reduce the executive's discretion when they are more unified. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study is a critical analysis of the Romani Opening in Turkey that was initiated by the government in the late 2009 as a project aiming to end discrimination against Roma in Turkey. Although this is a very important move considering the long-lasting ignorance of the problems of Roma in Turkey, there are important problems related with the presentation of the project and discussions revolving around it. As an outcome of these problems, this project has become a case where one can observe how antidiscrimination initiatives/strategies/policies can be discriminatory in their implementation. This study also argues that this paradoxical situation can be figured out only by reflection on the notion of power. A reflection on power, in turn, will necessarily lead to a re-thinking on democracy. [R]</p>

Taiwan's cross-Strait policies will continue to focus on economics and delay political negotiations.

We assess the stability of a variety of personality measures and find high correlations between the pre- and post-election measures. We also leverage the fact that Republicans made substantial gains in Congress in the 2010 election to determine whether various personality measures are affected by the intersection of partisan attachments and political events and find little evidence that they are. The findings provide encouraging evidence for those interested in examining the relationship between personality and political attitudes using survey data. [R]</p>

Novel items added to a nationally representative [US] survey show that 25 per cent of respondents report not believing their ballot choices are kept secret and over 70 per cent report sharing their vote choices with others. These findings suggest that standard models of candidate choice should account for the potential effects of doubts about ballot secrecy. Consistent with this view, regression analysis shows that social forces appear to have a greater effect on vote choices among people who doubt the formal secrecy of the ballot. This analysis supports the broader claim that the intended benefits of institutional rules may not be realized if people's perceptions of these rules differ from their formal characteristics.

Throughout the campaign, innumerable images of Obama and his family contradicted negative racial stereotypes and changed the balance of black exemplars in mass media in a positive direction, thus causing reductions in prejudice among political television viewers. Exposure to Obama caused the largest reductions in prejudice among J. McCain supporters, Republicans, and conservatives. [R, abr.]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>“Chavista” populism, facing resistance to the principle of unicity of the social and the political it promotes, has drifted towards electoral authoritarianism, reflecting the contradiction between its pretension to hegemony and the diversity required by pluralist systems. This authoritarianism is directed toward the opposition, perceived as “the enemy”, but also toward “friends”, that is, Chavismo's own allies. These practices intend to diminish diversity without quite achieving it, keeping the tensions alive amidst an electoral campaign and the doubts about the president's fitness to govern.

<p>Photographs of international events influence the understanding viewers develop of the world. Emphasis on specific aspects of an event means other prominent aspects are overlooked. This study examines the visual framing in photographs related to Iran's 2009 presidential election, comparing images photographers identified as their best work to those judged to be the Pictures of the Year. The analysis shows that while photographers primarily covered events leading up to the election and the violence that followed afterwards, they communicated a variety of frames through their images. The award-winning photographs, which set a standard for photojournalists, mainly depicted violent events, ignoring the civil participation of a wide range of Iranian citizens. [R]</p>

<p>Whereas catch-all parties have dominated the battle for popular support ever since the Federal Republic's foundation, recently a trend has set in for them being replaced by new party types seek as cartel parties, parties of career politicians, of civil servants, of parties in parliament or electoral-professional parties. This leads to the question, whether the constitutional conceptions of how parties work and what their role is as “transmission belt” between the people's will and the government's decision-making are still able to keep up with the new reality of party-democracy. This can hardly be affirmed for the parties' “constitutional mandate” of fulfilling intermediation and linkage functions; and especially the regulations on the financing of political parties do unveil strong evidence for legal revisions in this context.

<p>In the most widely cited result on the turnout effects of voting by mail, P. Southwell and J. Burchett report that Oregon's system increased turnout by 10 percentage points. We attempt to replicate this finding and extend the analysis to additional years to test whether the originally reported effect is due to the novelty of the first three voting-by-mail [US] elections in 1995 and 1996. We are unable to reproduce earlier findings, either via replication or extending the time series to include 2010 electoral data. We find evidence for a novelty effect when all elections between 1960 and 2010 are included in our analysis, and a consistent impact of voting by mail on turnout only in special elections. [R]</p>

<p>We analyze the role of cable news in the rise of the Tea Party during the current “crisis of neoliberalism” — a moment of political-economic volatility brought about by the Great Recession. We argue that the Tea Party's political purpose is to hold together the New Right coalition of business elites and white working- and middle-class Americans that undergirds the neoliberal political project. In the context of a deregulated corporate mass media, we show that both “right-wing” and “moderate” cable networks mainstreamed the Tea Party by framing it as a legitimate social movement, enabling the widespread projection of right-wing populist discourse in support of neoliberalism. We suggest that democratizing the mass media is crucial for a sustained progressive political response in the US. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2152]</p>

<p>This article empirically tests how determinants of public support in Poland for the EU change before and after accession. Despite studies on public attitudes towards EU integration and Euroskepticism that flourished in the run-up to accession, there is no evidence of how determinants changed over time. This study suggests that in Poland citizens support the EU on the basis of a form of “unconditional support” and general benefits for the country before accession, while personal benefits can become more determinant after accession.

<p>As tax policy is one of the most prominent issues for France at a time of great economic crisis and public debt, this article analyzes how redistribution has been viewed and considered by voters. Assuming three main hypotheses about attitudes towards redistribution (egotropic perspective, sociotropic perspective and voter incompetence), we propose a series of empirical tests of these various explanations from a cross-sectional survey fielded after the election. Despite a rather low salience of this issue during the campaign, we show that voters demonstrate quite coherent attitudes in this area. Preferences for redistribution are linked to individuals' socio-economic positions, to their beliefs about the effects of taxation, and lead to consistent vote decisions in 2012.

<p>We examine whether people in the Netherlands are consistently tolerant towards culturally different immigrant groups, using data of a representative national survey of 1998. Tolerance is defined as respecting the choices of others, even those one finds personally undesirable or objectionable. Between 40 and 50 percent of the Dutch population [are] tolerant and their tolerance is remarkably consistent. They are not prejudiced, do not distance themselves from immigrants, and grant them equal rights. They endorse individual freedom and resist attempts to close the national ranks against immigrants. In almost all these respects tolerant people differ from intolerant people, with the exception of one factor: the tolerant are skeptical of the immigrants' true political loyalty to the Netherlands.

<p>How does the democratic nature of India's political system affects its external policies? I analyze whether public opinion can make a difference in regard of Indian-American relations, the Kashmir-conflict and Indian climate-change policies. Three factors can lead decision-makers to consider public opinion before taking foreign policy decisions: (1) unambiguous preferences of the public, (2) a substantial elite dissent and (3) highly salient issues. My analysis of public opinion surveys shows that the first criterion is met in all three cases. A significant elite dissent, however, exists only as far as Indian-American relations are concerned. The main reason why public opinion is of only limited importance for Indian foreign policy is the low salience of foreign policy issues in the media and during electoral campaigns. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While three North African dictators have fallen victim to popular anger (Ben Ali, Mubarak, and Qaddafi), the overthrow of Mubarak was the most significant.

At the same time, the West's response to these dramatic events has been uncertain and inconsistent, reflecting a wider ambivalence about the impact of the Arab Spring on Western policies and interests in the region.

<p>Examining [US] congressional superdelegate endorsements in the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, the authors show that changes in the political context affected the balance of factors in members' decisions to endorse H. Clinton or B. Obama. Specifically, the national standing of the candidates became increasingly important — and local opinion less important — to Obama endorsements even as constituency views became a stronger influence over Clinton endorsements. The findings reveal how constituency considerations affect the elite endorsement choices that shape the presidential nominating process. In addition, the analysis highlights the ways in which members of Congress balance conflicting considerations in a changing political context when an issue plays out over an extended period. [R]</p>

<p>I focus on the forcible detention of company managers, placing industrial sequestration in the context of the pattern of collective negotiation processes in France, and comparing it with previous cycles of the same phenomenon, particularly in the post-1968 period. I argue that the current cycle of sequestrations needs to be understood as a response to the deterritorialization processes of neo-liberal globalization, and is the product of asymmetries of power between the fixity of labor and the fluidity of global capital. I argue that sequestration is a public melodrama of protest which might point to the development of a resistant politics of corporeality in France, in common with struggles in other social and economic sectors.

<p>We examine the political and personal effects of disaster volunteerism with participants of the New Orleans Rebirth Movement (NORM) using four waves of pre- and postsurveys and qualitative analysis of participant journals. Significant increases are found in internal political efficacy, desire to be active in politics, and value placed on social justice issues, but disaster volunteerism also dramatically increases cynicism and emotional distress. Nearly every NORM participant in the study experienced emotional stress, and 1-in-5 self-medicated as a coping strategy upon one's return. Disaster volunteerism holds the potential to rapidly accelerate social justice consciousness and activism, even among those already inclined to be active, but the cost is high. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>After the reunification of West and East Germany, West German laws, lawyers and judges almost completely replaced the East German legal system, giving rise to a unique situation in which “old laws” governed “new citizens”. Are West German laws and legal institutions incompatible with the socialist values of East Germans? Or do East Germans judge legal institutions based on their performance? Using three surveys from the 1990s and 2000s, this article shows support for both cultural and performance approaches to institutional trust, but suggests that the impact of cultural factors may have declined over time. Improved economic and political performance in the 2000s, moreover, has led levels of trust in the East to reach nearly the same levels as in the West. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Political alternate positions (otherwise known as substitutes) can have important effects on women's abilities to enter politics.

By examining patterns of women's representation as candidates in the 1996, 2001, and 2006 elections for the National Assembly and as elected office-holders (as both alternates for those assembly members and title-holders), the article analyzes how various political parties are utilizing these alternate positions. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, this study finds no evidence that these alternate positions are used to undermine women's political progress. [R]</p>

<p>Recent literature has shown that the long-established link between economic performance and electoral outcomes is conditioned by a country's institutions and government, what is often termed “clarity of responsibility”. In this article two distinct dimensions of the clarity of the political context are identified: institutional and government clarity. The first captures the formal dispersion of government power, both horizontally and vertically. The second captures the cohesion of the incumbent government. Analyzing survey data from 27 European countries, it is shown that voters' ability to hold governments to account, for both the economy and management of public services, is primarily influenced by the extent to which there is an identifiable and cohesive incumbent, whereas formal institutional rules have no direct impact on performance voting.

<p>Standard theories about elections in Africa suggest that they are little more than ethnic headcounts. Data from an exit poll conducted on Election Day in Ghana's 2008 election challenges this view. The two main parties, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP), drew support from many ethnic groups; and there was little evidence of ethnic block voting. Rather, voters' beliefs about the parties and incumbent performance were the main determinants of vote choice. Evaluations of the attributes of the NDC and NPP shaped the outcome of Ghana's 2008 election far more than the ethnic identity of the candidates. These results hold important implications for understanding voting, parties, and government performance in multiethnic democracies. [R]</p>

<p>While it is sometimes characterized as a dominant party, South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) has failed to demonstrate consistent dominance in provincial and municipal elections.

At the local and municipal levels, The ability of the ANC to frame this inseparability is hobbled by more policy-oriented frames as well as the institutional character of South Africa's constituent-legislator relationships.

In particular, we describe the impact of combining discussions about presidential debates with a festival format to see what impact the form had in student civic engagement. We conclude that a festival format contributes greatly to the success of the Debate Watch event. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We examine the effects of modernization and secularization on the vote for the religious party in the Italian First Republic (1948–1992). In addition to modernization and secularization, we also introduce two new factors to the analysis: the importance of institutionalized Church and effects of the Church's Vatican II reforms. Italy is of particular relevance because of the centrality of the Catholic religion in the Italian society and politics, and the domination of the religious party — the Christian Democracy (DC) — in the country's party system until 1992. We analyze the impact on the DC vote of a series of indicators of modernization and secularization and of Church organization and reform. The analysis confirms the traditional interpretation of secularization but also stresses effects of the failure of the Church's reforms of Vatican II. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper investigates the role of environmental social movements and NGOs in the struggle for democracy in Nigeria. It examines how environmental issues, specifically in the oil-rich Niger Delta, have come to symbolize the Niger Delta communities' craving for greater inclusion in the political process. By linking environmental crisis to democratization and the interactions of power within the Nigerian federation, NGOs and social movements have been able to gain support for environmental causes. This may, however, have dire implications for the environmental movement in Nigeria. Because ownership, not necessarily sustainability, is the central theme of such discourse on resource-extraction, social movements may not be framing the environmental discourse in a way that highlights its unique relevance.

<p>Are the Australian Greens, as a political organization, experiencing a similar transformation to green parties in Europe in moving from a movement-based party to a pragmatic parliamentary party? What are the implications of changes in the party organization, and how key party activists respond to this? The debate surrounding party leadership, and particularly parliamentary leadership, is a central issue. As the Greens have increased their parliamentary representation, the question of access to resources, as much as access to media, has brought the leadership issue to the forefront. The resignation of Senator B. Brown as federal leader on 13 April 2012 has sharpened that focus. This article explores the role of the “party organizational activist” and, in particular, how party activists perceive and respond to issues of leadership. [R]</p>

Although President Obama has owned a dog since shortly after his 2008 election, we argue that Bo's presence most likely did little to improve his owner's chances of being reelected in 2012. Rather, the apparent significance of dog-ownership uncovered by Mutz is due largely to key variables being omitted from the analysis. Using the same data, we show that Obama didn't so much have trouble with dog-owners in 2008 as he had trouble with conservative, rural, Southern whites, who, for reasons we examine, are more likely than other Americans to own dogs.

<p>In Poland, legacies of the communist past interact with contemporary domestic opportunity structures, conditioning and shaping the forms of action of the country's animal rights movement. The resulting “NGOization” of civil society impedes effective collective action, with animal rights activists' engagement channeled towards “animal charity” and service provision rather than more political strategies or disruptive forms of protest. Faced with an unfavorable political opportunity structure, the Polish animal rights movement has, moreover, opted for judicial activism and education instead of politics to achieve its ends. To understand the organizational fragmentation of the “collective action space”, the notion of “opportunity structures” must be broadened to capture how the interplay between different types of opportunity structures affects action.

<p>The workplace provides an exceptional outlet for citizens to encounter different viewpoints and discuss politics with people with whom they may disagree.

Group polarization theory suggests that these environments push individuals to the partisan and ideological extremes. This study tests this hypothesis by comparing opinion change among interns who worked in a partisan workplace with that of interns who were employed in less-partisan environments. The results suggest that partisan workplace environments foster opinion polarization, especially among Republicans. [R]</p>

<p>It has become orthodoxy in terrorism studies that the survival or durability of the organization or network is central to the terrorist mission.

It finds, in contrast to organizational and network theory, that the group mission is not particularly flexible and that the crucial explanatory variable that affecting both the recourse to violence and attempts to counter it, lies in the ideological agenda that the theory dismisses.

<p>A burgeoning literature on post-Soviet political economy finds a strong link between privatization and political pluralism in the region. To test whether the political promise of economic liberalization and the logic of modernization that underlies it hold true, I draw on existing and original data on privatization, pluralism, and opposition movements throughout the region from early independence to the present. Contrary to approaches that stress the “the primacy of economics” in determining political outcomes, numerous cases of post-Soviet capitalist defection to the political opposition clearly point to “the primacy of politics”: the tangible ways that formal and informal institutions structure economic opportunities and ultimately impinge on individual calculations to comply with, oppose, or seek refuge from the regime.

We then unpack this empirical relationship between risk attitudes and willingness to support challenger candidates using two additional data-sets. These supplementary analyses suggest that the relationship between risk attitudes and willingness to support challengers may be partly attributable to the fact that challengers represent a departure from the status quo and typically have less governing experience.

This approach, widely present both in political and scholarly discourses, is built upon the implicit conceptualization of the EU as a static and finite actor. The paper challenges this conceptualization of Euroskepticism and through a detailed analysis of the current “state of the art” offers a different perspective, where the conceptualization of Euroskepticism is a consequence of previously stated standards concerning the pro-European stance and the EU polity.

<p>Greece's radical Left is known for its endurance mainly due to historical reasons. It is a social movement consisting of political parties, extra-parliamentary groups and terrorist organizations. In recent years, the country's radical Left has come closer to Middle Eastern Islamists. This article claims that anti-American sentiments have provided a common framework justifying joint action. The theory of United Front and the master frame of anti-Americanism are the tools of justification for this unnatural alliance in the making. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1967]</p>

<p>63.2127 KATZ, Maya Balakirsky — <bold>The de-politicization of Israeli political cartoons.</bold> <italic>Israel Studies</italic> 18(1), Spring 2013: 1–30.</p>
<p>This article treats the topic of political cartooning and the evolution of a genre during the early years of Israeli statehood. It focuses particularly on the work of two prominent cartoon artists, Friedel Stern and Kariel Gardosh (Dosh), who made their careers in Israel in the 1950s–60s and whose politically charged images have been sanitized over time. It looks at how attitudes towards certain imagery have changed so that political commentary that was seen as relevant and acute during early statehood eventually lost its political edge through historical handling and revision. These two cartoonists provided strong visual symbols of early Israeli national identity, which invariably had political motivations, and yet their legacy as political commentators during a crucial period in Israeli political history is often overlooked.

<p>Voice-overs with muted images, often known as the “image bites”, have become an increasingly used but understudied format of political language by the television news media. Because the media can use images to fit many contexts and purposes of commentary, the media images are susceptible to continuous de-contextualization and re-contextualization. Drawing from theories of feminist critical discourse-analysis and gender performance as well as scholarship on the public/private divide, we examine the commentary of one US television news organization's (NBC) re-contextualization of the same stock footage of H. Clinton over ten newscasts from August 1998 to June of 2000. NBC re-enforces the public/private binary in conventional masculine terms. Yet it also worked, at times, to unify the binary when covering Clinton's US Senate campaign. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Analyses of both aggregate-level constituency data and individual-level survey data from the 1983–2005 British General Elections indicate that when available information clearly signals which parties in a constituency are viable and which are not, supporters of nonviable parties vote tactically. Alliance/Liberal Democrat tactical voters tend to split their votes between Labour and the Conservatives, so the major parties derive limited net benefit from them. When Labour faces a dismal outlook in a constituency many of its supporters also vote tactically, and those that do overwhelmingly cast their votes for the Alliance/Liberal Democrats. A party that has repeatedly seen Duverger's “mechanical” factor reduce the sizable share of votes it wins nationally to a far smaller share of seats thus turns out to be the biggest beneficiary of tactical voting.

<p>The assertion that East German women held a double advantage in recruitment to intra-parliamentary leadership positions in the <italic>Bundestag</italic> during the period from 1994 to 2010 is only partly true.

In all other parliamentary parties, East German women are represented well but below the level of their West German female and male colleagues. Furthermore, East German male parliament members are under-represented in intra-parliamentary leadership positions. And while some measurements indicate that the representation of East German deputies in leadership functions outside of the Left Party's parliamentary party group has improved over time, this is not due to a rising number of members holding positions but to a declining number of members serving in the parliamentary parties Greens, FDP, SPD and CDU/CSU. Only in the Left Party is a rising number of East German position holders found. [R]</p>

<p>Does Latin America's left turn matter in media politics? Has ideology any impact on governments' practices and policies regarding media and journalistic institutions? This essay focuses on the existence of a specific kind of media activism on the part of leftist governments in Latin America. It assesses discourses on the media, direct-communication practices, and media regulation policies. While showing that the current binary distinctions stressing the existence of two lefts — “populist” and “nonpopulist” — obscure important commonalities and continuities, the author demonstrates that institutional and structural constraints account for the differences among the various leftist governments in Latin America. In sum, the paper challenges the prevailing neglect of ideology as a relevant factor in explaining developments in government-media relationships in the region. [R]</p>

<p>The democratic transition in Haiti (1986-present) has been forged alongside the proliferation of global governance interventions, from a series of UN peacekeeping missions to countless NGOs. Much of this activity has been pursued in the name of building state capacity. This article explores why residents in a Port-au-Prince neighborhood targeted by diverse governance projects perceive and experience “statelessness”. Taking the peacekeeping mission as an exemplar of global governance, it traces how the mission's social effects promote the perception of statelessness among residents because they confuse the locus of sovereign authority. These perceptions of statelessness are rooted not only in the weakness of the government of Haiti but also in the impotence that comes from a political field occupied by excessive, disordered forms of governance.

<p>At the center of debates on deliberative democracy is the issue of how much deliberation citizens experience in their social networks. These “disagreements about disagreement” come in a variety of forms, with scholars advocating different empirical approaches and coming to different substantive conclusions. We investigate the consequences of conceptual and measurement differences for key findings relating interpersonal political disagreement to political attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on the 2008–2009 ANES panel study, we find evidence that different measures of disagreement have distinct effects when it comes to individuals' preferences, patterns of engagement, and propensities to participate. We discuss the implications for the study of social influence; as interpersonal disagreement can mean different things, scholars should think carefully about how to study it and should exercise caution when making pronouncements about its empirical and democratic consequences.

<p>The catastrophe of the presidential plane crash in April 2010 was of course a far-reaching event in Polish politics, with consequences still very present. The article describes and interprets various ways of speaking about the catastrophe. I consider this rhetoric in the context of a clash of ideologies: that of modernization and of national-religious values. The conservative camp insists on inscribing the crash into Polish history and claims that it reveals a division into two Polands: one of true patriots and another of collaborators. I analyze this narrative through post-Marxist political theory, particularly E. Laclau and Ch. Mouffe and the concept of ideology developed by Bakhtin/Voloshinov. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Scholars have long analyzed the influence of combat casualties on public support for war. However, the mechanisms through which casualties — particularly local casualties — affect wartime opinion-formation have received much less attention. We employ a novel survey experiment to test three mechanisms that might explain previously observed cleavages in war support between residents of high- and low-casualty communities. We find that subjects who read a news story concerning a casualty from their home state were significantly more likely to oppose the war in Afghanistan than were subjects who read an identically worded news story in which the fallen soldier was not identified as being from the respondent's home state.

<p>This article analyzes and evaluates the role of the media in the 2012 presidential election. In particular, it focuses on campaign coverage by television and the internet from the perspective of both the main candidates' usage of the media (candidate communication) and the media's coverage of the campaign (political reportage and commentary). It argues that television, the dominant medium in the era of modern campaigning, was the main information and communication platform for the mass electorate, while the internet, the medium of the postmodern era, was an important tool for the mobilization of committed and potential supporters. The article explains why this was the case and considers the implications for electoral communication in France. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2137]</p>

<p>In 2012 the Socialist Party (PS) presidential candidate, F. Hollande, defeated the incumbent, N. Sarkozy. The victory was convincing, though not overwhelming. Hollande thus became only the second Socialist president of the Fifth Republic after F. Mitterrand. Hollande's success in the presidential contest was reinforced a few weeks later when the PS and immediate allies won an absolute majority of seats in the parliamentary election. The articles in this special issue explore many of the key aspects of both 2012 campaigns: from understanding how Sarkozy could fall so rapidly from grace to examining the extent to which the outcome symbolizes a new direction for France, both domestically and internationally.

<p>By comparison with 2002 and 2007, does the 2012 presidential election reveal significant changes in French media functioning and their relations with the political sphere? This article challenges four statements heard during the campaign: the contribution of the media to F. Hollande's victory, the way journalists reported on the campaign, the role played by the polls and finally, the candidates' strategies in media agenda-setting. Even if the features traditionally ascribed to the French media (social proximity between journalists and politicians, importance of state regulation and public service, orientation toward the intellectual viewpoint in the patterns of media coverage) have not completely vanished, they describe reality less and less. Indeed, both the media and the political sphere are today subjected to a converging process of rationalization that transforms their practices and mutual relations.

<p>This article explores the influence of Protestant missionaries on malefemale educational inequalities in colonial India. Causal mechanisms drawn from the sociology and economics of religion highlight the importance of religious competition for the provision of public goods. Competition between religious and secular groups spurred missionaries to play a key role in the development of mass female schooling. A case study of Kerala illustrates this. The statistical analysis, with district-level datasets, covers colonial and post-colonial periods for most of India. Missionary effects are compared with those of British colonial rule, modernization, European presence, education expenditures, post-colonial democracy, Islam, caste and tribal status, and land tenure. Christian missionary activity is consistently associated with better female education outcomes in both the colonial and post-colonial periods. [R]</p>

<p>The article compares how the majority population in Denmark, Sweden, UK and the US perceive ethnic minorities.

This article describes whether Britons, Swedes and Danes have developed the same kind of prejudices toward “non-western immigrants”. The article is based on a unique data source where items from the American GSS survey are replicated in three European countries. The analysis shows that the Americans' prejudices toward “blacks” are not worse than the Europeans' prejudices toward “non-western immigrants”. This leads to the conclusion that neither attempts to de-politicize the ethnicity issue nor the presence of an encompassing welfare regime have been able to prevent the establishment of prejudices and stereotypes toward out-group members.

One credits reformist pressures that were largely external to the interests of the major political parties. Another proposes that party elites adopted direct primaries to protect their internal interests. We produce some results consistent with each explanation, but find the weight of our evidence supports the idea that rules changed in response to anti-party reform pressures. [R]</p>

<p>Various approaches have been taken to forecasting the outcomes of elections. The “PM and the Pendulum” model uses Prime Ministerial Approval as the sole short-term predictor of the vote in British General Elections. Here we test the forecasting power of this predictor against a close rival — Government Approval. Using a time-varying parameter estimator, we demonstrate that between elections and especially in the months preceding a General Election, PM Approval is the most accurate predictor of both governing party vote intentions and the actual vote on Election Day, as measured in governing party vote share. The autoregressive model for translating votes into seats, based on elections from 1910 onward, provides an almost exact prediction of the outcome of the 2010 contest. [R]</p>

In Study 1, personalized (vs. depersonalized) messages significantly enhanced message recognition and recall, but they heightened perceived presence of and imagined intimacy with the candidate only among more affiliative individuals, while lowering the willingness to vote for him among less affiliative ones. In Study 2, although personalized messages improved message encoding and retrieval, they induced stronger perceived intimacy with and more positive evaluations of the in-group candidate only among those with weak party identification. By contrast, those attaching greater value to their party affiliation responded negatively to the personalized messages and showed robust in-group favoritism. [R]</p>

The current crisis provides the organization with a unique opportunity to make a final comeback to the front stage. But the Brotherhood will have to tackle complex issues such as explaining with more clarity their troubled past and dealing with internal divisions resulting from their turbulent history.

<p>To assess President B. Obama's deracialized agenda-setting strategy, this article draws from two Gallup Organization polls and a 2010 survey of political behaviors and racial attitudes. We extend the debate about deracialization by focusing on two of Obama's most important policy initiatives: the American Recovery and Reinvestment (ARRA) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The debates over ARRA and the Affordable Care Act placed Obama in an unenviable position. The study shows that many African-Americans supported these policies despite Obama's use of deracialized rhetoric. This support was not necessarily due to blind faith or racial loyalty. African-Americans believed these laws would improve their own vulnerable situations and reinforce the federal government's commitment to remedying racial inequities.

<p>Scholars disagree about the nature of party attachments, viewing partisanship as either a social identity or a rational maximization of expected utility. Empirically, much of this debate centers on the degree of partisan stability, assuming that the objects of identity — parties — are fixed. If we instead allow party brands to change over time, then partisan instability is consistent with a social-identity conception of partisanship. To demonstrate this, I develop a branding model of partisanship in which voters learn about party brands by observing party behavior over time and base their psychological attachment to a party on these brands. The model suggests that convergence by rival parties, making their brands less distinguishable, should weaken party attachments. I test this implication using a survey experiment in Argentina and find evidence consistent with the model. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Tunisia's “Revolution of Dignity” lit the spark for the tsunami of popular protests, the misnamed “Arab Spring” that engulfed the region in 2010–2011. A central aspect of Tunisia's ongoing transition has been an alliance between the Islamist Ennahda party and two leading secular-left-of-center parties, which came together after the October 2011 Constituent Assembly elections to form a broad-based interim government until the completion of a new constitution and new elections in 2013. This alliance carries the potential for fashioning of the first genuinely democratic polity in the Arab world. Whether or not the alliance will manage to surmount the obstacles posed by the inherent tension between the Islamist and secular-modern currents remains to be seen.

<p>In 2000, the leftist camp in Israel experienced a crisis of meaning and identity, the result of the failure of the 2000 Camp David Talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The atmosphere that emerged among the Israeli left was one of despair and disillusion, a void of meaning. Recently, however, a new Zionist “national left” discourse emerged, which refutes the idea of peace and reconstructs the ideology of the Israeli left. This paper engages critically with this discourse by deploying a discourse-analytical approach, as it draws on E. Laclau and Ch. Mouffe's theory of hegemony as well as semantic analysis, specifically the use of “semantic fields” and “semantic networks”. This paper looks at a variety of public texts, which are exemplary of the “national left” discourse in Israel. [R]</p>

<p>This article describes the viewpoints and attitudes of Mexican citizens during the presidency of Felipe Calderón and the most significant features of political culture in Mexico, with a discussion on the quality of democracy, in order to observe the level of satisfaction of citizens and politicians with Mexican democracy. The attitudes of citizens with regard to their party links and participation in a range of political and social activities are analyzed. Based on the data provided, the article reflects on political citizenship in Mexico ten years after the first government alternation. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2612]</p>

<p>This article examines the influence of citizen participation, specifically voter turnout, on [US] congressional policy responsiveness. We argue that higher levels of citizen participation signal to representatives greater surveillance of their actions by their constituents and, thus, a higher probability of sanction. Representatives respond to these signals by deploying resources in ways that provide better intelligence of district needs and preferences. As a consequence, higher citizen participation is rewarded with enhanced policy responsiveness. [R]</p>

<p>Increasingly, scholars are applying Social Movement Theory to explore how radical Islamist groups strategically employ framing to legitimize the use of violence. What has not been explicitly examined, however, is under what conditions radical frames are more resonant with the public than more moderate alternatives. This article argues that the strength of a particular frame depends on the credibility of the competing claimmakers. Drawing on public opinion polls from the Palestinian Territories, the article shows that the resonance of Hamas's frames vis-à-vis the peace process between 1993 and 2006 depended on the ability of the Palestinian leadership to maintain its legitimacy. An understanding of the dynamics of credibility can help explain the continued moves towards national reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While much of the literature on migrant political attitudes focuses on the positive or negative ramifications of individual-level integration outcomes, I claim that the best way to understand political trust and government satisfaction among migrant-origin individuals is through the strong positive correlation with trust and satisfaction among native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. One implication of this argument is that migrant-origin individuals' trust and satisfaction are closer to native-origin individuals living in the same subnational region than to migrants living elsewhere in Europe. The research provides a new perspective for understanding the broad contours of migrant integration and shifts the debate away from whether or not migrants have positive attitudes about European society. The fact that migrant- and native-origin individuals have similar levels of trust and satisfaction is suggestive of successful attitudinal integration. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We examine what influences public attitudes toward torture and whether the public's attitude affects or is affected by shifts in presidential policy on torture. We employed ten surveys over five years that looked at approval of torture, as well as two surveys that asked questions about specific methods. We find that public support for torture has risen mildly, but a resilient ambivalence best describes the public's attitude. The public was not affected by the change in government from an administration that strongly supported enhanced interrogation techniques to one that opposed them, and labeled them torture. Public opinion also seemed unaffected by the increased criticism of torture generally. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2076]</p>

<p>In the first round of the 2012 French presidential election, Marine Le Pen drew a record score of 17.9% of the valid votes. Her success was attributed to the “de-demonization” strategy she implemented to soften the party's image, make it credible on issues other than immigration, and diversify its electoral audience. Survey data from 1988 to 2012 show a more complex picture. M. Le Pen's supports are ideologically and socially very similar to her father's. The only difference is her larger audience among women, especially in the service proletariat. If this erosion of the traditional “radical-right gender gap” is confirmed, it could considerably enlarge the National Front's electoral influence. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2137]</p>

<p>Scholars and commentators argue that the US has become politically polarized in recent years, with news content itself favoring polarized views. If true, this represents a radical shift from H. J. Gans's <italic>[Deciding What's News: A Study of CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, Newsweek and Time</italic>, New York, 1979] enduring news value of moderatism. By examining 208 advocacy groups' ideology and their representation in 118 newspapers, this study revisits Gans's moderatism argument and investigates polarization in news content. Analysis demonstrates that moderate groups has less prominence within articles, with no differences in tone. Polarization may offer a higher news value by presenting inherent conflict and a means for journalistic balance. [R]</p>

<p>Although there is considerable evidence that religion influences political opinions, it is unclear how this story plays out across different segments of the US population. Utilizing the 2000 Religion and Politics Survey, we examine the effects of religious beliefs, behaviors, and affiliations on citizens' attitudes relating to issues of egalitarianism. Our study comparatively analyzes the link between religious measures and political outlooks for the nation's three largest ethno-racial groups. The findings show that conservative Christianity is consistently associated with less tolerant and less egalitarian views among whites. Religious African-Americans and Latinos, however, hold more equitable opinions about disadvantaged individuals. To further strengthen our arguments, we also replicate these results using the 2008 American National Election Study. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The American Right's speedy political recovery after the historic 2008 election was driven in part by Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck. Yet conservative media are just one key component in the broad political networks built over the past few decades. Conservative talk radio, print publications, television networks, and internet sites have numerous connections with the think tanks, advocacy organizations, academic research centers, and foundations that develop and promote the Right's policy agenda. Progressives have acknowledged this “vast right-wing conspiracy” for years, but often demonstrate little understanding of how it actually works. I remind readers of the expansive scope and shape of conservative networks. Using the rise of Tea Party populism, I demonstrate how media organizations work within these networks to revive and promote ideas and action on the Right.

<p>The contribution analyzes the “majority strategy” of the Brotherhood and its inability to form coalitions (except with some sections of the Salafi movement) and break out of its isolation and appeal to a larger public. Does this stem from its previous history of persecution during the past 80 years and its suspicious nature as a semi-underground movement that has no experience in politics, or does it have its roots in the nature of the revolution which reached an impasse very early on and cannot be resolved without more heavy-handed measures?

<p>In the literature on post-Suharto Indonesia, an increasingly dominant stream has portrayed the political system as being hijacked by predatory elite interests associated with the fallen New Order regime. While such characterizations describe important elements of the post-1998 polity, they do not tell the full story. At the same time that patronage-driven career politicians have staked their claims in the newly democratic state, a large number of civil society activists also started to play an active role in formal politics. This article illustrates how human rights advocates, women activists and labor leaders have tried to promote their causes not from the margins of civil society, but from within the power center of political institutions.

<p>We examine the political attitudes of American Indians in eastern Oklahoma where they make up almost 20% of the population. We argue that American Indians in the region play the same role that other minorities in the southern states — notably blacks and Hispanics — do in resisting the region's realignment from the Democratic to the Republican Party. American Indians in the region are populists, in that they are economically liberal and religiously conservative. The results of our analysis suggest that the socio-economic characteristics of American Indians play a greater role in explaining American Indians' political attitudes than their ethnic identification.

<p>Before the rise of the Tea Party, propaganda primed the backlash to B.

This article analyzes the right-wing propaganda campaign to advance paranoid stories about the political enemies of America. It shows how three propaganda stories are tied to the Republican Party's electoral strategy: (1) the construction of a voter fraud myth as a foundation for attacking the voting rights of minorities and the poor; (2) the take-down of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN); and (3) the launch of a Red scare and witch-hunt by the pseudo-discovery of an alleged left-wing blueprint for destroying capitalism and collapsing the government.

<p>This article makes the case for the systematic registration of political studies. By proposing a research design before an outcome variable is observed, a researcher commits him- or herself to a theoretically motivated method for studying the object of interest. Further, study registration prompts peers of the discipline to evaluate a study's quality on its own merits, reducing norms to accept significant results and reject null findings. To advance this idea, the Political Science Registered Studies Dataverse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/registration">http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/registration</ext-link>) has been created, in which scholars may create a permanent record of a research design before completing a study.

<p>While much research examines the effects of celebrity endorsements in commercial advertising, scholars have only recently sought to investigate the effects of celebrity endorsements of politicians on voter perceptions and behavior. This study expands existing research on celebrity political endorsement effects via an experiment exploring effects of different versions of a news story describing a celebrity's endorsement of a political candidate on participants' voting attitudes, perceptions of candidate credibility, and voting behavioral intent. Although participants perceive credibility differences between high- and low-credibility celebrities, neither endorser credibility nor endorser sex impact attitudes toward the endorsed candidate, perceptions of the candidate's credibility, or intended voting behavior.

<p>During the campaign for the 2010 [US] midterm elections, conservative talk radio (CTR) played a fundamental role in voicing the protest against the B. Obama administration. A radio genre that has long been equated solely with Limbaugh, CTR now includes a more diverse offer of syndicated programs enjoying ratings similar to Limbaugh's and large national audiences. A content-analysis of four of the five top CTR programs shows that, while they share a common ideological core — with common emphasis on economic issues and foreign affairs, and a systematic indictment of the forty-fourth president — each program tailors its content in a unique way. Significant differences emerge in the way hosts foreground and characterize role players, emphasize themes, and relate to the grassroots. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2152]</p>

It relies mainly on mainstream media articles such as those archived in the Centre for Civil Society Social Protest Observatory.

<p>In theory, under conditions of open electoral competition, an active civil society and institutions that guarantee accountability, clientelism and vote-buying lose their attraction and tend to disappear.

An attempt is made to evaluate the causes and consequences of the persistence and continued relevance of clientelism, with an emphasis on the diversification of “client supply” in the context of local democratization. This diversification increasingly includes the provision of individualized benefits relating to public security, in exchange for political support. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2612]</p>

<p>Most research on media effects in political science deals with the news media or political campaigns.

This article examines the effects of fiction on political beliefs. We do this in the context of an experimental design, where subjects in the treatment group watched the outlandish movie, <italic>Wag the Dog</italic>. The results show that those who watched the film were more likely to believe in a far-fetched conspiracy, namely that the US government has and will fabricate a war for political gain. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We review theories of French elections, drawing on a recent general theory developed in our analysis of presidential elections (1988–2007). We offer an explanation for why President Sarkozy was not re-elected in 2012. Two key theoretical variables were involved: one long termideological identification-and one short term-economic evaluation. The effect of these variables changed greatly from 2007 to 2012, and together largely account for his loss of almost five percentage-points in second-round vote share. In 2007, he ran as an “outsider” who galvanized the base of his traditional right party (the UMP), promising to solve the economic problems the country faced. In contrast, in 2012, he ran as an incumbent with a failed record. Thus, he experienced substantial defection from the Gaullist right, as well as more global dissatisfaction with his poor economic leadership. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2137]</p>

<p>On the basis of his record in office, especially with regard to the economy, a heavy defeat for N. Sarkozy could have been expected. Our presidential election forecast supported that expectation. However, that forecast was for a larger Sarkozy defeat than actually occurred. We suggest, through an examination of leadership data, that Sarkozy managed to offset to some degree his negative economic record, by projecting a relatively positive leader image when compared to F. Hollande. However, that positive effect was not enough to overcome the negative effect of his economic record, which ultimately denied him victory. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1993]</p>

<p>This paper examines whether party platforms have adapted to the ideological content of EU treaty provisions — based on “neoliberalism” and “regulated capitalism” — across a range of policy areas. The analysis focuses on long-term party policy adjustment across different policy areas by examining whether there has been a shift away from core ideological goals towards the direction of EU policy. The main finding is that there has generally been a shift towards the direction of EU policy across all party families in both member and non-member states. The findings have implications for the quality of representation and functioning of democracy in the member states since the deepening of the European integration process reduces ideologically distinct policy alternatives across party families and can hinder policy innovation.

<p>We rely on the same logic underlying economic-centered research — that unhappy citizens blame governors and state governments for their discontent — but focus on the impact on approval of an entirely separate and relatively unexplored domain of life in a state: ethno-demographics. This article advances the hypothesis that citizen discontent over drastic ethnic change in their local environment is politicized as concern over immigration, which in turn serves as a concrete political issue through which personal discontent over increased ethnic diversity is translated into lower approval of state government. This hypothesis is tested within the context of the state of California [US] using pooled statewide survey data. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Models of political behavior are based on the idea that individual dispositions are fundamentally the same. Behavioral genetics questions this one-size-fits-all assumption. Political behavior is a product of both nature and nurture. The article argues that students of political behavior should take genetically informed deep-seated individual differences seriously, and presents a recent Danish study of twins' political behavior. The analysis shows that individual variation in ideological orientation, political participation, political interest and external efficacy is partially accounted for by genetic disposition. Moreover, the well-established relationship between sense of efficacy and political participation is primarily accounted for by a shared, latent genetic disposition. The article concludes that traditional theories of political behavior must be revised to incorporate the fact that one model of man does not fit all.

These findings challenge prior assertions that self-interest does little to account for American public opinion, demonstrating that on the issue of immigration reform that self-interest matters for African-Americans.

<p>Gay rights would seem an area of politics largely untouched by the changes wrought by Eastern Europe's democratic transitions and accession to the EU. Against the conventional wisdom, this article argues that the broader picture in the region is actually one of increasing rights and better-organized, more influential gay-rights movements and that these developments were catalyzed by EU accession. It also argues, however, that the dominant theoretical perspective on accession's effect on domestic politics, Europeanization theory, cannot account for this outcome. Using a close study of Poland, I suggest that social movement theory — with its emphasis on political opportunity structure, framing, and polarization — provides a better account of how gay rights have developed as a political issue since the fall of communism.

<p>Since 2008, environmentalist campaigns against global warming have taken place in a context of global economic crisis. However, since its beginnings, political ecology has framed its diagnoses as crises: economic, social and environmental ones. The discourses on the ecological and economic crises were constructed together in the 1970s. This article analyzes two very different environmental campaigns: that of R. Dumont in 1974, which gave birth to political ecology, and that mounted at the time of the Copenhagen Conference on global warming in 2009. The article [examines] the origins of the framing of the environmental crisis in France that distinguishes ecologists' campaigns. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2228]</p>

<p>This article builds on theories of political participation and civic engagement that evaluate Latino immigrant civic participation in a non-traditional immigrant destination city. The growth of the Latino population in the [US] Midwest makes the question of Latino civic participation germane for emergent Latino communities across the region. This research examines civic participation for 560 Latino immigrants in St Louis, Missouri. Using quantitative methods, we explored the major factors associated with civic engagement for Latino immigrants. We provide evidence that civic <italic>habitus</italic>, party identification, years in the US and education played an important role in explaining civic engagement among Latino immigrants. [R]</p>

<p>Political parties usually have an instrumental relation to their own party's history, whose function is to enhance party identity. The “official” party history normally is inclusive, designed as a composition of party heroes and villains as well as of party achievements which all members and ideological wings can agree upon or, at least, where they can find themselves represented. But sometimes it is hard to agree on history. All wings and currents of <italic>Die Linke</italic> can agree on R. Luxemburg and K. Liebknecht as symbols; their assassination in January 1919 is commemorated by a demonstration every year. Unexpected intra-party conflicts arose when in December 2006 a stone was placed at the cemetery Friedrichsfelde in Berlin near the graves of Luxemburg and Liebknecht commemorating the “victims of Stalinism”.

<p>After the defeat of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE) in the French and Dutch referendums, governments across Europe had little appetite for popular votes on the Lisbon Treaty. Indeed, nine of the ten countries which were committed to (or had held) referendums on the TCE got around such votes on Lisbon. The article investigates how governments in these nine countries avoided putting the treaty to the people despite the precedent set by the TCE. Three factors were crucial in this regard: (1) the European-level collusion between governments; (2) domestic political changes during the “period of reflection”: and (3) governing strategies of depoliticizing the decisions against referendums. Thus, avoiding referendums could succeed only due to the determined agency of governments and auspicious domestic contexts of ratification. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Over the last few years, in an attempt to mitigate parties' unequal access to mass media during election campaigns, several Latin American countries decided to increase the public funding of election campaigns vis-à-vis private sources. Among them, four countries (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Ecuador) moved to an exclusively state-funded regime of mass media election campaigns. Argentine legislation was first implemented for the 2011 presidential elections. According to new campaign finance legislation, among other changes, the buying and selling of electoral advertisements on radio and TV are prohibited. Parties and candidates may use advertising allocated by the state only to disseminate their campaign messages. Based on a large media monitoring scheme conducted during open primaries and general elections, this article evaluates the first implementation of this new law in Argentina. [R, abr.]</p>

Numbers run into the hundreds according to human rights groups. Attacks are committed with knives and metal bars as well as iron rods by members of “Golden Dawn” and even members of parliament themselves, with the police standing on the sidelines. “Golden Dawn”, which is becoming a state within the state, has many supporters within the police.

<p>Economists and psychologists often disagree about the impact of rewards on pro-social behavior. Economists generally believe incentives promote effort and performance, while many psychologists warn they depress intrinsic motivation and impair performance. I investigate the impact of extrinsic (monetary) rewards on voting in elections. In a pilot study, voters in Gilroy, California [US], were randomly assigned to receive a postcard mailing with either a simple reminder to vote or an offer to receive a financial reward (of varying levels) for participating in the November 2007 election. A large-scale replication study was conducted in Lancaster, California, in April 2010. The results of the experiments reveal nominal incentives failed to effectively raise turnout in elections, but nontrivial incentives elevated electoral participation. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>To [some] extent, academic debate has focused on the effects of political funding regimes on party organizations. Scholars have hypothesized the existence of a relationship between the increasing need for public funding and a progressive shift of internal power from the Party in Central Office to the Party in Public Office, at the expense of the Party on the Ground. This article tests this hypothesis by analyzing the evolution of budget and organization of four Italian political parties (PDS-DS, PPI-DL, FI, AN) from 1994 to 2004: we expect to find a massive need for public subsidies to survive environmental changes accompanied by a tendency to centralization of power within their organizations.

<p>This paper contributes to the academic literature on rebel group transitions, using the case of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao, Philippines, to analyze the use of religion and ideology as legitimizing strategies by rebel groups for enhancing civilian support. Drawing on empirical field research conducted with Maranao and Maguindanao communities during 2008–2010, the findings suggest that religion and ideology as legitimization strategies are of diminishing significance in the Moro conflict.

<p>This article examines key ideological, economic, and institutional preferences of the Brazilian political elite in the first 25 years of the country's democratic regime. Introducing the unified dataset of the Brazilian Legislative Surveys, it examines several crucial dimensions of politicians' attitudes, including elite placement on a traditional left-right scale, preferences concerning the fundamental economic model, direct comparisons of the recent Cardoso and Lula governments, and orientations toward Brazil's global and regional projection. On many of the central issues, attitudes have remained stable, but on the dimensions that have seen notable change, nearly all the change has been in the direction of decreasing polarization. The Brazilian case demonstrates that the sustained practice of democracy can lead to attitudinal convergence and macro-political stability, even when the initial political and socioeconomic conditions appear daunting.

<p>In list PR systems, the criteria applied in the candidate-selection process can be analyzed by contrasting the realistic and marginal candidates with the non-realistic candidates on the list. Marginal candidates' chance is more dependent on their personal result or the result of the list. This approach was applied to the Belgian Chamber elections in the period 1999–2010. A multilevel multinomial regression-analysis shows that incumbents, mayors and party employees stand a significantly larger chance of being selected as a realistic or marginal candidate. No evidence was found of a specific gender bias. Once the above-mentioned variables are taken into account, previous campaign experience has a negative effect on the odds of being selected. For the marginal positions, parties particularly seek local office holders from larger municipalities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article systematically investigates interest group-party interactions in the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK based on cross-national surveys with responses from 1,225 interest groups. The findings show that interest groups and parties still interact in the beginning of the 21st c., but that the vast majority of their interaction involves a low degree of institutionalisation. Using fractional logit analysis, it is demonstrated that the strength of interest group-party linkage is primarily affected by systematic differences in state-society structures and organizational group characteristics. Moreover, differences are found in what conditions different types of interaction. Whereas historical legacies and partisan origin influence an interest group's structural party links, group resources make interactions of a less institutionalized, ad hoc nature more likely.

<p>The implementation of the model of territorial organization established by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 involves the creation of non statewide institutions with legislative powers, and the regional elections in order to decide the composition of the authonomous parliaments. the turnout registered in this type of contests is persistently and generally lower than in general elections. Those citizens that participate in the general but not in the regional elections are known as differential non-voters. despite this pattern of non-voting is repeated election after election in all the communities, its magnitude and consequences differ in each case. In this paper, the causes of this variation are explored by using aggregated data of turnout in both types of elections across regions and over time. results from the specified econometric models seem to point out the need to resort to several socio-demographic, political and institutional factors to explain differential abstention in the decentralized Spain.

<p>The article considers why New Labour's political economy failed to insulate Britain from the economic crisis that emerged in 2007, and the characteristics of a political economy platform that would provide Labour with a solid base for a progressive social democratic program moving forward. The article argues that Third Way political economy failed to appreciate or address the inherent crisis dynamics of market economies, especially the extent to which profit-seeking behavior tends to contradict social interests more broadly conceived. It argues that mutual organization offers an opportunity to mute the crisis dynamics in capital by reestablishing links between production and community, and that the Labour party should seize on this opportunity at a moment of crisis to form the basis of a progressive program of social democratic reform.

<p>A range of empirical studies has shown that candidates' physical attractiveness can substantially influence the outcome of political elections. This applies to different countries, different electoral systems, and different levels of political systems, and equally affects simple direct or list candidates and front-runners. However, no previous investigation using actual election results has been made into whether candidates' attractiveness also has an effect under the conditions of a presidential electoral system. Theoretical reasons can be formulated that suggest attractiveness is ineffective [in] these circumstances. We analyzed the 2009 North Rhine-Westphalia mayoral elections. The results clearly show that candidates' attractiveness has a substantial influence. Taking into account earlier findings, the influence of physical attractiveness in political elections appears to be resistant, to a large degree, to varying constraints. [R]</p>

<p>Although most voters appear to be aware of at least some major [US] Supreme Court decisions and understand that presidents help to shape constitutional law by nominating Justices and other federal judges, presidential candidates generally find that the Court is difficult to transform into an election issue. As the nation's most revered defender of the rule of law and the Constitution, the Court is so widely respected, even when its decisions are unpopular, that attacks on the Court always have been politically perilous. Harsh criticism of the Court can backfire, making a candidate vulnerable to allegations that he seeks to politicize the Court or lacks respect for the Constitution. [R]</p>

<p>Using survey data collected between 1997 and 2001 in ten post-communist countries, I test a set of hypotheses that explain satisfaction with democracy among members of the main ethnic minority groups within each country. First, I test whether political representation, per se, has any effect at all. Second, I examine the relationship between the type of political system and the capacity of an ethnic minority to participate in the decision-making process. In particular, I show that those minorities which have a voice in parliamentary democracies are more satisfied than other minorities which act in political systems with a more powerful president. Finally, I show how more proportional electoral systems increase satisfaction with democracy for those minorities that either do not have any political representation at all or whose political ethnic party is small.

<p>It is frequently argued that non-Scottish UK citizens should be enfranchised in any referendum on the future of Scotland because they are affected by the decision. This article argues that this position cannot in fact be supported by the all-affected interests principle for two reasons: (1) a consistent application of the all-affected interests principle would require enfranchising not only all UK citizens but also many non-UK citizens who are also affected; (2) doubt is cast upon the all-affected interests principle itself by consideration of other cases of separation, such as divorce.

<p>This article presents an analysis of McCarthyite and Tea Party political discourse and explores the possibilities of utilizing populism as an analytic construct for making comparisons between the political and economic projects envisaged by these two conservative movements. Relying on a definition of populism as a universal discursive formation, this article argues that there is a similar structure to the discourses of McCarthyism and the Tea Party, which relies on the construction of a “left-oriented enemy”, posed as a threat to the American values of freedom and independence historically tied to the nation's “founding moment”. With this comparative discursive structure established, the article then explores the ideological differences between the movements and attempts to interpret them within a historical framework.

<p>We examine the regional variance of the votes on the railway station project, “Stuttgart 21”. In addition to party partisanship, prospective regional advantages and their regionally specific relevance explain the voting behavior in local districts. Thus, our findings contest previous journalistic and political interpretations of voting behavior, confirming the results of other studies on plebiscites. As in our case the overall voting results reflect parliamentary majorities, the use of plebiscites for increasing public participation seems questionable. Moreover, plebiscites may prevent the realization of infrastructure projects in low-population areas, as the voting results also depend on the covariance of the regional advantages with the distribution of the population. In the light of these findings, alternatives ensuring public participation need to be considered. [R]</p>

Did they behave any differently from their more liberal counterparts? Did they boast being endorsed by Palin and/or other Tea Party organizations? Did they invoke their gendered or “Mama Grizzly” status to appeal to voters? This study uses data gathered from ninety-two websites of women who ran for Congress in 2010. Overall, it is found that Republican women did not reference the Tea Party, nor embrace being “Mama Grizzlies”. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2152]</p>

<p>In 2008, B. Obama made history as the first politician to advertise in video games, but this was overlooked by political scientists and received little media coverage.

He was able to speak directly to young voters for a small cost compared to his expenditures on traditional media. This article explores Obama's use of dynamic advertising and shows why other candidates are likely to emulate him by running their own virtual campaigns. [R]</p>

By contrast, nation al identity and political institutions play an increasingly important role in explaining public Euroskepticism. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2246]</p>

<p>The electoral challenge of the far right is an enduringly problematic feature of contemporary French politics.

Drawing on official FN programs, detailed election results and opinion polling data, it assesses the strength of support for M. Le Pen and her party and explains their electoral appeal. It analyzes the claim that she has “de-demonized” the FN, transforming it from perennial outsider to normal participant in mainstream French politics; and it reflects on the strategic dilemma posed for the center-right by this newly invigorated far-right challenge.

<p>Relatively unskilled foreign workers in Northeast Asia face a range of hardships, and government programs have provided little support until recently. Media portrayals of foreign workers reinforce popular suspicions and fear of these foreigners. Yet, citizens of host countries themselves have formed numerous voluntary associations aimed at assisting foreign workers. I call the activities of these groups “associative activism”. My account of associative activism makes explicit the process through which some activists, who initially work in concert chiefly to solve specific problems, eventually form broader political ambitions as they exert pressure on dominant features of the public sphere, especially processes of governance, political representation, and opinion formation. I identify three domains of associative activism through which political influence is exerted by immigrant rights groups: legislative, juridical, and municipal. [R, abr.]</p>

One consequence of this change is a reduction in the electoral salience of inflation. While electoral support for the incumbent in the 1980s and 1990s was strongly tied to his or her ability to prevent increases in prices, in the 2000–2010 period there was no significant association between inflation rates and election outcomes. Instead, incumbents who presided over a growing economy in the last decade reaped electoral benefits. The importance of the economy for electoral outcomes varies over time and even across economic indicators. [R]</p>

<p>Voters who perceive the economy to be weak are generally less likely to support the incumbent government. Yet there is a debate over whether all people respond equally to economic shifts or if the state of the economy is more salient for those who feel economically vulnerable. This article examines whether insecure employment situations and employ-ability concerns strengthen responses to the government's economic record. Data from Latin America and Eastern Europe confirm that workers who feel anxious about being fired or who believe it would be difficult to find a new job place significantly greater weight on sociotropic evaluations than do those with more secure employment situations. Thus incumbents who create risks for vulnerable workers are sanctioned, while those who create opportunities are rewarded most. [R]</p>

<p>This article employs P. Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital to explain how I. Gandhi gained legitimacy in Indian politics. Despite belonging to the politically illustrious Nehru family, Gandhi suffered numerous indignities in the immediate post-Nehruvian period because the incumbent political elite at the time, the Syndicate, devalued the symbolic value of her family-name-based-capital of mass popularity. Having established her popularity as the symbolic capital of the Indian political field, she used her control over ruling party leaders' access to state offices and simultaneously created a new classification of a competent leader in the ruling party. This study contributes to the existing studies of leadership, especially leadership by women, and the legitimacy-gaining process by revealing the role of contest among the elite over the meaning of symbolic capital in creating or destroying their respective authority.

<p>This article analyzes the political effects of American media coverage on Tea Party health care politics. It suggests that the American media's inability to critique the neoliberal assumptions that lay at the foundation of Tea Party ideology have served to excite ideological confusion in American health care debates, especially those surrounding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Specifically, this article shows that media failure to make sense of the ideological and statistical basis of Tea Party opposition to the ACA, as well as a general unwillingness to mediate disagreement, have barred mainstream media from helping Americans see that the ACA is largely consistent with neoliberal orthodoxy. The media have served to legitimize rather than critique positions that stand at the center of Tea Party ideology. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2152]</p>

It examines what Euroskepticism is and why it occurs in these countries, using a framework for analyzing Euroskepticism based on the concepts of economic, political, post-materialist value-based, right-wing value-based, cultural and rural society Euroskepticism.

<p>The impact of political parties on public opinion has been debated among scholars for more than half a century. Yet, few studies have examined the influence of cues from political parties on citizens' policy preferences during an actual policy debate. Drawing on data from a six-wave panel survey, we examine how two major shifts in policy positions among the major center-right parties in Denmark affected public preferences during 2010–2011. We find strong effects of party cues on mass policy preferences and polarization along partisan lines. The magnitude of opinion shifts in our real-world context rivals party-cue effects found in experimental settings, suggesting a strong role of political parties as opinion leaders.

<p>Can [US] candidates spend their way into financial success? We propose that the 2007 presidential money primary offers unprecedented leverage to evaluate spending's influence since it allows for sharper controls of confounding factors. Our results demonstrate that greater candidate spending on fundraising-related efforts is associated with significant future financial benefits. We estimate that, prior to the primaries, increases in spending have an equal or larger payoff than increases in a candidate's viability and find different types of spending are beneficial for frontrunner and long-shot candidates. The results consistently indicate greater early spending works to advantage candidates, suggesting a lack of initial resources is a significant obstacle for candidates who seek to financially benefit from their campaign's performance.

<p>We offer a critical assessment of the politics of the Christian Right and question the degree to which the religious values of the Christian Right are compatible with a democratic political culture. Political action inspired by religious faith should not prevent critical scrutiny of the underlying values, or more importantly, their influence in shaping public debate and public policy. If religious values are indeed political values, then do protections of freedom of religious expression privilege forms of faith-based politics over secular forms? And if so, to what end? We argue that a more nuanced analysis of the intersection of religion and politics is required to ensure that public politics is not threatened by particular forms of religious political activism that exhibit totalitarian tendencies.

<p>The article focuses on the renewal of social conflict seen in France since the 1990s, the most notable episode of which is the 1995 strikes, which helped to reinvigorate commitment and reorganize the social movement landscape. Centering on the social questioning posed by the movements of those without a job, a home or residence papers, and by young, radicalized trade unionists, the renewed criticism opens, at the turn of the century, onto the new cause of counter-globalization. Disagreeing with those who argue for the radical newness of these movements, the article shows how much they are characterized by the hybridization of militant cultures, notably because so many of their activists belong to multiple organizations and because of the constraints of scale that they face.

The article examines the background debate to the referendums in both countries before considering the major issues that dominated the “no” campaigns as well as the issues that motivated the two countries' electorates in their decisions to reject the EU Constitution. The clear polarization of the “no” vote among those from socio-economically less well-off backgrounds is not only the sign of a further widening of the gap between mainstream political elites and their supporters with regard to European integration, but it is also having a significant impact at a party level in terms of the galvanization of Euroskeptic political parties — particularly the radical right.

<p>Numerous scholars have brought to light the impact of corruption on a range of economic and political outcomes. One outcome that has received less attention, however, is voter turnout. Do high levels of corruption push electorates to avoid the polls or to turn out in larger numbers? Though of great consequence to the corruption and voter-turnout literature, few scholars in either area have tackled this question and none has done so in a broad sample of democracies. This article engages in this endeavor through an analysis of the broadest possible sample of democratic states. Through instrumental variable regression we find that as corruption increases the percentage of voters who go to the polls decreases. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Japan's triple disaster of 11 March 2011 partially eclipsed the events of August/September 2009, when over fifty years of single-party dominance by the Liberal Democratic Party ended, and the opposition Democratic Party of Japan took power. This article assesses the new government's first two difficult and chaotic years in power, made all the more so after defeat in the upper house elections of July 2010. In addition, the triple disaster sorely tested Prime Minister Kan Naoto, and created confrontation between him and the nuclear power industry, backed by powerful politicians. The new government, inexperienced and poorly led, made serious errors, but it also had positive achievements. Local initiative helped disaster recovery, but severe structural problems in central politics and government remain. [R]</p>

<p>This paper examines the impact of government actions on social trust after controlling for individual and community characteristics. Using unique individual-level data drawn from the provincial capital cities across China, we find that trust in other people is strongly correlated with government actions. Positive actions by the government that facilitate information flow, including active communication and information transparency, significantly increase trust. Negative actions by the government, including corruption, violent law-enforcement, and abuse of privilege, significantly reduce trust. These actions affect people's trust in the government in similar ways that they affect trust in other people. We also find that most individual characteristics are not strongly related to trust in others, while being a member of the Communist party increases the likelihood of trust. [R]</p>

<p>The article uses the changed landscape of Euroskepticism to look broadly across a set of cases of government participation by parties holding Euroskeptic positions to examine whether government participation has an effect on their European positions and whether participation by Euroskeptic parties in government has had an effect on their European policy. In general, while there does seem to be a moderating effect of government participation on a party's Euroskepticism, there are notable cases of Euroskeptic party participation in government having some discernible impact on policy, but under somewhat specific conditions. The impact is clearly different for major and minor parties and, in the case of the latter, moderating their Euroskepticism is often a signifier of a wider process of party mainstreaming.

<p>Old-fashioned racism (OFR) was unrelated to white Americans' partisan preferences throughout the post-civil rights era.

After first demonstrating that such attitudes were significantly stronger predictors of opposition to Obama than ideologically similar white Democrats, I support that spillover hypothesis with the following evidence: opposition to interracial dating was correlated with white partisanship in 2009 despite being unrelated to party identification in 12 earlier surveys; moreover, evaluations of Obama completely mediated that relationship between OFR and partisanship; old-fashioned racism predicted changes in white panelists' partisanship between 2006 and 2011; these attitudes were also a stronger determinant of midterm vote preferences in 2010 than they were in 2006.

<p>The notion that a strong civil society helps to fight corruption has become a cornerstone of governance policy.

This study theorizes the relationship between civil society and corruption, arguing that civil society's impact depends to a large extent on its ability to generate sufficient public pressure which, in turn, depends on the press being free. Analysis of cross-national and longitudinal data shows that civil society strength is indeed inversely linked to the level of corruption, but the impact is highly dependent on press freedom.

<p>We examine whether fear of terrorism or state characteristics drive American citizens' support for expanding national defense budget for counterterrorism policy. Using Pew Survey data merged with state-level contextual factors, statistical analysis revealed that fear of terrorism does not lead to support for increasing national defense budget, holding other factors constant. However, findings showed that state contextual factors explain Americans' support for increasing national defense budget. Individuals residing in states with a higher number of military causalities are less likely to support increasing national defense spending against terrorism. This finding clearly shows a deterrent effect of war costs on American citizens' support for the US counterterrorism policy. These results contribute to our understanding of the basis of public support for US foreign policy on war-on-terrorism after 9/11 [2001]. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the two decades since the emergence of the EU at Maastricht, there has been a concerted attempt to build a European political space, typified by the debates on constitutionalization and democratization. Much less noticed, but no less important, has been the mobilization of publics, interest groups and political parties against the integration process. In the light of the failure to realize the Laeken objectives, the stabilization of an anti-integration bloc in the EP, recurrent “no” votes in national referendums and the emergence of an increasingly coordinated movement of critical interest groups, we argue that this opposition has become embedded and persistent, at both European and national levels.

However, the websites of candidates who already were in public office other than the presidency had more features than those of out-of-office aspirants; by contrast, the number of years candidates had spent in public office was negatively correlated with the number of features on their websites. Moreover, Democratic candidates' websites were found to offer substantially more features than Republicans'. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Despite comprehensive reform of party finance in Britain, public opinion of party finance remains plagued by perceptions of corruption, undue influence from wealthy donors, carefree and wasteful spending and, more generally, from the perception that there is just “too much money” in politics. We argue that knowledge of and attitudes to party finance matter, not least because advocates of reform have cited public opinion as evidence for reform. However, because attitudes to party finance are part of a broader attitudinal structure, opinion-led reforms are unlikely to succeed in increasing public confidence. Using data generated from YouGov's online panel, we demonstrate that the public know little of the key provisions regulating party finance and attitudes to party finance can be explained along two underlying dimensions: Anti-Party Finance and Reformers.

This article contests this view arguing that although the term was first coined during the mid-1980s in Britain, its features were present since the early stages of integration. Pointing to its changing nature over time, it calls for a holistic approach that would examine the phenomenon beyond the study of party politics and public opinion. It urges scholars to explicitly treat Euroskepticism as an “independent” as well as a “dependent” variable. The next generation should be identifying and explaining different patterns of opposition to the EU, and focusing on their implications for the process of European integration, the direction of EU policy, domestic European politics and the development of EU studies.

<p>The 2012 French presidential election witnessed an increase in discussion about the EU and its policies. To an equal degree, the two top contenders, N. Sarkozy and F. Hollande, criticized European policies and promised to rectify EU mistakes, if elected. European institutions and decisions became scapegoats for domestic failures and tough economic choices, reflecting a long-term surge in Euroskepticism among French voters, especially in comparison to EU averages. Both candidates sought advantage by engaging in “EU-Negative” campaigns to be able to mobilize as many potential voters as possible. Surprisingly, a half-year of EU criticisms has not led, at least in the short term, to a further increase in anti-EU positions in the public opinion. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2256]</p>

<p>This article examines how the most militant cross-sections of the Italian extreme Left have conceptualized and sought to frame a political position towards Islamism. By analyzing the writings of <italic>La Voce</italic>, a publication edited by individuals closely linked to the Red Brigades, it outlines the mixed and somewhat confused feelings of Italian militants towards groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, al Qaeda and the Taliban. The admiration for these groups' ability to challenge American, Israeli and Western imperialism is mixed with a criticism of some of their “backwards” views. However, Italian Leftists are firm in the conviction that Communist ideology will eventually return victorious, picking up the anti-imperialist struggle initiated by Islamist groups.

<p>This paper explains the characteristics and internal mechanisms of protest activity and solidarity among Russia's industrial workers over the past two decades. Both academic discussions and officials' attitudes toward protests prove contradictory. Even in periods of increase, labor activism has remained limited. Yet authorities continue to show concern about real and potential discontent, while academics puzzle over the dominance of quiescence as well as the reasons for sporadic activism. The research advances our understanding of both: the limits of protest, and the causes, forms and goals of Russian labor's periodic collective activism. We rely on a combination of available statistical and recent survey data to try to resolve the paradoxes of labor's quiescence and conflict, as well as elites' neglect and concern.

<p>Latin American women are less likely than Latin American men to express a preference for democracy. This gender gap in support for democracy is partly a function of the level of attachment that women as a group have for the democratic regime, and this level of attachment is determined by the mode in which democratic transition occurs. Four models examining the gendered attitude-toward-regime decision in seventeen countries over four time periods show that when women are involved as significant political actors at the time of the democratic transition, their support for democracy varies in ways similar to their male counterparts. When women have lesser roles, gender-specific behaviors emerge. [R]</p>

<p>The French elections of 2012 resulted in an unprecedented and overwhelming victory by France's Socialist Party, which gained control of the presidency and an absolute majority in the National Assembly to go with the party's existing domination of most of France's regions and municipalities. But the Socialist Party remains a minority party in the French electoral body politic, its victory the result of a skewered two-ballot electoral system. The Socialist government, moreover, remains hampered in its action by its obligations toward the EU and its participation in the Euro-zone countries as it attempts to deal with France's economic crisis. As a consequence of these phenomena, the government may also be sitting atop a profound political crisis characterized by the alienation of a good part of the electorate from the political system.

<p>This article uses an experimental design embedded in two US national surveys to offer direct systematic evidence of international law's effect on mass attitudes. To provide a relatively tough test for international law, the surveys examine public attitudes toward the use of torture, an issue in which national security concerns are often considered paramount. Contrary to the common contention of international law's inefficacy, I find that legal commitments have a discernible impact on public support for the use of torture. The effect of international law is also strongest in those contexts where pressures to resort to torture are at their highest. However, the effects of different dimensions in the level of international agreements' legalization are far from uniform. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We examined women's participation in village self-governance in an Eastern Chinese county. While they have more or less been universally participating in voting in village elections, their representation in the village self-governance bodies remains low, and their political aspiration and sense of empowerment remain limited. A wide range of factors contribute to this situation. In general, women enjoy a much lower level of education and are economically dependent upon male members of their families. Social gender, or the stereotypes of women as less competent and are expected to stay away from public affairs, plays a very significant role too. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper focuses on the relationship between national security and environmentalism in South Korea. The 2009 South Korean Presidential Committee on Green Growth set a long-term vision for South Korea to “go green”. This is promoted as a new state-led development paradigm and a response to new global security risks. The paper identifies official and unofficial contested narratives on development, environmentalism and national security. By focusing on civil society movements, the paper identifies challenges to the exclusionary realist and liberal institutional approaches to South Korea's Green Growth initiative. These alternative discourses of national security are unpacking and reconstructing the relationship between development and environmentalism through the question of who defines “national security” and for whose interests.

<p>New Labour staked much politically on its ability to enact a trouble-free shift in underlying economic subjectivities so as to nurture responsibly self-sufficient welfare citizens. This policy began merely as the requirement for benefit claimants to become active worker subjects in the interests of enhanced employability. More problematically, it ended as the requirement for as many people as possible to become much more tension-prone active worker-saver-investor subjects in the interests of enhanced private pension insurance. The article charts the collapse of New Labour's reputation for economic governing competence as these latter subjects' accumulated asset wealth threatened to implode during the recent financial crisis. The G. Brown government [was] able to defend either the financial interests of responsibly self-sufficient welfare citizens or its own reputation for macroeconomic responsibility, but not both.

<p>This book provides a comprehensive accounts of Russian opinion during the twenty years since the fall of communism. Based on a carefully weighted sample of respondents, it makes full allowance for the great variations of opinions according to age, income group and place of residence. It also allows for changes in opinion by drawing on surveys of earlier years. The finished product provides a wealth of information on subjects ranging from leisure to moral attitudes. The book sees little conclusive evidence of xenophobic attitudes towards the outside world, and suggests that ethnic hatred within Russia is a reflection of stress rather than racism. One salient finding is that very few Russians support the idea of the “minimum state” or unregulated free market. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What explains local variation in electoral manipulation in countries with ongoing internal conflict? The theory of election fraud developed here relies on the candidates' loyalty networks as the agents manipulating the electoral process. It predicts (1) that the relationship between violence and fraud follows an inverted U-shape and (2) that loyalty networks of both incumbent and challenger react differently to the security situation on the ground. Disaggregated violence and election results data from the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election provide empirical results consistent with this theory. Fraud is measured both by a forensic measure, and by using results from a visual inspection of a random sample of the ballot boxes. The results align with the two predicted relationships, and are robust to other violence and fraud measures. [R]</p>

<p>How can authoritarian states credibly signal their intentions in international crises? Nationalist, anti-foreign protests are one mechanism by which authoritarian leaders can visibly demonstrate their domestic vulnerability. Because protests in authoritarian states are risky and costly to repress, the decision to allow or stifle popular mobilization is informative. The threat of instability demonstrates resolve, and the cost of concession increases the credibility of a tough stance. The danger of instability and escalation increases foreign incentives to make concessions and preserve the status quo. This logic helps explain the pattern of authoritarian tolerance and repression toward nationalist protest. A case study of two US-China crises shows how China's management of anti-American protests affected US beliefs about Chinese resolve. [R]</p>

<p>Before analyzing the content of Germany's Left Party [_Die Linke_] program, agreed upon in October 2011, it is essential to first see it in its historical context and assess its significance within the party itself. Left-wing party programs in Germany have always signaled inner-party developments and relations of forces. The program is not Marxist and does not set out to be, for which there are specific reasons. The most important task confronting the program was its analysis of contemporary capitalism and this it has achieved quite well. Roughly half of the program is devoted to “left-wing reform projects”, among which two reform projects in the social security system caused major disagreements: unconditional minimum basic income and publicly funded employment.</p>

<p>Both the Arab Spring of 2011 and the “revolutions” of 1848 swept with dramatic speed across whole regions, but ended up yielding rather limited advances toward political liberalism and democracy. I seek to uncover the causal mechanisms that help account for these striking parallels. I argue that contention spread so quickly because many people in a wide range of countries drew rash inferences from the downfall of Tunisia's dictator. Applying cognitive heuristics that psychologists have documented, they jumped to the conclusion that they could successfully challenge their own autocrats. This precipitation prompted protests in many settings that actually were much less propitious; therefore problems abounded. Cognitive shortcuts held such sway because Arab societies were weakly organized and repressed and thus lacked leaders from whom common people could take authoritative cues. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article appraises an economic initiative developed by members of the New Left in the UK in the form of “A Socialist Wages Plan”, written by K. Alexander and J. Hughes. Their proposal was significant, coming at a time when some commentators argued the Labour Party was seeking to mimic aspects of the Swedish social democratic model and because of the measures adopted by the 1964–1970 Labour government. The hostility from scholars and political activists generated by the pamphlet is discussed, demonstrating how their ideas fared during the first years of H. Wilson's Labour government and concluding that they had virtually no impact on the trajectory adopted by that administration. “A Socialist Wages Plan” did reflect some similarities to the anti-inflationary approach adopted by the Swedish social democrats.

<p>This article examines right-wing populism and populist rhetoric in Norway preceding the July 2011 terror attacks at Utøya and in Oslo. It describes how the mainstream media, academics, and political parties have appealed to the public in an increasingly populist fashion and have spread fear about immigration, immigrants, and integration. While the populist right-wing Progress Party has adopted immigration and integration as its main cause and has gained support because of it, the media are also responsible for the way immigration, culture, and race have been reported, as are a wide range of politicians for formulating increasingly stricter immigration policies. After [the attacks], politicians became acutely concerned about their own anti-immigrant rhetoric and how it may have influenced the terrorist Anders Behring Breivik.

<p>During the dramatic upheavals and conflicts that have accompanied political independence in Timor-Leste, Timorese activists have made an important, sometimes overlooked, contribution. This paper highlights the significant roles they played at three major turning points over the past 15 years — the Santa Cruz massacre in 1991, the UN-sponsored independence ballot in 1999 and the political-military crisis in 2006. Each one of these events was a starting point for a new phase in Timorese development history and a new phase in the growth of Timorese civil society. The personal reflections of Timorese activists provide poignant insight into their changing focus of activism as Timor-Leste became independent. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Ideology is a central concept in research on American public opinion, yet it continues to be used in crude ways. Recognizing both the widespread use of the seven-point scale, and its numerous problems, we provide new findings on how ideology is used by survey respondents, the attitudinal correlates of ideological self-assignment, and the impact of education on ideological constraint. From these findings, we propose an alternative coding strategy that uses dummy variables for each ideological pole, which are then interacted with a three-point educational scale. Replicating past research on vote choice, racial attitudes, and respect for gay rights, we show that this new scheme generates more precise statistical estimates and offers new substantive insights into the relationship between ideology and a host of political outcomes.

The research builds on a wide variety of sources in order to explain the complex processes at work that have led to this social phenomenon. I show that these groups signify a fundamental trend in Russian political culture rather than operating on the margins of it, and that they are the result of political reformations in the country and the spread of global capitalism.

<p>This article tests G. Smith's <italic>[Democratic Innovations: Designing Institutions for Citizen Participation</italic>, Cambridge, 2009] broad-based democratic goods analytical framework on what is often perceived to be a highly successful democratic innovation: Downing Street e-petitions. It accepted 33,058 petitions receiving 12,384,616 signatures. Downing Street made 3,258 official replies. Given that it is arguably the most prominent e-democratic innovation in the world to date, the lack of empirical research is very surprising-and worrying-because the perceived success has led to the wider adoption of e-petitions. This article (1) tests the veracity of the democratic goods approach for case study research, with a view to streamlining it for future work; (2) provides the first detailed, theoretically informed analysis of Downing Street e-petitions; and (3) makes recommendations for the application of such systems more broadly.

<p>This article examines the use of material appeals for voter support using evidence taken from the case of the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Two types of material appeal co-exist in this case. Clientelist politics, in the form of vote-buying, and the distribution of public resources as political patronage, are features of state politics. Parties also use programmatic policies which offer benefits to beneficiaries regardless of partisan affiliation. The interest in universal provision can be traced back to elite policy preferences in the early 1980s. The article shows that competition within a clientelist political system need not lead to the intensification of clientelism. Political parties may dilute their clientelist strategy by the addition of some programmatic policies. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>There are two meanings to the “failure” of the New Left: to some extent the left will always fail because it stands for utopian ideals that will never be accomplished. This failure is in fact a kind of success, because it means that the Left still pursues its long-term program for overall equality. The reasons for the marginalization of the left since the 1970s are complex, but it did not happen overnight. The key to previous crises lies in the duty of equality, and its reinvention.</p>
