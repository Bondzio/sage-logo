<p>The dot-com boom spawned many start-ups. The web was new, software expertise was in demand, and entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the expansion of information technology. In <italic>The Company We Keep</italic>, Daniel Marschall chronicles the rise and fall of one dot-com start-up, which he calls IntenSivity. Like so many companies formed during this period, it offered challenge and excitement for technologists, many of whom sought to develop not only new software but also a work environment in which collaboration and creativity were part of the corporate mission. Like so many other start-ups, IntenSivity could not survive the downturn. Its offices closed, and its employees dispersed. Yet as Marschall explains, the experience of those heady days lives on in more than memory. For IntenSivity’s technologists, the connections forged in the boom years remain strong, and the network these workers maintain continues to shape their careers.</p>
<p>Marschall locates the story of IntenSivity in a critique of the network society and an extension of the notion of an occupational community. Rather than relics of the industrial era, he explains, occupational communities can thrive in the internet age. In today’s network society, they mediate elements of work relationships, offering participants timely information and mitigating some of the risks of precarious employment. In the place-based community of IntenSivity, the technologists he followed promoted their common identity. Supremely self-assured, they were an exclusive group of technical experts selected for their shared values and high-level skills. Driven by a commitment to quality, they expressed disdain for “chumpy companies” that compromised products in the service of corporate expediency. Continuing to express these values in online exchange, long after IntenSivity closed its doors, they now constitute a network occupational community.</p>
<p>In Marschall’s narrative, this community emerges as a result of both organizational structure, with its ever-shifting project teams, and organizational culture, with a series of “missives” delivered by the company’s founders. Marschall attends carefully to these documents, analyzing their context, substance, and tone. The messages in these missives, he argues, are evidence of workers’ own normative identities as elite practitioners, carefully chosen to meet company goals. This self-definition endured, he explains, even as IntenSivity altered its business model, partnering with “chumpy companies” that, many believed, diluted innovation and compromised the mission. For those who had joined IntenSivity in its early days, the decision to become “more corporate” drew clear boundaries that excluded some new hires. New offices lacking common spaces then reinforced hierarchies, with the founders increasingly distant and collaboration constrained.</p>
<p>The core identity of this community thus came first from above, flowing from founders to technologists, who arrive predisposed to participate in a collegial culture that valorizes innovation but is nonetheless subject to control. Then, as the founders changed course, seeking new business in a faltering economy, the community sought to maintain its own boundaries, upholding quality standards even when told to “take a bullet for the team.” Members of IntenSivity’s technological elite then assumed responsibility for defining their common identity, often in contrast with their customers. Presumably, therefore, horizontal ties between them became increasingly important. Yet horizontal communication receives less attention, with little data from team meetings or informal exchange, either in person or online. Despite the author’s extended presence in the setting, the book contains few examples of daily interaction, which might have augmented the picture of an emerging collectivity, capable of maintaining a membership over time.</p>
<p>Marschall might also have considered the influence of a broader occupational culture. Research on technical professionals has documented a similar focus on competence, a masculine culture idealizing individual heroics, and a disdain for managers and companies that fail to prioritize quality and innovation. He might further have compared this community with other online networks. Expansion of the web made possible a great many sites of virtual exchange, with listserves dedicated to specific groups of users and developers who share information about occupational practice. Placed in this broader context, the story of IntenSivity might explain elements of commonality or difference that could elaborate the notion of a network occupational community. How, for example, might this community, forged through face-to-face interaction, differ from one formed in cyberspace, where members have no shared experience offline?</p>
<p>Marschall does make a convincing argument: Network occupational communities can be a significant source of identity for practitioners, providing a reference group long after members’ affiliation with an employer. Operating as nodes in a network society, these communities can constantly reconfigure and respond to changing needs. The alumni of IntenSivity thus represent more than an association of nostalgic technologists recalling the rush of the dot- com boom. Attuned to each other’s concerns, community members provide ongoing connection and support. Network exchange, Marschall suggests, offers advantages for mobile workers, who unlike their industrial predecessors must constantly adapt to changing conditions in a new economy.</p>
