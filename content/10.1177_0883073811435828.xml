<abstract>
<p>The indications of brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in fetal alcohol syndrome are not clearly defined, even though the condition is recognized as one of the most common causes of mental retardation. This article reports a case of a 9-year-old adopted girl with developmental delay, mildly dysmorphic facial features, and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Extensive investigations including genetic studies and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities, and a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was considered since official diagnostic criteria were met. A brain SPECT was requested and showed severely decreased tracer activity in the thalami, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes on both sides, the overall findings being consistent with the established diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. With increasing availability of functional brain imaging, the study indications and possible ethical implications in suspected prenatal alcohol exposure or even before adoption need further consideration. In this patient, SPECT was the only test to yield positive results.</p>

<p>Although possible links between fetal damage and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy were documented even in the 19th century,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811435828">1</xref></sup> the first studies showing detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain development date back to the early 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811435828">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811435828">3</xref></sup> The first report involving brain imaging in fetal alcohol syndrome was published in 1992,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811435828">4</xref></sup> and only recent advances in brain imaging techniques have allowed more detailed in vivo studies. Despite potential functional impairments, most patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders do not present with evidence of detectable structural abnormalities. Clinical presentation in such cases may vary from general cognitive deficits, poor socialization skills, and significant learning disabilities to subtle behavioral and emotional problems without any signs of developmental delay or physical growth deficiencies. The diagnosis can be challenging in this situation, especially when no history is available, and functional brain imaging may provide additional clues.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 9-year-old girl with clinical history of short stature, microcephaly, abnormal facial features, and pervasive developmental delay and an extensive psychiatric history was referred for a brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The child was adopted from Russia at the age of 2 years. Her family history and medical history were unknown prior to adoption. Developmentally, at 2.5 years the child was walking but not well and had minimal language abilities. Subsequently, her walking and speech improved, but she displayed a complex pattern of behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. The child experienced learning difficulties, repeated kindergarten twice, and was attending elementary school with educational modifications for autism. Her psychiatric history was significant for 3 previous short-term psychiatric hospitalizations for reactive attachment disorders, for psychosis accompanied by visual and auditory hallucinations, and for severe self-injurious behaviors, accordingly. The last hospitalization was more than 1 year ago. Her current medications included guanfacine 1 mg daily orally and aripiprazole 5 mg in the morning and 7.5 mg at bedtime orally.</p>
<p>Her physical examination was significant for underweight (&lt;5th percentile) and short stature (&lt;5th percentile). Her parents had been told by physical and occupational therapists that she had an immature voice, immature hands and feet, and mildly dysmorphic facial features including slight micrognathia and mildly down-slanting eyes. The parents also noted that she had intermittent drooping of her left eyelid, precipitated by chewing or sucking on a straw. She has never had episodes concerning for seizure activity. Neurological examination was nonfocal.</p>
<p>Her complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, celiac panel, and liver and thyroid function tests showed no abnormalities. Extensive metabolic investigations, including testing for insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, plasma amino acids and organic acid quantitation, vitamin D and B<sub>12</sub> levels, acylcarnitine profile, plasma lactate and pyruvate levels and ratio, creatine kinase levels, methylmalonic acid level, urine organic acids, transferrin isoelectric focusing for congenital disorders of glycosylation, and acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies, showed no distinct abnormalities. The child also underwent a complete genetic evaluation (genome wide oligonucleotide-based comparative genomic hybridization array [135 K], 610-K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] array, aristaless related homeobox gene [ARX] gene sequencing, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 [CDKL5] gene sequencing, methyl CpG binding protein 2 [MECP2] gene sequencing and deletion/duplication studies, full gene analysis for Rett syndrome [RETT] panel, which revealed no abnormalities to account for her symptoms.</p>
<p>Bilateral knee radiograph showed normal mineralization of bones without evidence of rickets. Her electroencephalograph (EEG) was normal with no lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (sagittal and axial spin echo T1, axial and coronal TSE T2, axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, postcontrast axial, sagittal and coronal spin echo T1, axial diffusion weighted imaging) showed diffuse prominence of the cerebral and cerebellar sulci, which was nonspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811435828">Figure 1</xref>). There was minimal asymmetry of the lateral ventricles (left greater than right) within limits of normal anatomic variation. Nonspecific small areas of signal abnormality were also noted in the periventricular white matter, more prominent on the right side, considered to likely represent gliosis. There were no other abnormalities and no midline shift, intracranial mass lesions, or abnormal fluid collections. The visualized major intracranial vessels appeared patent without areas of abnormal enhancement following contrast administration.</p>

<p>The child was referred to the nuclear medicine department for a cerebral perfusion imaging study. Brain SPECT images were obtained following intravenous injection of 18.8 mCi of Tc-99 m ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) (bicisate dihydrochloride [Neurolite]). The study showed severely decreased tracer concentration in the thalami on both sides with only minimal faint activity visualized in the thalamic region. Significantly decreased tracer activity was also noted in basal ganglia on both sides. Decreased tracer activity was noted in both temporal lobes. The images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811435828">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome is recognized as the most common known cause of mental retardation, affecting from 1 to 7 per 1000 live-born infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811435828">5</xref></sup> It is estimated that the current prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in populations of younger school children may be as high as 2% to 5% in the United States and some Western European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811435828">6</xref></sup> Clinical presentation, however, can vary greatly and may be related to the amount of alcohol consumed during pregnancy, timing of prenatal exposure, and maternal health as well as genetic influences. Thus, many children with developmental brain damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure can exhibit milder features, making the diagnosis difficult. This could be especially challenging in adopted children whose history is not available.</p>
<p>Both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811435828">7</xref></sup> and the revised Institute of Medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811435828">8</xref></sup> guidelines recommend that certain criteria be fully met for a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. These include (1) evidence for growth retardation at or below the 10th percentile for either height or weight; (2) facial features indicating fetal alcohol syndrome; (3) central nervous system damage, which may present as clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment; and (4) confirmed or unknown prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, according to the official guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811435828">7</xref></sup> and the Institute of Medicine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811435828">8</xref></sup> a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome is still possible in cases when prenatal alcohol exposure is unknown if other key features are present at clinical levels. This child underwent extensive investigations and met the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome. In fact, this was the referral diagnosis, established in a specialized center before a brain SPECT examination was requested. Interestingly, brain SPECT was the only study that revealed positive findings in this patient, who underwent multiple investigations after adoption.</p>
<p>Apart from commonly noticed overall reduction in brain volume in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroimaging studies showed specific structural abnormalities most commonly involving corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811435828">9</xref></sup> Reductions in the size of the thalamus and even fusion of thalamus and caudate nuclei across the midline have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811435828">10</xref></sup> Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated significant diffusion abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome extending beyond the corpus callosum, particularly involving commissural and temporal connections, as well as deep gray matter areas of the brain, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811435828">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>However, in clinical practice, the role of functional brain imaging studies in children with prenatal alcohol exposure still needs to be established, this representing a relatively new area. In a study that aimed to correlate the structural and functional brain integrity in children who had relatively mild intellectual deficits but met the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome, Clark et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811435828">12</xref></sup> reported decreases in relative regional cerebral metabolic rates in 5 brain regions comprising the thalamus and basal ganglia. Interestingly, only 1 MRI of the brain was found to be abnormal in this cohort of 19 patients, and the abnormality was detected in the subject with the lowest IQ. In a separate study, Cortese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811435828">13</xref></sup> reported elevated levels of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the left caudate nucleus in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Significant correlations between increased choline/creatine ratio in the brain and duration of in utero ethanol exposure were also reported in primates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811435828">14</xref></sup> Of note is that these alterations occurred in the absence of gross structural brain anomalies detectable by MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811435828">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the basal ganglia–thalamus complex in children with microcephaly but normal brain structures on MRI examination has also been reported in patients with glucose transporter type 1 (Glut1) deficiency of the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811435828">15</xref></sup> The syndrome typically presents with epilepsy that shows positive EEG findings, neurological abnormalities (hyperreflexia, Babinski reflexes, terminal tremor), hypoglycorrhachia, neuroglycopenia, and no improvement with medical treatment. This patient had no history of seizures, no genetic abnormalities after extensive investigations, a normal EEG, and clinical symptoms related to fetal alcohol syndrome (growth retardation below the 10th percentile, facial abnormalities, visual and auditory hallucinations, prior psychiatric hospitalizations for psychosis). However, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency should be included in differential diagnosis in such cases.</p>
<p>With the increasing number of published reports, the role of functional brain imaging in the diagnostic workup of fetal alcohol syndrome is progressively gaining support, especially in conditions in which gross structural brain abnormalities may be absent. Retrospective studies have shown that as many as 28% of children adopted from outside the United States subsequently developed phenotypic facial features (using strict criteria) suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811435828">16</xref></sup> Studies performed outside the United States reported instances when more than half of residents of the orphanages had intermediate or high phenotypic expression scores suggesting prenatal exposure to alcohol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811435828">17</xref></sup> The percentage of children expressing functional or intellectual deficits without associated structural abnormalities remains largely unknown and can be even higher. In this situation, the possible indications for functional brain imaging before adoption may need to be addressed, not only in terms of medical indications but also in terms of complex ethical issues involving patient autonomy and potential side effects from the procedure versus legal obligation of the adopting parent to provide a standard of care for the child, which may be lifelong in fetal alcohol syndrome.</p>
