<p><sc>The articles in this issue of the journal</sc> emerged from a two-year collaborative project undertaken by the Center for the Arts &amp; Humanities at Colgate University and the Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry at Emory University. Jonathan Jacobs and Martine Brownley, the directors of the respective centers, knew each other from contexts other than this project and they found that they shared some common concerns about the place of the humanities in the contemporary university and in intellectual culture more broadly. The humanities and arts seem to be increasingly regarded as less than essential to the mission of many universities and colleges. There are several reasons for this, and the evidence for it includes the fact that, in recent years, several departments in humanities disciplines at institutions of higher education have been shut down or consolidated with other departments and programs – sometimes in ways that make some measure of intellectual and academic sense, sometimes in ways reflecting more dubious rationales. That trend reflects a very serious, larger trend, a key feature of which is a widely shared tone-deafness to the significance of the humanities as part of the self-understanding of contemporary culture and the world as well as being crucial to understanding the past. The self-understanding attained by humanistic studies makes a critical difference to what sorts of people we are and aspire to be, and to what sort of world we shape and bequeath to future generations.</p>
<p>The concerns expressed in these articles are not a matter of certain constituencies of academics trying to protect their ‘turf’ or promoting their self-interest in times of financial stress at universities. The argument that the humanities and arts are vitally important to liberal education and that liberal education is vitally important to society, politics, and culture in general needs to be made more effectively and needs to reach a wider audience. Unfortunately, scholars in the humanities have not been especially vigorous in explaining to others the nature and importance of what they teach and what they study. This project emerged from the shared sense that scholars in the humanities should non-defensively make the case for the humanities in liberal arts education because matters of the first importance and completely general importance – matters much more important than the self-interest of certain groups of scholars – are at stake.</p>
<p>The result was the formation of a working group on each campus, the groups working independently and also collaboratively. The aim was to seek clarity about the issues, become more informed about them, and hopefully attain a level of articulateness that would resonate with colleagues in humanities and non-humanities disciplines and with others, whoever they might be, with a genuine interest in the character and content of education and scholarship. These articles are an invitation to what should be wider, more public discussion and debate about education and scholarship. They are a challenge to those who are comfortable in the opinion that the humanities and arts are charming cultural accessories – when affordable – but not essential to understanding the world and to self-understanding. They are a challenge to those who believe that ‘real’ knowledge is attained only in the sciences, to those who think that the arts and humanities do not engage, illuminate or explain the ‘real’ world.</p>
<p>The challenge is offered by way of argument, analysis, and illustration. The issues at stake for the authors are not the fates of department budgets or preserving faculty positions despite declining enrollments. Such things are symptomatic of something more significant, namely, what sorts of intellectual aspiration are to be encouraged and supported, and what sorts of intellectual responsibility are to be valued in contemporary education. We hope that readers will take up those questions and will discuss them in depth and widely, including in such discussions individuals and groups whose views regarding university education have an impact on the shape and direction of it, whether or not they themselves are scholars. Motivating such discussions is a chief aim of the articles overall.</p>
<p>While the articles have been influenced by conversation within and between the working groups at Colgate and Emory they have not been planned in such a way that each author has had a particular ‘assignment’ to make a specific point. The articles reflect liberal education in a more genuine way than that. Each author has selected his or her own focus, and has articulated the relevant considerations, as he or she understands them. At the same time, all of the authors have tried to write in such a way that the articles are accessible to educated persons generally, and not only to scholars in the humanities and the arts. In fact, one of the authors is a natural scientist, and we are especially grateful for his contribution.</p>
<p>We should note at the outset that we are aware that at different institutions departments are organized into academic divisions in different ways. The question of which disciplines properly belong in the humanities is not a pronounced concern of these articles. Instead, the focus is on the character and significance of humanistic education and scholarship. Debates about the organization of universities are not merely tangential or insignificant, but they are not the present, primary concern. The chief issues do not depend on a highly specific, fixed conception of exactly what belongs to the humanities as a matter of institutional organization.</p>
<p>Jan Parker and the editorial staff of <italic>Arts and Humanities in Higher Education</italic> deserve many thanks for devoting an issue of the journal to the Colgate/Emory collaboration. This project has depended on the willingness, interest, and effort of colleagues at Colgate and Emory. I am very grateful to the members of the two working groups – and to Martine Brownley especially – for their commitment, their insights, and their wisdom. The presence of such scholars in the academy is a reason for optimism regarding the prospects for the humanities and the arts.</p>
