<p>Kenny, a young ninth grade “gem in the gutter,” opens up Vajra Watson’s <italic>Learning to Liberate: Community-Based Solutions to the Crisis in Urban Education</italic> (p. xviii). Bright and talented but struggling in school, Kenny is emblematic of many “at-risk” designated youth who educators, especially those in under-resourced schools and communities, have met, taught, worried about, and been inspired by. Watson’s experiences working intensively with Kenny and later seeing him drop out and face significant barriers to his educational and professional successes inform her analysis. Kenny, she says, taught her “that simply having an excellent teacher and/or mentor with good intentions will not suffice” for youth on the fringes of the American educational system (p. xx). <italic>Learning to Liberate</italic>, then, while marking a significant contribution to research on innovative pedagogies that can address educational achievement gaps in the United States, is also a personal tale of the search for an answer to the question of “what works?” for “gutter gems” like Kenny.</p>
<p>Drawing on three years of ethnographic data, multiple in-depth interviews, and the biographies of four innovative urban educators in the San Francisco Bay Area, Watson presents a picture of how schools “can embrace the hood in a way that is for the common good” (p. xxi). Her use of portraiture methodology allows for a unique analytical narrative that uses vivid storytelling to invite the reader “into each moment, where a lively, authentic, and multi-faceted reality unfolds” (p. 7). True to the method, Watson’s book keeps the reader engaged while simultaneously presenting a comprehensive analysis of four urban educators’ strategies for teaching hard-to-reach youth. By carefully examining the day-to-day work, beliefs, pedagogical orientations, and practical tools these four “best of the best” teachers use, she “dispel(s) and demystify(ies) the notion of a ‘miracle worker’” and replaces it with a model that other educators can utilize to educate high-risk students—one centered on communication, community building, compassion, and commitment (p. 6).</p>
<p>Dereca Blackmon and her work with West Oakland’s Leadership Excellence (LE) program, illustrate the “pedagogy of communication.” LE, which is run by and for African American students, has three primary initiatives: Oakland Freedom School, a six-week summer literacy and leadership program for kids ages 5–13; Camp Akili, a six-day summer overnight retreat and consciousness-raising program for teens ages 14–18; and Camp Alkebulan, a two-week program in West Africa where students study and engage in community improvement projects. Blackmon embraces mutual communication and fosters reciprocal learning processes where teachers and students talk to and learn from one another on a regular basis. Small class sizes, culturally-relevant literature and lessons, analysis of racism and other forms of oppression, and tactics that draw on and respect students’ knowledge of the world facilitate this focus on communication.</p>
<p>Rudy Corpuz, Jr., a former gang leader and street hustler, founded United Playaz (UP), a San Francisco non-profit that works with youth on the margins of the educational system. UP uses what Watson calls the “pedagogy of community” to try to get youth “bangin in a different way” (p. 75). For Corpuz, developing students’ leadership skills and supporting them in their educational careers essentially translates into cultivating a group of community activists who “bang to save our neighborhoods” (p. 77). UP students connect their learning directly with the needs of their school and home communities. They meet weekly to plan and direct projects with local impact. For example, UP students raise monies for an emergency fund that they use to assist struggling families when financial crises hit. Community development plays a central role in United Playaz.</p>
<p>Victor Damian embodies the “pedagogy of compassion.” Through Youth Task Force (YTF), Damian works with students who have been in prison, foster care, mental health facilities, and special education programs. Using writing projects, spoken-word poetry slams, and other creative activities, he gives youth the space to remove their tough “fronts” or “masks” and share with one another. He provides intense emotional support and opens himself up alongside his students so that they are not alone in making themselves vulnerable. Damian’s compassion and focus on “nourishment” of individual students allows them to develop their voices (p. 113). Thanks to his work, YTF participants use those voices to “talk back” to the system/s that once (or still) entangle/d them. Paid a nominal amount to participate, YTF teens work as consultants to government agencies by writing reports and making policy recommendations informed by their experiences.</p>
<p>Jack Jacqua, a white man and near-lifelong activist in minority communities, embodies the “pedagogy of commitment.” Jacqua’s commitment to combating violence and imprisonment and, probably more importantly, his consistent presence in the San Francisco neighborhoods he works in garnered him a reputation as a first-class educator. Jacqua is a co-founder of Omega Boys Club, a program that currently serves over 12,000 youth in schools, colleges, and detention centers. Omega has its own community center, offers a range of classes at its Leadership Academy and inside prisons, provides individual counseling for inmates, and hosts a training institute for practitioners who want to work on combatting violence in their own communities. Jacqua utilizes peer education (i.e., asking those who have “been there” to teach), love for those he works with, spirituality, listening closely, and holding people to very high standards to empower his students.</p>
<p>In <italic>Learning to Liberate</italic>, Vajra Watson uses Jacqua, Watson, Corpuz, and Damian’s stories to provide a carefully researched answer to the schooling failures that well-intentioned educational reforms have so far been unable to repair. She makes a compelling argument against the “intellectual violence” schools visit upon their students in the form of low expectations, irrelevant curriculum, and strict discipline policies that can and do push young people out of school and into the streets. Rather than offering piecemeal policy changes, Watson suggests a “deeper paradigm shift rooted in the very purpose of school” (p. 11). Her in-depth portraits of four urban educators offer a clear vision of what that paradigm shift looks like. Dereca Blackmon, Rudy Corpuz, Jr., Victor Damian, and Jack Jacqua may emphasize communication, community, compassion, and commitment differently, but they all balance these priorities. Each of these educators draws on a series of practices that their years in the field demonstrate can work with high-risk youth. They disrupt didactic teaching practices and replace them with reciprocal learning strategies. They empower youth to become community-building leaders in their own neighborhoods. They listen to youth carefully (or do what Corpuz calls “ear hustlin”) and allow student perspectives to guide the learning process. They hold students to high academic standards. They allow youth to develop and articulate their own visions for success. They prioritize low student-to-teacher ratios. They bring street life into classrooms without glorifying or demonizing it so that lessons are relevant to students’ experiences. Finally, they build and maintain open, genuine, and trusting teacher-student relationships. As Watson convincingly argues, these approaches, when embodied in or offered as a supplement to classrooms with teachers highly trained in academic content, have the potential to “…not only break the cycle of social reproduction in the lives of poor urban youth; [but] replace it with <italic>social resistance</italic>” (p. 6).</p>
