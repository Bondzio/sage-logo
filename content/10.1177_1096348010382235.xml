<p>The objective of the study was to examine how first-time and repeat visitors develop loyalty differently. A multiple group analysis in LISREL was conducted using data collected from a major tourism destination in the southern United States. The findings revealed that (a) repeat visitors reported higher levels of revisit and referral intentions (used to infer destination loyalty) compared with first-time visitors and (b) previous experiences moderated the relationship between tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty—satisfaction played a more important role in leading to loyalty for first-timers than for repeaters. The theoretical and managerial implications were drawn based on the study findings, and recommendations for future researchers were made.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies that have examined tourist satisfaction and market segmentation suggest that it is crucial for destination managers to develop better understanding of specific segments of consumers to accommodate their distinct needs and wants and establish efficient and effective marketing and promotion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348010382235">Kim, Wei, &amp; Ruys, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010382235">Mykletun, Crotts, &amp; Mykletun, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010382235">Oppermann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010382235">Sonmez &amp; Graefe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010382235">Veen &amp; Verhallen, 1986</xref>). Since many attractions and tourist destinations rely heavily on the repeat visitor segment, it would be of prime interest for destination managers to gain more knowledge on the repeater segment: how repeat visitors develop loyalty differently from first-time visitors, how previous experience can affect visitors’ image perception and future behavior, and how repeat and first-time visitors’ perceptions of destination image and satisfaction may influence their loyalty.</p>
<p>A number of empirical works revealed that previous experiences with a destination were likely to influence the perceived destination image and future behavior; a higher number of visits with a destination would result in more positive image of the destination as well as higher interests and likelihood to revisit it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010382235">Baloglu &amp; Mangaloglu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010382235">Chon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010382235">Echtner &amp; Ritchie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010382235">Hu &amp; Ritchie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010382235">Milman &amp; Pizam, 1995</xref>). Studies also suggested a close relationship between previous experiences and consumer satisfaction and loyalty; repeat visitors were more likely to be satisfied with their travel experiences and were more likely to return and spread positive word-of-mouth (WOM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010382235">Gyte &amp; Phelps, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010382235">Juaneda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010382235">Oppermann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010382235">Petrick &amp; Sirakaya, 2004</xref>). Even though studies indicated that both previous visits and satisfaction were determinants of the revisit intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010382235">Kozak &amp; Rimmington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010382235">Mazursky, 1989</xref>), researchers reported contradictory findings regarding the magnitude of the influence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010382235">Kozak (2001)</xref> argued that future intentions were more likely to be influenced by satisfaction than by past experience. Other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010382235">Garbarino &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010382235">McAlexander, Kim, &amp; Roberts, 2003</xref>) found that consumption experience tended to moderate the effect of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty. They stated that although satisfaction tended to have a significant influence on loyalty for less experienced group, it did not appear to significantly affect the more experienced group’s loyalty. Instead, other determinants tended to replace satisfaction as drivers of loyalty.</p>
<p>Taken together, previous studies found that destination image, tourist satisfaction, and destination loyalty as separate constructs were affected by previous experiences; few studies, however, have investigated the relationships in an integrated framework. Moreover, most of the previous studies used attribute- or factor-level descriptions and examined univariate or multivariate comparisons which may explain the mix results reported. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine if first-time and repeat visitor groups differed in the systematic relationships depicted in the destination loyalty model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348010382235">Figure 1</xref>. The focus of this study was on the comparison of an entire process rather than on attribute- or factor-level description. More specifically, this study investigated (a) if there were any differences between the latent means of the first-time and repeat visitors’ evaluations of destination image, tourist attribute, overall satisfaction, and destination loyalty and (b) whether travelers’ previous experiences were likely to influence the magnitude of the relationships among destination image, tourist attribute and overall satisfaction, and destination loyalty as specified in the destination loyalty model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348010382235">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Destination Loyalty Model</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010382235">Chi and Qu (2008)</xref> developed a systematic approach to understanding destination loyalty by examining the theoretical and empirical evidence on the causal relationships among destination image, tourist attribute and overall satisfaction, and destination loyalty. Their results supported the proposed destination loyalty model, which suggested that destination image directly influenced attribute satisfaction; destination image and attribute satisfaction were both direct antecedents of overall satisfaction; and overall satisfaction and attribute satisfaction in turn had direct and positive impact on destination loyalty (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348010382235">Figure 1</xref>). However, they did not examine how tourists’ previous experience(s) can affect the destination loyalty model.</p>

<title>Effects of Previous Experience(s) on Image, Satisfaction, and Loyalty</title>
<p>Previous visitation, or direct experience with a destination, is likely to modify the destination image. Several studies investigated image modifications due to actual destination experience and reported that previous experience could be both a positive and negative factor in image evaluation because it is likely to lead to a more diversified, detailed, and realistic impression of a destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010382235">Fakeye &amp; Crompton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010382235">Gitelson &amp; Crompton, 1984</xref>). Whereas some studies used a longitudinal approach to study the differences between tourists’ pre-trip and post-trip images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010382235">Dann 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096348010382235">Pearce, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348010382235">Phelps, 1986</xref>), others examined the image differences between visitors and nonvisitors. These studies found that (a) travelers tended to have different images before and after visiting a destination and (b) visitors and nonvisitors were likely to hold different images of a particular destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010382235">Chon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010382235">Fakeye &amp; Crompton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010382235">Hu &amp; Ritchie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010382235">Milman &amp; Pizam, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of empirical works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010382235">Baloglu &amp; Mangaloglu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010382235">Chon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010382235">Hu &amp; Ritchie, 1993</xref>) demonstrated that both the number of visits to and the length of stay at a destination influenced the perceived image. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010382235">Echtner and Ritchie (1993)</xref> argued that higher familiarity with a destination tended to lead to more holistic, psychological, and unique images whereas lower familiarity resulted in images based more on attributes, functional aspects, and common features. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010382235">Beerli and Martin (2004)</xref> indicated that previous visitation(s) would affect the cognitive image depending on the number of visits, the duration of visits, and the degree of involvement with the place during the stay. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010382235">Milman and Pizam (1995)</xref> empirically tested the impact of consumer familiarity with a destination on the consumer’s destination image and on the interest and likelihood to visit the destination. Their results indicated that higher familiarity with a destination resulted in more positive image of the destination, higher interests, and higher likelihood to revisit it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010382235">Hong, Lee, Lee, and Jang (2009)</xref>, who studied the decision-making process for repeat visitors, found that familiarity provided tourists with a positive image of a previously visited destination and played an important role in repeaters’ decision to select the same destination.</p>
<p>Previous studies have found that past experiences are influential on satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010382235">Licata, Mills, &amp; Suran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010382235">Mittal, Kumar, &amp; Tsiros, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010382235">Schreyer, Lime, &amp; Williams, 1984</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010382235">Petrick and Sirakaya’s (2004)</xref> empirical study suggested that repeat visitors were more satisfied with their travel experiences and were more likely to return and spread positive WOM. With repurchase and use/consumption of a product/service, consumers were able to more accurately evaluate the product/service and may discover new and unanticipated benefits and costs that may affect both satisfaction and loyalty. Similar findings regarding the close relationship between previous travel experiences and future behavioral intentions were also reported by other studies and it was argued by several researchers that repeat tourists were expected to be more likely than first-timers to choose the same destination in the future. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010382235">Li, Cheng, Kim, and Petrick (2008)</xref> reported that repeaters had a higher level of satisfaction than first-timers, had a stronger intention to return, and were more likely to give positive WOM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010382235">Oppermann (2000)</xref> empirically examined the impact of previous experience on future tourist visitation behavior and found a significant relationship between the two variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348010382235">Pearce and Kang (2009)</xref> provided empirical evidence that increase in visitors’ experience and exposure to tourism settings was associated with increase in their continuing interests in those settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010382235">Sonmez and Graefe (1998)</xref> found that past travel experience appeared to be a powerful influence on behavioral intentions. Individuals with previous travel experiences to various destinations may become more confident as a result of their experiences and thus be more likely to travel back to those places of interest.</p>
<p>A few empirical studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010382235">Gyte &amp; Phelps, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010382235">Juaneda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010382235">Kozak &amp; Rimmington, 2000</xref>) focused on the influences of satisfaction and previous visits on the probability of returning to the same destination. Both previous visits and satisfaction were found to be determinants of the revisit intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010382235">Mazursky (1989)</xref> investigated the impact of past experience and satisfaction on future revisit intentions and suggested experience-based measures in addition to tourist satisfaction as an input for estimators of future intentions to return. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010382235">Gabe, Lynch, and McConnon (2006)</xref> found that the total number of past visits and a higher level of tourist satisfaction significantly increased tourists’ revisit likelihood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010382235">Kozak (2001)</xref> built a theoretical framework of future behavioral intentions based on multiple variables such as the number of previous visits, tourist overall satisfaction, and tourists’ satisfaction with destination-based attributes. From the empirical data he found that future intentions were influenced more by satisfaction than by past experience.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010382235">Hong et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that satisfaction alone is not sufficient for attracting repeaters and other motivators must be employed to entice them to return. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010382235">McAlexander et al. (2003)</xref> empirically explored the relative impacts of satisfaction, consumer experience, and brand community integration on customer loyalty. They found that customer satisfaction affected customer loyalty depending on consumption experience. Satisfaction had a positive effect on loyalty for less experienced group but its effect in the more experienced group was not significant. For more experienced customers, brand community integration became more powerful than satisfaction in building customer loyalty. The authors concluded that loyalty creation was an evolutionary process driven by experience: “With experience, customers have the opportunity to develop the additional and meaningful connections of brand community that can provide a strong bond that affects satisfaction and loyalty” (p. 7). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010382235">Garbarino and Johnson (1999)</xref> found that for low relational (less experienced) customers’ satisfaction had significant influence on future behavioral intention; whereas, for experienced relationship-oriented customers, trust and commitment replaced satisfaction as drivers of loyalty. They concluded that satisfaction was most effective for developing loyalty among less-experienced low-relational customers.</p>

<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>This study employed a causal research design using a cross-sectional sample survey. The survey questionnaire consisted of the following major sections: questions that measured the following constructs—destination image, tourists’ attribute satisfaction, overall satisfaction, destination loyalty, and questions designed to gather tourists’ frequency of visits and demographic information.</p>
<p>Destination image was measured by 53 destination items that were identified from a comprehensive review of previous destination literature, content analysis of tourism literature, promotion brochures, and websites for Eureka Springs, and the employment of qualitative research techniques such as focus group sessions, unstructured personal interviews, and managerial judgment. Each destination item was rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale where 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. An exploratory factor analysis with oblimin rotation was performed to determine the underlying dimensionality of “destination image” by analyzing patterns of correlations among the 53 image attributes. Items with loadings lower than .4 and with loadings higher than .4 on more than one factor were eliminated. Using a range of cut-off criteria such as eigenvalues, scree plot, percentage of variance, item communalities, and factor loadings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348010382235">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>), a nine-factor solution, with 37 variables being retained, was chosen representing approximately 75.9% of the total variance. The Cronbach’s alpha for the nine factors varied from .81 to .93, suggesting high internal consistency. The nine factors were labeled based on the core variables that constituted them: travel environment, natural attractions, entertainment and events, historic attractions, travel infrastructure, accessibility, relaxation, outdoor activities, and price/value. Nine composite variables were created and used as indicators for the latent construct “destination image” in the subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Attribute satisfaction was measured by 33 items that were drawn on the most relevant tourism literature and destination attributes applicable to Eureka Springs. Each item was measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>very dissatisfied</italic> and 7 = <italic>very satisfied</italic>). Using the same exploratory factor analysis procedure discussed above, seven factors with eigenvalues above 1.0 were generated, which explained about 71% of the total variance. The seven destination attributes domains were labeled as accommodation, dining, shopping, attractions, activities and events, environment, and accessibility. The Cronbach’s alphas for the seven factors were robust, ranging from .85 to .91, indicating high internal consistency among the variables within each factor. Seven summated scales were created and used as manifest variables for the latent variable “attribute satisfaction” in the subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>A single overall measure of satisfaction was used in this study for its ease of use and empirical support. The respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with the overall traveling experience on a 7-point Likert-type scale with 1 being <italic>very dissatisfied</italic> and 7 being <italic>very satisfied</italic>. Two single-item measures were used for assessing tourist destination loyalty as the ultimate dependent construct: tourists’ intention to revisit Eureka Springs and their willingness to recommend Eureka Springs as a favorable destination to others, with 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>most unlikely</italic>; 7 = <italic>most likely</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1096348010382235">
<title>Reliability</title>
<p>A pilot test was conducted to test the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. The first draft of the survey instrument was distributed to 50 randomly selected visitors who stayed at Eureka Springs’ hotels and motels. A total of 32 completed surveys were returned. A reliability analysis (Cronbach’s alpha) was performed for “destination image” and “attribute satisfaction,” resulting in a robust alpha of .96 and .93, respectively. An alpha of .7 or above is considered acceptable as a good indication of reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096348010382235">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). Based on the results of the pilot test and feedbacks from Eureka Springs Chamber of Commerce, the final version of the survey instrument was developed.</p>

<title>Sampling Plan</title>
<p>The empirical data for the study was collected in a major tourism destination in the state of Arkansas—Eureka Springs, which is known as ‘‘the little Switzerland of the Ozarks’’ and was named one of the 12 Distinctive Destinations by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The target population was all the visitors who stopped by the Eureka Springs Welcome Center, stayed at hotels, motels, and B &amp; B or visited souvenir shops/art galleries during a 2-month survey period.</p>

The amount of variability in the population is estimated to be 50%, which is widely used in social research (e.g., national opinion polls in the United States). Assuming a response rate of 50% and an unusable rate of 10%, a total of 963 (385/0.4) people were approached to participate in the survey.</p>
<p>A two-stage sampling approach was used: proportionate stratified sampling was applied for deciding on the strata sample size, and systematic random sampling was used to select the survey participant within each stratum, which involved choosing every <italic>k</italic>th element after a random start. In this study, <italic>k</italic> was determined as 10. The self-administered survey was conducted on site by the staff working at different local destinations. They were instructed to select a random visitor to start off the survey, and every 10th visitor after the random start was approached to fill out the questionnaire. The questionnaires were distributed daily at random times throughout the survey period. Incentives such as $20 lodging discount coupons and a grand prize drawing of a three-night all-inclusive vacation were offered to increase the response rate.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Multisample structural equations analyses examined whether the hypothesized destination loyalty model was comparable across first-time and repeat tourists. Structural equation modeling (SEM) can be used in cross-group comparisons, when researchers are interested in comparing structural models in different populations. SEM is capable of simultaneously estimating a single solution across a number of samples, according to a multiple group LISREL model with some or all parameters constrained to be equal over groups. It allows researchers to discuss comparability of causal processes (relationships) as well as means (levels) in different populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010382235">Maruyama, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1096348010382235">
<title>Measurement equality/invariance</title>
<p>Before comparing the structural model, researchers need to ensure that the theoretical variables in the measurement model are identical in different samples; therefore, the establishment of measurement equality/invariance across samples is a logical prerequisite to conducting multigroup comparison. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010382235">Vandenberg and Lance (2000)</xref> proposed an integrative paradigm for conducting sequences of measurement equality/invariance tests and this study adopted the following tests for measurement invariance:</p>
<list id="list2-1096348010382235" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>A test of “configural invariance” in which the same pattern of fixed and free factor loadings was specified for each group;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A test of “metric invariance” in which factor loadings for like items were invariant across groups (tau equivalent); and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A test of parallel model, in which both factor loadings and error variances for like items were held identical across groups.</p>

<title>Structural model comparisons.</title>
<p>To examine if a regression equation is equivalent in several populations, researchers can conduct three tests according to the following sequence:</p>

<p>The unconstrained model allowed both the intercept and coefficients for the regression equations to be freely estimated across groups;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>

<sec id="section12-1096348010382235">
<title>Latent mean comparisons</title>
<p>LISREL can also help compare means of latent variables in multigroup studies. Since a latent variable is unobservable, it does not have an intrinsic scale, thus no origin nor the unit of measurement. LISREL defines a common scale for the latent variables in all groups by assuming that the means of the latent variables are zero in one group and that the loadings of the observed variables on the latent variables are invariant over groups. Under these conditions, it is possible to estimate the means of the latent variables relative to this common scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010382235">Joreskog &amp; Sorbom, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 345 questionnaires were returned, which corresponds to about 90% of the targeted sample size. More than 60% of the respondents were female (66%). More than half of the respondents (57%) were aged less than 50 years, with 4-year or above college education (55%). A total of 69% of the respondents’ annual household income was above $50,000. The majority (94%) of the respondents was traveling with their family and friends, and vacation/leisure was quoted as the major purpose of the trip (79%). One third (33%) of the respondents were first-timers and the remaining 67% were repeat visitors. Previous visits (37%) and WOM (33%) emerged as the two key information sources for respondents to learn about the travel destination.</p>
<sec id="section14-1096348010382235">
<title>Effects of Previous Experiences on Destination Loyalty Model</title>
<p>It was postulated that the structural paths in the destination loyalty model differed based on tourists’ previous experience with a destination (Hypothesis 1). To test this hypothesis, a multiple groups analysis was conducted to examine the potential differences between first-time and repeat visitors concerning the relationship of destination image, tourist satisfaction, and destination loyalty. Specifically, this analysis assessed whether the five structural paths in the destination loyalty model were similar across the tourist groups. The multiple group methodology in LISREL helps determine whether particular parameters or the entire covariance matrices are equal for different groups. Prior to comparing the structural model, however, it was necessary to examine if the theoretical variables in the measurement model were identical in different samples.</p>
<sec id="section15-1096348010382235">
<title>Measurement invariance</title>
<p>Measurement invariance was tested by comparing results of a confirmatory model fitting separate models for first-timers and repeat tourists. Following the approach recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010382235">Vandenberg and Lance (2000)</xref> for establishing measurement invariance, three tests were conducted in the following order. Initially, model coefficients were freed such that separate loading estimates and error variances were computed for each subsample (configural invariance model M<sub>1</sub>). This resulted in acceptable model fits to the data: the overall χ<sup>2</sup> = 937.12 with 298 degrees of freedom, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .12, comparative fit index (CFI) = .94, and parsimony normed fit index (PNFI) = .80. Next, the model was reestimated adding the constraint that the matrix of factor loadings remained invariant across samples (tau equivalent model M<sub>2</sub>). The constrained model gained additional degrees of freedom at a price of worse chi-square fit statistics: 961.89 with 313 degrees of freedom, but other fit indices such as RMSEA (.12) and CFI (.94) remained the same and the parsimony fit index improved (PNFI = .84). Last, the model was examined with the added constraint that the matrix of error variances also remained invariant across subsamples (parallel model M<sub>3</sub>). This generated the most parsimonious model (the highest degrees of freedom, i.e., 331 and the highest PNFI, i.e., .88) with the worst chi-square fit statistic: 1004.73. Other fit indices were similar to that of the previous two models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010382235">Table 1</xref>).</p>

The chi-square difference statistics provided evidence that the measurement model was tau equivalent, that is, the factor loadings were invariant across both samples but not the error variances (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010382235">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Structural Models Comparison</title>
<p>In this analysis, the possible invariance of the causal relationships (structural paths) leading to destination loyalty was assessed across first-time and repeat travelers. Three multiple group structural models were tested. For each structural model, the factor structure for the two tourist groups was held tau equivalent (same factor loadings and different error variances) to assure that the constructs were being measured similarly between groups. In the first model (M<sub>u</sub>), both the intercept and coefficients for the regression equations were allowed to vary between groups, suggesting different structural paths for the two groups (unconstrained model). In the second model (M<sub>p</sub>), the equality constraints were imposed on the regression coefficients, but the intercept terms were freely estimated, suggesting a parallel model. In the third model (M<sub>e</sub>), both the intercept terms and the structural paths were constrained to be equal, suggesting an equal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010382235">Joreskog &amp; Sorbom, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1096348010382235">Table 2</xref> provides a summary of the LISREL parameter estimates for the three models. The chi-square difference tests were then used to examine if the structural parameter estimates were identical across groups. The findings showed that the unconstrained model (M<sub>u</sub>) outperformed the other two models, leading to the conclusion that the structural coefficients in the model were indeed group specific. The model fit statistics for the three models and chi-square difference tests are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1096348010382235">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>The analysis suggested that two out of the five paths were different between groups: (a) overall satisfaction → destination loyalty and (b) attribute satisfaction → destination loyalty. A constrained model (M<sub>c</sub>) in which two paths were allowed to vary between groups were compared with the parallel model in which all five paths were held invariant (M<sub>p</sub>). The chi-square different tests reflected that M<sub>c</sub> had a significant improvement in model fit over M<sub>p</sub> (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 19.11, greater than χ<sup>2</sup> critical value <inline-formula id="inline-formula16-1096348010382235">

<p>It seemed that the constrained model (M<sub>c</sub>) best combined model fit and model parsimony: χ<sup>2</sup>(329) = 959.17, CFI = .94, RMSEA = .11, PNFI = .88 and should thus be retained as the final model. In this multisample model, three paths were held invariant (destination image → attribute satisfaction, destination image → overall satisfaction, and attribute satisfaction → overall satisfaction) and two paths were different across the two tourist groups (overall satisfaction → destination loyalty and attribute satisfaction → destination loyalty). Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was partially supported: specifically the findings supported Hypotheses 1d and 1e, whereas Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c were rejected. The structural coefficients for the two tourist groups from this final model were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1096348010382235">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The structural models showed intriguing differences between first-time and repeat vacationers. For first-timers, all five structural paths were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and in the expected direction: destination loyalty was affected directly by attribute satisfaction and indirectly by attribute satisfaction through overall satisfaction; destination loyalty was indirectly influenced by destination image via overall satisfaction and attribute satisfaction. For repeat tourists, all but the path between attribute satisfaction and destination loyalty (β<sub>31</sub> = .10, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) were statistically significant: attribute satisfaction indirectly affected destination loyalty through overall satisfaction, and destination image indirectly influenced loyalty via overall satisfaction and attribute satisfaction.</p>
<p>The main differences here were that: (a) for first-time tourists, both overall satisfaction and attribute satisfaction directly influenced destination loyalty; whereas for repeat visitors, only overall satisfaction directly influenced destination loyalty and (b) for the relationship between overall satisfaction and destination loyalty, the path estimate for the first-timers (β<sub>32</sub> = .94, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) was larger in magnitude than that of repeat visitors (β<sub>32</sub> = .66, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), indicating that overall satisfaction had a stronger impact on first-timers’ destination loyalty than on that of repeat visitors.</p>

<title>Latent Means Comparison</title>
<p>It was posited that repeat visitors would have different destination image, satisfaction level (both attribute and overall satisfaction), and destination loyalty as opposed to first-time visitors (Hypothesis 2). To test this hypothesis, the mean values of the latent constructs were compared between first-time and repeat tourists.</p>
<p>Given that it is not possible to identify a definite origin and an intrinsic scale for latent (unobserved) variables, constraints need to be imposed in order to define a common scale (Jorekog &amp; Sorbom, 1995). All loadings of the observed variables on the latent constructs were constrained to be equal across groups. The four factor means were constrained to zero for the first-timers (reference group) and freely estimated for the repeaters (comparison group). Overall, latent mean differences for all four constructs between the groups were obtained from the unconstrained model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1096348010382235">Table 5</xref>): for destination image (κ = .01, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), for attribute satisfaction (κ = −.03, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), for overall satisfaction (κ = .07, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), and for destination loyalty (κ = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<p>The results revealed that (a) repeaters held slightly more positive image, expressed marginally lower attribute satisfaction, and higher overall satisfaction with the destination; however, the differences were not statistically significant, therefore Hypotheses 2a, 2b, and 2c could not be supported and (b) repeat tourists did report significantly higher likelihood of revisiting and recommending the destination than first-timers, thus Hypothesis 2d could be corroborated. It can thus be concluded that first-timers and repeat tourists were alike in terms of the image perception and the satisfaction level with the destination, but repeat tourists indicated higher levels of loyalty toward the destination (inferred by higher revisit and referral intentions) than first-timers.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have found that tourists’ previous experiences affected destination image, tourist satisfaction, and destination loyalty as separate constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010382235">Beerli &amp; Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010382235">Kozak &amp; Rimmington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010382235">Oppermann, 2000</xref>); however, few studies have looked into the potential differences between first-time and repeat tourists in the systematic relationships among these constructs. The objective of the study was to compare the destination loyalty model between first-time and repeat travelers and see if different segments had different loyalty formation process. Findings reported are likely to contribute to advances in theoretical understanding of the effects of previous visitation(s) on the destination loyalty formation process. The findings could also facilitate destination managers to carry out market segmentation, which is an essential marketing tool in today’s increasingly competitive business world and has become part of the everyday thinking of tourism managers in their efforts to improve planning and productivity. By dividing the broad categories of the market into more specific component parts, managers are able to gain strategic marketing insights. This in turn allows them to direct their marketing efforts to attract and satisfy tourists more efficiently.</p>
<sec id="section19-1096348010382235">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>Extensive literature review showed few, if any, prior studies that used multiple group analysis in SEM to examine tourist segments distinguished by previous visitations(s). Multiple group analysis allows comparison of multiple samples across the same measurement model. This study not only investigated differences between first-time and repeat visitors in the <italic>levels</italic> of key constructs (latent means) in the destination loyalty model, it also focused on differences across the two groups in the <italic>relationships</italic> among the constructs (structural paths) in the model. The findings revealed that past travel experience(s) affected the means of the latent variables as well as the structural relationships between the latent variables in the destination loyalty model.</p>
<p>First, repeat tourists reported higher levels of revisit and referral intentions (used to infer destination loyalty) compared with first-timers. The importance of previous experience in influencing traveler destination preferences has been reported in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010382235">Oppermann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010382235">Sonmez &amp; Graefe, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010382235">Milman and Pizam (1995)</xref> found that higher familiarity with a destination results in more positive image of the destination, higher interests, and higher likelihood to revisit it. Other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010382235">Gyte &amp; Phelps, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010382235">Juaneda, 1996</xref>) also verified that repeat tourists are more likely to return to the same destination than first-timers. Since actual holiday experiences are considered as more reliable than information sought from media or friends, they provide a vital tool for tourists to make destination choice decisions. Given that tourism product is known for its intangibility and inseparability, and involves considerable expenditure and high degrees of uncertainty, prior experience and knowledge help reduce tourists’ doubts and boost their confidence about the potential trip(s), resulting in greater willingness to visit the same destination again.</p>
<p>Second, previous experience(s) moderate the relationship between tourist satisfaction (both attribute satisfaction and overall satisfaction) and destination loyalty—satisfaction plays more important role in leading to loyalty for first-timers than for repeaters. The findings supported previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010382235">Garbarino &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010382235">McAlexander et al., 2003</xref>) about the influence of consumer experiences on their loyalty. These studies found that satisfaction affects loyalty based on consumer experiences; satisfaction has significant influence on loyalty for less experienced group but not for more experienced group. For the latter, other factors serve as drivers of loyalty such as trust and commitment.</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>Because of the distinctiveness of the first-timers and repeaters, these two groups may have different demands and requirements regarding the products and services offered by a destination. In addition, marketing efforts directed primarily at enticing new visitors to a destination may be entirely inappropriate for encouraging previous visitors to return. Therefore, it is necessary to develop different marketing strategies and tourism activities tailored to the needs of novice and experienced travelers. The implementation of effective promotional and functional activities targeted at first-timers and repeaters requires a sound understanding of these two dissimilar groups.</p>
<p>This study showed that satisfaction leads to loyalty for first-time visitors. This amplifies the importance of first impressions and suggests to the destination managers that priority should be placed on providing satisfying experience to first-timers. The provision of high-quality experience is the key to alluring the first-timers to return. As for repeat tourists, satisfaction is no longer the major factor in leading to loyalty. This study has not empirically investigated the special determinants for repeaters’ loyalty, but other researchers have uncovered important variations in the common “satisfaction builds loyalty” equation.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010382235">Boo, Busser, and Baloglu (2009)</xref> found that for tourists with previous visitation experience, destination brand value and tourists’ image congruence with a destination were critical to developing tourist loyalty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010382235">Petrick and Sirakaya (2004)</xref> found that attachment rather than satisfaction is a deciding factor for repeat tourists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010382235">Garbarino and Johnson (1999)</xref> found that trust and commitment supplant satisfaction as drivers of loyalty for repeat customers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348010382235">Oliver (1999)</xref> believed that satisfaction makes important contributions to loyalty early in the ownership cycle but as customers gain experience a convergence of product, personal and social forces can lead to “ultimate loyalty.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010382235">McAlexander et al. (2003)</xref> showed that the impact of satisfaction on loyalty diminishes as customers gain experience and brand community integration becomes more powerful in building loyalty. These findings underscore the importance of nurturing attachment, trust, and commitment among repeat tourists and encourage and support brand communities that can draw consumers into a complex web of relationships and, hence, solidify their loyalty toward the destination brand.</p>
<p>Destination managers can consider forming clubs and other consumer communities for repeat tourists to keep them in the long-term engagement with the destination. For example, airlines have “frequent flyer programs” and hotels have “frequent guest programs,” both targeting at retaining their repeat customers and ultimately winning their loyalty. Destinations can follow the similar format and bring all or some of their tourism suppliers together to initiate a “loyal traveler” program. This program should not be just about discount prices or first-class treatments; more important, it should encourage emotional involvement such as friendship built around product/service consumption and integration of product/service into extended self-concept. This will help create higher exit barriers and maintain an ongoing relationship with repeat visitors. When tourists start to identify themselves with the destination, they will surely return to the same destination over and over again.</p>
<p>Of course, because of the fragmentation of the tourism and hospitality industry, it will be very difficult and probably expensive to carry out a program that requires high coordinating efforts but the returns of such program are enormous considering that it is less costly to retain repeat visitors than to attract new customers, plus repeat tourists are more likely to remain loyal and share their positive experiences with other people thus creating free WOM advertising. That is why many attractions and destinations rely heavily on repeat visitation, which highlights the critical importance of marketing efforts devoted to the development and maintenance of repeat clientele.</p>
<p>In spite of the much preached notion that repeat visitors are a positive business sign and attracting repeaters is a sound business strategy, a competitive destination should have a fine mix of both repeaters and first-timers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348010382235">Oppermann (1999)</xref> pointed out, if a destination only relies on repeat customers, its market will eventually die out as some customers “defect” to other destinations, others stop traveling, and still others die of natural causes. Therefore, destinations should try to continuously attract and open up new markets in order to maintain its long-term viability. To achieve this, destinations can develop different tourism packages that appeal most effectively to different segments.</p>
<p>The Internet offers great opportunity for customizing destination offerings and cultivating destination loyalty. Separate web pages can be created for first-timers and repeaters, with different tourism options available for their choices. With the Internet, destination marketing organizations can easily keep track of the customer database and the reservation information. Such information is obviously instrumental in developing the most appropriate tourism product/service targeting at different tourist segments. Destination websites may also incorporate online newsletters, online chat rooms, and other approaches that will bring tourists together, either new or veteran, sharing their traveling experiences, discussing traveling related or unrelated problems, and finding solutions. This will help establish what the aforementioned brand community and keep tourists in a close-knit family.</p>

<title>Limitations and Recommendations</title>
<p>The results presented in this study need to be qualified in light of several limitations. First, the population of this study was limited to visitors of a tourist destination in the southern United States. Therefore, the results from the study may not be generalized beyond this population. Replicating similar studies in other tourist destinations would be imperative for increasing the generalizability of these findings.</p>
<p>Second, overall satisfaction, repurchase, and referral intention (used to infer destination loyalty) were all measured by a single question. The use of a multiple-item measurement scale in future studies may enhance the interpretation and prediction of overall satisfaction and destination loyalty. The development of more complete and psychometrically sound measures would strengthen the reliability of findings and assist future tourism research projects with scale and theory development about tourist satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
<p>Third, “destination image,” “attribute satisfaction,” and “overall satisfaction” were studied as antecedents to destination loyalty. There might be additional factors influencing and interacting with tourists’ loyalty. Future researchers are advised to investigate additional antecedents of tourist loyalty, such as value, quality, trust, commitment, and so on. This may lead to the uncovering of omissions and misrepresentation of the relationships tested in the current study and to further conceptual refinement and extension.</p>
<p>Last, data collected from the present study were neither experimental nor longitudinal. As such, the cause-and-effect relationships reported herein should be interpreted with caution. Although SEM allows one to postulate causal relationships, the present study’s model specification was based on previous research and theory, not on the actual data. As a consequence, the cause-and-effect relationships suggested by the model in this study may not represent the true causal nature of the relationships among the constructs. Future research will benefit from the collection of longitudinal data to more precisely measure change across time and the direction of causality among relationships. Ideally, this research would begin tracking tourists from one trip until the next trip. In addition, it may be useful to manipulate factors of interest experimentally, thereby enabling more definite conclusions about causal relationships to be drawn.</p>
