<abstract>
<p>This article explores the performance of heterosexual masculinity in the Yahoo! Taiwan dating site via a discourse analysis of daters’ self-introductions. Seeing the collective representations of masculinities as ‘masculine fronts’, the research finds that tender, domestic, emotional, passive and victimized fronts dominate the site; in comparison, tough and virile fronts, which reflect hegemonic Taiwanese masculinities, are much less performed. The dating site is argued to act as a heterotopia: it reflects the social imaginaries of appropriate masculinities in women’s perspectives; being quasi-anonymous and female-gaze-only, it compensates for the imperfect daily social spaces by allowing the public performance of marginalized masculinities; moreover, it manifests the illusory aspect of hegemonic masculinities, which are presumed to be ‘natural’, rather than acted out in accordance with the situated social relations and spectatorships.</p>

<p>Gender issues have long had a presence in the short history of internet communication. The idea of gender-crossing in cyber forums, together with its twin concept ‘identity play’, springs up as one of the most noisy buzzwords in internet research after the publication of Sherry Turkle’s pioneering, though widely criticized, 1995 work <italic>Life on the Screen</italic>. Reflecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877911422855">Haraway’s (1990)</xref> revolutionary female cyborg image, cyberfeminism is first advocated in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877911422855">Plant, 1996</xref>) and perhaps best embodied in women’s movements or micro politics that make good use of ICT technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911422855">Guertin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877911422855">Harcourt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911422855">Hawthorn and Klein, 1999</xref>). In a similar vein the internet is said to empower queer identities to negotiate with hegemonic sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877911422855">O’Riordan and Phillips, 2007</xref>). It is suggested that cyberspace creates new possibilities for exploring one’s sexuality; for instance, an active, sexually interested heterosexual female gaze may be generated via consuming cyber porn ‘For Women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367877911422855">Schauer, 2005</xref>). Just to name a few.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the attributes and potentialities of internet communication in its total sense are proposed and debated. Among them, its characteristics of being anonymous and disembodied are much cited; its potentials, as consequences of such attributes, for transgressing, if not subverting, the present socio-cultural order are argued and expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367877911422855">Stone, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877911422855">Turkle, 1995</xref>). Going against the celebratory tone of this work, some empirical studies contest the early theories and prove them to be naïve and over-optimistic: the so-called anonymity and disembodiment never exist in their entire sense; likewise, the promise of transgression or subversion is never fulfilled, since the extension or reproduction of offline worlds is more likely to be the case on the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911422855">Bassett, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877911422855">Ignacio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877911422855">Kolko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877911422855">Nakamura, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877911422855">2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877911422855">2000</xref>;). Arguments in this line, celebratory or contesting, in general assume a binary discursive frame: the disembodied or embodied, breakaway or extension, subversion or reproduction, etc. ‘The internet’ or ‘cyberspace’ is sometimes discussed as undifferentiated totality and so are its attributes or ‘natures’, however small the sector that one is looking at (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367877911422855">Robinson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Such discursive frames, to some degree, dominate the early agenda of internet research in relation to gender issues. Departing from the subversion–reproduction frame, this article examines the performance of heterosexual masculinity on a Taiwanese dating site, looking into its possibilities of mirroring and contesting the current gender order. Thus, we can see the gendered space on the net as neither utopic nor dystopic, but rather, to take Foucault’s term, as heterotopic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877911422855">1</xref></sup> It may, as in Foucault’s formulation, act as a counter-site, reflecting the orders in mainstream social spaces, and creating either spaces of illusion that expose every real space as more illusory, or spaces of compensation in which everything is perfectly arranged in contrast to the messy, usual living sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911422855">Foucault, 1986</xref>: 27). Current research on e-dating rightly tackles the questions of identity-creation and self-presentation, providing us with a good start for exploring the issue. The performance of a gendered self via a dating profile is intrinsically <italic>reflexive</italic>, presuming the perspectives of its spectators. Moreover, it takes place in a particular kind of socio-cultural space rarely seen in everyday life. Unlike content-providing websites and virtual communities primarily for online connections, internet dating sites presume social interactions and possible future face-to-face relationships. They are quasi-anonymous, semi-private (though publicly accessible), and oriented to segregated audiences and intimacies. Such attributes, as will be argued, make possible specific spectatorships and thus the emergence of a broad spectrum of ‘masculine fronts’ that represent, yet, at the same time, reverse common patterns of masculinity in daily sites. Exploring the cultural patterning in such ‘counter-sites’ (i.e. heterotopias), we are enabled to reveal the mechanism underpinning ‘normal’ masculine selves in the heterosexual world.</p>
<p>The following pages first go through a review of relevant literature. A series of ideas that pave the way for my theoretical framework are developed contextually, and linked to questions of Taiwanese masculinity. This is followed by a discourse analysis of 187 male daters’ self-introductions taken from the Yahoo! Taiwan dating site. The emphasis is placed on the dialogic relations and the situationality in the making of online masculine fronts. The remarks made and conclusion reached in this article should not be over-generalized, since they are based on a case study contextualized in a modern Asian society where some traditional Chinese values remain dominant. They should also not be carelessly applied to the case of femininity or sexual minorities, for the social relations involved in femininity and the gender codes in same-sex (or other sexual minorities’) intimate relationships can be very different.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877911422855">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Putting oneself on the dating site</title>
<p>While online friendship/relationship making can be traced back to the early stages of internet communication via emailing, bulletin board systems or multi-user domains, etc., internet dating in its strict sense is quite a recent invention. As defined, internet dating, or e-dating, is ‘a purposeful form of meeting new people through specifically designed Internet sites’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911422855">Barraket and Henry-Waring, 2008</xref>: 149), which distinguishes it from other online communication forms, where friendships or relationships emerge more as by-products. Online dating services also differ from earlier forms of mediated matchmaking (such as newspaper or magazine personal advertisements) in providing more sophisticated tools for self-image creation and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422855">Ellison et al., 2006</xref>). To initiate a romantic encounter in the strictly defined internet dating sites, the first step is to create a personal (or, in some case, personality) profile. A typical internet dating profile page contains the dater’s photos, demographic characteristics, personal interests and a rewritable self-introduction. The demographic characteristics and personal interests are usually predefined to be selected on the list; in comparison, the self-description space allows more original and creative narratives, in which idiosyncratic ‘identity-creation’ or ‘self-making’ can freely proceed.</p>
<p>Identity-creation or self-presentation on dating sites is said to involve a series of Goffman’s ‘sign activities’, including the controlling of ‘expressions given’ (the communicative messages per se) and ‘expressions given off’ (the messages that may lead to certain impressions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911422855">Albright, 2007</xref>: 82–3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422855">Ellison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367877911422855">Whitty, 2008</xref>: 1720). Daters tend to re-create their profiles over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877911422855">Whitty, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367877911422855">Yurchisin et al, 2005</xref>), sometimes with the input of helpers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877911422855">Whitty, 2007</xref>: 64, 67); for the success of future face-to-face relationships, they tend to create more honest (or closer-to-offline) profiles. Consequently the self-images presented in dating profiles usually swing between the actual, real selves and the better ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422855">Ellison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367877911422855">Whitty, 2008</xref>: 1720; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367877911422855">Yurchisin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These research findings indicate the high self-awareness in the production of daters’ personal images, or their ‘personal fronts’ <italic>à la</italic> Goffman; via a series of sign activities (primarily in speech acts) they create the impression of who they are in accordance with their social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911422855">Goffman, 1990 [1959]</xref>: 34).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877911422855">3</xref></sup> As research suggests, such personal fronts are reflexively made. In making personal profiles, daters may review some objective ‘facts’ (such as weight, height, hair colour, etc.), pick up those features that their acquaintances think they have, and blend in features that they imagine to be considered appealing by their target daters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367877911422855">Yurchisin et al., 2005</xref>). In other words, making a personal dating profile involves the act of self-reflection, seeing and evaluating the dater as ‘object’ via taking others’ perspectives. The ‘others’, via whose views we make sense of ourselves as subjects, can be individuals that we interact with in everyday life, or a whole body of social groups or communities we encounter in social processes, namely, the ‘generalized other’, whose views or perspectives are in their critical sense synonymous with group norms or social values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877911422855">Mead, 1934</xref>: 152–64). Just as self-making in some other internet genres (such as homepage, blog or online diary) ‘presumes the expectation of the virtual generalized other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367877911422855">Robinson, 2007</xref>: 104), the making of an attractive gendered self on a dating site presumes a dialogic relation with the ‘desired other’, for whose desire the speaker’s self-image is manufactured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911422855">Davis et al., 2006</xref>: 468).</p>

<title>Masculinity in the perspective of the gazing other</title>
<p>Goffman’s category of ‘front’ and Mead’s idea of ‘the generalized other’, though based on earlier experiences of American society, shed light on the situationality and reflexivity of online daters’ self-images. In gender theories, the presence of others and situatedness are equally emphasized. As West and Zimmerman contend, gender is produced and reinforced in socially situated interactions that are ‘carried out in the <italic>virtual or real presence of others</italic> who are presumed to be oriented to its production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367877911422855">West and Zimmerman, 1987</xref>: 126, italics added). While gender is always connected to normative conceptions, individuals in effect participate in sustaining the norms via doing ‘proper’ gender acts and playing the role of spectators-inspectors in social situations.</p>
<p>In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911422855">Connell and Messerchmidt (2005)</xref> emphasize the situatedness in hegemonic masculinities. Existing as imaginaries or models, they are accomplished in social actions and differ in accordance with their social settings. Though not necessarily, hegemonic masculinities by and large pertain to heterosexual men; women’s compliance plays a central part in their making, while women’s subversion may also lead to new, and supposedly more democratic, forms of masculinities.</p>
<p>The recognition of situated, accomplished and multiple masculinities facilitates the vision of a spectrum of hierarchical masculinities in time and space, performed in response to social situations and gender relations. In Taiwan, a predominantly Han Chinese society, hegemonic masculinities take form in various ways. It is contended that traditional Chinese masculinity is distinct (from Western ones) in its privileging of men’s cerebral or spiritual attainment over muscular strength. Even in kung fu (martial art) films, in which physical performance is at stake, it is courage, righteousness, loyalty or wisdom that ultimately makes a man a hero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877911422855">Louie, 2002</xref>). Despite this, the body remains the central site of hegemonic Chinese/Taiwanese masculinity; as pinpointed in a study of normative masculinity in late imperial China, men’s sexual role of penetrator has been the core of masculinity in Han Chinese society for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877911422855">Sommer, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The legacy is shown in current Taiwanese political rhetoric that frequently picks up the terms of virility boosting (such as ‘get hard’) as a way to demonstrate both a politician’s capacity and masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877911422855">Liu, 2009</xref>). It is also shown in the celebration of male sexual potency as a manifestation of manhood in some Taiwanese men’s social activities. Among others, ‘aluba’ and ‘flower- drinking’ are two fine examples. The former is a popular school prank among Taiwanese adolescent boys as well as a favourite hazing ritual among military personnel on the island. The victim is lifted and thrown towards a hard object (a pole, a tree or anything available) with his legs wide open so that his groin will rub or hit against the object. Aluba may be done in order to strengthen adolescent male bonds or to bully people, both of which are related to the construction of masculinity based on the social obsession with the male sexual organ, peer competitions and traditional heterosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877911422855">Kuo, 2004</xref>). In comparison, ‘flower-drinking’ (a common male social drinking activity involving sexual services) exhibits a more sophisticated form of hyper-masculinity. The drinking event usually takes place along with business negotiations, while women act as catalysts producing a friendly atmosphere. The sexual element is strengthened. Male sexual vigour and fraternal bonds are at the stake, as hostesses boost and reward masculinity. Men, in rivalry and solidarity with other men, drink to boost their competitiveness and belligerence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877911422855">Hwang, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As the two examples reveal, the sexual-vigour-privileged, hyperbolic masculinity in Taiwan tends to be performed in men-to-men social spaces, in which men themselves are the principal gazing others. In his observation of American society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877911422855">Pleck (1980</xref>: 424–7) points out that hierarchies stratifying different rankings of masculinities are indeed created and sustained by men for the payoffs allowed by patriarchy; in doing so, they strive to act out normative masculinity and push others to act the same.</p>
<p>While sexual virility is seen as the hallmark of traditional Chinese masculinity, it has long been socialized and harnessed to the roles of husband and father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877911422855">Sommer, 2002</xref>). The hyperbolic, sexually competitive and sometimes misogynist performance stands as the other side of a hegemonic masculinity in which a man’s capacity for provision and protection is as much expected as his sexual potency. The tradition that defines man as ‘head of the household’ remains strong in the island where nuclear families have become the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367877911422855">Yang et al., 2005</xref>); his ability to maintain the family (financially and procreation-wise) serves best to exhibit a normal male adult’s manliness. Such ideas of masculinity are so rooted that in Taiwanese textbooks the fathers are portrayed as strong, brave, knowledgeable and capable of protecting and supporting the family, while women are primarily linked to domestic labour and emotional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911422855">Lin and You, 2010</xref>: 60–3). The hegemonic image of ‘head of household’, however, has encountered its opponent in recent years, since the popular discourse of ‘new good man’ emerged in 1995 with a series of commercial campaigns promoting a new family car. The ‘traditional good man’, as a counter-image to the ‘new good man’, is reliable, dutiful but unromantic and inexpressive, showing much more interest in his career than in children and family care. In comparison, a ‘new good man’ enjoys domesticity, showing more of his soft side and willingness to participate in domestic labour and child care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877911422855">Hsin-Dai, 1995</xref>). Such a ‘new good man’ archetype, ever since its first appearance, has penetrated the local commercial language, selling all sorts of products related to domestic life, from cars, washing machines and kitchenware to instant food. In more recent media representations, the younger ‘new good man’ would exhibit his tenderness by buying his girl friend sanitary towels or Chinese herbal drinks to take care of her period.</p>
<p>The media representations of the new good man have been criticized by local feminists since their emergence. It is contended that instead of being a sign of gender liberation, the new manhood is not far from benevolent patriarchy which calls on men to play the role of women’s providers and patronizers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877911422855">4</xref></sup> Despite the ideational residue of hegemonic domestic masculinity, the ‘new good manhood’, though not fully liberated, is not identical with the strongest versions of hegemonic masculinity. I tend to see it as masculinity-in-negotiation in the wake of the changing gender relations since the rise of both women’s economic roles and local feminisms in the late 1980s. It exists as a shade in the spectrum of current masculinities, some of them closer to the hegemonic, normative end, while some of them are further away. It is essential to note where and for whom these masculinities arise. As reviewed earlier, women play a part in the sustaining and subversion of hegemonic masculinity. If women’s compliance, along with patriarchs’ dominance, stabilizes traditional domestic masculinity, then women’s discontent with it may also lead to its transformation. The media representations of the ‘new good men’ do not tell us directly how women may be discontented with the old paradigm; nevertheless, they presume a changing women’s perspective about men on the home front: beside the new hero on the screen, there is always and only a pair of admiring female eyes. It is for her gaze but not for that of other men he strives, be they his male peers or patriarchs.</p>

<title>Putting on a masculine front on the dating site</title>
<p>The above pages discuss how internet dating sites may allow the presentation of a situational, reflexively made ‘personal front’; the various shades of Taiwanese masculinity in relation to the gazing others are indicated. Now we move to the question how the making of a male dater’s personal front, aiming to attract desired female others, may be involved in the performance of masculinity, and how the segregation of audience, in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911422855">Goffman (1990 [1959]</xref>: 57), may play a role in it.</p>
<p>An e-dating profile conveys the first impression of the dater, courting the affection of an <italic>imagined audience</italic> – despite possible revisions, an e-dating profile is initially done before the dater can actually know who he is interacting with. This is one of the factors that make gender performance via an e-dating profile distinct from that in face-to-face social spaces. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911422855">Goffman (1990 [1959]</xref>: 37–45) reminds us, a personal front arising in a particular social situation is usually blended with a given, collectively represented ‘social front’ with reference to an established social role, showing an idealized view of a situation and exemplifying the officially accredited values of the society. Likewise, we may regard the collective representations of various masculinities as ‘masculine fronts’, which may be established, hegemonic, popular, emergent or alternative, according to how they are recognized socially. The making of a personal front of a masculine self is engaged in the production and reproduction of masculine fronts by adopting, appropriating or creating them. When the masculine personal front is aimed at attracting women, it more or less reflects the social imaginaries of attractive, eligible men. Besides, when the front-making takes place in the absence of ‘other men’, the perspective that the performer takes is presumably that of his desired female others. Taking the idea of performance, I recognize the possibility that the daters’ personal fronts are not necessarily well-thought-out – they may simply say what springs to mind without too much calculation, or they do not always have good control of the expressions given or given off. All these possibilities could affect the performance of online masculine fronts. We will look at this with other issues in the following case study.</p>

<title>Performing Mr Right: male daters in the Taiwanese Yahoo! dating site</title>
<sec id="section6-1367877911422855">
<title>Data and methods</title>
<p>The data for the research were collected from the Yahoo! Taiwan dating site during the period from September 2008 to January 2009. In November 2010, the site and iPartment (a local dating site) merged into one, yet the previous Yahoo! membership and the entry from the portal site remain valid. One thousand active straight male daters’ profiles were randomly collected, and 200 of them were included in the sample, after those that contained little narration of personal feelings, thoughts or experiences in the self-introductions were removed. To look at how personal fronts are created by the daters’ own words, I focus on their self-introductions. For a better understanding of male daters’ usual concerns, three long-term members were interviewed two to three times. The profiles on the site are publicly accessible. I sent notices to the daters whose profiles are included in the data, and took note of those who did not wish their words to be cited in the article. All the words cited in the article are translated from Chinese.</p>
<p>Based on a preliminary analysis of the profiles, I differentiate a series of masculine fronts emerging from the data: the ‘hyper-masculine man’, the ‘traditional good man’ and the ‘new good man’ fronts represent the aforementioned Taiwanese masculine paradigms; the ‘super-loving man’ expresses nothing else in his self-introduction but his promise of romantic and truthful love; the ‘sentimental man’ is marked by the person’s excessively expressed emotionalism and sensitivity; the ‘little man’ is passive, easily frustrated and afraid of being hurt in relationships; and the ‘feminism-sensitive man’ shows his recognition of equality and mutual respect in relationships. Instead of being predefined, the front categories are demarcated along with the preliminary data analysis. Their demarcation is only done for the sake of analytical convenience and does not imply a clear boundary between fronts, nor does it attempt to exhaust the possibility of masculinity performance. Some of them share the same elements: for instance, promises of love may be made in all sorts of fronts, but not all the fronts are as much saturated with it as the ‘super-loving man’; both the ‘super-loving man’ and the ‘new good man’ fronts are romantic, but the latter is more oriented to domesticity; the ‘sentimental man’ is a truthful lover, too, yet he differs from the ‘super-loving man’ through his tears. All the collected profiles are coded after the construction of the front categories, according to the overall impressions they create. Some cases are more typical than the others, and, very occasionally, incoherence exists. Thirteen profiles were excluded from the coding result as they do not comfortably fit into any of the categories because of the lack of enough gender messages. In the end, 187 profiles have been coded into seven front categories. As the research is not intended for quantitative generalization, the coding result will only be taken for opening up further discussion of the dynamic relations between internet dating sites and gender performance.</p>
<p>In analysing the fronts I look at four layers of <italic>dialogic</italic> relations, taking place simultaneously and symbiotically. The term ‘dialogic’ takes something from both Mead’s idea of reflexive self and Bakhtin’s concept of ‘inner dialogism’, which indicates the inner connection between utterances and preceding worldviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422855">Bakhtin, 1986</xref>: 119–20). First, the dater’s personal front is seen as a result of a dialogue between the reflecting/writing ‘I’ and the written/reflected ‘me’. Second, the personal front is made in the awareness of the presence of his potential female spectators, who act as generalized others. Third, since the front is primarily performed for soliciting romantic relationships, it is involved in a dialogue with the need and desire of the potential female gazing others. While the configuration of the potential female audience, with whom the male dater is yet to start substantial interactions, only exists in imagination, their need and desire as social reality are also <italic>imagined</italic>. This is where the personal, masculine front enters into dialogic relations with current discourses or imaginaries of masculinity and how a collective masculine front is reproduced or created in a personal front. That said, it is possible that not all the front-making goes through the four layers of dialogue. Just like the front categories, the definition of the four dialogic relations is based on data observation. These different layers of dialogues, proceeding alongside the making of masculine fronts, will be further delineated in analyses of typical cases in the following pages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367877911422855">
<title>Making masculine fronts in multiple dialogues</title>
<p>Among others, the constant use of the first-person pronoun ‘I’ in the self-introductions indicates the first layer of dialogues under analysis. When the pronoun ‘I’ appears in the text as both the narrator and the object of narration, it exists in both the senses of ‘ I’ and ‘me’ <italic>à la</italic> Mead – indeed, in Chinese there is no subject/object difference in personal pronouns; one single word does both jobs. The self-reflexivity, or self-dialogic-ness, is best shown in those texts in which the narrator is clearly aware of the situationality. One young dater even begins his self-introduction with the lines ‘Self-introduction? I probably have to spend a lifetime to answer the question who I am.’</p>
<p>As common as the use of the first-person pronoun is the use of the second-person pronoun, which suggests interpersonal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367877911422855">Van Compernolle, 2007</xref>: 2073) and serves to manifest the second sense of dialogism. Though it may have rather vague referents at times, the word ‘you’ (in singular form in Chinese) as an indicator here is mostly oriented to women. Sixty out of the 187 samples adopt this term (and occasionally ‘we’/‘us’ ), together with the use of ‘girl’, ‘darling’, ‘my dear’ or other similar words, to interpellate their potential daters most unambiguously and thus engage in self-reviews via the addressees’ perspectives. Hailing women who are presumably waiting to be loved, the ‘super-loving men’ enter the scene. Forty-six out of the 187 profiles (24.6 percent) represent this category of masculine front. Lots of them make claims about the daters’ understanding of love and how truthful they are as lovers. Some swear to love ‘you’ for thousands of years. Some cut and paste lyrics or poems. Many write their own verses, echoing the idea of tender, crazy or sacrificing love in current Taiwanese popular music<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367877911422855">5</xref></sup> and reminiscent of the romantic heroes in the ‘idol dramas’ (targeted at a young female television audience), who would do anything to win their women’s hearts. Though it is not surprising to see men present themselves as affectionate on a site dedicated to intimacy, it is worthwhile noting the similarities in their words of love. Different from the common ‘candle-lit dinners’ or ‘beach walks’ clichés in English-speaking dating sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877911422855">Whitty, 2007</xref>), one of the most romantic scenes celebrated by the male daters in the Yahoo! Taiwan site comes from a Chinese literary classic <italic>The Book of Songs</italic>, in which the promise of eternal love is crystallized in the sentence ‘hold your hand and grow old with you’. Indeed, this old-fashioned idea of love has been reproduced in the local commercials and popular songs, one of which says, ‘the most romantic thing I can think of is to grow old slowly with you’.</p>
<p>Along with the promise of tender, eternal love, the interest in domesticity is frequently shown: the desire for a happy domestic life is commonly declared as one’s dream of life; of course, such happiness can only be fulfilled when there is a female hand for him to hold on to. A dater says in his profile:<disp-quote>
<p>My dream of life is so simple. All I hope for is to build a home with my beloved.</p>
<p>After we are both retired, we’ll build a cottage at the seaside or any countryside where the air is clean and fresh. There will be a garden with swings, so we can sit together side by side, holding hands with each other, to watch the sunset together while talking about our shared memories.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This self-portrait of a romantic and domestic man exemplifies the ‘new good man’ front on the site (51 units; 27.3 percent of the total sample), which can be further fortified by the claims of one’s ability to take care of housework. Below is a case in point:<disp-quote>
<p>I do sewing, laundry, and all sorts of housework. This is who I am – a domestic man.… Where are you, my darling?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The performance of the ‘new good man’ front mounts to its full sense when the usual gender roles are reversed. Swearing to provide a sweet home for his dear, a dater says:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ll cook for you, making a whole table of food that delights you the most. I’ll feel so happy when seeing you eating it. I also hope to hear you saying, ‘oh, dear husband, the food you make is so delicious!’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As shown in the cases of both fronts, the ideal male selves portrayed online can appear very similar, in some sense almost identical, to each other. The similarity, or homogeneity, suggests a collective understanding about women, who are imagined as a totality of collective need and desire. The social imagination of reality, as much noted in media studies, goes along by way of people’s reception of all sorts of cultural representations, most notably in the mass media. The dialogism between the male dater and women’s need and desire is, to a certain degree, in effect that between the dater and the <italic>media</italic> <italic>representation</italic> of the need and desire of women as part of the received social reality. Men construct their knowledge of women partially via media reception, and construct their ideal selves accordingly. This explains why the terminology and image of the mediated ‘new good man’ are well cited in the male daters’ personal fronts; it may also explain why the love words spoken on the site are frequently modelled on popular media discourse.</p>
<p>Apart from media representations, feminist discourses are also reflected in the online male speech. The ‘feminism-sensitive man’ front (7; 3.7 percent) is materialized in phrases such as ‘Both sexes are equal; violence is hated’, or words that draw a line between the writer and male chauvinism. This, as one interviewee pointed out, implies current young men’s awareness of feminisms and the paradigm shift in present gender relations, in which women expect more respect from men than previous generations of women did.</p>
<p>Together with the above male fronts, the little men (10; 5.3 percent) and the sentimental men (22; 11.8 percent) stand as the most tender. The ‘little man’ front is constituted in words disclosing one’s experiences of hurt and emotional vulnerability, as well as his self-positioned passive role in relationships; masculine selves in this line frankly tell of their timidity in love affairs and sometimes their experiences of being victims of love. A dater writes about his frustration in relationships as below:<disp-quote>
<p>I … a man who loves deeply … but eventually hurt by love.… I was strolling on a road paved with the seduction of love, sweet as honey. I lost myself accidentally. I let my soul go astray without noticing. Looking back, I found them sunk in the sea of sweet lies …</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As some most secret feelings can be unashamedly revealed, tears are not taboo here. The ‘sentimental man’ front emerges in speeches demonstrating one’s excessive sentiment and emotionalism. Some daters freely admit to their natures being sensitive, sentimental or even weepy. In dialoguing with ‘you’, one dater says so in his profile:<disp-quote>
<p>I would like to have a new CD player. Strangely the one I have is always playing lonely sad songs and making me cry. Hey, I want to be happier, too! Not to shed tears all the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Compared with the super-loving and new-good-man fronts, which more or less take up the ideas of romantic heroes in media representations, the little-man and sentimental-man fronts performed as such apparently exceed the edge of popular media discourse and appear so fragile and so tender as to reverse the mainstream gender paradigm entirely. In normative Taiwanese gender discourse, as represented by the maxim ‘men shall not shed tears easily’, sentimentalism is opposed to manhood. It is true that the mediated romantic heroes can get hurt and have tears in their eyes at critical moments; yet they remain active and courageous, and never appear as passive, victimized or emotionally weak. Possibly the little/sentimental male fronts are performed as a way to demonstrate one’s affections and capacity for intimacy; possibly, as spelt out below, they come into being as consequences of self-revelations in a space marked by its orientation to expressivity and its segregated audience.</p>
<p>As has been argued, the indicator ‘you’ in the male daters’ words may refer to one or many women, but never a man: the usual male others that monitor each other’s hyper-masculinity are absent here. Furthermore, the dating site may contribute to a relaxing atmosphere, while ‘the feeling of being anonymous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877911422855">Kennedy, 2006</xref>), or quasi-anonymity, encourages disclosures of private thoughts and emotions. Compared to preceding forms of matchmaking, e-dating sites give a sense of privacy, despite their public accessibility. Every member has a little space of their own, which will not be fully in sight until someone clicks on the file. It is not entirely anonymous: the dater’s picture is shown in the entry and details of personal information are required in completing the profile. Nevertheless, it is in effect somewhat anonymous: people can always use nicknames and fake personal information; most of all, they are usually away from the gaze of their acquaintances, unless they also come here to try their luck. One interviewee told the researcher, he felt more likely to ‘be himself’ and more secure to open up here, since none of his daily acquaintances, especially the male ones, are around: he could reveal his resistance to the social norms regarding men’s achievements, and needed not be ‘armoured’ as he was in everyday competitions with his male rivals. Another interviewee said that he tends to reveal more of his inner self on the dating site, not so much because of the quasi-anonymity but rather because of the feeling that he is speaking to a more sympathetic audience, women. The interviewees’ words echo the research finding that internet dating sites facilitate the presentation of daters’ ‘true selves’ that are not easily expressed in face-to-face everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367877911422855">Whitty, 2008</xref>: 1720). More significantly, they suggest the effect of the absence of ‘other men’s gaze’ in the arena. Truthful or not, masculine fronts that are usually unfavoured, discouraged, or repressed in front of male others are unashamedly performed in this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hegemonic masculinities are acted out. Daters who perform the ‘traditional good man’ front (39; 20.9 percent) promise their reliability or economic capacity but show little sign of romanticism or sensitivity to feminism. Some candidly speak about their wishes to have traditional wives who commit to ‘female duties’, such as child rearing and family care. Pretty, tender and virtuous women are their favourites. Some declare their dislike of feminists or ‘superwomen’. Hyper-masculine fronts (12; 6.4 percent) are presented via words that emphasize one’s toughness, aggressiveness and male power; despite their obvious interest in finding a woman on the site, some speak in a misogynist tone like the one below:<disp-quote>
<p>There are only two types of men: lustful and very lustful</p>
<p>There are only two types of women: gullible and very gullible</p>
<p>Wolves and sheep co-exist in the world, while sheep are born to fulfil the desire and lust of wolves. This is the Law of Nature.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another dater expresses his frustrations over past relationships and uses four-letter words to end his self-introduction:<disp-quote>
<p>I simply can’t understand why. Am I cursed? How come women come and go in my life, but none of them stay? … All I want is to get married. Is it so difficult? Fuck!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The acting out of hegemonic masculine fronts here, revealing true selves or not, suggests that these masculinities are considered as appropriate (if not necessarily desirable) in heterosexual relations. Obviously, they do not subscribe to the aforementioned media discourse of the ‘new good man’ or the romantic heroes in both popular music and female genres. As noted earlier, the performance of a gendered front on a dating site, though reflexive and situational, may not be always meticulously done. It may be the case that men who perform such fronts simply say what they think about who they are, without being too concerned about the situationality and the properness of their words. Self-aware or not, the presence of the ‘traditional good man’ and ‘hyper-masculine’ fronts here manifests the legitimacy and hegemony of the masculinities they represent; they are so dominant in current gender relations that even misogyny can be freely expressed on a site oriented to female perspectives and desires.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1367877911422855">
<title>Conclusion: undoing mainstream masculinity in the online heterotopias?</title>
<p>The dating site stands as a socio-cultural space crosscut by desires for intimate relationships and saturated with situational, reflexive gendered personal fronts in front of an imagined, segregated audience. In the case of Taiwanese heterosexual male daters, we see the performance of a broad spectrum of masculine fronts, representing a diversity of masculinities, from hegemonic, popular and feminism-sensitive ones to marginal, alternative ones. The site reflects different imaginaries of preferable masculinities in the perspective of women, makes visible men’s reception of popular media discourses in this regard, manifests the situatedness of masculinity performance, and witnesses the power of hegemonic masculinities.</p>
<p>As proposed, the internet dating sites may act as heterotopias where the order of daily living sites is mirrored, contested and inverted, and thus their imperfections are compensated for and their illusory aspects exposed. The diverse masculinities acted out on the site somewhat reflect the call for new masculinities in current Taiwanese society. Since the 1980s, women’s participation in the economy has been rising with the growing number of well-educated women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367877911422855">6</xref></sup> Local feminism started to make its presence felt around the same time and diversified in the 1990s. Professional women with higher incomes and female consciousness are common. Women’s subjectivity is widely advocated in the media, while female eroticism has become a regular topic in women’s magazines and some bestsellers. In response, discourses of men’s liberation began to occupy part of the public sphere in the early 1990s,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367877911422855">7</xref></sup> while the gender boundaries ensuring hetero-normality and hegemonic masculinity have been further pushed back with the burgeoning of local gay activism around the same time. Men in Taiwan are now facing the need to negotiate with both the old paradigm of manhood and the changing gender structure. This is especially true for better-educated men and those from the middle class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911422855">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911422855">Lin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this, traditional masculinities are still normative as described earlier. The public performance of marginal, ‘illegitimate’ masculine fronts on the dating site suggests the compensatory side of this space as heterotopia. The sense of quasi-anonymity and the absence of the male gaze allows the disclosure of real, counter-hegemonic male selves, which are more likely to be concealed in other public spaces such as schools, working sites and especially some hyper-masculine occasions, or even private ones, such as households where the patriarch usually plays the role of inspector.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the extensive performance of the new good man and the tender lover on the site reveals how men, showing their true or supposedly better selves, would present themselves in courting women privately. This may be completely contrary to how they act in front of their male peers: as research indicates, in male-only groups, impersonal, competitive and aggressive speeches are favoured over expressive, sensitive words, while misogyny is more often endorsed than interest in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877911422855">Kiesling, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Proportionally, the less hegemonic patterns of masculinity seem to dominate the site, since the ‘traditional good man’ and the ‘hyper-masculine’ fronts in total take up only 27.3% of the final sample. The inverted, uncommon relations in a heterotopic space, as Foucault proposes, serve to make crystal clear the illusory cultural order in ordinary living sites by showing what is usually <italic>not</italic> there. If such is the case, the prevalence of less hegemonic masculine fronts on a dating site as described above may serve to manifest the illusory aspect of gender norms that see hegemonic masculinities as given and natural, instead of acted out in accordance with prescribed gender roles and gender hierarchy in everyday social settings that are, by and large, subjected to the normative male gaze.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the presence of hegemonic masculine fronts on the site reminds us of their validity. The imaginary of a virile and patronizing heterosexual man, that has stood firm and erect for hundreds of years, strides proudly side by side with those of tender and domestic men in the intimacy-oriented space, where women play both the audience and associates of the Performing-Mr-Right pageant.</p>
