<p>Anders Blok and Torben Jensen have written an outstanding guide to the work of Bruno Latour. First of all, they examine the apparently disparate approaches, themes, and questions that characterize Latour’s oeuvre. Second, they take us through the criticisms and misunderstandings of his work: even if at the end of the book, some readers may still feel such criticisms are well founded, the misunderstandings will have been dispelled.</p>
<p>First then, to the ways in which Blok and Jensen carve up Latour. They emphasize that his work has two “axes”: thematic and ontological-metaphysical. The thematic axis stems from his lifelong fascination with the production and distribution of scientific facts. In refusing to assume that scientific facts are given or inevitable, Latour opens up a terrain for the empirical study of their emergence and their fate beyond the laboratory or other point of origin. In following Gaston Bachelard’s motto, “facts are fabricated,” Latour successively investigates four themes: the laboratory, which he subjects to a kind of anthropology (in <italic>Laboratory Life</italic>); the question of modernity and its relation to the pre-modern and the non-Western world (in <italic>We Have Never Been Modern</italic>); the problem of ecological threats, which he examines as a question of the relation between scientific and political forms of representation (in <italic>Politics of Nature</italic>); and the various forms of “association”—scientific, legal, religious, and artistic (in <italic>Reassembling the Social</italic>). Each of these four themes is given its own chapter by Blok and Jensen, providing the book with its structure. This is an extremely helpful way of approaching Latour, and the authors lay out the continuities in what otherwise could seem to have been a mysterious series of switches in interest and focus. As these four themes are drawn together toward the end of the book, we are made much more aware of the coherence in Latour’s work. This is one of the great virtues of the book: the themes are respected as discrete and there is no attempt to force a system onto a series of varied inquiries; nonetheless, Latour’s consistent preoccupations are revealed.</p>
<p>The second axis, the ontological-metaphysical, can be characterized as monist. This emphasis is nicely broached via a discussion of what Latour owes to his three most important sources of inspiration: Alfred North Whitehead, Gilles Deleuze, and Michel Serres. In engaging with these three thinkers, Latour’s thought is shaped by an accent on, respectively, process, immanence, and mediation. From Whitehead, Latour takes the idea that nature is a process through which <italic>events</italic> allow a series of relations to be formed between natural entities. Whitehead’s refusal to accept that nature must be bifurcated—the idea, for example in Locke, that nature might have primary (independent) and secondary (subjective) qualities—is decisive generally for Latour’s refusal of dualism, but specifically for his reconceptualization of the relationship between political and scientific representation (as in, for example, <italic>Politics of Nature</italic>). Deleuze’s emphasis on a single plane of immanence gives an anti-dualist inspiration to Latour; in looking outside the more typical philosophical resources that stress transcendence, the dynamic relations—the translations, circulations and so forth that play on the single plane of immanence—allow for <italic>hybridization</italic>. Blok and Jensen make the important point that for Latour, the term “network” simply refers to this plane of immanence with all its hybrids (something akin to Deleuze and Guattari’s “rhizomes”), and that there is no kinship with the notion of network as used by many other sociologists such as Castells. Latour’s network thus attempts to be a way of conceptualizing processes of hybridization without recourse to transcendent objects such as Science or Society. The third influence, Michel Serres, is uninterested in the archetypal (dualistic) battles between opposing terms or ideas, but instead is drawn to the “excluded third”: “go-betweens, messengers, angels, parasites” (p. 16). In <italic>We Have Never Been Modern</italic>, Latour develops this notion of the excluded third, labelling it “The Middle Kingdom”; more generally, we can see Serres’ influence in Latour’s insistence on studying movement and border crossing, and his desire to break through the usual boundaries that we erect between analytical categories, between epochs, and between spaces.</p>
<p>In an impressive move, Blok and Jensen integrate their discussion of criticisms of Latour into a discussion of how Latour’s responses to those criticisms helped him generate each successive thematic phase of his writing. In this way, the criticisms are not artificially bolted on to the discussion, and we can appreciate Latour’s living, breathing philosophy as always under development. There are three major criticisms that are canvassed: that he is a social constructivist, that he is a relativist, and that he is too power-focused (or to put it another way, that he treats all scientific and political actors as Machiavellian). In dealing with the first—a valid point, given the original subtitle for <italic>Laboratory Life</italic> was <italic>The Social Construction of Scientific Facts</italic>—Latour’s response is to work on the ways in which the social and the natural combine to form hybrids: the social can never simply be mobilized as a final explanation of society or nature, but can only ever be described as part of a hybrid. In dealing with the second, Latour is at pains to explain that he does not wish to privilege the relativism of truth: the point is rather to show the relations that enter into the fabrication of truth, or the “truth of relations,” and to generate a “relationalism” rather than a “relativism.” As Blok and Jensen explain, Latour’s perspective here is closer to Einstein’s relativity than to some philosophers’ epistemological relativism. As to the third problem, Latour is closer to Hobbes than to Machiavelli. The Leviathan is a Latourian metaphor for scientific or political ordering, and technoscience is understood as one of a number of (Hobbesian) sources of power. This martial perspective fades from the later Latour when, with Dewey in mind, he becomes more concerned with processes of negotiation and democracy in “matters of concern”: how might we democratize science?</p>
<p>There are other good summaries of Latour available (Graham Harman’s <italic>Prince of Networks</italic> springs to mind). But where Harman treats Latour primarily as a philosopher, Blok and Jensen adopt a different strategy, emphasizing Latour’s empirical investigation of four themes. Nonetheless, the metaphysical positions that Latour takes are illustrated extremely well through this structure. Whether you have little knowledge of the world of Bruno Latour, or you consider yourself an expert, this book will illuminate and entertain. It also contains an interview with Latour—interesting, but not essential—and a very useful glossary.</p>
