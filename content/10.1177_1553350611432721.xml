<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past few years, an increasing number of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures have been performed in humans; however, safe peritoneal access and secure closure of the access site continue to be the most important concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611432721">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611432721"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611432721"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611432721"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611432721"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611432721">6</xref></sup> Previous studies reported that the transgastric approach using submucosal tunneling with clip closure at the mucosal incision was performed successfully without causing peritonitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432721">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611432721">8</xref></sup> Submucosal tunnel was performed as follows: First, a mucosal incision was made and the scope was inserted into the submucosal space; second, submucosal dissection for a length of about 6 cm was performed; and finally, it led to creating a flap-valve closure when the scope was withdrawn. The narrow longitudinal submucosal tunnel itself is considered to be good for approximation and healing of the wound. However, it is not clear to what degree the sealing effect is a result of the submucosal tunnel itself. We evaluated the technical feasibility of the submucosal tunnel technique for transgastric peritoneal access without mucosal closure for NOTES.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Oita University Faculty of Medicine.</p>
<sec id="section3-1553350611432721">
<title>Preparation of the Pigs</title>
<p>Six female domestic pigs weighing 40 to 45 kg were included in the study. The animals were fasted for 48 hours prior to the procedure. All procedures were performed with the pigs under 1% to 2% sevoflurane general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. An antibiotic (cefazolin 1 g) was administered intravenously to all pigs at the start and end of the procedure. The surgical field, including the oral cavity, was prepared with 10% povidone–iodine solution and covered with sterile drapes. The endoscope and all accessories were subjected to high-level disinfection and gas sterilization.</p>

<sec id="section4-1553350611432721">
<title>Transgastric Peritoneoscopy Using the Submucosal Tunnel Technique</title>
<p>In the present study, the submucosal tunneling method was performed by the 2 endoscopists, who were proficient in endoscopic technique, and had also experience in the submucosal tunneling method for the transgastric approach in a porcine model. A standard gastroscope (GIF-XQ200, Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) with a transparent hood (D-201-10-704, Olympus) was advanced into the stomach, and the gastric lumen was lavaged with 300 mL of normal saline solution. First, the gastric wall incision site was selected using the bulge created by the pressure of the operator’s finger on the abdominal wall as a marker to prevent injury to adjacent organs. The submucosal tunnel was created as follows using the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) technique. A 23-gauge injection needle was used to inject 5 mL of normal saline solution into the submucosal layer. An initial small incision through the mucosa was then made over this submucosal cushion with a flex knife (KD-630L, Olympus). The initial incision allowed insertion of an insulation-tipped electrosurgical knife (KD-610L, Olympus), and the incision was extended to 2 cm in length. Submucosal dissection was performed with an insulation-tipped knife to create a submucosal tunnel of approximately 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>A small incision of the seromuscular layer at the distal end of the submucosal tunnel was made with the flex knife, and a 15-mm dilation balloon (CRE5842; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was inserted into the peritoneal cavity to enlarge the opening. The gastroscope was then advanced into the peritoneal cavity. Soon after the recognition of abdominal distension, a 14-gauge needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity for decompression of the pneumoperitoneum. Intraperitoneal exploration, comprising advancement, withdrawal, turning, and retroflexion of the endoscope, was done for 20 minutes. After this peritoneoscopy and the expelling of any remaining air in stomach, the endoscope was removed without closing the mucosal incision site. We examined the existence of pneumoperitoneum after removing the endoscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350611432721">
<title>Follow-up and Necropsy</title>
<p>The pigs were fed a liquid diet immediately after recovery from general anesthesia, and a regular diet was resumed on postoperative day 2. The physical activity and eating habits of the animals as well as white blood cell count and measurement of body temperature were carefully monitored every day for signs of peritonitis. Necropsy was performed 7 days after the procedure. The peritoneal cavity around the serosal incision site was irrigated with 100 mL of normal saline solution, and the fluid was submitted for microbiologic cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350611432721">
<title>Outcome Measurements</title>
<p>The peritoneal cavity was examined for signs of organ injury and evidence of peritonitis. The gastric wall incision site and adjacent structures were carefully inspected. In resected specimens of the stomach including adjacent structures, the size of the open defect at the mucosal incision site and extension of any adhesion between the serosal wall and adjacent structures was evaluated. Sections of the submucosal tunnel site were taken, and pathological evaluation was performed.</p>

<title>Technical Outcomes</title>
<p>Perioperative outcome is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611432721">Table 1</xref>. Transgastric peritoneal access and peritoneoscopy were accomplished successfully in all 6 pigs. The mean time required to create the submucosal tunnel by ESD was 25.7 minutes (range 20-32 minutes). In pig 1, we could not cut the mucosal layer smoothly and carbonization formed. The upper-side mucosal layer of the tunnel was damaged during dissection from the muscular layer. Afterward, we cut the mucosal layer carefully and dissected the upper-side mucosal layer of the tunnel from the muscular layer without injury. After transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy was completed, no rupture or injury of the submucosal tunnel was noted in spite of the vigorous movement of the endoscope for peritoneoscopy, and the endoscope was removed from all the pigs. Gastric distension was maintained without obvious pneumoperitoneum after endoscope removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611432721">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Follow-up Results</title>
<p>All the pigs recovered fully following transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy and resumed normal activity on the day of the procedure. They tolerated a liquid diet within a few hours of recovering from anesthesia and ate a regular diet on postoperative day 2. Five of the 6 pigs ate well during the survival period. Pig 1 did not eat well, and was suspected of having abdominal complications, but started to eat from postoperative day 3. During the postoperative period, there were no clinical signs of peritonitis in any pig except pig 1.

<p>The pigs were killed on postoperative day 7 after transgastric peritoneoscopy. There was no evidence of organ injury or peritonitis, such as ascites or abscess formation except in pig 1. Pig 1 showed local peritonitis with purulent fluid localized around the serosal incision site and strong adhesion of the omentum. Serosal examination of the incision site revealed adhesion of the omentum or thin scarring in the 5 pigs with no complications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611432721">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although several technical variations have been described for gaining access to the peritoneal cavity via a hollow viscus such as the stomach in NOTES, secure closure of the access site continues to be the most important concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611432721">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432721">7</xref></sup> von Delius et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611432721">9</xref></sup> reported that the narrow longitude submucosal tunnel technique with clip closure at the mucosal incision was the most effective method for closing an iatrogenic gastric wall defect. We previously reported the successful performance of transgastric staging for pancreatic cancer using a submucosal tunnel technique in NOTES.8 The narrow longitudinal submucosal tunnel itself may be good for wound approximation and healing, and thus it may be possible to perform the submucosal tunnel technique without mucosal closure in transgastric peritoneoscopy. Therefore, to proceed to clinical application, it is important to clarify the sealing effects and healing process that occur when the submucosal tunnel itself is used for closure.</p>
<p>In the present study, 1 of 6 pigs developed mild peritonitis and formed a large open ulcer at the mucosal entry site. However, the other 5 pigs recovered with no complications after this procedure, confirming completeness of gastric closure. We believe that the size of the open defect at the mucosal incision site and the damage to the upper-side mucosal layer of the tunnel may relate to iatrogenic damage. To avoid a large open ulcer, it is important to cut the mucosal layer smoothly and at a proper length (&lt;20 mm) with a flex knife using the cutting mode without coagulation. In pig 1, we were not able to cut the mucosal layer smoothly, and carbonization formed, which largely might have caused the damage to the mucosal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1553350611432721">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the upper-side mucosal layer of the tunnel was damaged during dissection from the muscular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1553350611432721">Figure 6B</xref>). Thereafter, we cut the mucosal layer carefully and dissected from the muscular layer without injury to the upper-side mucosal layer of the tunnel. The other 5 pigs, in which smooth cutting of the mucosal layer and successful dissection of the submucosal layer from the muscular layer were performed, demonstrated no complications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1553350611432721">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1553350611432721">B</xref>). Another important factor that needs to be considered when interpreting the complication of the first pig, is the learning curve posed by the technique. We experienced the first pig that was not cut the mucosal layer smoothly, and the upper-side mucosal layer of the tunnel was damaged during dissection from the muscular layer, which might lead to delaying of healing the mucosal incision site and peritonitis. This experience was taken into consideration for the subsequent experiments.</p>

<p>In the present study, the artificial gastric ulcer seen at necropsy on postoperative day 7 was that of an open ulcer with mucosal defect. However, our colleagues in the Surgery I division of Oita University previously reported that on postoperative day 7 after NOTES transgastric peritoneoscopy using the submucosal tunnel with clip closure of the mucosal entry site, small ulcer at scar stage was observed at the site of the artificial gastric ulcer in all 6 pigs studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432721">7</xref></sup> Although the clinical setting of the present study, including preparation of the pigs, transgastric peritoneoscopy using the submucosal tunnel technique, and follow-up and necropsy, was almost the same as that of our colleagues, the mucosal closure technique was different. This suggests that mucosal closure with clips played an important role in the promotion of proper healing of the mucosal incision defect.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study showed that the submucosal tunnel technique using ESD without mucosal closure is a safe and effective method for transgastric peritoneal access and subsequent closure, where the endoscopists’ learning curve was accomplished and the submucosal tunnel was produced without mucosal damage. Although this technique will work once the process is smooth, the closure of mucosal defect should be performed at first or whenever things are not perfect. It is necessary to use devices such as mucosal clips or tissue anchors in order to achieve adequate healing of mucosal defect.</p>
