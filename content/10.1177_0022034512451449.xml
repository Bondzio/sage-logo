<abstract>
<p>During periodontal regeneration, inhibition of gingival downgrowth is necessary to promote migration of mesenchymal cells into the defects. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that has numerous cell functions, including regulation of epithelial growth. Recent studies have shown that Smad2, a downstream transcription factor of TGF-β, plays crucial roles in wound healing in the epithelia. Therefore, we investigated the effects of Smad2 overexpression on re-epithelialization of gingival wounds. Transgenic mice overexpressing <italic>smad2</italic> driven by the <italic>keratin 14</italic> promoter (<italic>k14-smad2</italic>) were confirmed to have significant Smad2 phosphorylation in gingival basal epithelia. Punch wounds were made in the palatal gingiva, and wound healing was assessed histologically for 7 days. Re-epithelialization was significantly retarded on day 2, while collagen deposition was enhanced on day 7 in <italic>k14-smad2</italic> compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, expression of keratin 16 (K16), an indicator of keratinocyte migration, was significantly inhibited in wound-edge keratinocytes in <italic>k14-smad2</italic>. The inhibition of K16 coincided with the induction of Smad2 in the corresponding epithelia, while BrdU incorporation was unaffected. These results indicated that Smad2 has inhibitory effects in regulating keratinocyte migration during gingival wound healing. TGF-β/Smad2 signaling mediating alteration of K16 expression must be tightly regulated during periodontal regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Periodontal regeneration can be achieved through synergistic interactions of different cell populations of ectodermal and mesenchymal origin. Because of differences in cell proliferation rates of each periodontal component during wound healing, it is necessary to temporarily prevent gingival epithelial downgrowth along the root surface, allowing the intrabony defects to be repopulated by mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512451449">Wikesjö and Selvig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512451449">Cho and Garant, 2000</xref>). The guided tissue regeneration (GTR) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512451449">Nyman <italic>et al</italic>., 1982</xref>) is the only periodontal regenerative treatment approach that aims to physically prevent epithelial downgrowth, but it is problematic because of susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512451449">Tempro and Nalbandian, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512451449">Bratthall <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Thus, other methods should be explored. Here, we developed a strategy to improve periodontal wound healing by exogenous biological molecules that can prevent gingival downgrowth.</p>
<p>Epithelial wound healing involves coordination between migration and proliferation of keratinocytes, extracellular matrix deposition, and re-epithelialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512451449">Clark, 1996</xref>). Re-epithelialization begins with keratinocyte migration, which occurs in a series of sequential steps: adhesion formation by integrins at the leading edge, translocation of the cell body, adhesion disassembly at the cell rear by regulators of adhesion turnover, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and rear retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512451449">Ridley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Moreover, when injury occurs, strong induction of keratin 16 (K16) and K6 occurs in post-mitotic cells at the wound edge, which is a crucial event that precedes the onset of keratinocyte migration into the wound site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512451449">Paladini <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Although K16 is not present in the normal epidermis, it is constitutively expressed in some other stratified epithelia, including the palate, gingiva, and junctional epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512451449">Presland and Dale, 2000</xref>). Thus, K16 appears to be involved in alteration of the adhesion molecules at the wound edge, affecting keratinocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512451449">Freedberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is important in multiple aspects of wound healing, including epithelial growth and collagen deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512451449">Werner and Grose, 2003</xref>). Signal transduction from TGF-β1 depends on phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins, which then translocate to the nucleus to initiate transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512451449">Heldin <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512451449">Massagué <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Although each Smad is phosphorylated directly by the TGF-β type I receptor, all may have distinct roles in the cellular and tissue responses to wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512451449">Massagué, 1999</xref>). <italic>Smad2</italic>-knockout mice are embryonic-lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512451449">Nomura and Li, 1998</xref>), while <italic>smad3</italic>-knockout mice die from immune defects after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512451449">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Importantly, loss of <italic>smad3</italic> markedly enhances the rate of wound re-epithelialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512451449">Ashcroft <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512451449">Jinno <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), whereas the role of Smad2 has not been fully explored.</p>
<p>Previously, transgenic mice overexpressing <italic>smad2</italic> driven by the <italic>keratin 14</italic> promoter were established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512451449">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). These mice decelerate cutaneous wound healing because of impaired epithelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512451449">Hosokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that Smad2 is a feasible candidate molecule for inhibition of epithelial downgrowth. Although healing of both oral and cutaneous wounds proceeds through the same sequential phases, oral wounds are distinguished by rapid healing and reduced scar formation compared with cutaneous wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512451449">Szpaderska <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Moreover, gingival keratinocytes migrate directly through the fibrin clot, which is different from cutaneous keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512451449">Hakkinen <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is necessary to investigate the effects of Smad2 in gingival wounds for possible clinical applications. Here, we investigated gingival re-epithelialization from a histological and molecular biological viewpoint, with emphasis on the relevance of keratinocyte migration.</p>

<title>Wound-healing Model</title>
<p>Full-thickness wounds were made in the palatal gingiva near the first molar by means of a 1-mm biopsy punch (BIOPSY PUNCH<sup>®</sup>; Kai Industries, Tokyo, Japan). The wounds were assessed for 7 days post-wounding (<italic>n</italic> = 3 from each wound time-point for both genotypes). The wounds were photographed by stereomicroscopy (Stemi200CS; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Quantitative wound-closure measurement was performed histologically as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512451449">Graves <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512451449">Jinno <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512451449">Martinez-Ferrer <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), with minor modifications. Briefly, the specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for paraffin embedding. Cross-sections, measuring 5 µm, were taken from the wound gap, and an area measuring approximately 200 µm in the central portion was stained with H&amp;E to determine the wound centers, visualized by microscopy (BX50, DP70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 40 × magnification. The wound width was measured with DP Controller (Ver.1.2.1.108) (Olympus). The re- epithelialization rates were calculated as the distance of epithelial migration divided by the distance between original wound margins, visible where the fibrous connective tissues and basal keratinocytes were disrupted.</p>
<p>Every 5 sections at the central portion of each wound were subjected to assessment of the organization and the amounts of collagen and non-collagenous proteins, with the use of the Sirius Red/Fast Green Collagen Staining Kit (Chondrex, Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) as <italic>per</italic> the manufacturer’s instructions. To quantify collagen deposition in the specimens with exemption of bone and tooth, we analyzed microscopic images of the staining sections using ImageJ software as documented (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/examples/stained-sections/index.html">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/examples/stained-sections/index.html</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Western Blotting Analysis</title>
<p>Wound tissues containing the punched area were collected on various days post-wounding (<italic>n</italic> = 5 from each wound time-point for both genotypes). Homogenized samples were used for blotting as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512451449">Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The membranes were blocked for 1 hr with 5% skimmed milk (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in TBS and then incubated at 4°C for 12 hrs with antibodies against Smad2 (#610842, 1:1,000 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA), phospho-Smad2 (P-Smad2) (#3101, 1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), TGF-β1 (#MAB240, 1:1,000 dilution; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), integrin α3 (#V76720, 1:250 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (#3285, 1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), or keratin16 (K16) (#LS-C50087, 1:5,000 dilution; Lifespan Biosciences, Seattle, WA, USA), and GAPDH (#MAB374, 1:1,000 dilution; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) as a loading control. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The signal intensities were quantified by ImageJ.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Sections were blocked for 1 hr with 10% goat serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in PBS, and then incubated at room temperature for 12 hrs with 1:100 dilution of antibodies against Smad2, P-Smad2, or K16 (as described above) followed by addition of either Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 488 or Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 594-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclear staining was performed with DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Staining signals were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (BX50, DP70; Olympus). Staining was performed on 3 separate samples <italic>per</italic> genotype, <italic>per</italic> time-point. Non-specific staining was determined with the use of an appropriate isotype control antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at the same concentration.</p>

<title>Cell Proliferation Assay</title>
<p>Mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine: Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (100 µg <italic>per</italic> g body weight) every 12 hrs, and sacrificed 1 hr after the last injection (<italic>n</italic> = 3 from both genotypes). BrdU incorporation was detected on paraffin sections with the use of a Zymed<sup>®</sup> BrdU Staining Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty randomly selected sections from the center of each wound were used for the analysis.

<title>Induction of TGF-β/Smad2 Signaling in Smad2-overexpressing Gingiva</title>
<p>To verify the effects of <italic>smad2</italic> overexpression on TGF-β/Smad2 signaling, we performed Western blotting with intact gingiva. The levels of Smad2 and P-Smad2 were 5- to 8-fold higher in TG than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Figs. 1Aa</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">1Ab</xref>). Moreover, TG mice had a significant increase in TGF-β1 compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Fig. 1Ac</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that Smad2 was expressed throughout all layers of epithelia except the basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Fig. 1Be</xref>), while P-Smad2 was highly expressed in the basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Fig. 1Bf</xref>). In WT, Smad2 immunofluorescence was virtually undetectable, and there was a non-specific background of staining only for P-Smad2 in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Figs. 1Ba</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">1Bb</xref>, Appendix Fig. 1).</p>

<title>Retarded Wound Re-epithelialization in Smad2-overexpressing Gingiva</title>
<p>To investigate the biological function of Smad2 in regulating epithelial wound healing, we examined the extent of wound closure. The wound area was visually larger in TG mice than in WT mice on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Figs. 2Ab</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2Af</xref>); however, TG and WT wounds became similar after day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Figs. 2Ac</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2Ad</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2Ag</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2Ah</xref>). Histological examination demonstrated that, on day 2, Smad2 overexpression clearly decelerated gingival wound healing, and TG wounds were 18 % re-epithelialized (p &lt; 0.05), compared with 54 % in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Figs. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2C</xref>). Collagen fiber was absent below the migrating keratinocytes in both TG and WT wound sites on day 2 (Appendix Fig. 3). Interestingly, on day 3, the wound healing in TG mice caught up to that in WT mice; however, epithelial thickness was thinner in TG mice than in WT mice (Appendix Fig. 2). On day 7, epidermal architecture in TG mice was similar to that in WT mice; however, discontinuity of collagen was more frequently observed in the center area of WT wounds than in that of TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Fig. 2D</xref>). Although the wound was completely re-epithelialized, the wound bed could be distinguished by the presence of a thin collagen layer and disrupted stratum corneum and basal stratum in TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Fig. 2D</xref>). The first molar could also be an anatomic landmark for the punched region (left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Fig. 2D</xref>).

<p>To examine the direct role of proliferation in the decelerated wound closure and re-epithelialization by Smad2 overexpression, we analyzed the incorporation of BrdU in the wound-edge keratinocytes on day 2. Keratinocyte proliferation was increased away from the wound edge in the basal layer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512451449">Figs. 3Aa</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512451449">3Ab</xref>). However, the incorporation of BrdU was uncommon in the epithelial edges of the wound in both WT and TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512451449">Figs. 3Ac</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512451449">3Ad</xref>). We counted the number of BrdU-positive cells to determine the effect of Smad2 on wound-edge keratinocytes, and found no significant difference between genotypes on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512451449">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Reduced Expression of Keratin16 in Smad2-overexpressing Gingiva</title>
<p>To address the molecular mechanism of retarded re-epithelialization regulated by Smad2 overexpression, we examined the expression of cell migration molecules integrin α3, FAK, and K16 on day 2. Densitometric analysis indicated that K16 levels were significantly lower in TG than in WT mice, whereas FAK and integrin α3 levels were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">Fig. 4A</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that gingiva constitutively expressed K16 in the spinous cell layer, including the leading edges of the wound. The intensity of K16 in either wound or intact gingiva was significantly decreased in TG compared with that in WT mice. When compared between intact and wound sites, wound tissues had significantly lower intensity than intact tissues in TG mice, while sites in WT mice were similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">Fig. 4B</xref>). Moreover, to determine the correlation with Smad2 overexpression, we examined the co-localization of Smad2 and K16 on day 2. Both molecules were mostly co-localized in the wound edges; however, TG mice showed reduced K16 expression in the corresponding location with enhanced Smad2 expression compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">Figs. 4Ca</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">4Cb</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">4Ce</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">4Cf</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During wound healing after periodontal regenerative therapy, it is critical to inhibit epithelial migration along the root surface in the early phase, and thereafter re-epithelialization must be completed as rapidly as possible to re-establish tissue integrity. In this study, re-epithelialization was significantly decelerated in TG compared with WT mice until day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Figs. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2C</xref>); however, it became histologically similar between WT and TG mice after day 3 (Appendix Fig. 2). Analysis of these data indicated that Smad2 signaling effectively inhibits re-epithelialization only in the early stage after wounding, and subsequently there must be a compensatory signal that accelerates re-epithelialization. TG mice showed significantly high levels of TGF-β1 in addition to Smad2 and P-Smad2 expression in the gingiva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that there may be an autocrine loop of TGF-β1 ligand secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512451449">Van Obberghen-Schilling <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>) enhanced by Smad2 overexpression. Continuous activation of TGF-β receptors has been reported to lead to proteasome-mediated elimination of activated Smad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512451449">Lo and Massagué, 1999</xref>). The self-elimination signal may contribute to recuperation in normal wound healing in the late stage after wounding.</p>
<p>Since TGF-β signaling has been implicated in collagen deposition, Sirius Red analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">Figs. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451449">2E</xref>). Although TG mice had a well-developed collagen compared with WT mice on day 7, there was no significant abnormality in collagen quality and quantity in TG mice. While TGF-β signaling is implicated in several aspects of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512451449">Derynck and Akhurst, 2007</xref>), longitudinal wound analysis is needed for the assessment of gingival repair architecture. The acquisition of collagen maturation and decelerated re-epithelialization in TG mice reinforced the concept that TGF-β/Smad2 signaling is mitogenic for fibroblasts, but anti-proliferative for epithelial cells during wound healing. Keratinocyte migration precedes the proliferation process in open wounds, such as on day 2 in this study. Although individual processes are overlapping across the early phases of wound healing, it can be excluded that cell proliferation has a predominant role in decelerated re-epithelialization in TG mice, since there was no significant difference in BrdU incorporation between WT and TG mice on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512451449">Fig. 3</xref>); the decelerated re-epithelialization was mostly due to impaired gingival migration by Smad2 overexpression.</p>
<p>In response to epidermal injury, keratinocytes express a specific set of keratin proteins, distinct from the keratins in the healthy epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512451449">Tomic-Canic <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Our results indicated that intact TG mice had a significantly lower K16 level than intact WT mice. Moreover, K16 in wounded TG mice was decreased compared with that in intact TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512451449">Fig. 4</xref>). Since TGF-β1; is up-regulated during gingival wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512451449">Hakkinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and also in TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451449">Fig. 1A</xref>), keratinocyte-specific overexpression of TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling may suppress K16 expression, resulting in decelerated re-epithelialization. It will be intriguing to investigate the physiological role of constitutively expressed K16 in normal gingiva, and the precise mechanism for down-regulation of K16 by Smad2 signaling during re-epithelialization.</p>
<p>In summary, our study clearly demonstrated that overexpression of Smad2 decelerates re-epithelialization in the early stage after wounding. The reduced expression of K16 may re-organize cytoskeletal components, affecting keratinocyte migration. We demonstrate that gingival downgrowth can be prevented by exogenous molecules <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since the inhibitory effect on gingival migration by overexpression of Smad2 is transient and does not affect tissue integrity, further investigation of the detailed mechanism, and manipulation of the duration and extent, of Smad2 signaling may be useful for molecular control of gingival downgrowth, leading to successful periodontal regeneration.</p>
