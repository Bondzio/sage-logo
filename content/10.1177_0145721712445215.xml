<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to assess factors related to diabetes medication nonadherence in a sample of predominantly Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin adults residing along the US-Mexico border.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712445215">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>As part of a randomized controlled trial, 302 patients randomly sampled from a clinic roster completed a baseline interview. Medication nonadherence was assessed with the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Consistent with the framework proposed by Venturini et al, four factors were examined: patient-related attributes, drug regimen characteristics and complexity, health status, and patient-provider interaction characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712445215">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixty percent of the patients were classified as nonadherent. Men, those who engaged in diabetes control behaviors less frequently, and individuals with depression were more likely to be classified as nonadherent. Among those who were Spanish-dominant, education and self-rated health also were significantly and negatively related to medication adherence; patients with a high school education or greater and those who more positively rated their health were more likely to be classified as nonadherent compared to those with less than a high school education and those who rated their health as poor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721712445215">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Results reflect potentially higher medication nonadherence rates for Latinos with type 2 diabetes living in rural communities along the US-Mexico border. Additionally, this study supports the need to address strategies to support medication adherence, including addressing depression, for diabetes control. Strategies to promote adherence among Latino men are sorely needed, as are strategies to address forgetfulness and carelessness regarding diabetes medicine taking.</p>

<p>In the United States, the incidence of diabetes in adults aged 18 to 79 has almost doubled in the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712445215">1</xref></sup> While rates have increased in the general population, the prevalence remains unevenly distributed, with 11.8% of Hispanics, 12.6% of non-Hispanic blacks, and 8.4% of Asian Americans diagnosed with diabetes compared to 7.1% of non-Hispanic whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712445215">2</xref></sup> Tight diabetes control (ADA recommendation of hemoglobin A1C &lt; 7%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712445215">3</xref></sup>) is important for preventing long-term complications; however, many patients never achieve this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712445215">4</xref></sup> In general, Latinos have worse glycemic control compared to other racial and ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712445215">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712445215">6</xref></sup> Poor glycemic control among Latinos is associated with a number of barriers, including lack of access to health care, cultural and linguistic barriers to receipt of health information, and sociocultural and economic barriers to adherence behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712445215">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712445215">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there are many factors that impact glycemic control, adherence, defined as the extent to which patients follow the instructions they are given for prescribed treatments, is consistently shown to improve control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712445215">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712445215"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712445215">11</xref></sup> Moreover, nonadherence is associated with an increase in A1C as well as other negative health outcomes such as increased LDL cholesterol levels, increased all-cause hospitalizations, and increased all-cause mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712445215">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712445215"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445215">14</xref></sup> Despite awareness of the importance of medication adherence, rates vary widely between 36% to 93% for oral hypoglycemic agents and 63% to 80% for insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712445215">15</xref></sup> However, very few studies addressing adherence rates and factors that influence adherence have included Latinos.</p>
<p>In a review published in 2011, Peeters et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712445215">16</xref></sup> identified 12 studies addressing adherence to oral hypoglycemic agents among patients with type 2 diabetes of at least one ethnic group other than whites. Of these 12 studies, only 3 sampled Latinos. A retrospective analysis conducted by Venturini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445215">17</xref></sup> assessed compliance with sulfonylureas in a sample of patients that was 17% Latino. Using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712445215">18</xref></sup> the researchers found that 44% of patients self-reported highly compliant behavior. The authors proposed a framework for examining adherence behavior that included four categories: patient-related attributes, drug regimen characteristics and complexity, health status and disease-related factors, and patient-provider interaction characteristics. In their study, the researchers found age to be significantly positively related with compliance while treatment complexity, perception of general health, and being a newly treated patient were inversely related with compliance. A longitudinal study by Kuo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445215">14</xref></sup> assessed the inconsistent use of diabetes medications and its effects on diabetes complications and mortality among 908 Mexican Americans over the age of 65 years. In their study, the authors determined that 64% of the patients had high consistent use of their oral hypoglycemic medications. Kuo et al found that older age (≥75 years), in contrast to Venturini et al, and lack of supplemental health insurance were significantly associated with inconsistent use of medication. Another study identified by Peeters et al was a cross-sectional study by Sarkar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712445215">19</xref></sup> that examined the association between self-efficacy and diabetes self-management. Among their largely Hispanic (40%) and African American (25%) sample, 64% of the patients reported high medication adherence, and no association was found between self-efficacy and medication adherence. A more recent cross-sectional study by Mann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445215">20</xref></sup> assessed predictors of medication adherence among a sample that was 58% Latino and found that 78% of the patients were highly adherent to their diabetes medication regimen. The authors identified disease and medication beliefs as significant predictors of poor medication adherence, such as believing you have diabetes only when blood sugar is high and believing there is no need to take medicine when blood sugar is normal. Of these 4 studies, only 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445215">20</xref></sup> reported on the country of origin of the Latinos they sampled, which is important because of the additional barriers foreign-born individuals may face for both health care utilization and possibly medication adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712445215">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given limited evidence on predictors of medication adherence among Latinos, especially among immigrant Latinos, this study examined (1) the rates of medication nonadherence in this predominantly Spanish-speaking sample of Mexican-origin adults and (2) the characteristics associated with diabetes medication nonadherence using the framework proposed by Venturini et al (patient-related attributes, drug regimen characteristics and complexity, health status and disease-related factors, and patient-provider interaction characteristics).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445215">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study investigated factors associated with diabetes medication nonadherence using baseline data of 302 randomly sampled Latino patients with type 2 diabetes. The study population was derived from the <italic>Puentes hacia una mejor vida</italic> (<italic>Puentes</italic>; Bridges to a better life) study, 1 of 8 international randomized controlled studies funded by the Peers for Progress network to test models of peer support for diabetes control (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.peersforprogress.org">http://www.peersforprogress.org</ext-link>). The <italic>Puentes</italic> study involved a partnership between the Institute for Behavioral and Community Health (IBACH) at the San Diego State University Research Foundation and <italic>Clínicas de Salud del Pueblo</italic>, Inc. (CDSDP), a private, nonprofit corporation providing comprehensive primary care services to over 54 000 patients per year across 10 clinic sites throughout Imperial and Riverside Counties.</p>
<p>All study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of San Diego State University to ensure protection of human participants. Research assistants conducting study activities at the clinic completed ethics training at CDSDP to meet HIPAA requirements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721712445215">
<title>Study Setting</title>
<p>Imperial County is located in Southern California and borders Mexico to the south, Riverside County to the north, San Diego County to the west, and the State of Arizona to the east. Population estimates for 2010 indicate that of the more than 174 000 people living in Imperial County, approximately 80% are of Hispanic or Latino origin, 32% are foreign born, 48% are female, and 63% are high school graduates. The median household income in 2009 was estimated at US $37 846, with 23% of persons living below the poverty level, compared to the California median household income of US $58 925 and 14% of persons living below the poverty level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445215">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, recent Imperial County estimates indicate that in 2009, 67% of adults were overweight and obese and 11% of adults were diagnosed with diabetes, compared to 56% of overweight and obese adults and 7% of adults diagnosed with diabetes in California.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712445215">22</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0145721712445215">
<title>Participants and Recruitment Procedures</title>
<p><italic>Puentes</italic> study participants were randomly sampled from 3 CDSDP clinics located in the cities of Brawley, Calexico, and El Centro. Between April 2010 and January 2011, patients with diabetes and who had been seen at the clinic during the past 3 months were identified through the electronic medical record system. Patients were removed from this list if they were under the age of 18 or had their diabetes under control (A1C &lt;7%). Fifty percent of the identified patients were randomly sampled and telephoned to assess eligibility and (if eligible) interest in participating in the study. Patients were excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) They had significant physical or developmental disability, (2) they were unable to read and sign the consent form in English or Spanish, (3) their primary residence was not in Imperial County, or (4) they planned to move out of Imperial County during the study period. This process occurred two to three times per clinic to obtain the final sample of 336 patients. For the current study, the sample was reduced to 302 after excluding individuals who (1) self-identified as other than Latino, (2) had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, or (3) self-reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes so recent that they had not been prescribed any hypoglycemic agents.</p>
<p>Once eligibility and interest were determined, the staff member made an appointment with the patient to complete the consent form, medical chart release form, voice and image release form, and interviewer-administered survey, all of which were available in English or Spanish. The patient then met with his or her health care provider to obtain measures of height, weight, and blood pressure and to have their blood drawn if they had not had laboratory work completed within the past 3 months.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0145721712445215">
<title>Measurement of Medication Nonadherence</title>
<p>Patients self-reported medication nonadherence using the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), which examines barriers to medication taking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712445215">18</xref></sup> The scale has been used previously with Latinos who have diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445215">20</xref></sup> heart failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712445215">23</xref></sup> and hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445215">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712445215"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712445215">26</xref></sup> The items capture ways in which patients might experience drug omissions, for example, “Do you ever forget to take your diabetes medicine?” and “When you feel better, do you sometimes stop taking your diabetes medicine?” Response options were no (0) and yes (1). Affirmative responses were summed for a possible range of 0 to 4, with scores ≥1 indicating medication nonadherence. The reliability analysis yielded an alpha coefficient of .54, similar to but lower than other studies assessing adherence to hypertension, depression, and heart failure medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712445215">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445215">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712445215">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721712445215">
<title>Model Specification</title>
<p>The medication adherence model was based on the following four dimensions identified by researchers as outlined by Venturini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445215">17</xref></sup>: patient-related attributes, drug regimen characteristics and complexity, health status, and patient-provider interaction characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721712445215">
<title>Patient-Related Attributes</title>
<sec id="section13-0145721712445215">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics potentially associated with consistent use of diabetic medication were included in the analyses: age (continuous; years), gender (dichotomous; male vs female), education (dichotomous; less than high school education vs high school education or greater), health insurance status (dichotomous; uninsured vs insured), country of origin (foreign born vs US born), and self-rated general health (continuous; poor = 1 to excellent = 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0145721712445215">
<title>Personal actions</title>
<p>The 3-item personal actions subscale of the Chronic Illness Resource Survey (CIRS) was used to assess personal actions patients take to manage their diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712445215">28</xref></sup> Response options range from none of the time (1) to most of the time (5). A mean scale score was computed with higher scores indicating more frequent engagement in personal actions to support diabetes control. The reliability analysis yielded an alpha coefficient of .81.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0145721712445215">
<title>Mastery</title>
<p>The Pearlin and Schooler 7-item scale was used to assess the extent to which patients regarded their life chances as being under their control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712445215">29</xref></sup> Items include “I have little control over the things that happen to me” and “What happens to me in the future mostly depends on me.” Response options range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). Some items were first reverse-coded and a mean score was computed with higher scores indicating higher perceived mastery. The reliability analysis yielded an alpha coefficient of .63.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0145721712445215">
<title>Drug Regimen Characteristics and Complexity</title>
<p>Two variables were used to assess drug regimen characteristics and complexity: (1) total number of currently prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents and (2) whether the patient was on insulin. Both were assessed by asking the patients to either list all of their current diabetes medicines and/or by asking them to show the interviewer all the diabetes medications they were currently taking. The first yielded a sum of the number of oral hypoglycemic medications presented and the second determined if any of their medications were insulins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0145721712445215">
<title>Health Status and Disease Experience</title>
<sec id="section18-0145721712445215">
<title>Number of nights hospitalized</title>
<p>The total number of nights hospitalized was used to control for a possible underuse of diabetes medications due to hospitalization. This was assessed by self-report using one item to which patients reported the total number of nights they spent in a hospital within the past 6 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0145721712445215">
<title>Length of diagnosis</title>
<p>Length of diabetes diagnosis, in years, was determined by subtracting the patient’s self-reported age of diabetes diagnosis from their age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0145721712445215">
<title>Depression</title>
<p>Depression was assessed using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), which is a valid diagnostic and severity measure for depressive disorders previously used with Latinos.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712445215">30</xref></sup> Response options ranged from not at all (0) to nearly every day (3) and were summed with scores ≥10 indicating clinically significant depression. The reliability analysis yielded an alpha coefficient of .81.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0145721712445215">
<title>Patient-Provider Interaction Characteristics</title>
<sec id="section22-0145721712445215">
<title>Planned doctor visits</title>
<p>The number of planned doctor visits was assessed using one item to which patients reported how many planned doctor visits they had within the past 6 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0145721712445215">
<title>Communication with the provider</title>
<p>Frequency of doctor-patient communication was assessed with the 3-item Communication With Physicians Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712445215">31</xref></sup> Responses were made on a scale that ranged from never (0) to always (5). A mean scale score was computed with higher scores indicating more frequent communication with their primary care physician. The reliability analysis yielded an alpha coefficient of .66.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0145721712445215">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data management was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 18, and statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) Version 9.2. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population, and reliability analyses using Cronbach’s alpha were used to determine the internal consistency of all scales. To examine the factors associated with medication nonadherence, chi square (χ<sup>2</sup>) tests between categorical variables and Pearson’s correlations (<italic>r</italic>) between continuous variables were conducted to identify correlates of medication nonadherence at the univariate and bivariate levels. A multivariate logistic regression using a 4-step model building process was conducted to test the independent contribution of each variable while adjusting for all other variables. Also, given that 84% of the participants completed the survey in Spanish and given the association between language use and adherence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712445215">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712445215">33</xref></sup> the final logistic regression model was applied to the Spanish-dominant sample only (N = 254). All significance tests used an alpha level of .05.</p>

<title>Participant Characteristics</title>
<p>Study patients were primarily foreign born (78%), older, female (65%), and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for an average of 13 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712445215">Table 1</xref>). Eighty-six percent reported having health insurance with almost 20% reporting more than one source of insurance. Patients indicated moderate mastery (mean = 2.73, SD = .42), frequent engagement in personal actions to control their diabetes (mean = 3.53, SD = 1.16), and less frequent communication with their primary care provider regarding their diabetes (mean = 1.60, SD = 1.23). On average, patients reported having 1.70 (SD = .79) concurrent diabetes medications and 31% were prescribed insulin. The mean A1C was 8.42% (SD = 1.65%). In addition, 12 patients (4%) reported being hospitalized at least one night within the past 6 months. Mean self-rated general health was 2.10 (SD = .81), indicating that most patients rated their health as fair. Thirty-two percent of patients were estimated to have depression (PHQ-8 ≥10), 82% had clinically diagnosed hypertension, 40% diagnosed obesity, and 11% diagnosed heart disease.</p>

<title>Bivariate Predictors of Medication Nonadherence</title>
<p>Most patients (60%) reported not adhering to their physician prescribed diabetes medication regimen (MMAS ≥1). The most frequently endorsed reason for not adhering was forgetting to take the diabetes medication, and the least frequently endorsed item was stopping the medication regimen if the patient felt worse when taking his or her medicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712445215">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Building the logistic regression model involved a 4-step process (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712445215">Table 2</xref>). In the first step (M1) only the patient-related attributes were included and gender and personal actions were significantly associated with medication nonadherence (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). In the second step, the drug regimen characteristics were added to the model.

In the third step, the variables assessing health status and disease experience were added. In this step, gender and personal actions remained significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, respectively) and depression was identified as significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In the fourth and final step, the patient-provider variables of number of planned doctor visits within the past 6 months and communication with the provider were added.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, 60% of patients were identified as nonadherent based on the MMAS, consistent with several studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712445215">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445215">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445215">34</xref></sup> but higher than most. This may reflect an actual difference in adherence rates for Latinos with type 2 diabetes living in rural communities along the US-Mexico border, a group that has not been sufficiently studied. Based on the multivariate analyses, being male, lower frequency of engaging in personal actions, and having depression were all associated with medication nonadherence, consistent with medication adherence research involving other ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445215">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445215"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712445215"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721712445215">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among those who are Spanish-dominant, the relationships between nonadherence and gender, personal actions, and depression persisted. In addition, higher education and higher self-rated health were significantly and positively related to medication nonadherence, the latter consistent with at least one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445215">17</xref></sup> The finding that higher education is negatively associated with medication adherence may seem counterintuitive; however, researchers have suggested that better educated people may feel more responsible for their own health and make decisions about discontinuing drug treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145721712445215">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strength of this study lay in its focus on predominantly foreign-born Spanish-dominant Latino patients with type 2 diabetes who reside in rural communities along the US-Mexico border. While this limits the generalizability of the study, it has the advantage of describing an understudied community. Study findings contribute to the current body of literature on factors associated with medication nonadherence and add to the growing literature on adherence in the Latino population. However, as with all cross-sectional studies, this study offers only a snapshot; causality or directionality cannot be determined. Also, the self-reported measures may have been subject to recall bias and/or social desirability bias.</p>
<sec id="section30-0145721712445215">
<title>Implications for Diabetes Educators</title>
<p>Examining factors associated with medication nonadherence among foreign-born Spanish-speaking patients suggests potential areas of intervention. Of specific interest to diabetes educators should be the need to integrate depression screening and treatment as a means to improve adherence. Increased attention should also be placed on Latino males. It is probable that additional strategies are needed for Latino males on the importance of taking all medications. In this study, engaging in personal actions to support diabetes was found to be protective against medication nonadherence, which can also be a target of intervention to improve medication adherence. By educating Latino patients on how to engage in activities that support their diabetes, diabetes educators may effectively address blood glucose control.</p>
<p>Because the most highly endorsed items for nonadherence included being forgetful or careless about taking diabetes medicines, additional strategies are needed to address these issues. Low-cost strategies and suggestions may include talking with patients about linking taking diabetes medicines with normal, recurring daily activities, such as going to bed or after a meal; providing plastic daily-dosing containers and/or any additional items that may prompt the patients to remember to take their medications; or using customized daily email or text reminders.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned points of intervention may be effective in improving medication adherence, longitudinal research is needed to identify which strategies would work best with this population as well as the long-term effects of diabetes medication nonadherence. Future research should also address the differences that exist between less acculturated patients and those who are dominant in the English language since it is clear they face different barriers. A multifaceted approach to improving medication adherence may require more resources, but it may be the most effective method to improve glycemic control.</p>
