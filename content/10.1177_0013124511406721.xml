<abstract>
<p>Educational and sociological scholars frequently debate how racial dynamics between neighborhoods and their public schools can maintain or exacerbate educational inequality. Drawing on secondary data from the Georgia Department of Education, 2000 Census Bureau, and attendance boundaries for metro Atlanta public high schools, this study investigates the following: To what degree do Atlanta-area racial and ethnic segregation patterns in public secondary schools reflect those in residential catchment areas? I find that in areas with the greatest racial heterogeneity and the greatest potential for diversity in educational settings, the public schools least reflect the racial composition of the neighborhoods. These results can inform policy makers and administrators on neighborhood and school-level factors which have implications for minimizing ethnoracial differences in education.</p>

<p>In the <italic>Souls of Black Folk</italic>, W. E. B. Dubois characterized Atlanta as “South of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred Hills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the future” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511406721">DuBois, 1903</xref>, p. 76). There are many signs of positive racial change in Atlanta and the status of African Americans has greatly improved over time. African American mayors have held office since 1973, 40% of Atlanta’s city business is done with minority contractors, African Americans constitute more than half of the city’s police force, and Atlanta contains one of the most vibrant Black middle-class in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511406721">Orfield &amp; Ashkinaze, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511406721">Owens &amp; Rich, 2002</xref>). In addition, city’s employment opportunities have fueled domestic migration as well as attracted a growing number of foreign-born workers in the last three decades which significantly changed the racial landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511406721">Gozdziak, 2005</xref>). However, metro Atlanta public schools, secondary institutions in particular, have actually become more segregated in the past 30 years by both race and class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511406721">Orfield &amp; Eaton, 1996</xref>). Metro Atlanta has experienced a rise in Black–White resegregation and a steady increase in Latino–White segregation, and high dropout rates and low achievement scores continue to be prominent in the inner-city schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511406721">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>). Despite clear civil rights gains in Atlanta, public officials, school administrators, and teachers must scramble to meet No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 (NCLB) requirements, attempt to integrate a rapidly growing English language learner (ELL) population not seen before in the region and are expected to promote educational achievement of all students.</p>
<p>Three-way ethnic competition dynamics (Black, White, and Latino) are prevalent in many U.S. cities, but the rapid growth of Atlanta’s Latino population has added a new dimension to neighborhood ethnic competition, long understood in dichotomous Black-and-White terms. Limited research has examined the incorporation of Latino immigrant children in the South, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511406721">Wainer (2006)</xref> found signs of growing tensions between Latino immigrants and African Americans in metro Atlanta public schools. However, we know very little about how interethnic conflict manifests itself in a context where African Americans may choose to align with Whites. By examining the dynamics involving ethnically diverse groups in this contest, I hope to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how racial competition plays out in neighborhood schools.</p>
<p>Atlanta public schools saw a massive exodus of White students between 1967 and 1986. The city’s decline in White enrollment was one of the most rapid of all major school districts in the country, with White enrollment dropping 41% over the two decades. However, White students were not the only ones who abandoned the city system; middle-class Black students also left as schools became blacker and poorer. In many cities, a traditional split between wealthy White suburban and inner-city poor Black schools exists. Atlanta fits this pattern at the extremes: The majority of poor schools are Black, and the wealthiest schools are predominately White. However, given the rising Black middle-class of Atlanta, in between these extremes researchers find that not every suburban school is wealthy or White. Instead, contemporary racial disparities in the metro Atlanta area are rooted in the context of extreme hypersegregation in housing; where the poorest inner-city schools are predominately Black, the wealthiest public schools are located in White suburbs, and in between these areas are Black suburbanites who live in areas of racial change and whose children attend integrated schools with increasing numbers of Latino and Asian students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511406721">Orfield &amp; Ashkinaze, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on segregation patterns across large U.S. school districts reveal that racial and economic segregation in public schools is higher than the residential racial and poverty rates across neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511406721">2007</xref>). Nationally, White–Black segregation is greater than White–Hispanic segregation in schools and neighborhoods, but “the gap in segregation between neighborhoods and schools is more prominent between white and Hispanic students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>, p. 98), meaning that the discrepancy between schools and their neighborhoods is greatest between Latinos and Whites. Similar international research on German and English education systems find large mismatches between school composition and catchment areas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013124511406721">1</xref></sup> in locales with the most racial and/or class diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511406721">Noreisch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511406721">Parsons, Chalkley, &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>). My study builds on this extant research by investigating the following: To what degree do Atlanta-area racial and ethnic segregation patterns in public secondary schools reflect those in residential catchment areas?</p>
<sec id="section1-0013124511406721">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The painful history of segregation and exclusion of African Americans in public schools is intimately tied to contemporary educational debates in the South. Although, the South had more integrated schools than any other region in the United States following major 1970’s court-mandated desegregation efforts, in the past couple of decades this pattern has begun to reverse itself again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511406721">Orfield &amp; Gordon, 2001</xref>). As desegregation policies were dismantled in the past 30 years, public schools began to reflect the neighborhood racial demographics once again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124511406721">Wells, Holme, Revilla, &amp; Atanda, 2009</xref>). Isolation patterns suggest most Atlanta-area public high schools are following national trends. Schools are experiencing significant racial shifts but are becoming more segregated for both Latinos and Blacks. Although African Americans remain slightly more isolated than Latinos in many Atlanta-area school districts, isolation rates have increased for both groups over the past 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511406721">Tarasawa, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In a variety of ways, the legacy of housing discrimination continues to shape neighborhoods, and therefore the public schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511406721">Orfield (1996)</xref> argues the history of housing discrimination and real estate practices in the United States reinforces a self-perpetuating pattern of segregation. Most people look for homes in areas where they have knowledge of the neighborhood or acquaintances, thus offering Whites and Blacks familiarity with separate communities. White realtors seldom look for housing in “minority communities” and real estate steering practices are frequently organized along racial lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511406721">Isenberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406721">Kruse, 2005</xref>). In addition, the fears of violence and intimidation in some White communities still pose serious obstacles to housing choice for African Americans.</p>
<p>Research on neighborhood choice finds that Whites prefer to live in neighborhoods with high proportions of other Whites and seek out schools that are also majority White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511406721">Alba &amp; Logan, 1993</xref>). However, attitudinal survey data consistently find non-Whites have a greater tolerance for integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406721">Bobo &amp; Zubrinsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406721">Massey &amp; Denton, 1993</xref>). Whites have avoided integration by moving to all-White or mostly White neighborhoods, enrolling their children in mostly White schools or sending them to private schools. Social status is often associated with the neighborhoods people live in as well as the quality of the schools their children attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406721">Holme, 2002</xref>). Within the context of schools, growing minority enrollment can be perceived as a threat to the dominant racial or ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406721">Olzak &amp; Shanahan, 1994</xref>). Contemporary work on White flight finds that residentially mobile families and students who transfer schools tend to be White and affluent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511406721">Levin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406721">Renzulli &amp; Evans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511406721">Saporito, 2003</xref>). In addition, White students are more likely to enroll in private and magnet schools as the percentages of non-Whites in their neighborhoods increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511406721">Lankford &amp; Wyckoff, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>National research on segregation patterns across large U.S. school districts also reveals that racial and economic segregation in public schools exceeds residential segregation and neighborhood poverty rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2007</xref>). Blacks continue to be segregated from Whites in both schools and neighborhoods, but the mismatch between the demographic composition of neighborhoods and schools is most pronounced when the neighborhood is composed of Whites and Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>). In other words, the discrepancy between schools and their neighborhoods is greatest between Latinos and Whites. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406721">Reardon and Yun (2001)</xref> found between 1990 and 2000, southern states saw a decrease in residential segregation but an increase in school segregation. Thus, it is important to understand how localized residential segregation affects school-level enrollment patterns.</p>
<p>I build on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito and Sohoni’s (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511406721">2007</xref>) work, but with a focus on the metro Atlanta area. Drawing from recent developments in the field of sociology of spatial inequality, this study examines the ecological context in which racial competition takes place by exploring segregation patterns across neighborhoods and schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406721">Lobao, Hooks, &amp; Tickamyer, 2007</xref>). This perspective brings into focus the complex spatial relationship between schools and race, which are at their clearest at the local level. By restricting the scope of this study to a specific time and setting, I can discuss issues of segregation in a more meaningful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406721">Kruse, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124511406721">Figure 1</xref> illustrates three hypotheses regarding the relationship between residential and school segregation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406721">Massey and Denton (1993)</xref> found in the hypersegregated neighborhoods of Chicago, schools reflected the same hypersegregated racial patterns. Thus, if residential segregation forms the core of status competition, then schools should mirror neighborhood demographics. However, if the segregation in schools exceeds residential patterns, schools magnify status competition dynamics. In other words, a significant negative mismatch between school and neighborhood racial composition signals that racial competition takes the form of flight from the local public school but not necessarily flight from the neighborhood. Another possibility is a positive mismatch; in other words, a school has a higher proportion of a particular racial minority group than what the catchment zone would predict. Overrepresentation could be a product of school choice or voucher program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511406721">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the direction of the mismatch is also important in understanding racial dynamics.</p>

<p>This analysis explores how racial and ethnic segregation patterns differ between Atlanta metropolitan public secondary schools and the residential catchment areas they serve. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013124511406721">Figure 2</xref> presents a map of the 20-county sample in this study, which encompass 27 school districts and 110 public high schools in 2000. The map also depicts the subregions: Atlanta and inner suburbs, northern outer suburbs, and southern outer suburbs. The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) defines these 20 counties as the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in accordance with the published standards applied to U.S. Census Bureau data. MSAs are regions that describe considerable core areas of population with bordering communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration, illustrated by high rates of commuting from the bordering areas to job locations in the city center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406721">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0013124511406721-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In collaboration with the ARC and local public school districts, I obtained catchment maps<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013124511406721">2</xref></sup> that depict all public high schools from the 27 school districts in the 20-county metro Atlanta area. I constructed attendance boundary maps using in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and subsequently integrated the maps of school catchment areas with 2000 block-level census data<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013124511406721">3</xref></sup> (the most recent data available) by overlaying the digital maps of catchment areas on top of maps of census blocks. Overlays allowed me to identify the school that served every block in each public high school. Thus I was able to determine the proportion of high-school aged children by race and ethnicity that live in each catchment area. These residential catchment areas reflect a baseline hypothetical situation if all students attended the local public school of their catchment area in the 2000/01 academic year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>). To examine how these hypothetical racial and ethnic compositions compared with actual racial demographics, I compared my baseline measures to the enrollments reported by the Georgia Department of Education in 2000/01.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013124511406721">
<title>Method</title>
<p>I first calculated the “mismatch” or discrepancy between the proportion of children by racial/ethnic group living in a school’s catchment zone to the proportion of children by racial/ethnic group attending the respective secondary school in the 2000/01 school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511406721">Noreisch, 2007</xref>). A value of 1.0 represents a perfect racial match, meaning the racial demographics of a particular public high school exactly match the racial percentages of its catchment zone. A mismatch value greater than 1.0 indicates a greater percentage of students from the specified group are attending the high school than are resident in the respective area. A mismatch value less than 1.0 means that a smaller proportion of children of a particular racial group are attending the high school than are resident in the catchment area. Second, I ran an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine if significant subarea differences exist for the racial mismatches. Finally, I created scatterplots that allowed me to visually compare the percentage of students by racial group with the percentage of their respective racial group in each school’s catchment area. By comparing schools with their neighborhoods, I was able to determine if there were lower or higher percentages of White, Black, or Latino<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013124511406721">4</xref></sup> students in schools than in their corresponding catchment areas. These analyses allowed me to observe, for each school, whether racial segregation in schools was greater than in the corresponding catchment areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>).</p>

There were significant differences between means across the suburbs for all racial mismatches. The greatest discrepancy between neighborhoods and catchment zones exist in Atlanta and the inner suburbs for all racial groups. The southern suburbs have greater Black mismatches than the northern suburbs but lower Latino mismatches. On average, Whites in Atlanta and the inner-suburb public high schools are underrepresented but overrepresented in the outer northern and southern suburbs. In contrast, Blacks are overrepresented in Atlanta and inner-suburbs schools but are slightly underrepresented in the outer suburbs. Latinos are underrepresented across the subarea regions but to the highest level in Atlanta and the inner suburbs.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0013124511406721">Figure 3</xref> presents the scatterplot of the percentage of White students in the schools and in the corresponding attendance boundaries. The hypothetical regression line (gray) depicts the proportion of White students who would be enrolled in public high schools if all children residing in the school catchment area attended their public neighborhood school. The actual regression line (black) compared with the hypothetical line reveals several interesting findings. In general, White students are enrolled in public schools at lower percentages than their catchment zones predict, and they are widely dispersed. This is especially true for areas where Whites are not predominately in the neighborhoods encompassed by the school catchment boundary. In addition, where Whites are the clear majority (more than 75%), schools reflect their catchment boundaries much more closely. I find that the difference between the percentage of White children in their catchment areas and their schools is greatest in areas that are more racially balanced, as indicated by the wide dispersion at the middle of the curvilinear regression line. “Where we would expect schools to contain nearly equal proportions of white and nonwhite students is precisely where white children are the most underrepresented in schools relative to their neighborhoods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>, p. 90). In other words, in integrated neighborhoods, residential segregation is less than school segregation.</p>

Again the hypothetical regression line (gray) depicts the proportion of Black students who would be enrolled in public high schools if all children residing in the school catchment area attended their public neighborhood school. Comparing the actual regression line (black) to the hypothetical line (gray) reveals Black students are enrolled in public schools at higher percentages than their catchment zones predict, and they are widely dispersed. In addition, there are several schools where African Americans comprise a modest percentage of the catchment area but comprise the majority of the public high school.</p>

<p>Latinos represented lower percentages in the public high schools than their catchment zones across the board. Comparing the hypothetical regression line (gray) to observed regression line (black) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0013124511406721">Figure 5</xref>, I find that in virtually every school, Latinos are enrolled at lower percentages than their catchment zones would predict, and they are highly clustered. In addition, this discrepancy increases as the percentage of Latinos in a school increases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The spatial mismatch measures capture the differences between actual levels of racial segregation in public high schools and the hypothetical scenario in which all children attended their local neighborhood public high school. The intensity of these patterns varied by the racial composition of the area and differed by racial group. My findings show support for both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406721">Massey and Denton (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito and Sohoni (2006)</xref> and points to a conditional relationship in metropolitan Atlanta. On one hand, the outer northern and southern suburban high schools, which are hypersegregated, more or less reflected their catchment zones. The majority of high schools in these districts were within 10% of the hypothetical racial breakdown in the catchment boundaries. These patterns lend support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406721">Massey and Denton’s (1993)</xref> research that suggests schools merely reflect the patterns of racial hypersegregation in neighborhoods. On the other hand, when residential segregation is not as pronounced, public high schools are less likely to reflect their catchment zones. One of the most troubling findings of this study is that in Atlanta and the inner-suburban schools, where Blacks, Whites, and Latinos are more likely to live in proximity, the public schools were the least likely to reflect the racial and ethnic composition. In other words, in areas with the greatest racial heterogeneity and the greatest potential for diversity in the public schools, the public schools <italic>least</italic> reflect the racial composition of the neighborhoods. These findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito and Sohoni (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511406721">2007</xref>), where schools are an additional domain for racial competition and can exacerbate residential segregation.</p>
<p>My findings show that racial competition dynamics are at work before students even enter schools. Where residential segregation is “successful,” schools are more likely to reflect the neighborhood racial composition. In contrast, when residential segregation “fails,” schools are less likely to resemble the neighborhood racial composition and provide another domain for racial competition. For metropolitan Atlanta, this means public high schools more or less reflect their neighborhoods in outer suburbs with higher levels of residential segregation. In contrast, inner-suburban and city-center schools with the greatest racial heterogeneity least reflect the racial composition of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study are important to remember. Although these data cannot differentiate in- and out-migration to and from particular catchment areas or to private, magnet, or charter schools, research on White racial patterns and enrollment find that White losses are spurred by both interracial contact and the availability of private alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406721">Clotfelter, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511406721">Jencks and Phillips (1998)</xref> find that a tipping point occurs: Once minority enrollment in a neighborhood school reaches a critical mass, most White parents are hesitant to move into that neighborhood. However, first-generation Latinos are less likely to have the resources to opt for private, charter, or magnet schools than Whites. In addition, research on Latino dropout rates suggests in areas with higher populations of Latinos, students are more likely to leave before degree completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124511406721">Secada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406721">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). The findings from this study beg further attention: Are the Latino and White negative mismatch patterns driven by the same factors? Why are Whites, overall, less represented in metro Atlanta public high schools than their neighborhood composition would predict? Why are Latinos less represented in metro Atlanta public high schools than their neighborhood composition would predict?</p>
<p>The above limitations notwithstanding, this study is one of a long line of studies of racial inequality in education that suggest, left to our own devices—families will promote racial segregation in public schools. Education is commonly perceived as the route to success and fulfillment of opportunity. However, the fate for our children of different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds are structurally unequal at the start. The findings from this project reveal how the micro-level qualitative findings about parental decisions around school choice become systemic macro-level patterns. Decisions parents and families make about where to send their children perpetuate structured inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406721">Holme’s (2002)</xref> work finds that status ideologies that emphasize race and class and information from other parents in their social networks influence parents’ choices about where to send their children. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406721">Renzulli and Evans (2005)</xref> find that racial competition over school status contributes to White families’ decisions to send their children to charter schools. When parents defend the legitimacy of meritocracy and by narrowly focusing on their own children’s life chances, these families continue to disregard the patterns they are perpetuating for a whole new generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511406721">Johnson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The racial mismatch results also show low representation of Latinos in metro Atlanta area public high schools relative to the neighborhood catchment zones, and this discrepancy increases as the percentage of Latinos in a school increases. These findings parallel national studies on Latino dropout rates which suggest in areas with higher populations of Latinos, students are more likely to leave before degree completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124511406721">Secada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406721">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). Although all children are guaranteed access to public education through Grade 12 in the United States, noncitizens, including undocumented immigrant children, face financial and legal barriers to college education. Particularly in the state of Georgia, even with a diploma from a local high school, undocumented students pay out-of-state tuition fees. Many states, such as California, Utah, Illinois, New Mexico, and Kansas, have passed laws that permit undocumented students to pay in-state tuition under specified conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511406721">College Board, 2009</xref>). However, the incentive of college admission is not actualized for undocumented immigrant students in Georgia without such laws.</p>
<p>This study has numerous policy implications. Recent research examining the impact of school and neighborhood segregation nationally finds that disadvantaged students from predominantly African American and Latino high schools, but not neighborhoods, are less likely than their fellow disadvantaged peers attending predominately White high schools to finish high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511406721">Goldsmith, 2009</xref>). These patterns suggests that in terms of long-term educational attainment of minority students, policies and practices designed to integrate African American and Latinos with Whites schools should take precedence over residential desegregation efforts. However, the findings from this study suggest that in Atlanta, policy remedies must tackle residential segregation in combination with school desegregation to make any real impact. Uncoordinated housing policies operating in housing markets which continue steering practices often intensify school segregation by destabilizing communities with higher levels of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511406721">Orfield &amp; Eaton, 1996</xref>). Recent gentrification processes where Whites return to the city but often send their children to private schools with low investment in neighborhood public schools adds another layer of complexity to the issue of residential patterns.</p>
<p>Second, the continued trend of suburban segregation presents a conundrum for local officials. Metropolitan Atlanta points to the need for cross-district desegregation plans. The most stable desegregation efforts have the greatest reach by including the city-center and suburban school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511406721">Orfield &amp; Eaton, 1996</xref>). As Clayton County public school district’s dramatic racial turnover demonstrates, older suburbs can face relatively fast racial resegregation in schools in tandem with significant changes in their housing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511406721">Tarasawa, 2009</xref>). Atlanta-area public high school racial enrollment patterns and geographic expansion projections point to greater levels of African American enrollment in the outer suburbs and growing numbers of Latinos in the northern suburbs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406721">Kruse, 2005</xref>). The outer suburbs of Atlanta, like many suburban districts nationally, have little experience and few tools for dealing with the racial transition.</p>
<p>Finally, the findings from these analyses offer some insight on local and national educational policy debates. Whereas some districts across the country operate widespread racial desegregation programs, in the form of magnet schools, or “controlled-choice options,” Atlanta is phasing out voluntary (Minority-to-Majority program) desegregation efforts. Furthermore, many Atlanta-area districts are moving toward choice or voucher programs. These free-market school choice policy decisions increase the ease of student mobility and may have an unintended effect of exacerbating current race-specific distributions of students in public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406721">Saporito &amp; Sohoni, 2006</xref>). My work suggests that particularly in areas of greater racial heterogeneity, families may activate “choice” to avoid their neighborhood public school.</p>

<p>The grade-level organization of a typical high school does not neatly align with the Census Bureau’s block-level age categories. For instance, some children may enter high school early or stay after 18 years of age. Thus, the age category of 15 through 17 does not match the grade structure perfectly but serves as best available approximation. Racial/ethnic percentages were used rather than actual numbers of students for better comparisons.</p>
