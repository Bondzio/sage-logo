<p>Inclusion in education in the UK hardly needs any more authoritative claims, or any more expounding of principled positions. Such talk (and writing) about inclusion is often circular, and often fruitless. The question of how to align an education system with a considered educational purpose is too real, and too pressing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is not an authoritative book. It is all the better for that. A glance at the title might create some unease on this point. In following a fashion for ‘leading on’ and ‘leading in’, the editors leave readers to wonder about the assumptions that inform their models of leadership. But this is not a book hitched to a strong theory of school leadership; there is no ego-centred call for driving inclusion forwards here, or even promoting or facilitating inclusion. Rather, leadership flits in and out as a concept, or as a practice, as the authors of the various chapters each seek to present a particular aspect of the practice and purpose of education as they see it. Inclusion is discussed, of course, and there is plenty in the way of overview, interestingly different in different chapters, to provide historical and policy-historical context. But the chapters work because they pick up and address a particular issue related to the practice of inclusion.</p>
<p>Setting out as it does to present and build on the findings of a collaborative training project, the book achieves its objectives by bringing together a series of readable, purposeful chapters. But their purpose is not to present a particular line, but to promote reflection, to inform enquiry, and to generate food for thought. In places this is done through overt points for reflection, with guiding questions. In my view, however, the benefits of reading this book are all the greater when readers come to each chapter alert to the questions that it raises. For the authors are united in their attempts to present particular issues, the importance of which requires that sort of reflective reading. And they facilitate it: these are short, sharp chapters, easily read in the manner of good short stories, at one sitting, leaving plenty of space for mulling over the questions arising.</p>
<p>There is a satisfying arc to this book, rising out of Graham-Matheson’s chapter orienting the reader, into the arena of choices and consequences of particular aspects of practice. Pupil voice is first up. Richards works through contemporary critiques and challenges to reaffirm the value of serious, concerted attempts to shift school cultures to be able to listen and take account of pupils’ perspectives. Her case comes alive with the attention she gives to pupils with disabilities, raising as she does the requirements entailed in a commitment which is not (just) about doing something good, per se, but about a change in the way schools learn and know. This is not the only chapter suggesting that leadership involves humility. Liasidou and Svensson forefront the SENCO role, and through a comparison of vivid case studies seek to demonstrate that the role is too important to be bureaucratically divorced from whole-school policy making. Too important, in that SENCOs should be in there, part of the team of people committed to creating conditions where staff are encouraged to make mistakes, to try things out, to share their developing ideas. Then Thompson pulls together a range of perspectives on whole school development, with a focus on school development plans: here is a case for making much more collaborative use of a process that can so easily stifle real development instead of organising it. Find ways to plan together, which means negotiation of shared values to inform decisions.</p>
<p>Lurking around in much of the text so far is that well-rehearsed dilemma facing practitioners committed to inclusion: how to include all pupils as we want to, in the face of the standards agenda. In response to this, Ekins makes the case for pulling all relevant school systems together in the name of inclusion. Again, this chapter raises many questions, which deserve thoughtful attention. Co-opting the system in the name of inclusion seems like a powerful way to build values into the heart of the school, but systems are powerful, and have their own logic, and there may be many ways in which this approach could go horribly wrong. I wanted to know more about the voices of teachers expressing their ‘dread’ of school, and how they got over it.</p>
<p>It is difficult to address succinctly teaching and learning in relation to inclusion, but Middlemas’s chapter is full of examples of the paramount need for collaboration, whether by design, or trial and error; whether with pupils or between staff; in classrooms and beyond. Again, there is much to argue about, and to raise questions over. The SENCO email forum comes out of this chapter very well, as an example of a facilitative space where solutions to common issues can be suggested and discussed. Collaboration is centre stage again in the next chapter, as Soan analyses the value, purpose and effectiveness of multiagency working of different types. Slicing through such activity she considers the challenges of language, time, definition, professional identity and funding, highlighting very clearly the centrality of communication, and the impossibility of any standard model. Again, identifying and addressing questions is key. The same is true in terms of Blamires’s chapter on ICT and enabling education, which usefully brings this dimension into discussion. Many of the issues that he identifies resonate with earlier chapters, not least the ridiculousness of carrying on as if pupils only know what they are taught in school, and therefore have nothing to say of use in creating an educational environment.</p>
<p>The arc of the book now falls back to ground level, from addressing particular and policy-related issues, to a very valuable examination of enquiry in practice, discussing the ethics of teachers asking questions through a useful series of case studies. The points are hammered home: ethical enquiry is central to inclusive action, and the only authority that really counts in inclusion is that which is derived from such committed enquiry. Grimes’s chapter on inclusive education in Lao PDR tells a good story of someone learning to facilitate such enquiry. There are many issues here which again rebound to the English context, so that setting this chapter alongside the previous one is a potentially fruitful juxtaposition. Not one that has been exploited in this book, but there is always more to do.</p>
<p>Which is how Cornwall rounds up the discussion, in a powerful final chapter that starts off with the reminder that such debates and developments are never finished; takes a look back to the educational ideals of John Dewey, then picks up the challenge that Ken Robinson placed before the educators and educationalists of many countries with his analysis of the failure to educate so many young people. The answers lie in critical reflection, and through it the development of confident teachers who can solve problems, not least by learning to take proper account of young people and the opportunities that truly educational enquiry opens up. Inclusion requires professional teachers, committed to enquiring together. A more pragmatic approach requires more consideration, not less.</p>
<p>All in all, this book is a valuable read, with plenty of ideas brought forward for discussion, and with some resonant themes emerging from the mixture and juxtaposition of contributions. The editors should be congratulated on a concise, rich and timely text.</p>
