<abstract>
<p>Research exploring learning outcomes in instrumental music has tended to focus on attainment ignoring other outcomes including long-term commitment to engage with music. This research addresses this issue. One hundred and sixty-three instrumental music students completed a questionnaire which sought information about their practising strategies, attitudes towards learning and performing, the level of support they received, their level of attainment, time spent practising and time learning. Their teachers were also asked to rate them on a range of musical and motivational factors. The students were aged from 7–17 with standards on graded instrumental examinations ranging from preliminary to Grade 8. A series of multiple regression analyses revealed that the level of expertise attained was best predicted by various measures of time spent learning while there were no statistically significant predictors of the quality of learning outcomes as assessed by the mark awarded in the most recent graded examination. Future aspirations in relation to music were predicted by a range of variables relating to enjoyment of musical activities, attitudes towards playing an instrument and the perceived value of music, musical self-beliefs and practising strategies.</p>

<p>Over the last two decades explanations of achievement in learning to play an instrument have been framed largely within the expertise paradigm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735611425902">Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Romer (1993)</xref> proposed that the amount of time an individual was engaged in “deliberate” practice was monotonically related to the quality of that individual’s performance. Therefore, to reach the highest levels of expertise the amount of practice should be maximized, although three constraints were identified, resource, effort, and motivation. Resources referred to available time and energy, access to teachers, training materials, and training facilities; effort concerned avoiding exhaustion and limiting practice to an amount from which recovery could be made; while motivation concerned viewing deliberate practice as key to achieving further improvements in performance. Their proposals were supported as the amount of practice accumulated by the expert pianists in their samples was estimated at more than 10 times higher than that for amateurs, while of the three groups of 10 violinists studied, those showing promise for international careers and those of slightly less ability in comparison with those that planned careers in music education spent more time practising alone and needed more rest to recover. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735611425902">Ericsson et al.’s (1993)</xref> theoretical framework has underpinned much subsequent research, with particular attention being paid to the importance of time spent practising, the quality of practice, the way that practice changes with increased expertise, and more general issues relating to motivation.</p>
<p>Adopting a similar approach to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735611425902">Ericsson et al. (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0305735611425902">Sloboda, Davidson, Howe, and Moore (1996)</xref> studied 257 young musicians aged 8–18 playing a variety of instruments at very different levels of expertise. The most successful practised more than the other groups from the second year of playing onwards. They undertook increasing amounts of practice up to Grade 8 standard. By this time they had undertaken an average of 3,30 hours of practice, although there were large within-group differences. Some young musicians managed to attain high-grade levels with relatively little practice while others did four times the average practice to gain a given grade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735611425902">Hallam (1998)</xref> studied 109 violin and viola students aged 6–16 also at different levels of expertise. She found that level of expertise was best predicted by time spent learning whether this was assessed as the length of time playing an instrument or a composite of length of time and amount of practice. In both cases over 50% of the variance was explained. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735611425902">McPherson (2005)</xref> in a 3-year longitudinal study of 157 children aged 7–9 mainly playing wind instruments found that children’s accumulated practice explained between 9% and 32% of the variance in scores on performed rehearsed music but not on other tasks, for instance, sight-reading, playing from memory, or playing by ear. The importance of the length of time learning is also illustrated in studies which have shown that those who reach the highest levels of attainment tend to start playing at an early age (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735611425902">Davidson, Howe, Moore, &amp; Sloboda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0305735611425902">Jørgensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0305735611425902">Sosniak, 1990</xref>). These studies provide convincing evidence that time spent learning is a salient determinant for achieving high levels of skill. The likelihood of anyone achieving high levels of expertise without at least some “deliberate” practice is remote.</p>
<p>In many domains, a distinction is made not only in terms of the level of expertise attained, for example, undergraduate, masters, doctorate, but also the quality of outcome at that level. In graded instrumental music examinations, which children take when they are perceived as having reached the required level of expertise, a mark is awarded indicating the quality of their performance at that level of expertise. Strong consistent relationships between the amount of practice and the quality of performance at any specific level of expertise have not been found. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0305735611425902">Williamon and Valentine (2000)</xref> compared the amount, frequency, and distribution of deliberate practice undertaken by 22 pianists, aged 11–24, ranging in expertise from Grade 1 to 8 while preparing an assigned composition by Bach. Quantity of deliberate practice was not significantly correlated with the quality of performance. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735611425902">Hallam (1998)</xref> found that the length of time spent learning to play an instrument and on weekly practice were not significant predictors of the mark attained in graded instrumental music examinations. Only the music teacher’s assessment of musical ability was predictive of the quality of outcome with a beta weight of 0.5. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735611425902">O’Neill (1997)</xref> showed a strong relationship between the amount of piece-specific practice and performance outcomes for a group of beginning musicians with up to 6 months of musical experience. In light of the lack of consistency in previous research findings the research reported here explores what best predicts the quality of performance at each grade level.</p>
<p>The focus of the expertise paradigm on “deliberate” practice raised questions about the role of the quality of practice in determining the outcomes of learning. Professional musicians, typically establish an overview and aural mental schema of music to be learned by studying the score, playing the music, or learning from a live or recorded model. Difficult sections are identified based on the formal structure of the music, the most difficult parts being divided into smaller subdivisions. As practice progresses the sections are linked together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735611425902">Chaffin, Imreh, Lemieux, &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735611425902">Hallam, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735611425902">1995b</xref>). To what extent do young musicians adopt similar strategies? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735611425902">Gruson (1988)</xref> studied 43 pianists from novice to professional level finding that as expertise developed there was an increase in the repetition of sections, verbalizing and playing hands separately, while errors, repeating single notes and pauses decreased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735611425902">Hallam (1997)</xref> studying 55 string players aged 6–18 ranging from beginner to post-Grade 8 standard identified six levels of practice. At the lowest level there was much time wasting and work was incomplete; at the second level the music was played through with no corrections; at the third, single notes were corrected; at the fourth, the material was played through with short sections repeated en route; at the fifth the material was played through with large sections practised en route; while at the sixth level the material was played through initially, with difficult sections identified and worked on in isolation. The correlation between these levels and graded examination level was 0.69. A 3-year longitudinal study of relative beginners found that 90% of home practice time was spent playing through a piece with the children sometimes repeating a small section after an error. Some worked things out before playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that novices’ practising strategies are less than effective and that they do not systematically correct errors. This may be because they lack appropriate mental schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735611425902">Hallam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735611425902">McPherson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Practice typically consists of technical and repertory work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735611425902">Hallam, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735611425902">McPherson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; McCormick, 1999</xref>), the former often undertaken at the start of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735611425902">Duke, Flowers, &amp; Wolfe, 1997</xref>). A distinction has also been made between formal and informal practice (playing favourite pieces by ear, messing about with music, improvising) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; McCormick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735611425902">Sloboda &amp; Davidson, 1996</xref>). High achievers tend to report more formal and informal practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735611425902">Sloboda &amp; Davidson, 1996</xref>). Playing undertaken as part of a musical group may also support the automatization of musical skills, although, to date, this has not been considered. When preparing for an examination students tend to increase the amount of practice, are better motivated, more organized and have a greater focus on technical requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425902">Davidson &amp; Scutt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425902">Hallam, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425902">2001b</xref>). The extent to which this is undertaken may contribute to the quality of performance.</p>
<p>Professional musicians also exhibit high-level metacognitive skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425902">Hallam, 2001a</xref>) i.e. “knowledge concerning one’s own cognitive processes and products” and “the active monitoring and consequent regulation and orchestration of these processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735611425902">Flavell, 1976</xref>, p. 232). This is not always the case for young musicians. Some young learners are easily distracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735611425902">Miksza, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735611425902">McPherson and Zimmerman (2002)</xref> suggest that self-regulation, including self-observation, environmental and covert self-regulation is important in effective learning. Working with 101 high school wind players, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735611425902">McPherson (1997)</xref> explored mental strategies in relation to sight-reading, playing by ear and from memory, and improvising. On each of the measures, self-regulated musicians consciously employed more sophisticated and musically appropriate strategies. In a performance task, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425902">Hallam (2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425902">2001b</xref>) explored the extent of implicit planning adopted as students completed a time-limited task. Those who exhibited high levels of planning completed the task, identified difficulties early on, concentrated their efforts on those difficulties, and then integrated learned sections together. Students at high levels of expertise exhibited high levels of planning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735611425902">Cantwell and Millard (1994)</xref>, adopting a different approach, studied six 14-year-old students and identified deep and surface approaches to learning music, the former involving learning in musical rather than technical terms. This led to a greater focus on understanding and subsequently enhanced learning outcomes.</p>
<p>The importance of time spent learning and the amount of practice undertaken in attaining high levels of musical expertise suggests that learners need to be highly motivated. However, there is evidence that not all musicians enjoy practising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735611425902">Chaffin, Imreh, &amp; Crawford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735611425902">Hallam, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425902">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425902">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>). Historically, motivation has been theorized in many different ways. Current theories, are broadly framed within behaviourist or social cognitive paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735611425902">Maehr, Pintrich, &amp; Linnenbrink, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735611425902">Martin &amp; Dowson, 2009</xref>). Reviews of research on musical motivation have led to the development of models which recognize the complex interactions which occur between environmental (cultural, institutional, familial, educational) and internal factors (cognition and affect) in enhancing or reducing motivation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735611425902">Asmus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735611425902">Austin, Renwick, &amp; McPherson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735611425902">Hallam, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735611425902">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0305735611425902">O’Neill &amp; McPherson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0305735611425902">Sichivitsa, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Social interactions are an acknowledged source of influence on students’ motivations to engage in active music making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735611425902">Creech, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735611425902">Creech &amp; Hallam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735611425902">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>). Parental support and family background have been found to be particularly important especially in the early stages of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735611425902">Austin &amp; Vispoel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735611425902">Creech &amp; Hallam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735611425902">Legette, 2003</xref>). Families who have musical skills and are interested in music seem to be able to transfer these values and interests to their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0305735611425902">Moore, Burland, &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0305735611425902">Pitts, Davidson, &amp; McPherson, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0305735611425902">Zdinski, 1996</xref>). Where parents are indifferent or less involved children are likely to give up playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735611425902">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735611425902">O’Neill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0305735611425902">Pitts et al., 2000a</xref>). Parents can provide many kinds of support including guidance, financial and practical aid. They can also offer support for practice or indeed supervise it (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425902">Brokaw, 1982</xref>). The role of peers in supporting engagement in music making has been less researched. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735611425902">Allen (1981)</xref> found that peer influence had a significant positive effect on students wanting to continue with musical activities, while young people involved in the arts more generally are appreciative of the support they receive from their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735611425902">Burland &amp; Davidson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735611425902">O’Neill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0305735611425902">Patrick et al., 1999</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735611425902">Hallam (1998)</xref> found that perceptions of peer influence were less predictive of retention than children’s own attitudes towards playing. Teachers also play a major role in the extent to which learners are interested, motivated, and enjoy learning to play an instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735611425902">Creech &amp; Hallam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735611425902">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735611425902">Davidson, Moore, Sloboda, &amp; Howe, 1998</xref>). The relationship between pupil and teacher, the sensitivity of the communication between them and the extent to which the student has a sense of autonomy all have an impact on learners’ liking for music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735611425902">Bakker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611425902">Cassie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0305735611425902">StGeorge, 2010</xref>). Pupils who give up playing have poorer relationships with their teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0305735611425902">StGeorge, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents, other family members, teachers, and peers act as sources of reward, and provide feedback which influences self-beliefs. These develop in interaction with the environment and are important in sustaining motivation. Self-efficacy, an individual’s judgement of their capabilities to organize and carry out a particular course of action required to achieve a particular aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735611425902">Bandura, 1982</xref>), has been found to be the best predictor of instrumental examination results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; McCormick, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735611425902">2006</xref>), while having a positive musical self-concept is related to high levels of attainment and successful task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735611425902">Asmus &amp; Harrison, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0305735611425902">Vispoel, 1993</xref>), motivation for engaging with music, interest in it, and commitment to continue playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735611425902">Klinedinst, 1991</xref>). Those who give up playing tend to have lower expectations of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735611425902">Chandler, Chiarella, &amp; Auria, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0305735611425902">Pitts, Davidson, &amp; McPherson, 2000b</xref>) and are less confident about future outcomes largely through disappointing earlier experiences where they have not been successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0305735611425902">StGeorge, 2010</xref>). Research within the expectancy-value paradigm supports this demonstrating that students’ beliefs about their competence predict learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735611425902">Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Beliefs about the nature of musical ability can also effect motivation. Where learners have incremental beliefs (i.e., that musical ability can be enhanced rather than being fixed) they tend to have more effective practice habits and higher attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735611425902">Braten &amp; Stromso, 2004</xref>). Closely related to these beliefs are the ways that attributions are made about success and failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0305735611425902">Weiner, 1986</xref>). In music, attributions tend to be made to effort, musical background, classroom environment, musical ability, and love of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735611425902">Arnold, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611425902">Asmus, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735611425902">Legette, 1998</xref>). Two types of goals have been established in relation to learning which are related to beliefs about ability and attributions for success or failure. Performance goals are associated with the demonstration of competence or ability, while mastery goals are associated with wanting to learn and to understand. In music, research to date has had mixed results regarding the importance of adopting mastery or performance goals, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735611425902">Lacaille, Koestner, and Gaudreau (2007)</xref> studying conservatoire students found that performance goals (approach and avoidance) were associated with negative emotional outcomes, while mastery goals were unrelated to outcomes. Only intrinsic goals relating to aesthetic expression and enjoyment were associated with positive performance and emotional outcomes.</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation, engaging in particular activities because they are rewarding in their own right rather than being undertaken for external rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735611425902">Maehr et al., 2002</xref>), is crucial in continuing to learn to play an instrument over a long period of time as it is a voluntary activity. Music itself can generate positive emotions, pleasure and joy in playing certain pieces of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735611425902">Gellrich, Osterwold, &amp; Schulz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735611425902">Nagel, 1987</xref>). It can also provide satisfaction through performance in terms of positive feedback and the way it provides opportunities for exhibiting skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735611425902">Nagel, 1987</xref>). Flow, which represents a state of equilibrium between the amount of challenge in activities and an individual’s capabilities leading to perceived enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735611425902">Csikszentmihalyi, 1991</xref>) has been demonstrated in composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735611425902">McDonald, Byrne, &amp; Carlton, 2006</xref>) and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735611425902">O’Neill, 1999</xref>). Those who give up playing may be more extrinsically motivated as they tend to engage in more teacher approval-seeking behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735611425902">Costa-Gioma, Flowers, &amp; Sasake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>), while some students refer to participation in band, or the opinions of their parents and friends as shaping their own attitudes towards music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0305735611425902">Pitts et al., 2000a</xref>).</p>
<p>For many children playing an instrument is a hobby which they view no differently from other activities which they undertake in their free time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; McCormick, 2000</xref>). It is not highly valued within the expectancy–value model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735611425902">Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002</xref>), which defines the value attached to tasks in terms of their importance, intrinsic value, usefulness and cost, the latter being perceived as a negative, and expectancy in terms of the individual’s beliefs about their likelihood of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735611425902">Eccles, O’Neill, &amp; Wigfield, 2005</xref>). A UK study found that children continuing to play an instrument in primary and secondary school had higher scores on competence beliefs and task values than those giving up or those describing themselves as nonplayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0305735611425902">O’Neill, Ryan, Boulton, &amp; Sloboda, 2000</xref>). Research with those wishing to pursue a career in music, where music is clearly highly valued, has shown that they are dedicated, committed, determined, and willing to make sacrifices. They also have increasing levels of self-belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0305735611425902">MacNamara, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735611425902">Kemp (1996)</xref> found that the most accomplished classical musicians in his sample were self-motivated almost to the point of obsession.</p>
<p>In music, the main focus of research within the expertise paradigm has been the quantity and quality of practice and its relationship to the level and quality of expertise attained. Some studies have considered what motivates learners to spend the many hours required to attain high levels of expertise, but much research on motivation has been less explicitly related to the long-term development of expertise and the aspirations of participants. This study aims to bring together these differing strands of work. The specific research questions to be addressed are:</p>
<p>Which factors relating to the quantity and quality of practice and motivation best predict:</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A questionnaire was designed based on findings from the existing literature as outlined above. The questionnaire sought information about the level of expertise attained (assessed by the highest graded examination taken and the next examination to be taken) and the quality of performance at that level of expertise as measured by the mark obtained in the highest graded examination taken. In the UK there are several independent examination boards which offer graded instrumental examinations, usually from preliminary to Grade 8. Typically, graded examinations assess candidates’ performance on pieces, scales, sight-reading, and aural tests, with some examination boards assessing technical exercises and improvisation tasks. In addition, some examination boards require applicants to have taken a theory examination before proceeding to instrumental examinations beyond Grade 5. To take account of this, the questionnaire included statements about the content of practice, including the study of theory, prior to an examination and when an examination was not imminent. Statements were also included based on the existing literature relating to the detailed practising strategies adopted and the way that practice was organized and managed. Learners were asked to indicate the length of time that they had been learning to play an instrument and the time that they currently spent practising each week, the latter being assessed by the completion of a practice diary over a 2-week period. Other statements were concerned with factors which have previously been identified as contributing to motivation to learn and continue to play an instrument including: self-beliefs; enjoyment of musical activities; enjoyment of performance; level of support received from parents, friends and teachers; parental support for practice; attitudes towards playing an instrument and perceptions of its value; beliefs about the importance of musical ability; and future musical aspirations. The questionnaire consisted of statements relating to the above based on a 7-point Likert scale. The statements themselves are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">2</xref>. The questionnaire was piloted on a small group of students to ensure items were easily understood. No changes were required following this process.</p>

<p>A questionnaire was also devised for teachers. This requested them to rate their perceptions of the pupils selected to participate on a 7-point scale on items assessing a range of factors which previous research had indicated may contribute to the development of children’s expertise in playing a musical instrument (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735611425902">Hallam, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735611425902">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; Hallam, 2009</xref>). These measures were intended to provide a more objective assessment than might be provided by the students themselves while also providing information about the students’ musical skills. The statements related to motivational factors (enjoyment of playing, involvement in musical activities, desire to achieve, willingness to learn); elements which were likely to relate to the effectiveness of their practice (self-discipline, personal organization, concentration); the level of support that they received from their parents; and a range of musical skills which historically have been related to high levels of attainment in music (physical coordination, cognitive skills, e.g., reading music, aural ability, performance skills, sense of pulse/rhythm, expressive skills and performance anxiety) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735611425902">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The research was designed taking account of the ethical guidelines of the British Psychological Society and the British Educational Research Association and was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Education, University of London.</p>
<sec id="section2-0305735611425902">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>As a means of accessing children and young people learning to play an instrument, teachers in a Local Authority Music Service were approached to participate in the research. The music service selected provided tuition and ensembles for children and young people in an English county at the centre of which was a city with a world-leading university. Overall, the population had low levels of economic deprivation and high educational standards. The music service was award winning, with world-class ensembles regularly touring abroad and participating in high-status competitions and festivals. The staff was highly qualified, a considerable proportion being ex-professional performing musicians. Lessons were either with individual children or in small groups of no more than four children. All of the children participating in the research were having individual lessons. Parents contributed to the cost of the lessons but they were in part subsidized by the local authority.</p>
<p>A presentation was given to staff explaining the purpose of the research and they were invited to participate. They were assured that all data collected would be anonymized. Confidentiality was guaranteed. They were informed that they would be provided with information about the findings of the research when the analyses were complete. Fifty-five staff volunteered to take part out of a total of 94 who were employed by the music service in either a full- or part-time capacity. Participating teachers were asked to select three of their pupils representing average, above, and below average learners. These were to be selected from any level of expertise. This instruction was to avoid teachers only including their “best” pupils. It was not possible to establish whether every individual teacher selected from their pupils on this basis as this would have required collecting information about all of their pupils. However, the range of marks obtained by learners in their graded examinations which ranged from 55% to 94% and the amount of practice undertaken by them which ranged from 0 to 105 min daily suggested that teachers had not selected only their “best” pupils.</p>
<p>The teachers were requested to approach the selected pupils and ask if they were prepared to participate in the research. They were instructed to tell the pupils that they did not need to participate and that there would be no negative repercussions if they chose not to participate. All of the children who were approached agreed to participate. The pupils were asked to take the questionnaire home and complete it there. This was because the questionnaire included a diary section to enable a record to be made of the amount of practice undertaken each day over a period of 2 weeks. The pupils were told that they were to complete the questionnaire unaided, although as they were completing it at home it is possible that their parents provided some guidance if it was requested. The questionnaires were returned to the teacher in a sealed envelope (to facilitate confidentiality) and subsequently to the researcher.</p>

<title>The sample</title>
<p>The final sample consisted of 163 learners, 37 males and 126 females. Eighty-three were wind players (51%) including clarinet, flute, oboe, saxophone, trumpet, French horn, cornet, bass, and trombone, while 80 played stringed instruments (49%) (violin, viola, cello). The students were aged from 7–17. Wind players were on average older (11.8 years as opposed to 10.3 years). More of the string players were at a lower level of expertise. All of those pre-Grade 1 (23) were string players.</p>
<p>Students were asked for information about the grade and mark of the most recent graded instrumental examination that they had taken and the level of the graded examination that they were about to take. Fourteen percent of the sample (23 students) were preparing to take the preliminary grade, 22% Grade 1 (36 students), 22% Grade 2 (36 students), 18% Grade 3 (30 students), 12% Grade 4 (20 students), 4% Grade 5 (7 students), 2.5% Grade 6 (4 students), 2.5% Grade 7 (4 students) and 2% Grade 8 (3 students). The minimum percentage mark obtained in the examination was 55% the maximum 94% with an average of 78%.</p>

<sec id="section4-0305735611425902">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The questionnaire was intended to assess students’ current perceived beliefs, attitudes and practices. Reliability and validity data from previous studies was therefore not available. In order to carry out multiple regression analysis it was necessary to sum the items into predetermined composite measures based on the existing literature. A Cronbach’s alpha statistic was calculated for each group of items with the intention of removing any items which were clearly unrelated to the predetermined category. Negatively framed statements were reversed prior to this process. In addition, as Cronbach’s alpha statistics do not confirm the uni-dimensionality of included items, the factor structure for each composite was also examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735611425902">Grayson, 2004</xref>). This confirmed each composite as representative of a single factor. The Cronbach’s alpha analyses revealed that the omission of individual items would not have any significant impact on the statistic so all items were included. The Cronbach’s alpha statistic for each composite measure was as follows: practising strategies: .866; organization and self-management of practice: .637; practising when not preparing for an examination: .67; practising when preparing for an examination: .75; self-belief: .796; support from family, friends, and teachers: .709; enjoyment of performing: .852; attitudes towards playing an instrument and perceptions of its value: .813; enjoying musical activities: .786; future aspirations: .787; and teacher ratings: .927. The other items included in the multiple regression analyses were single items (belief about musical ability, parental support for practice, number of months learning, amount of weekly practice, attendance at a county music school, membership of the county youth orchestra).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>For each of the statements means and standard deviations were calculated. These are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">2</xref>. The following sections provide a brief commentary.</p>
<sec id="section6-0305735611425902">
<title>Time spent learning</title>
<p>Reported months learning ranged from 36 to 168, <italic>M</italic> = 61.6 (<italic>SD</italic> 21.6) representing 3 to 14 years of tuition. Participants were asked in the questionnaire to keep a record of how many days they practised, how many sessions on each day and how long daily practice was. These data indicated a range of days of practice from none to 7 each week, <italic>M</italic> = 4.4 (<italic>SD</italic> 1.5). The number of sessions of practice each day ranged from none to 5, <italic>M</italic> = 1.1 (<italic>SD</italic> .57). The average amount of daily practice recorded varied from none to 105 min, M = 20.7 (<italic>SD</italic> 15.0).</p>
<p>Students were asked if they took part in extracurricular music activities in addition to their lessons either at a county music school or as a member of the county youth orchestra. Such participation would have represented an additional 3 hours weekly of making music on their instrument throughout the school year. Seventeen students were members of the county youth orchestra while 68 (42%) were members of a county music school. Eighty-seven (53%) did not participate in these activities and eight failed to respond to the question (5%)</p>

<title>Factors relating to practice</title>
<sec id="section8-0305735611425902">
<title>Practising strategies</title>
<p>The statements contributing to the practising strategies category with their means and standard deviations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Table 1</xref>. Responses were made on a 7-point scale from always to never. The students reported that they had some effective practising strategies, for instance, practising sections slowly, repeating difficult sections, starting practising slowly and speeding up. Most participants also reported being able to recognize when they had made a mistake. However, the data suggested that quite a high proportion of students frequently adopted relatively low-level strategies for improving their performance, for instance, playing through the piece in its entirety, or correcting a single wrong note. It is possible that they were adopting these strategies for other purposes, for instance, giving a mock performance, practising sight-reading or identifying difficulties, although previous research has indicated that it is generally those at low levels of expertise who adopt these strategies and that the strategy is generally unproductive. Very few reported listening to a recording of the work they were to learn, or made recordings of themselves playing as a means of listening and critiquing their own playing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0305735611425902">
<title>Organization and self-management of practice</title>
<p>In relation to the organization and self-management of practice, participants reported finding it easy to concentrate when practising (<italic>M</italic> = 5.60) and had developed efficient organizational strategies starting with scales (<italic>M</italic> = 4.69) and/or warm-up exercises (<italic>M</italic> = 4.20). However, there was little evidence of practice with the metronome (<italic>M</italic> = 1.81) and most participants reported that they did not make a list of what they had to practise (<italic>M</italic> = 2.82) although there was more agreement that they set themselves targets for each practice session (<italic>M</italic> = 3.80) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0305735611425902">
<title>Non-examination practice</title>
<p>The students agreed most strongly with statements relating to practising pieces when they were not preparing for an examination (<italic>M</italic> = 4.54). Agreement for other elements was lower than for pieces (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Table 1</xref>). Least agreement was for studying theory (<italic>M</italic> = 0.07).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0305735611425902">
<title>Examination practice</title>
<p>Ninety-one percent of the students reported that they practised more when they were preparing for an examination. Sixty-eight percent indicated that they practised on more days. Twenty-nine percent indicated that they practised on two additional days, and 13% one additional day. In terms of the average amount of time that practice increased 7% of students reported practising for 5 minutes more, 5% for 8 minutes more, 25% for 10 minutes more, 5% for 13 minutes more, 10% for 11 minutes more, 5% for 20 minutes more, and 7% for 30 minutes more. Smaller percentages of students indicated other amounts. The girls reported doing statistically significantly more additional practice for examinations than the boys (girls <italic>M</italic> = 10.37, <italic>SE</italic> = .99; boys <italic>M</italic> = 7.35, <italic>SE</italic> = .99) (t(112) = 2.151, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The data suggest that the students practice more prior to examinations.</p>
<p>The order of priority of practice during examinations was similar to that for normal practice with higher levels of agreement relating to what was practised for most elements. This was most marked for scales which increased from a mean of 3.35 to 4.45 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Table 1</xref>). There were gender differences related to the practice of sight-reading and the study of theory of music. Girls reported practising sight-reading more in preparation for an examination (<italic>M</italic> = 3.17, <italic>SE</italic> = .14) than the boys (<italic>M</italic> = 2.38, <italic>SE</italic> = .24) (t(61) = −2.86 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01). The girls also reported studying theory of music prior to an examination (<italic>M</italic> = of 0.17, <italic>SE</italic> = .07) whereas the boys reported no theoretical study (t(125) = −2.23, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0305735611425902">
<title>Parental support for practice</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which their parents supported their practice. This was not assessed by a rating scale but yes/sometimes/no responses. Sixty-five percent of respondents indicated that their parents normally reminded them to practise, 4% that they practised without being reminded and 31% that they did not practise. Sixty percent of respondents indicated that their parents had at some time helped them to practise, 37% indicated that this was not the case and 3% that this had happened sometimes. Forty-seven percent of respondents indicated that their parents helped them to practise now, 37% that this was not the case, and 2% that sometimes this was the case.</p>

<title>Factors contributing to motivation</title>
<sec id="section14-0305735611425902">
<title>Self-beliefs</title>
<p>Of the four items contributing to the category self-beliefs the highest mean was for being able to achieve anything on an instrument if enough practice was undertaken (5.19), followed by a perception that most people believed that they played their instrument well (5.04), and usually being successful in what they attempted to do on their instrument (5.9). The lowest mean was for “I have the potential to be a good musician” (4.74) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>). Overall, these responses suggest that participants were confident about their learning and performance on an instrument.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0305735611425902">
<title>Beliefs about the importance of musical ability</title>
<p>A <bold>s</bold>eparate variable relating to the extent to which participants believed that to succeed in playing an instrument it was necessary to have musical ability was included in the questionnaire. The mean response was 4.53 with an <italic>SD</italic> of 1.5 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0305735611425902">
<title>Support from family, friends and teachers</title>
<p>The highest levels of perceived support for learning to play an instrument came from other relations, for example, grandparents (5.72) and parents (5.69). There was a gender difference in the extent to which learners perceived that their relations liked them playing a musical instrument with girls indicating less strong agreement (<italic>M</italic> = 5.59, <italic>SE</italic> = .136) than boys (<italic>M</italic> = 6.13, <italic>SE</italic> = .18) (t(161) = 1.997, <italic>p</italic> = &gt; .05). Overall, there was less evidence of support from teachers at school (4.76) and siblings (4.02) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>). There was relatively strong support for the statement that the respondents had friends who played musical instruments (4.76).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0305735611425902">
<title>Enjoyment of performing</title>
<p>Overall, participants agreed that they enjoyed performance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>). Learners indicated stronger agreement that they found it satisfying to play in concerts (<italic>M</italic> = 5.0) than that playing in concerts gave them a thrill (4.56) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0305735611425902">
<title>Attitudes towards playing an instrument and perception of its value</title>
<p>Participants indicated high levels of enjoyment of playing an instrument (5.82), and of their lessons (5.56). Interestingly, boys indicated enjoying their lessons (<italic>M</italic> = 6.0, <italic>SE</italic> = .17) more than girls (<italic>M</italic> = 5.4, <italic>SE</italic> = .13) (t(162) = 2.24, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Participants also believed that it was valuable to play an instrument (5.36) and liked practising (4.88). They disagreed to some extent that practice was boring (3.04) and strongly disagreed that they hated having to play an instrument (1.67).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0305735611425902">
<title>Enjoying musical activities</title>
<p>The participants indicated strong agreement that they enjoyed listening to music (<italic>M</italic> = 5.93). The boys (<italic>M</italic> = 6.4, <italic>SE</italic> = .13) more than girls (<italic>M</italic> 5.79, <italic>SE</italic> = .14) (t(117) = 3.38, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01). The participants also reported enjoying playing in musical groups (5.15) and to a lesser extent going to concerts to listen to music (4.64). There was also overall agreement that playing an instrument was an important part of their social life (4.5) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>). Although the difference was relatively small there was a gender difference in the composite score of enjoying musical activities. The boys reported greater enjoyment of musical activities (<italic>M</italic> = 21.73, <italic>SE</italic> = .72) than the girls (<italic>M</italic> = 19.78, <italic>SE</italic> = .47) (t(161) = 2.024, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0305735611425902">
<title>Future aspirations</title>
<p>Participants agreed that they would always want to be involved in musical activities (5.19), and thought it would be useful to their future career to play an instrument (4.81) although there was less agreement that they would like to become a musician (4.21) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Teachers’ ratings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735611425902">Table 3</xref> sets out the details of the mean ratings made by the teachers in relation to their students. The ratings were negatively skewed (from −.419 to 1.224) with the greatest skew being in relation to motivational factors and parental support. While pupils appear to have been selected to provide examples of a range of qualitatively different learning outcomes, overall, teachers tended to give high ratings relating to their pupils’ motivation, quality of practice, general musical skills, and parental support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0305735611425902">
<title>Multiple regression analyses</title>
<p>Prior to the multiple regression analyses a series of correlation analyses were undertaken between the composite measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735611425902">Table 4</xref>). Only one correlation exceeded 0.75, the generally accepted level for exclusion from multiple regression analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611425902">Field, 2009</xref>), that was age, which, as expected was strongly correlated with level of expertise as assessed by graded examination taken (.79, <italic>p</italic> = .0001). Age was therefore omitted from the analysis. Gender was omitted from the regression analyses, as across all of the statements there were very few gender differences. Only one composite measure (enjoyment of musical activities) showed gender differences. A series of multiple regression analyses were undertaken using the composite scores from each of the categories outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611425902">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425902">2</xref> in addition to attending a county music school, being a member of the county youth orchestra, teachers’ assessment of a range of musical and motivational factors, parental support for practice, months learning, and weekly practice. For each regression analyses, the data were examined for outliers and influential cases. None threatened to bias the models.</p>

<p>The regression analyses focusing on the level of expertise attained and the quality of expertise included the same predictor variables. Collinearity statistics were calculated and were within acceptable limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735611425902">Bowerman &amp; O’Connell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735611425902">Myers, 1990</xref>). The variance inflation factor (VIF) values ranged from 1.14 to 3.5 and the tolerance statistics were above 0.2 (.284 to .875). The regression analyses conducted in relation to aspirations included the same predictors as the earlier analyses with the exclusion of those relating to aspirations. For these analyses the variance inflation factor (VIF) values ranged from 1.17 to 2.5 and the tolerance statistics were above 0.2 (.503 to .84). The forced entry method was used for all of the regression analyses as this is regarded as the most appropriate method for theory testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0305735611425902">Studenmund &amp; Cassidy, 1987</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section23-0305735611425902">
<title>Level of expertise attained</title>
<p>Two multiple regressions were undertaken in relation to level of expertise attained, the first in relation to the most recent successful grade examination taken, the second in relation to the next examination to be taken. The analysis relating to the most recent graded examination taken revealed a multiple R of .84 with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of .699 (<italic>F</italic>(17, 60) = 8.2, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .001). The strongest predictor was the number of months learning with a beta weight of .626. The next strongest predictors were weekly practice (.238), non-examination practice (.233) and attitude towards playing an instrument and perception of its value which had a negative weighting of −.223. For full details see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0305735611425902">Table 5</xref>. These findings were further supported when level of expertise attained was assessed by grade to be taken. The multiple R was .817, with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of .618 (<italic>F</italic>(17,113) = 13.35, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .001). The strongest predictors were months learning with a beta weight of .587 and weekly practice (.245) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0305735611425902">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Commitment to being involved with music</title>
<p>A series of multiple regressions were undertaken in relation to the extent to which learners were motivated to continue being involved in music. In these analyses the variables relating to aspirations were not included as predictor variables. A regression analysis was undertaken on the composite measure of aspirations and on the three elements of the composite separately. The multiple regression relating to overall aspirations revealed a multiple R of .717 with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of .447 (<italic>F</italic>(16, 114) = 7.56, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .001). The strongest predictors were enjoying musical activities with a beta weighting of .295, self-belief (.189) and attitude towards playing an instrument and perception of its value (.183) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0305735611425902">Table 7</xref>). For the statement “I think it will be useful to my future career to play a musical instrument” the strongest predictors were enjoying musical activities (.291), self-beliefs (.221) and support from family, friends, and teachers (.187) giving a multiple R of .587 with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of .253 (<italic>F</italic>(16, 114) = 3.751, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .001) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0305735611425902">Table 8</xref>). For the statement “I will always want to be involved in music” there was a multiple R of .669 with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of .37 (<italic>F</italic>(16, 114) = 5.76, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .0001). The strongest predictors were attitude towards playing an instrument and perception of its value (.293), enjoyment of performing (.165), self-belief (.141), and support from family, friends, and teachers (.123) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0305735611425902">Table 9</xref>). When the statement “I would like to become a musician” was used as the dependent variable there was a multiple R of .585, and an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of .250 (<italic>F</italic>(16, 114) = 3.705, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .001). The strongest predictors were enjoying musical activities (.299), attitude towards playing an instrument and perception of its value (.160), and practising strategies (.134) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0305735611425902">Table 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research confirms length of time learning as the strongest predictor of the level of expertise attained with weekly practice and what is undertaken during that practice making important contributions, supporting findings within the expertise paradigm. The negative weighting for attitude towards playing an instrument and the value attached to it reflects the finding amongst a more general population that attitudes towards playing an instrument and the value attached to playing decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; O’Neill, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0305735611425902">Wigfield, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0305735611425902">Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The regression analysis relating to quality of performance was not statistically significant suggesting that other factors contribute towards the quality of learning outcome as assessed by graded examinations which are not directly related to time learning or practice per se. This is clearly an area for further research. The requirements of graded examinations go beyond the performance of prepared pieces and include sight-reading and aural tests and in some cases improvisation. To perform these well requires automatization of different skills to those which are required for performing a well-learned piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425902">Hallam, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425902">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735611425902">McPherson, 1997</xref>). The findings from this research indicate that these tend to be practised less frequently. Other factors may also be implicated, for instance, the extent to which performers are able to communicate with an audience, in this case the examiner, or the extent to which high-quality aural schemata have been developed against which performance can be assessed and progress monitored during practice.</p>
<p>The findings on musical aspirations revealed some interesting, although subtle, differences depending on the particular statement being considered. Overall, enjoying musical activities, which included listening to music, going to concerts, playing in musical groups, and having an active social life relating to music was important, although, interestingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between this measure and age suggesting that perceived enjoyment of musical activities differs from attitudes towards playing an instrument and its perceived value. Also important were the support of family, friends, and teachers; and self-beliefs. Practising strategies emerged as important for those wanting to become musicians perhaps indicating the determination and dedication which has been identified by previous research. The strong emphasis on enjoyment of a range of musical activities suggests that the high-level family support found in previous research for those who attain the highest levels of expertise is driven by the interest of the learner rather than determining that interest. It may be the enjoyment of the learner, their enthusiasm, the satisfaction that they gain from making music, which may be in musical groups, that leads the family to offer their support. The evidence presented also suggests that the wider family group, including grandparents, may be important in this respect. The findings further reinforce the role of motivation suggesting that research needs to focus more closely on what it is about music, which provides enjoyment and satisfaction to some learners and not others.</p>
<p>There were some gender differences. Boys scored higher than girls on enjoyment of a range of musical activities and perceiving that they had a greater level of support from their relations. The higher scores of the boys contrast with earlier research which has found higher competence and value beliefs in girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0305735611425902">McPherson &amp; O’Neill, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0305735611425902">O’Neill et al., 2000</xref>). This may be because the research reported here focused on instrumental players who, in the main were committed to music while earlier research has tended to be based on samples from the general school population.</p>
<p>There are clearly limitations to this study. The teachers chose the students to be included and although they were instructed to include average, above, and below average students the data suggests that they were biased towards those who were well motivated and had considerable family support. Despite this there were some who were clearly not engaged. The sample was dominated by girls, which is not untypical in the UK in relation to the playing of classical musical instruments within a school context. The lower levels of expertise were over-represented in comparison with those above Grade 5. This also represents the national picture in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735611425902">Hallam, Rogers, &amp; Creech, 2005</xref>) where many children learn to play an instrument but do not sustain their commitment through to the higher grade levels. The research was also largely based on self-report from the students. There was no observation of their activities and no interviews were undertaken to provide greater in-depth understanding. Despite these weaknesses the research has highlighted areas for future exploration.</p>
<sec id="section27-0305735611425902">
<title>Implications for education</title>
<p>The questionnaire responses suggest that there continue to be strategies related to practising which learners adopt infrequently. These include using recordings of their own playing to enable them to more objectively assess their performance, using recordings to listen to music which they are learning to enable them to develop aural schemata of the piece, and using the metronome to support technical and rhythmical development. It would seem that there is still scope for teachers to encourage learners to adopt these learning strategies.</p>
<p>The power of graded examinations to influence the amount of practice undertaken and what is practised is clear from the students’ responses. Practice typically focuses on pieces with an increase in other elements, particularly scales, when examination preparation is being undertaken. There was also little practice of improvisation. This taken alongside the higher than might have been hoped for agreement with the statement that practice is boring suggests that the nature of the instrumental music curriculum, particularly that determined through the graded examination system, might benefit from some changes to place greater emphasis on the performance of music and creative activities with less emphasis on technique for its own sake.</p>
<p>The findings indicate the importance of learners enjoying a range of musical activities and the opportunities they provide for socializing with other like-minded people in developing a long-term commitment to engaging with music. This suggests that teachers should encourage learners to join musical groups at an early stage in their learning or provide opportunities for their own pupils to make music together and participate in other musical activities.</p>
