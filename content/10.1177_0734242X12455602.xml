<p>What happens when science meets practice? As always the human factor is important, but positive symbiosis is definitely an option. Actually, when it happens there are many examples of inspirational new developments in terms of essential problems being identified and solutions devised.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, cadmium was identified by medical science as an element that is toxic to humans if they are exposed to it through inhalation of air or intake by food or water. Its effects can be crippling with high doses or cause fatal kidney malfunction with lower doses over extended periods of time. Polluted water from cadmium mining and the irrigation of rice fields created the first crippled victims (<italic>itai-itai disease</italic>) in Japan in the early 1930s. Subsequently the use of cadmium in industrial production revealed occupational health problems as a result of direct inhalation by soldering workers. Environmental problems involving cadmium, such as food and animal feed contamination, were found to link directly to emissions from waste incinerators or the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture. Studies between the 1950s and the 1970s which investigated cadmium pathways in the human body and in air, soil, water and plants, showed the way to limit cadmium pollution and use to an acceptable level. Furthermore, regulation made it possible to implement control programmes in practice. In very simple terms, medical and natural science met with bad cadmium practice in industry, waste management and agriculture, and that encounter created innovative thinking and a healthier practice for the management of cadmium in society and the environment.</p>
<p>Lead has been known for centuries as a toxic element to humans, for example by causing brain damage if the intake (e.g. when drinking wine from leaded cups or tins) exceeds certain limits (detected centuries after the first incidents in the Roman Empire). Lead was used as an additive in petrol to improve engine performance and it is clear that lead had been spread efficiently over land due to atmospheric transportation and fall out (wet and dry). Other sources of lead emissions to the atmosphere were combustion plants burning, for example, household and industrial waste materials. Even in remote areas the atmospheric pollution fall out was significant. In the 1970s, when it was scientifically documented that the major lead pollution of food and feed came from atmospheric precipitation (and not from plant root uptake) it became clear that the practice of using leaded fuel needed to be abandoned. At the same time other sources of atmospheric lead emissions, for example, from incinerators, had to be limited as well. Again, scientists met with practitioners and innovative solutions to serious problems were developed.</p>
<p>Phosphorus is an essential element for all life on planet Earth. It can also be a problematic pollutant if over-fertilizing of soils occurs or effluents are discharged into water-bodies that become eutrophic with excessive algae blooms, discolouring of the water and depletion of oxygen. Natural science can document the actual flows of phosphorus in natural systems and identify where imbalances are present or likely to occur. This knowledge can then be translated into new and more adequate engineering and practice, for example, in terms of sustainable fertilization in agriculture; new detergent products from industry; or new waste and wastewater treatment designs that prevent phosphorus pollution of land and water and at the same time reduce consumption of a limited natural phosphorus resource.</p>
<p>Some of the contributions to these positive developments can be found in articles published in <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> since 1983. In 1986 a special issue was published on incinerator emissions of particulates and heavy metals and in 1987 trace organics were the topic matter. Not that these articles solved the problems, but they definitely expressed the joint concerns of professionals in practice and science. Advanced sampling and chemical analysis methodologies produced research results that helped industry achieve better in-plant process controls and reduced the emission of pollutants so that today’s incineration technology is part of sustainable waste management. Similar experiences are available from later <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> special issues, on topics such as health care waste, waste prevention, and waste and climate change. In general, articles in <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> have a scientific touch that increases understanding of the problem in question and often provides concrete leads toward preventive or remedial action. It is worth mentioning that both natural and social sciences contribute, as do humanities when dealing with, for example, social justice and behavioural issues. But above all, the coupling of science and experience is the mix that produces the most interesting articles and thereby advances in sustainable development of resources and waste management on a global scale.</p>
<p>The International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) decided to publish <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> in 1982 and some of the professionals and scientists of the then Scientific and Technical Committee invested much time in getting a good start by pushing colleagues to publish work in progress as well as acting as authors themselves. The initiation of working groups added to this science–practice symbiosis and helped ISWA organize exciting specialized conferences, and <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> to publish the results of research necessary to make progress on documented (not postulated) evidence. After some 30 years of co-existence it is now time to refresh the joint <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> –ISWA action programme with the specific purpose of enhancing sustainable development in resource and solid waste management. Facts about and perspectives on such an endeavour are challenging and promising.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12455602" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An ISWA Science Task Force has just completed a report that outlines new approaches for the many ISWA working groups to focus more on the science–practice interaction, for example by locating working group meetings where ‘hot’ issues are dealt with, namely in research institutions including universities and in companies dealing with advanced practical problems. Young researchers and professionals should have special opportunities to participate and thereby use ISWA as a networking platform for their career building.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Journal publication should be of particular concern for each ISWA working group because that will heighten the information documentation level and thereby the professional approach when solving practical problems within the working group context or when working back in one’s home institution.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ISWA has now started summer schools. The first one, being planned in cooperation with the Technical University of Vienna is on Sustainable Waste Management and is scheduled for 03–14 September 2012. Participants will include both professionals and university graduate students from several countries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attendance at the ISWA 2012 Congress is expected to be the highest in a decade and so is the submission of conference presentations. Scientists have submitted more than 60% of the papers to be presented, and as something very positive and new, more than 100 international students will attend.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>So, in principle the message is simple and optimistic: where science meets experience and practice, exciting vibrations emerge and opportunities arise for scientists to address real-life problems and professionals to more systematically analyse their challenges with better information before implementing new plans and projects. ISWA has started a move towards such integration of science and practice and more will be done in years to come. The facilitation of interaction between young talents with experienced professionals will be a specific target. Summer schools, specialized conferences and seminars, and more journal publications will be some of the tools to achieve new results regarding sustainable resource and waste management.</p>
