   <body>
      <p>It is a pleasure to welcome readers to the first issue of Volume 46 of the <italic>Drug Information Journal. </italic>As noted in my commentary in the final issue of Volume 45, production and publication of the <italic>Journal</italic> has now moved to SAGE Publications (www.sagepub.com). Founded in 1965 and headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, SAGE is one of the world’s largest journal publishers. Their portfolio includes around 650 journals spanning the science, technology, and medicine (STM), humanities, and social sciences fields, with more than 280 journals being published on behalf of professional societies and institutions. Many individuals at SAGE have already done a tremendous amount of work on our behalf. All of us involved with it offer our thanks, and we are delighted with the <italic>Journal</italic>’s new “home.”</p>
      <p>As a result of this move, the submission, review, and acceptance processes are changing to an online system that will be of tremendous benefit to authors, reviewers, and readers, resulting in a decrease in the time from submission to publication. New enhancements include the <italic>DIJ</italic> Online Manuscript Submission website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dij" xlink:type="simple">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dij</ext-link>, and OnlineFirst, whereby accepted articles will appear online ahead of the printed issue in a fully citable manner at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dij.sagepub.com" xlink:type="simple">http://dij.sagepub.com</ext-link>. These are significant advancements, and I hope they will play their part in attracting the best authors and topics to the <italic>Journal</italic>.</p>
      <p>On which note, following the addition to the <italic>Journal</italic> of various categories of published articles during the past year, it is appropriate to update the manuscript submission guidelines, which appear online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dij.sagepub.com" xlink:type="simple">http://dij.sagepub.com</ext-link> and also in the back of this issue of the <italic>Journal</italic> and on the DIA website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.diahome.org" xlink:type="simple">www.diahome.org</ext-link>. In addition to the “regular” manuscripts that have long been the backbone of the <italic>Journal</italic>, new categories include Expert Commentaries, Letters to the Editor, Student Papers, and Rapid Communications, each of which was introduced in my commentaries in the previous volume. Submission information on each of these categories is now included in the updated guidelines.</p>
      <p>The first Expert Commentary, authored by Professor Eoin O’Brien, University College Dublin, was published in last year’s May issue and was entitled, “Why ABPM Should Be Mandatory in All Trials of Blood Pressure–Lowering Drugs.” This led to the publication of the first Letters to the Editor, in September 2011, authored by a senior regulator at the FDA and the chief medical officer of a cardiac safety company. Professor O’Brien also provided a response. (From now on, SAGE’s online review system and online publication of articles ahead of print publication will decrease the time between an original article and related Letters.) This combination of a commentary with letters, therefore, represents a dialog between individuals in academia, a regulatory agency (government), and industry; and, as such, it demonstrates meaningful interaction among 3 of the stakeholders in biopharmaceutical development and therapy. It is hoped that in future issues, the <italic>Journal</italic> will continue to facilitate such dialog and will also involve contributions from other stakeholders, including payers and—the most important stakeholders of all—patients.</p>
      <p>The first submission in the Student Papers category, authored by Andreas Suchanek and Professor Herwig Ostermann, is published in this issue and entitled, “The Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD): An International Pro/Con Analysis of the Electronic Pharmaceutical Product Submission Process.” (While papers authored by students have certainly appeared in the <italic>Journal</italic> before, this category of publications will highlight such papers that are coauthored by the next generation of professionals.) As mentioned in my previous Commentary, I would like to encourage all students in terminal and professional degree courses, as well as undergraduates who have the opportunity to conduct some form of research project, to consider submitting their work to us; we also respectfully request that professors and supervisors communicate this possible avenue of publication to their students.</p>
      <p>As we enter a new volume of the <italic>Journal</italic>, it is appropriate to reinforce 2 points made in previous commentaries. First, while the <italic>Journal</italic> continues to have great interest in biopharmaceutical development and therapy, it is also widening its scope to have equal interest in devices and diagnostics, the “three Ds” of central interest. While individual consideration of each is necessary and meaningful, their interplay is also of considerable importance. Topics of interest to the <italic>Journal</italic>, therefore, include combination products, undesirable drug-device interactions, and the role of companion diagnostics in predicting which individuals are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic intervention and those who may be at greatest risk from such treatment. Second, regulatory science is fundamental to medical product development and use and, therefore, of great interest. Regulators around the globe are encouraged to view the <italic>Journal</italic> as a vehicle via which to communicate with a very large readership.</p>
      <p>Again, my thanks to SAGE, and I look forward to a long and productive partnership.</p>
