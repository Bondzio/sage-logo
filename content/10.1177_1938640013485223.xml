<p>Ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries in any population and a common chief complaint to those that provide foot and ankle care. Because of its prevalence, there is a wide disparity with regard to the diagnosis and treatment among medical practitioners. This symposium will explore lateral ankle injury in its entirety and highlight some of these practical clinical issues.</p>

<title>The Acute Lateral Ankle Injury</title>
<sec id="section2-1938640013485223">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>What are the most reliable clinical (physical exam) findings in establishing the level of ligamentous disruption after an acute ankle sprain?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>First of all, I think it is important to evaluate every “ankle injury” despite the initial impression of patient or triage person. The reason I say this is because we cannot assume the injury is just localized to the ankle. Examples of this are problems that may simulate an ankle injury or may occur concurrently with an ankle injury. These examples include Achilles rupture, peroneal and deep flexor tendinopathies, acute compartment syndrome, ankle fracture, Maisonneuve fracture, stretch injuries to peripheral nerves, and so on, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Static exam findings for ligamentous injury would include location and presence of swelling and ecchymosis. If ecchymosis is present, then at least grade II injury can be suspected. Muscle testing, joint range of motion, and systematic palpation is a must. Provocative stress maneuvers are a must for assessment of instability. Dynamic exam findings that may reflect grade of injury would include ability to walk on flat ground, ability to walk down a set of stairs without holding on to a rail, and ability to hop on involved extremity.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I am not sure that this is important. There is a paucity of scientific evidence linking the level of ligamentous disruption to ultimate outcome if injury is adequately initially treated.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I really am not concerned about determining the level of ligamentous disruption when directing treatment of the acute ankle sprain. Certainly, I want to try to determine if there has been single- or double-ligament disruption, but this can be very difficult based upon simple examination. I think it is best to err on the assumption that there has been ligament disruption and treat accordingly. I am more concerned about the location of ligament disruption, that is, lateral ligaments versus syndesmotic versus medial, and the extent of disability as reported by the patient. Physical exam to determine extent of ligament disruption is very unreliable after acute sprain. While the anterior drawer test can be reliable for detecting an unstable ankle, edema and muscular splinting make this test very unreliable at the time of injury. The external rotation stress and the “squeeze” test can be reliable to suggest syndesmosis injury, even immediately after sprain.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I have little confidence in the physical exam findings soon after the injury. Although it is important to establish the complete spectrum of injury, it cannot be done reliably in the acute setting. The extent of injury is more accurately determined after a period (7-10 days) of immobilization and compression. At that point, one is usually able to isolate point tenderness to specific anatomical areas, and any asymmetry between the injured and uninjured side is more likely to manifest.</p>
<p>Are these physical exam findings reliable on the day of injury? Why or why not?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>On the day of injury, the ankle is typically diffusely painful, swollen and developing ecchymosis. Examination is difficult, but if the patient presents acutely, a lower-extremity exam is mandated to rule out other pathologies as listed in the above answer. Though establishing the grade of injury of the ankle will be difficult in grade II to III injuries, ruling out other more concerning pathologies would be paramount (ie, fracture, compartment syndrome, etc). This would be a time as well to determine general grade of injury and initial treatment protocol.</p>
<p>In more severe injuries, it would be wise to see the patient back after initiating a PRICE protocol for reevaluation in a few days. Then, the grade of injury can be established.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>No. Too much depends on the initial immediate treatment; for example, if heat was applied (too often I fear) the injury will look worse than it is.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I would also point out that physical exam findings immediately after an acute ankle sprain are poor predictors of prognosis for recovery. Studies have shown that the self-reported perception of disability from the patient is more accurate as a predictor of severity of sprain rather than physical examination.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>The degree of swelling usually diminishes the reliability of the exam, and the patient is more likely to resist any attempts at range of motion of provocative maneuvers.</p>
</speech>
<p>Beside radiographs, what other diagnostic tests are in order to evaluate the acute lateral ligament injury?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>I remain a big fan of stress testing clinically and, then. based on my clinical impression, to validate my clinical impression with provocative stress testing with imaging. Our clinic has a fluoroscan that I find invaluable to aid in determining grade of injury as compared with the contralateral side PRN. This test can be done in minutes giving valuable info in differentiating grade II versus grade III injury. I feel it is important to differentiate grades of injury as for me my treatment protocols will vary based on grade of injury and whether this is a first time or recurrent injury. I strongly disagree with the argument that it does not matter which grade of injury it is. Not a big fan of ultrasonography at this point, but in skilled hands, I think this would be an excellent dynamic tool for assessment of ankle injury especially with new 3D/4D imaging capabilities.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I personally don’t think any additional tests are necessary. If one is going to operate on the basis of a positive MRI, then perhaps; but I think this is rarely indicated. The Ottowa ankle rules should always be applied.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>Virtually none. I will order MRI if the patient is severely disabled and has normal radiographs. I just saw a patient who had normal radiographs, but MRI showed extensive microfractures in the talus. Her severe pain and swelling prompted me to suspect injury beyond ligament disruption.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>No additional testing is usually indicated. If there are some tests that would be helpful to direct treatment, it is better to wait until clinical signs and symptoms evolve. Stress radiographic examinations can certainly add some information, but I have stopped doing this study both acutely and after the period of immobilization because I am fearful of disrupting any healing of the ligaments that has taken place, particularly the calcaneofibular (CF) ligament.</p>
</speech>
<p>In what circumstance is an MRI indicated for the diagnosis and/or treatment plan when evaluating an acute lateral ankle sprain? Please elaborate.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>MRIs can be good for validation of suspected soft-tissue injury, especially tendon/muscle injury, though I find the operative findings rarely reflect exactly what pathology the MRI suggests. Can help validate clinical and stress test findings though they are often confusing for ligamentous injury involving the anterior talofibula (ATF; 30% false positive finding for ATF injury) and especially CF lateral ligamentous injury (which I find difficult to discern on cardinal plane views). I use them definitively for ankle syndesmosis injuries as these can be challenging to accurately diagnose and treat. I also use them for high-level recreational and professional athletes for additional screening purposes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Initial MRI not indicated.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>When treating a “high ankle sprain” the treatment plan is quite different from the more common lateral ankle ligament disruption. In most cases, the physical exam will confirm syndesmotic sprain, and certainly, radiographs will provide validation when significant injury has occurred (diastasis). In some cases, I will request an MRI to confirm the extent and location of injury when a high ankle sprain has occurred, but this is less than 10% of the time. I would never need MRI to direct treatment of the more common lateral ankle sprain.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Almost never. Although we read in the newspapers about professional athletes with frank ankle fractures or severe sprains having MRIs, I cannot see a circumstance where any “finding” on MRI would change the initial treatment plan.</p>
</speech>
<p>What role does peroneal tendon insufficiency/dysfunction have in patients with lateral ankle instability (LAI)? Should we be more inquisitive in patients that present with an acute injury in order to establish concomitant involvement?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Role of peroneal tendinopathy (PT) can play a significant role with LAI because I would surmise that the incidence of PT would be greater in patients with LAI, and this would have implications from a treatment standpoint. If an inverted heel is present, both PT and LAI can result from this potential pathologic structural problem. Certain PT pathologies would mandate surgical intervention, so it would be paramount not to miss this pathology as functional ankle instability could persist because of an unrecognized PT. Less common but just as important is pathology of the deep flexors, which are often not appreciated. This could result in a functional medial ankle instability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I don’t think the role of insufficiency has really been well documented, especially in the “virgin” ankle.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>When standard treatment of the acute ankle sprain has failed, the primary problem is incomplete healing of ligaments. In my experience, the second most common problem is pathology in the peroneal tendons. Weakness of the peroneals has not been consistently established as an etiology of chronic ankle instability, but intrasubstance tears and subluxation can be a common finding in these patients. It is difficult to pin down specific peroneal tendon injury at the time of evaluation of the acute ankle sprain as these structures are often tender and surrounded by edema and hematoma. I would not change the initial treatment plan anyway, regardless of whether I was suspicious of peroneal tendon injury. I might consider changing the treatment and diagnostic testing later if this suspicion continued.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Unfortunately, we often do not discover peroneal tendon involvement until the patients’ symptoms are chronic. The presenting complaint can be one of “instability” in spite of intact lateral ligaments. Yet trying to determine the genesis of peroneal tendon dysfunction is difficult. It seems that many believe that peroneal tendon injury is more of an attritional process rather than a single traumatic episode. Whether this attritional process is predetermined or precipitated by an acute inversion injury is the basis for this dilemma. Yet I believe that once the tendon injury is established, cumulative damage ensues with time, even without repetitive inversion injury.</p>

<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Regardless of one’s individual diagnostic strategy, how would you manage a grade II injury to the ATF ligament (ATFL) in a 24-year-old professional ballet dancer?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Use acute-phase treatment as needed using the “ICE” protocol for 7 days with the use of the short leg walking (SLW) boot until swelling subsides; then, 2 options are considered. If ankle stress suggests instability of ATF then I would put the patient in SLW fiberglass cast for 7 days. If ankle stress is negative for instability, then I would continue to use the SLW boot for 7 days always maintaining a close pack position of the ankle (foot 90° to the leg). After this short period of immobilization, I would initiate a comprehensive PT program emphasizing a controlled mobilization protocol with emphasis on balance, proprioception, and dynamic strengthening. An ankle brace followed by an ankle sleeve is recommended for 4 to 6 months post injury.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Focal compression wrap for 24 to 36 hours and immediately starting rehabilitative exercises (eg, balancing on the injured extremity).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>There is growing evidence that a brief period (10 days) of strict immobilization in a short leg cast, followed by an extended treatment with removable immobilization is superior to previous “early mobilization” strategies. A minimum of 4 weeks of protection of the ankle is required after a grade II injury. In the case of the athletic patient, a walking boot is preferred for a minimum of 2 weeks after cast removal, followed by a lace-up figure-of-eight brace for the next 4 weeks. A functional rehabilitation program would begin at day 10 after cast removal and would focus initially on restoration of range of motion. Achieving adequate ankle joint dorsiflexion is critical in the recovery of ligamentous disruption of the lateral ankle ligaments. Strengthening of all the lower-leg muscles is the next priority, utilizing concentric and eccentric protocols. Balance and proprioception training can begin at day 14 and should continue for at least 8 weeks. Activity-specific training begins at 3 weeks and continues to 6 weeks or more. Return to play should never be sooner than 4 weeks postinjury, although most athletes in this country are returned to play within 2 weeks of a grade II sprain of the ankle. No wonder 30% have long-term sequelae.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I am probably more conservative than most because of the prevalence of ankle instability and/or end-stage arthritis in my practice. Almost always, the patient relates a history of a severe sprain that was treated with an ACE wrap and return to activity when tolerated or, worse, with benign neglect. For reasons that are still obscure, the pathway of repetitive inversion injuries often culminates in ankle arthritis with varus deformity. The real issue is figuring out which patients will have repetitive injuries from the onset of injury. Accordingly, since the described patient requires a stable ankle for his/her livelihood, I would encourage a 10-day period of compression and immobilization (nonremovable cast or splint), followed by a short leg walking cast for another 2 to 4 weeks. After that, aggressive supervised rehabilitation. This is frequently met with resistance from the patient because of their zeal to return to performances, but I think it is the most reliable strategy. I do not think that in a highly conditioned athlete, 4 to 6 weeks is all that morbid. Permanent restriction of motion is extremely rare following this regimen.</p>
</speech>
<p>How would you manage the same injury in a 68-year-old sedentary patient?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Acute-phase treatment lasts for 5 to 7 days, with SLW boot and crutches for assistance if there is difficulty walking. If the ankle is unstable, then SLW fiberglass cast is used for 2 weeks. If the ankle is stable, 2 weeks in SLW boot then a PT program is used.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Manage the same.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>Great question! In reality, this patient should be treated the same as the younger athletic patient, as ligaments heal slowly in elderly, but the athlete needs a stronger ligament repair to return to sport than the sedentary patient. Therefore, the time to “healing” and the time of immobilization are about the same. The difference in the older patient is the need for a more stable, restrictive immobilizing device than the younger athletic patient. I would put an older patient in a Controlled ankle motion (CAM) boot on day 1 and keep them in the device for 4 weeks after a grade II sprain. The problem is that elderly patients are already compromised in balance, and wearing any type of immobilizing device only complicates this situation. Implementing a walker or cane to improve stability should be considered when dispensing a CAM boot to an elderly patient. Physical therapy protocols would be the same as for the athlete, with the exception of activity-specific training. Balance training is critical in the elderly patient and should continue for 12 weeks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I would treat the patient the same.</p>
</speech>
<p>How would you manage a grade III injury to both the ATFL and calcaneofibular ligament in the competitive college athlete?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Acute-phase treatment for 7 days with posterior splint and crutches, then 10 days in fiberglass SLW cast, then a comprehensive controlled mobilization PT program. When the CF is also involved, as in this example case, I put the foot at 90° to approximate the ATF, and I also evert the RF by placing a valgus wedge under the RF to approximate the CF ligament while in the SLW cast. An ankle brace followed by an ankle sleeve is recommended for 6 to 10 months following the injury.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>The same</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>Identical to the grade II injury, except the immobilization is longer. I would allow weight bearing to tolerance in a short leg cast for 10 days, then a CAM boot for the next 6 to 8 weeks. Never return the athlete to sport until at least 6 weeks postinjury. Again, this is never done in the NCAA or professional sport, but ligaments take this long or longer to heal. I have no problem allowing weight bearing after a grade II or III sprain. Weight bearing encourages ankle joint dorsiflexion, activates the lower leg musculature, and pushes the ankle into a close pack position with reduced strain on the ATFL and calcanofibular ligament (CFL). The patient should decide if they feel more comfortable bearing weight. The exception is in the case of high ankle sprains, which should be non–weight bearing for an extended time period.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I would treat them the same, but it is very difficult to convince this patient subgroup to adopt this regimen. Athletic trainers and/or team physicians tend to look at the short-term outcomes rather than the late sequelae and want the athlete to return to competition. There are a lot of exogenous pressures for “early functional rehab.”</p>
</speech>
<p>What if any are the indications for primary repair of the injured ligament(s)? Would you approach this injury any different if there was an acute talar dome injury?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Primary repair is considered if the patient also has fracture that needs to be addressed, that is, large fibular summit avulsion fracture, talar dome fracture, lateral talar process fx, and so on. There should be consideration for primary repair in a professional athlete as well. Theoretically direct primary repair should be more predictable with the added benefit of direct visual joint inspection for occult intraarticular injury not apparent on initial exam or workup (especially with chondral injuries). Though conservative care has been favored for grade III ankle sprains in the recent past, the literature is still uncertain if surgical repair or conservative care is superior. This was the conclusion of a Cochrane Review in 2009 in comparing conservative to surgical tx.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I don’t think there are any indications for immediate repair. The slightly increased likelihood of enhanced result is more than overshadowed by the potential of surgical complications and the lengthened period of rehabilitation after surgery. If the talar dome injury (fracture, I presume) was recognized and surgery contemplated, then ligament repair could be undertaken but not necessary.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I am not aware of any indication for primary repair of the acute ankle sprain. If conservative treatment fails, delayed primary repair has the same success as immediate repair. I suspect that many patients have some degree of (did you say lateral?) medial talar dome injury after grade II and grade III ankle sprain. The majority of these injures seem to heal after appropriate traditional conservative treatment of the ankle sprain. More severe talar dome injuries require an extended period of non–weight bearing. I would be suspicious of this injury and order an MRI if the patient was failing to improve after the second week of therapy.</p>
</speech>
<p>What is the role of physical therapy following an acute grade II ligament injury of both the CFL and ATFL?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>The role of PT in all grades of ankle injury is critical. Due to the high incidence of morbidity in all grades of injury, we have to reevaluate our treatment protocols to include all grades of injury to ensure each patient/athlete is fully rehabilitated before returning to activities. In my opinion, most ankle injuries are not fully treated for healing to be complete.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>What is “physical therapy”? Surely an aggressive and appropriate exercise program is indicated. Other physical therapy modalities have not been documented as necessarily helpful,</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>Physical therapy is critical in the treatment of these injuries. I do not think a patient can fully recover from a grade II sprain, let alone grade III, without a focused rehabilitation program that emphasizes range of motion, strengthening, balance, and proprioception and activity-specific training. It is impossible for a patient to accomplish this on their own with a “home program.” Every injury is unique and a physical therapist is required to evaluate the patient at least twice weekly to modify the specifics of the individual program. Of all components, the balance and proprioception training is most critical to ensure adequate recovery and avoidance of long-term sequelae of chronic ankle instability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I became more of a “believer” in physical therapy after having major shoulder reconstruction myself. Deconditioning is underappreciated, and at the very least, enrollment of the patient in a supervised physical therapy program educates the patient, such that a home therapy program will be more successful. Yet the ultimate efficacy of PT really depends on the individual patient’s motivation.</p>

<title>Chronic Instability</title>
<sec id="section5-1938640013485223">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>How would you define chronic LAI?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>This is a patient who has had previous ankle injury who then becomes prone to persistent recurrent ankle injury. This can be perceived as found in sinus tarsi syndrome (patients feel unstable but do not sprain their ankle) or real with patients actually recurrently spraining their ankle. This real instability with recurrent injury can be mechanical (mechanical ankle injury [MAI]) or functional (functional ankle injury [FAI]). MAI would imply previous damage to the ligaments, now with insufficiency of those ligaments. FAI would typically imply intact ankle ligaments with recurrent instability due to some other factor, that is, inverted heel, tight Achilles, PF first ray insufficient or no rehab with proprioceptive defect, PT, and so on. These patients would be more prone to mechanical instability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Recurrent episodes of functional instability (ie, ankle collapsing or “going out”) in spite of an adequate rehabilitation program.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>This diagnosis is made by history and subjective complaint from the patient. Chronic ankle instability combines 2 or more of the following symptoms: pain, feeling of “giving way” of the ankle, and repetitive sprains. It is thought to be the result of mechanical instability (ie, ligament rupture or laxity) or functional instability (loss of neuromuscular control over the ankle).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Although arbitrary, I define chronic instability as the occurrence of another lateral ankle inversion injury within 1 year of their first acute sprain. Certainly there are patients that may have a second sprain after a long hiatus, but I don’t think this is as common as those who never fully recover from their initial acute episode.</p>
</speech>
<p>What are the diagnostic and historical criteria for the establishment of chronic LAI?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Recurrent sprains, many times with minimal provocation. Stress testing would be positive for ligamentous insufficiency for MAI and would be normal for FAI. Other predisposing factors would need to be sought and recognized. MAI would typically imply a previous grade II or III injury with inadequate or insufficient treatment. FAI can result from grade I sprains, and in 1 study, grade I sprains resulted in the highest incidence of FAI.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Can define only after the patient has undergone a rigorous restrengthening program.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>This diagnosis is made by history, not from any specific study or exam finding.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>A specific history of repetitive sprains or limitation on uneven ground. Stress radiography helps stratify the extent of the anatomical injury and helps direct surgical treatment if nonoperative treatment is unsatisfactory.</p>
</speech>
<p>How reliable is MRI for the assessment of ligamentous integrity in the chronically unstable ankle? What are some of the pitfalls of this modality?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>In my experience, not reliable. It can contribute additional information to the clinical picture, but I would never feel that it is accurately diagnostic. Again 30% false positive for ATF rupture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>May be inadequate ligamentous integrity on MRI, but I think importance is based on entire clinical picture. We know that MRI evidence of disruption does not necessarily mean clinical or functional instability;</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>The literature clearly shows that MRI has very high specificity and sensitivity to detect rupture of the ligaments of the ankle after acute injury and in the chronic unstable ankle. In spite of this, I find it difficult to rely on MRI findings when assessing the integrity of the ATFL as this structure is often difficult to visualize, even in the healthy ankle. Certainly MRI is very helpful to detect associated pathologies of chronic ankle instability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I don’t think it is any more reliable than the clinical exam and historical findings. Unfortunately, the public places a lot of emphasis on this modality. There is such a high incidence of false positives that I seldom request such a study. Even if there is an MRI, it generally does not direct treatment.</p>
</speech>
<p>What do you think is the most prominent reason for the development of chronic LAI?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>As stated at the outset, inaccurate diagnosis and insufficient/inadequate treatment. I feel conventional treatment protocols are not appropriate. The trend in the last 10 to 15 years has been toward early or functional mobilization of all lateral and medial ankle sprains. The thought is if the patient does not get better from the physical therapy, then surgery can always be performed PRN. Patients prefer functional treatment, and they typically will return to work and sport quicker, but they will commonly have persistent problems, that is, instability because of this premature return to activities and sport.</p>
<p>If we look closely at the histology of ankle injury, the key phase I feel is the second or proliferative phase (7-21 days postinjury). During this phase, premature excessive motion (which is initiated with early or functional rehab) will lead to predominantly type 3 collagen (weaker than desired type 1) with likely an attenuated or insufficiently healed ligament. There is a role for protection initially and, in my opinion, a short period of immobilization to allow uninhibited fibroblast proliferation to occur. This time frame would be during this 7- to 21-day period. For the last 15 years, I have been following a protocol that uses a short period of immobilization after the initial acute phase. Initially, I used 2 weeks in a SLW cast, but now, based on a recent study from the United Kingdom, I use 10 days for a grade III injury. That makes protection time (acute phase tx + casting period) to be approximately 2 weeks, give or take a few days. In previous studies that compared immobilization with functional treatment for lateral ankle sprains, the shortest immobilization time I could find was 3 weeks, though typically, the studies used 4 to 6+ weeks of immobilization, which is too long due to “cast disease” effects.</p>
<p>Another reason for developing ankle instability is inadequate or no rehabilitation. After the short period of immobilization, aggressive therapy is pursued emphasizing proprioception, balance, and dynamic strengthening. Patients should be followed (which can sometimes be many months) before being discharged from therapy. There are many validated clinical protocols now that identify criteria to be met before one can return to play both from a clinical and patient self-assessment perspective.</p>

<p>Failure of the ruptured ligaments to heal properly. Studies show that mechanical instability is the most common feature seen in patients with chronic ankle instability, although it is certainly not seen in every patient. PT and OCL lesions would be less common but known causes of chronic ankle instability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Inadequate treatment at the time of the original injury based on either (1) inaccurate diagnosis/grading of injury, (2) pressure from the patient, or (3) indifference from the provider because of habit or the recognition that surgical repair can be done later if the symptoms of instability evolve. It is surprising that the true long-term morbidity of ankle injury is really unknown and, as such, this supports a more benign approach. Yet it seems rather obvious that 4 to 6 weeks in a walking cast has far less morbidity than any surgical procedure, particularly when the same period of immobilization is part of the postop protocol. Clearly, we need to establish the burden of lateral ankle ligament injury to society as a whole in order to refine the existing treatment protocol.</p>
</speech>
<p>Is there a difference between chronic instability and “functional instability” (when the patient complains of frequent sprains, yet there are no confirming diagnostic tests)?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I believe patients with FAI do better with bracing versus patients with MAI. When predisposing factors are recognized and addressed, patients with FAI do well. Patients with FAI tend to do better clinically whereas patients with MAI will always be relegated to using mechanical preventive measures (hi-top shoes, ankle bracing, etc) because if they don’t, an ankle sprain is likely to recur.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Yes. I think the latter is the result of inadequate rehabilitation of the muscles (peroneals) involved.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>Absolutely. Many studies have confirmed that there are subgroups of patients with chronic ankle instability who have functional instability (ie, feeling of “giving way” of the ankle or repetitive sprains) who do not have evidence of mechanical instability (ie, ligament rupture or laxity). Patients with functional instability alone may comprise 30% to 50% of all patients with chronic ankle instability. Functional instability is thought to be caused by some deficit of neuromuscular control of the ankle either on the afferent (proprioceptive) or efferent (motor control) loops of the mechanism.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I think that there is indeed a difference, and it is based on the anatomic integrity of the ligaments. I use stress radiography to distinguish these entities. When there is distinct asymmetry between the injured and uninjured sides, this is true instability; when the stress films are normal in spite of repetitive sprains, this is functional instability. I also find that those patients with functional instability more commonly report less-severe injury with each episode. These patients seem to have less morbidity than those with anatomic insufficiency when comparing each successive injury.</p>
</speech>
<p>Is there such a thing as “subtalar” instability? If so, can you define it, and how does it differ clinically and diagnostically from lateral ligament instability?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I believe it does exist but rarely as an isolated pathology. When doing ankle stress views, I occasionally encounter mechanical subtalar joint (STJ) instability on both inversion and push-pull techniques. The Telos apparatus even has a special STJ instability attachment to test for this problem. When mechanical STJ instability is apparent, a close evaluation of shoe wear and evaluation for foot orthoses may be beneficial.</p>
<p>Implications surgically would be to recognize this pathology and address it during the surgical reconstruction. Primary repair of the lateral TC ligament and CF along with additional STJ augmentation may be necessary to address this instability. During a secondary repair, it would be important to have the tendon grafts cross the STJ to ensure both ankle and STJ stabilization. For example, I perform a Bröstrom/modified Chrisman Snook procedure when there is both ankle and STJ instability. The tendon allograft used crosses the STJ twice ensuring ankle and STJ stability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I am not sure this exists, and I am surely unable to distinguish it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I do believe there is a subgroup of patients who have isolated subtalar instability who are diagnosed with chronic ankle instability. One would argue that the CFL is both an ankle and subtalar stabilizing structure, so loss of this ligament would lead to instability at both joints. Injuries to the interosseous talocalcaneal and cervical ligaments can occur in isolation and lead to chronic sprains and symptoms of functional instability in the patient. MR imaging can be helpful, but not certainly diagnostic. A skilled clinician can detect laxity of the subtalar joint with manual exam when comparing to the contralateral foot.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>It probably exists, but I don’t know that I can tell when it is subtalar versus ankle instability. Fortunately, the treatment protocols are parallel in my practice, so I don’t worry so much about it. It may be that subtalar instability is a subset of functional instability.</p>
</speech>
<p>What is the impact of talar dome lesions in the genesis of end-stage arthritis from chronic instability?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>There was a recent paper in <italic>AJFAS</italic> concluding that there is 100% incidence of various types of ankle pathology in patients with CAI, the most prevalent of which was synovitis. Add to that pathology the presence of a talar dome lesion, and the incidence of secondary joint changes would probably be higher. I believe it has been established that talar dome lesions are more prevalent in patients with CAI. There should definitely be more concern for the presence of a talar dome lesion in a patient with CAI as there would be good chance that the talar dome lesion would progress to a higher-grade lesion.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>This is actually a 2-part question: (1) Does chronic instability result in end-stage arthritis (may be true but not well documented)? or (2) Does a talar dome lesion inevitably lead to end-stage arthritis? If symptomatic talar dome fracture (usually the result of loose body presence) is subjected to just loose body removal is arthritis inevitable? Not well documented.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I am not sure that OCL lesions have been implicated as the primary factor in the eventual development of degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the ankle in chronic ankle insufficiency. Although DJD has been a known sequela of CAI, the thought has been that the disruption of normal stability and mechanics of the talo crural joint leads to shifting of contact pressures and abnormal cartilage wear. At the same time, with the widespread use of MRI after ankle sprain, clinicians realize that even subtle talar dome lesions are very common. It is hard to ignore the possibility that these lesions may be the primary cause of DJD later when chronic ankle instability develops.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>This is another area that needs large epidemiological studies. Yet I do not believe there is much of an association between talar dome lesions and late consequences of repetitive or single injury. I think that one of the reasons that we cannot establish a firm relationship is that talar dome lesions are different pathologic entities than torsional impaction of the cartilaginous surfaces at the medial or lateral horizons of the talus or tibia. It is the latter that leads to end-stage arthritis because the cartilage loses the capacity to repair due to focal loss of chondrocytes. It is analogous to the development of subtalar arthritis after a perfectly reduced posterior facet in acalcaneal fracture. Death of the chondrocytes from impact leads to post-traumatic arthritis.</p>

<title>Treatment</title>
<p>What is your approach in the surgical management of chronic LAI? (Please elaborate).</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>For CAI only involving the ATF, I perform a Bröstrom with ligament augmentation PRN. I address chronic mechanical ankle instability with reconstruction of both ATF and CF ligaments using peroneus longus or brevis tendon autograft. The repair basically is an anatomical reconstruction securing the tendon allograft at its distal attachment (with screw and washer) through the distal fibula (with drill holes) to the lateral wall of calcaneus (with screw and washer) at its proximal attachment. In patients who have concurrent ankle and STJ instability or in patients with 2-ligament instability with generalized ligamentous laxity, I perform a combined Bröstrom/modified Chrisman Snook, which restores normal ATF and CF anatomy but adds another “ligament” coursing between ATF and CF that results in excellent stabilization of both joints (with a spokes-on-a-wheel effect).</p>
<p>In addition, if there are felt to be any predisposing factors, they may have to be dealt with as well either, with conservative or surgical treatments. Factors such as ankle equinus, PF first ray, inverted heel, limb length discrepancy, tarsal coalition, and so on would need to be considered.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I find it rarely necessary if adequately rehabilitated. In my estimation, “sending a patient to physical therapy” is not treatment. A means of recovering muscular strength is the mainstay of rehabilitation. Often, “physical therapy” involves many things (modalities, global strengthening, and so on), but reestablishing strength is not sufficiently addressed.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I am very careful to exhaust all conservative measures before considering surgery for chronic ankle instability. If a patient has completed 12 weeks of functional ankle rehabilitation, including balance training, and their symptoms persist, surgery is considered. I make sure that all appropriate imaging studies have been done as there are likely associated pathologies other than ligament disruption when a patient fails conservative care. Impingement lesions, peroneal tendinopathy, and OCL lesions are the the top 3 to consider. In most cases, surgical exploration must ensure visualization of all of these structures as MRI can miss any or all of these pathologies. This is why I rarely perform the simple Bröstrom-Gould procedure through a smaller incision. Years ago, Jack Schuberth showed me a very simple technique to reconstruct the CFL and ATFL using an autogenous split peroneus longus tendon graft. I prefer this technique over all others, although I have used semitendinosis allograft with similar results but far greater expense. Allograft is preferred when there is suspicion of peroneal tendon pathology.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>My surgical treatment is based on my best estimation of the extent of ligamentous insufficiency. In those patients that have “functional instability” or those only with a positive anterior drawer on stress X ray, I perform a Bröstrom. However, I try to extend the placation as far inferior as the peroneal tendons. In those patients with clearly asymmetric talar tilt, I perform an anatomic augmentation using peroneus longus with interference screws. I try to replicate physiologic tension of the new “ligament” recognizing that it is purely arbitrary. Doing anything other than an anatomic approach makes little sense to me.</p>
</speech>
<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Bröstrom procedure compared to a more formal dual ligament reconstruction?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>If you are certain that there is an isolated ATFL insufficiency and the patient has CAI and there are no other associated pathologies in the ankle joint (which is rare) the Bröstrom procedure is certainly more simple to perform and seems to have a faster recovery than tenodesis procedures.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Obviously, the Bröstrom is much simpler to execute. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes and only relies on soft-tissue healing instead of bone tendon interfaces.</p>
</speech>
<p>If you do perform a formal double-ligament reconstruction, do you utilize an anatomic or nonanatomic approach and why?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>You must perform anatomic reconstruction or face serious limitation of subtalar joint range of motion. This complication can pose significant disability for the athlete. With the use of newer technologies for interference fixation, there is no reason to not perform an anatomic reconstruction.</p>
</speech>
<p>How does one prevent the restriction of subtalar motion when performing lateral ankle stabilization procedures?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>The key to this procedure is the placement of the drill holes in the distal fibula. As long as they are distal, there have been no problems with limitation of ankle and/or STJ motion. In addition, the CF ligament graft is secured and tensioned to the lateral wall of the calcaneus with the ankle joint at 90° with foot loaded on the instrument tray.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Subtalar motion is often lost simply because of the period of immobilization necessary following ligament repair.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>The key is to orient the tendon graft to reconstruct the CFL exactly according to the original anatomy, which happens to run parallel to the axis of the subtalar joint. Too often, the surgeon will place the graft almost parallel to the fibula instead of orienting it in a posterior-plantar direction from the fibula. I have found that the ideal placement of the CFL is running along a bisection of the body of the calcaneus when the foot is in a weight-bearing position. Flatter feet with a lower calcaneal inclination angle have a lower inclination of their subtalar joint axis, whereas cavus feet have a higher inclination.</p>
</speech>
<p>In the 1980s, an arthroscopic approach was developed to treat chronic LAI. Later, capsular shrinking became popular. Do you think that either of these modalities have a place today in the treatment of lateral ligament insufficiency? If so, when would you utilize them?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>It is always good to keep an open mind, but at this time, I am not impressed with the original technique for arthroscopic ankle stabilization. Not aware of any new techniques to stabilize the ankle arthroscopically, but I am sure someone is working on it. Sometimes, I have enough of a challenge stabilizing the ankle with an open procedure. Capsular shrinkage is also an interesting idea, but I would be skeptical of its application for ankle stabilization.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>I think both these techniques are examples of technology overwhelming good sense.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I have no experience with this as I never believed that simple capsular shrinking would ever adequately address the issue of chronic ankle instability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>We did try the arthroscopic stapling technique in the 1980s, but aside from being technically cumbersome, it just did not seem to change the amount of laxity. The postop anterior drawer seemed the same; perhaps, it was our inexperience with the technique, but we did not pursue the mastery of this operation due to the simplicity and efficacy of the Bröstrom. Capsular shrinkage just doesn’t make sense. The premise was to essentially denature the molecular structure of the ligament; the fact that ligamentous tissue lost all of its resiliency was more or less ignored.</p>
</speech>
<p>How would your approach to this clinical entity change if the patient had generalized ligamentous laxity?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Bouché:</speaker>
<p>As discussed in the surgical implications above, I would consider additional procedural strategies to ensure a successful result.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Garrick:</speaker>
<p>Patients with generalized ligamentous laxity are less likely to benefit from ligamentous surgery.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richie:</speaker>
<p>I have found that these types of patients have less tendency to suffer from chronic ankle instability. When they do “sprain” their ankles, they seem to recover more quickly—perhaps because their ligaments are more compliant? If I ever operated on such a patient for chronic ankle instability, I would favor tendon allograft rather than autograft, as a more rigid ligament reconstruction would be obtained.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I agree with Dr Richie in that we just don’t seem to see a lot of patients with chronic instability and ligamentous laxity. I have done no more than 2 patients like this and used an anatomic but autologous tenodesis procedure on both of them, with satisfactory results. In any event, I don’t think the Bröstrom is the right choice for this subgroup of patients.</p>
