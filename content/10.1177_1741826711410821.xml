<p><bold>Background:</bold> Small autopsy studies and clinical practice indicated that carotid atherosclerosis develops in an asymmetrical helical pattern coinciding with regions of low shear stress. We investigated the distribution of carotid atherosclerosis as determined by maximum carotid intima-⊟media thickness (CIMT), to assess if we could confirm this atherosclerotic configuration across various populations with different cardiovascular risk. <bold>Methods and results:</bold> We used the individual baseline CIMT data from 3364 subjects from four recent international multicentre randomized controlled trials in which the carotid artery was systematically examined using the same ultrasound protocol and method to quantify CIMT. For each subject, circumferential information on the maximum CIMT of the left and right carotid arteries was obtained for the common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid artery segments. In each segment (common, bifurcation, internal), mixed modelling was used to study the differences in CIMT between angles, sides, gender, age, race, and studies. Each segment showed a different circumferential CIMT pattern. In all segments there were statistically significant differences between maximum CIMT across circumferential angles (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001); on average CIMT was highest in the posteromedial wall of the bifurcation and internal carotid segments and in the anterolateral wall of the common carotid segment. This asymmetric circumferential pattern was found to be identical in men and women, in young and old age, in different race groups, and across the studies. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We confirmed the asymmetrical helix-like distribution of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries and expand the evidence by showing that the atherosclerotic configuration is similar across populations with different vascular risks and across gender, age, and race. This has implications for future design of carotid ultrasound studies, as the angle of insonation is an important predictor of maximum CIMT.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711410821" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several small postmortem and angiographic studies have shown that carotid atherosclerosis develops in an asymmetrical manner preferentially localized at branching points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711410821">1</xref></sup><sup>−</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711410821">5</xref></sup> This coincides with impressions from clinical practice. Moreover, Masawa and coworkers assessed the distribution of atherosclerosis in carotid artery in 42 carotid arteries removed at autopsy from asymptomatic patients and reported a non-uniform distribution of atherosclerosis with circumferential location of maximum intima thickness shifting in a continuous helix from proximal to distal artery levels coinciding with regions of low shear stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711410821">6</xref></sup> Systemic cardiovascular disease risk factors such as elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, impaired glucose intolerance, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and smoking, which form the backbone of our current risk prediction models, can not entirely explain this way of development of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711410821">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711410821">8</xref></sup> These findings have lead to the hypothesis that haemodynamic shear forces play a major role in the development of atherosclerosis. However, it would be important for our understanding of the atherosclerotic disease process to confirm the helix-like distribution of maximum wall thickness in a large group of subjects with early stage atherosclerosis. Furthermore, as risk models are developed based on the absolute level of carotid intima-⊟media thickness (CIMT) as indicator of future absolute risk, information on the distribution of CIMT may be valuable.</p>
<p>Therefore, we set out to explore the circumferential distribution of atherosclerosis in a large cohort of participants (<italic>n </italic>= 3364) who were recruited in four international multicentre clinical trials in which carotid atherosclerosis was measured by B-mode ultrasound. We hypothesized that we could find a helix-like distribution of maximum CIMT in these populations. Furthermore we investigated whether this pattern differs across gender, age, and race.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1741826711410821"><title>CIMT ultrasound protocol and measurement</title>
<p>All imaging centres in the trials used a similar protocol for image acquisition. The B-mode ultrasound imaging protocol was based on a multi-angle, multi-segment approach using predefined acquisition angles guided by the Meijer′s carotid arc for external positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711410821">Figure 1</xref>). The carotid segments were defined as the common carotid artery (CCA) (from 10 to 20 mm proximal to the tip of flow divider), carotid bifurcation (from the tip of flow divider to 10 mm proximal to the tip of flow divider), and the proximal 10 mm of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Ultrasound images were collected from 12 well-defined sites: near and far walls of the three segments of the right and left carotid arteries (2 × 3 × 2). For each of the 12 sites, images were collected from four (RADIANCE I and II) or five (OPAL and METEOR) angles using Meijer’s arc. Therefore, each examination provided maximally a total of 48 (RADIANCE I and II) or 60 (OPAL and METEOR) selections of images.
<fig id="fig1-1741826711410821" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of carotid artery showing sites of CIMT measurements (i.e. common carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation, and the internal carotid artery) using ultrasound and a Meijer’s arc (see photo inset). BIFUR, bifurcation; CCA, common carotid artery; ECA, external carotid artery; ICA, internal carotid artery; NF, near and far wall; OAI, optimal angle of interrogation; RS, right side.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741826711410821-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The entire ultrasound examination was recorded on super VHS videotapes (OPAL and METEOR) or magnetic optical disk (RADIANCE I and II) and sent to the core laboratory at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, USA for the participants in the USA or to the core laboratory at the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands for the European and/or South African participants.</p>
<p>All ultrasound scans were read using Automated Measurement Software AMS II (RADIANCE I and II) or Image Pro software (OPAL and METEOR) onto which a dedicated software program was added to ensure standardized settings across reading stations and continents. For each image sequence, the reader selected one frame for measurement in the end diastolic phase guided by the QRS complex of the ECG. One-centimetre lengths of near and far wall CIMT were traced within the predefined region of interest controlled by the reader. Maximum CIMT was determined from a set of measurements perpendicular to the media−adventitia boundary.</p>
<p>In the database for each of the 12 carotid sites, maximum CIMT results were recorded by their corresponding Meijer’s arc angle of interrogation. In order to make the data understandable from a plain anatomical point of view and independent of the measurement method (arc angles and walls), we modified the Meijer’s Arc angles to the anatomic circumferential angles, as detailed in Appendix 1. After circumferential modification, 0° corresponds to the posterior or dorsal wall, 90° corresponds to the outer or lateral side wall, 180° to the ventral aspect of the artery, and 270° location corresponds to the inner or medial side wall of artery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711410821"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The present pooled analysis included CIMT values collected from the assessment of participants prior to being assigned to treatment groups. Means of the maximum CIMT measurements and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of each study were plotted for each of the 10 angles of the three segments for both the right and left carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711410821">Figure 2</xref>). This evaluation showed different circumferential patterns of CIMT over carotid segments. Therefore, further analyses were done separately for each segment.

<p>CIMT modelling was performed using a repeated measures, linear mixed-effects model. The dependent variable was maximum CIMT and the repeated measure was angle by side. The model was specified in terms of random intercept for individual participants and fixed effects for study, race, geographic origin, sex, age, side, and angle. For evaluating whether the distribution of CIMT in angles varied by the levels of the above-mentioned factors, we included multiplicative interaction terms for angle with each variable (side, age, sex, race, and geographical origin) in the model. Statistical significance of the added interaction term provided evidence that the CIMT distribution (i.e., relation between angle and CIMT) differed across the variable. However, lack of statistical significance for the interaction term suggested that the relation between angle and CIMT was identical across the variable levels.</p>
<p>The calculations were carried out by Proc Mixed with restricted maximum likelihood and unstructured covariance structure for the repeated measurement, using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were 2-sided and <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1741826711410821" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The entire sample comprised 3364 adults; 1447 (43%) men and 1917 (57%) women. 1601 (45.1%) were from European countries, 1524 (45.3%) were from the USA and 239 (7.1%) were from South Africa. Overall, there were 3150 (93.6%) Caucasians and 214 non-Caucasians. The mean age was 54.7 years.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711410821"><title>Angle and CIMT relations</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711410821">Figure 2</xref>, the mean values and 95% CI of the maximum CIMT measurements from the 10 circumferential angles of the right and left carotid artery segments are displayed separately for each study. As expected, the bifurcation had the highest level of CIMT followed by the ICA and the CCA. The studied populations, though with different baseline CIMT values, showed similar CIMT patterns for each segment. The observed patterns in the ICA and bifurcation were to a certain extent comparable: in the interrogated wall sectors of both the ICA and bifurcation, thickness tended to decrease circumferentially from posterior wall to lateral and reaching the minimum values at anterolateral sector (135°), then gradually increasing through medial wall reaching a maximum in the posteromedial wall. However, in the bifurcation, the maximum was reached in the medial aspect of the artery (255−285°) and thereafter a drop off was observable, but in ICA, the maximum measured CIMT value was in the posteromedial sector (315°). The CCA had more homogenous circumferential thickness compared to the two other segments. However, thickness tended to increase circumferentially from the posterior wall to the lateral, reaching the maximum value in the anterolateral sector (135°), then gradually decreased to reach a relatively constant level in all medial sectors.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410821">Table 2</xref>, the numerical results of the CIMT modelling are given for each carotid segment. Findings of all segments revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the CIMT values of separate interrogated angles (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) documenting the non-uniform circumferential distribution of the CIMT across the angles. This finding was independent of age, gender, race, region, and side.

<sec id="sec10-1741826711410821" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, on a large cohort of participants assessed by B-mode ultrasound, we found a helix-like distribution of maximum CIMT in the carotid arteries. This confirms earlier findings in small pathology studies and underscores the hypothesis that local haemodynamic factors play a major role in atherosclerosis development. Furthermore, we expand the evidence by showing that this pattern of asymmetry is similar in men and women, across age groups, among races, and between European and US populations.</p>
<p>Previous macroscopic and microscopic studies of the transverse sections of human carotid artery segments have revealed that plaques tend to form on the flow divider side in the common carotid artery and opposite the flow divider in the bifurcation region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711410821">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711410821">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711410821">16</xref></sup> Masawa and co workers, assessed carotid arteries removed at autopsy from patients with no clinical or anatomic evidence of cerebrovascular disease. He showed that the distribution of maximum CIMT is helical, occurring at common carotid artery it was at the flow divider side, immediately proximal to the flow divider it was at the lateral side wall. In the mid-sinus region of the internal carotid artery it was opposite to the flow divider and at the distal internal carotid just beyond the sinus, maximum intimal thickness was at the inner side wall. In addition, their evaluation revealed that intimal thickenings were occasionally bimodal, particularly in the proximal internal carotid region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711410821">6</xref></sup> Our findings of the circumferential distribution of the CIMT are in line with this report and confirm their observations using CIMT data from more than 3000 participants from different risk populations residing in different continents.</p>
<p>Espeland and coworkers also performed a carotid ultrasound study in 900 American adults aged 40−79 years who were at low risk of cardiovascular events. They showed that atherosclerosis increases distally through the common carotid segment, peaks near the distal end of the bifurcation segment, and decreases gradually through the internal segment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711410821">17</xref></sup> These findings are in line with our results and the aforementioned pathology studies. However, they did not address the circumferential distribution of the maximum wall thickness and did not assess the role of age, gender, and race.</p>
<p>The proposed causal factor for the formation of atherosclerotic lesions at specific regions of the arterial tree is the role of local haemodynamic forces. The entire vasculature is exposed to atherogenic effects of the systemic risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidaemia, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic infections, and genetic predisposition) but atherosclerosis develops mainly in the vicinity of branch points, the outer wall of bifurcations, and the inner wall of curvatures, where disturbed flow occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711410821">18</xref></sup> These local haemodynamic forces include flow-generated endothelial shear stress (ESS) and blood pressure-derived tensile stress, with ESS playing the most fundamental role in atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711410821">19</xref></sup> Prolonged decreases in ESS force endothelial cells to switch towards an atherogenic phenotype. Endothelial cell turnover, endothelium-derived inflammatory mediators, and extracellular matrix degradation are tightly regulated by ESS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711410821">20</xref></sup><sup>−</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711410821">22</xref></sup> In line, low ESS promotes increased permeability and enhanced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake into the artery wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711410821">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711410821">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, ESS regulates endothelium derived nitric oxide (NO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711410821">25</xref></sup> These processes are known to facilitate atherogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711410821">19</xref></sup> Several studies have documented the presence of a reverse association between circumferential distribution of ESS and atherosclerosis lesion thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711410821">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711410821">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711410821">26</xref></sup> The areas of high CIMT in our results also correspond to areas of low shear stress in the carotid artery wall supporting the haemodynamic basis of the observed patterns in our study. Geometry plays a key role in determining the nature of haemodynamic patterns. Therefore, the parallel patterns of circumferential CIMT distribution, regardless of age, gender, and ethnic and geographical origins, can be due to the similar geometry of carotid artery in all of these diverse subpopulations.</p>
<p>We observed mirror-image symmetry in circumferential distribution of CIMT in right and left carotid arteries. Not only the pattern but also the level of CIMT was similar in both sides. This finding was in contrast with several papers reporting a systematic increase in atherosclerosis in favour of left side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711410821">27</xref></sup><sup>−</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711410821">29</xref></sup> All these studies suffered from measurement of CIMT based on a single image. This systematic increase might be explained by the combination of right-handedness of most sonographers and incomplete and non-standardized interrogation of carotid arteries resulting in a biased location of image acquisition in right and left sides.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that the findings reported here deal mainly with the average pattern of CIMT circumferentially. They can not be generalized to the individual patients, nor do we expect the same pattern in every individual. Therefore, taking into account the tendency toward application of CIMT measurement in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in individual patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711410821">30</xref></sup> the measurement protocols should not be limited to just the single ‘nicest double line pattern’ view. Our findings show that depending on the angle of carotid interrogation, the absolute CIMT measurement differs and when evaluating individual risks based using the absolute value of CIMT, all measurable sites of the both sides should be interrogated. The other reason for recommending this extensive evaluation is the fact that the precise orientation of the carotid bifurcation with respect to the body as a whole varies from one individual to another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711410821">6</xref></sup> and considering the association between bifurcation geometry and haemodynamic stress in the artery one should expect variations in the CIMT across interrogated angles.</p>
<p>Certain limitations of our study need to be addressed. As we used the data from subjects recruited in four clinical trials, they are not representative of the general population. Yet, the fact that we show identical patterns across the four trial populations, all with different inclusion and exclusion criteria, lends support for generalizability. Another potential limitation was the lack of complete data on circumferential distribution of CIMT; visualization of carotid walls by B-mode ultrasonography in 135−195° and 315−15° angles was impossible due to the anatomic positioning of the arteries among other neck tissues. Particular strengths of our study are the large number of participants and the rigorous and uniform method of CIMT ultrasound protocol and measurement.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1741826711410821" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the results of the study support the view that atherosclerosis develops in an asymmetric manner across carotid walls in a helical pattern. We found that the configuration of the asymmetry is identical across gender, age, race, and population groups with different vascular risks. This has implications for future design of carotid ultrasound studies, as the angle of insonation is an important predictor of maximum CIMT. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that haemodynamic forces have a major contribution in the development of atherosclerosis and warrants further research on the interaction between the haemodynamic forces and the artery wall.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1741826711410821"><title>Data preparation in order to translate the Meijer Arc approach to plain anatomical values</title>
<p>Anatomical perception of the CIMT data needs a full understanding of the positioning of both the carotid artery and the transducer throughout the interrogation. For the measurement the patient lies down and the Meijer's arc is put around his neck. In order to better expose each carotid artery for interrogation, the patients' neck is turned 45° to the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711410821">Figure 1</xref>). The arc is designed such that by this positioning of the neck, the carotid under investigation will be placed around the center of the arc's circle.</p>
<p>Then, on each side, the sonographer acquires and records CIMT images of the 6 segment-wall combinations of the near and far wall of the common, bifurcation, and the internal carotid artery segments, at 4 to 5 predefined angles of 30° steps guided by the Meijer's arc (60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 degrees when scanning the right carotid artery and 300, 270, 240, 210 and 180 when scanning the left carotid artery).</p>
<p>For making the data simpler for statistical modeling and concurrently comprehensible independent of the measurement method described above, we calculated anatomic angles corresponding to each Meijer's angle. In first step, assuming that the artery is located in the center of the arc through out the interrogation and its wall is circular, equivalent circumferential angles for the far walls of the right carotid artery segments can be simply calculated by adding 180 degrees to their corresponding Meijer's angles (e.g. 90° far wall will be transformed to circumferential 270°). Therefore, 60°–180° stands for the near wall of the right carotid and 240°–360° stands for its far wall, circumferentially.</p>
<p>By this modification the necessity of mentioning the far or near wall for each site will be removed, however, we still need to adjust the angles for the 45° counterclockwise rotation of the neck inside the Meijer's arc, which can be done by subtracting 45° from the current angles. Now, adjusted angles show the circumferential position of the interrogated sites on the right carotid segments, setting the mid-point of the carotid posterior wall at 0, and angles increasing in counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p>For the left side, by the same reasoning we calculate equivalent circumferential angles of the far wall by subtracting 180 degrees from the Meijer's angles (e.g. 270° far wall will be transformed to circumferential 90°), then 45° adjustment will be done by adding 45° to the equivalent angle. Again, adjusted angles show the circumferential position of the interrogated sites on the left carotid segments, setting the mid-point of the carotid posterior wall at 0, and angles increasing in counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p>Since, one of the objectives of our study was evaluating the symmetry of pattern in right and left carotid segments, another modification was also applied on left side by a mirror transformation of the angles, so that the mid-point of the carotid posterior wall is still at 0, but angles increase in clockwise direction.</p>
