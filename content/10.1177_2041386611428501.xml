<p>Good theory in organizational psychology is not only novel and interesting but also has the potential to extend existing theory. We suggest that organizational psychology can most effectively contribute to theory in the broader discipline of psychology when it leverages features that make organizations distinct from other social entities, such as families and communities. We identify several of these distinctive features and provide examples to illustrate how they can serve as a foundation for advancing theory.</p>

<p>Good theory is the essential motor for the entire scientific enterprise—the advancement of knowledge. Good theory enables other scholars to understand the world differently, unites previously isolated communities of scholars, solves puzzles that hinder scientific progress, and generates solutions to problems that could not have been previously anticipated. And yet, there is a great deal of confusion about what constitutes good theory. Our goal is to reduce this confusion in the following essay, which consists of three parts. First, we describe a necessary condition for good theory along with some examples of the kinds of scholarship that either attain or fail to attain this standard. Second, we suggest that good theorizing goes beyond merely attaining the necessary condition set forth in the first section; to be <italic>good</italic> the theory should be <italic>interesting</italic> as well. Drawing heavily on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2041386611428501">Davis’ (1971)</xref> classic paper, “That’s Interesting,” we offer suggestions on how organizational scholars may use existing theories to shed light on workplace phenomena in creative ways. Finally, we also believe that the relationship between basic theory and organizational phenomena is a reciprocal one. Just as basic theory may be used to explain relationships between variables that organizational psychologists care about, exploring these relationships in the context of organizational phenomena may extend or refine basic theory. Thus, in the third section we offer suggestions on how the study of organizational psychology may deepen our understanding of more basic psychological theory.</p>
<sec id="section1-2041386611428501">
<title>A necessary condition for good theory</title>
<p>We suggest that a hallmark of good theory in organizational psychology is to go beyond simply describing a phenomenon or a relationship between variables. Instead, it is necessary to delve into the underlying mechanisms that explain why a particular phenomenon emerges or why the variables are related to one another. To illustrate, consider two forms that conceptual papers sometimes take which fall short of this standard. Some papers offer a framework or model which summarizes a range of antecedents associated with a particular outcome, such as individual, social, and task-related predictors of employee motivation. All too often such models do not adequately explain the causal mechanisms—why and how the antecedents identified shape important outcomes. While such efforts may be extremely valuable for categorizing and organizing research (e.g., one paper that does an exceptional job of categorizing and organizing the justice literature and thus serving a basis for subsequent theorizing is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2041386611428501">Greenberg’s [1987</xref>], “A Taxonomy of Organizational Justice Theories”), the failure to focus on underlying causal mechanisms diminishes their ability to guide future research. That is, without a clear explanation of why the antecedents elicit resulting outcomes, scholars using the model are left with little guidance (and indeed the entire model is called into question) when they identify variables omitted from the model or find that a relationship predicted by the model is absent or opposite in sign to that which was predicted.</p>
<p>A second example of how theory can fall short may emerge in research devoted to identifying contingency factors or conditions under which expected relationships fail to emerge. A common pitfall of some of this type of research is that it may be largely descriptive rather than explanatory, such as the numerous papers in cross-cultural psychology that merely compare U.S. populations to those drawn from other countries. While this research provides answers to the “when?” question and thus suggests boundary conditions for existing research findings, theory development may be delayed until later efforts to reconcile the cross-cultural differences in results. In the cross-cultural psychology area, conceptual progress was meaningfully increased with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2041386611428501">Markus and Kitayama’s (1991)</xref> research on self-construal, which posits that Western populations are more likely to have independent self-construals while Eastern populations are more likely to have interdependent self-construals. They demonstrate that this difference in self-construal is responsible for the failure to replicate “basic” psychological phenomena in nonindividualistic cultures, such as the fundamental attribution error whereby people perceive the behavior of other people to be due to dispositional rather than situational causes. The fundamental attribution error emanates, at least in part, from the higher salience of individual actors among those with independent self-construal (e.g., those from Western cultures) and thus is less prevalent among those for whom the social context is more salient (i.e., Asians who have more interdependent self-construal). Contingency approaches may be examples of good theory when scholars use information about <italic>when</italic> a relationship holds to draw insights about <italic>why</italic> these factors are related. Markus and Kitayama’s research thus serves as an example of how efforts to understand the conditions under which a phenomenon does or does not emerge helps to explain rather than merely describe, and in so doing constitutes good theory.</p>

<sec id="section2-2041386611428501">
<title>Make it interesting</title>
<p>While an explanation of why a phenomenon exists is a necessary condition for good theory in organizational psychology, the best theory is also interesting in that it is novel or surprising. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2041386611428501">Davis’ (1971)</xref> article suggests that what makes theory interesting is that it leads us to think more deeply about, and perhaps question, existing assumptions. Davis highlights some of the ways that theory can call existing assumptions into question, which we illustrate with examples from organizational psychology in what follows.</p>
<p>First, interesting theory may help us understand why and how something we thought was complex in various ways (e.g., multifaceted, differentiated, or changing) is actually more simple. For example, self-affirmation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2041386611428501">Steele, 1988</xref>) showed that diverse phenomena identified in the field of social psychology—such as inconsistency experiences that give rise to cognitive dissonance and uncontrollability experiences that lead to learned helplessness—may have a common thread. Specifically, both threaten individuals’ self-integrity. Moreover, this common thread yields a common solution: providing people with opportunities for reaffirmation reduces self-integrity threat and thus eliminates the effects of inconsistency and uncontrollability.</p>
<p>In organizational psychology, a host of seemingly distinctive forms of organizational change (e.g., layoffs, restructurings) and different concomitants of organizational change (procedural unfairness, job insecurity, or reductions in the motivating potential of work) may yield similar consequences; all may elicit resistance to change because they threaten employees’ self-integrity. Moreover, providing an opportunity to reaffirm (even in ways that are unrelated to the threat) may reduce employees’ resistance to change. Thus, applying self-affirmation theory to organizational change offers insight into why these various forms and aspects of organizational change elicit resistance (i.e., because they threaten self-integrity), uniting apparently distinct phenomena. In so doing, they provide a novel approach to alleviating the resistance employees often show in response to organizational change (that is, providing opportunities for reaffirmation, even those occurring in a different domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2041386611428501">Wiesenfeld, Brockner, Petzall, Wolf, &amp; Bailey, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>How might scholars identify points of convergence between seemingly distinct organizational phenomena? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2041386611428501">McGuire (1973)</xref> suggests that reasoning by analogy may be one method. Specifically, when analogous findings emerge across seemingly distinct areas there may be a common explanation underlying the findings and thus an opportunity to advance theory in a novel way. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2041386611428501">Sumanth, Mayer, and Kay (2011)</xref> noted that the tendency to retaliate against whistleblowers is analogous to other incidents consistent with system justification theory, such as the tendency for those disadvantaged by a system to support the system in spite of the fact that doing so may lead to perverse behaviors and cognitions such as victim-blaming. They therefore offer system justification motives as the underlying mechanism explaining retaliation against whistleblowers, thus advancing our understanding of why this counterintuitive organizational phenomenon is so prevalent.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2041386611428501">Davis (1971)</xref> also suggests that the opposite state of affairs may be interesting; that is, providing a rationale for how something we thought was simple, virtually always true, or unitary is actually more complex, contingent, or multifaceted. For example, economists, sociologists, and equity theorists have long argued that people react more positively to decisions that yield favorable or fair <italic>outcomes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2041386611428501">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2041386611428501">Blau, 1964</xref>). At the same time, social psychologists have suggested that people react more positively when the <italic>procedures</italic> used to make and implement decisions are fair and respectful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2041386611428501">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2041386611428501">Thibaut &amp; Walker, 1975</xref>). Elsewhere, we have summarized the results of many studies which show that the effects of what you do depend on how you do it, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2041386611428501">Brockner &amp; Wiesenfeld, 1996</xref>); that is, reactions to decision outcomes depend upon the decision process and reactions to the decision process depend on the decision outcome. This is because people use both outcome and process information to make sense of decisions, decision-makers, and themselves. Put differently, the effect of variables highlighted by economists (the favorability of tangible outcomes) cannot be understood without considering variables salient to psychologists (the fairness of the decision process), and vice versa, suggesting that these phenomena may be more complex than initially believed.</p>
<p>Another path to interesting theory operates by calling into question common preconceptions of how good or effective certain policies or courses of action may be. For example, research in organizational psychology on the attributional effects of affirmative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2041386611428501">Heilman, 1996</xref>) suggests that such policies, which are designed to level the playing field and thus create a more equal workplace, may ironically have precisely the opposite effect. For example, affirmative action policies lead White males to question the competence of women and minorities. Affirmative action also offers an alternative explanation for the achievements of women and minorities, thereby preventing them from confidently taking credit for their own success and accomplishments. Thus, Heilman’s theorizing helps explain why affirmative action, which is undertaken with the best of intentions, may have some paradoxically negative effects.</p>
<p>Likewise, good theory is also interesting when it helps explain why something that is traditionally viewed as bad or ineffective may actually be good. For example, procedural unfairness is generally thought to be highly undesirable. However, attribution theory suggests that when people receive negative outcomes, such as failing to receive a raise or promotion, procedural unfairness may in fact be highly desirable as a buffer against ego threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2041386611428501">Brockner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2041386611428501">Brockner et al., 2003</xref>). That is, recipients of negative outcomes may feel better about themselves if they can blame their outcomes on an unfair process than if they believe that their poor outcomes were due to something about themselves. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2041386611428501">George (2011)</xref> uses a “dual-tuning” approach to highlight how negative affect, which is often thought of as problematic, may be beneficial and adaptive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2041386611428501">McGuire (1973)</xref> exhorts scholars to search for “paradoxical incidents” such as George’s examples of the instances in which negative affect is helpful; it is these observed paradoxes which may offer a path to identifying theory that offers surprising insights about what is beneficial or what is harmful.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2041386611428501">Davis (1971)</xref> also suggests that theory is interesting when it calls into question our understanding of taken-for-granted relationships, such as illuminating cases in which factors that we thought were unrelated are actually related or vice versa, situations in which positive relationships are actually negative or vice versa, previously assumed antecedents are actually outcomes or previously assumed outcomes are actually antecedents, and similarities are identified in factors that are apparently different or vice versa. For example, schadenfreude refers to taking pleasure in others’ misery (i.e., feeling good when others feel bad), and envy refers to feeling bad when others are likely to feel good. These two constructs may at first appear to be different types of emotions. However, an analysis of the social implications of these emotions suggests that both may lead people to feel incongruent with the targets of their emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2041386611428501">Blader, Wiesenfeld, Rothman, &amp; Wheeler-Smith, 2010</xref>). Indeed, these emotions may be indistinguishable with respect to the influence they have on how people respond to others’ treatment, outcomes, and perceptions of justice. Specifically, feeling schadenfreude or envy toward a decision recipient had the same effect on observers’ reactions to decisions that unfairly advantaged a recipient: in either case, people perceived the recipient’s unfair underadvantage as fair, and therefore reacted positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2041386611428501">Blader, Wiesenfeld, Fortin, &amp; Wheeler-Smith, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Studying organizational psychology also may inform existing theory</title>
<p>The field of organizational psychology is an applied field in that it is focused on psychological processes that are relevant to organizational contexts. Thus, perhaps most common in organizational psychology, and indeed the form that best characterizes many of the examples of theory highlighted above, is when theory in organizational psychology applies well-established theoretical perspectives in other areas of psychology (such as social or cognitive psychology) to help understand organizational phenomena. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2041386611428501">Dutton, Dukerich, and Harquail’s (1994)</xref> highly influential work drew upon the existing research in social psychology on social identity theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2041386611428501">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>) to construct a model of how organization members relate to the organizations to which they belong. Many of the most important conceptual models in organizational psychology also may be best characterized as applications of established psychological theory to organizational problems or situations: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2041386611428501">Hackman and Oldham’s (1976)</xref> job characteristics model owes a great deal to research in psychology on motivation; much of the research on judgment and decision-making in organizational psychology is based on decision-making research in cognitive psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2041386611428501">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 2000</xref>); and those who have documented the “affective revolution” in organizational research explicitly acknowledge the fact that this transition in organizational research was influenced by more than a decade’s worth of light-shedding research on emotion in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2041386611428501">Barsade, Brief, &amp; Spataro, 2003</xref>). These examples may leave readers with the impression that good theory in organizational psychology fits the description of “old wine in new bottles”; that is, importing well-understood theory from fields such as social or cognitive psychology to help explain organizational phenomena.</p>
<p>Contrary to this view, we suggest that organizational psychology also is extraordinarily well positioned to make important conceptual contributions by developing novel theory or substantially elaborating on existing theory in psychology. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2041386611428501">Levine and Moreland’s (1990)</xref> article mapping an agenda for small groups research, the authors describe research on the psychology of small groups as “alive and well, but living elsewhere.” In fact, the “elsewhere” they refer to is the field of organizational psychology rather than its original home, the broader discipline of social psychology. We suggest that organizational psychologists have the potential to make contributions to the discipline when they leverage the features that make organizational psychology <italic>organizational</italic>. We devote the remainder of this essay to identifying several of these critical points of leverage.</p>
<p>A promising path for identifying how organizational psychology may contribute to existing theory in the basic discipline involves identifying how organizations are distinct from most other social entities. Distinctive features are a point of leverage because they shine light on gaps in our theorizing which serve as a platform for theory building. What are some of the distinctive features of organizations that differentiate them from other social entities such as families, communities, and markets?</p>
<p>One such feature is that organizations are inherently hierarchical. Hierarchy is explicitly defined and reified with features such as formal roles, reporting structures, task assignments, and compensation systems. Organizational psychologists have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been at the forefront of research on the psychology of social hierarchies. For example, observing the formal and informal mechanisms reinforcing social hierarchy in organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2041386611428501">Magee and Galinsky (2008)</xref> advanced a theory of social hierarchy as composed of power and status. These two aspects of social hierarchies have historically been viewed as quite similar, but Magee and Galinsky’s work points out that they may, in fact, be very different. Power is defined with respect to control over resources, whereas status is defined with respect to winning others’ respect and admiration. While these two may often be confounded in the broader society, as when majority groups such as White males have both power and status, research in organizational psychology helps to distinguish the two by showing that they have distinct antecedents and consequences.</p>
<p>For example, recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2041386611428501">Rothman, Wheeler-Smith, Wiesenfeld, &amp; Galinsky, 2011</xref>) demonstrates that leaders who behave more fairly are perceived as having higher status but lower power than their less fair counterparts. Moreover, fairness heuristic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2041386611428501">Lind, 2001</xref>), which itself is rooted in organizational psychology, suggests an underlying mechanism explaining these apparently contradictory relationships. Fairness heuristic theory elaborates and extends research on justice by highlighting an unacknowledged set of inferences for which people use fairness information. Specifically, the theory suggests that a central concern for people evaluating authorities is determining whether the authorities are benevolent versus exploitative. Fairness information is particularly useful in arriving at this judgment; unfairness signals high self-concern on the part of authorities which is associated with them behaving exploitatively, while fairness signals other-orientation which is associated with them behaving benevolently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2041386611428501">Rothman et al. (2011)</xref> showed that unfair authorities are perceived to be more powerful because they are viewed as relatively more self-concerned, whereas fair authorities are perceived to be higher in status because they are viewed as more other-oriented. Thus, in contrast to previous research showing that status and power tend to travel together, authorities may be seen as having more of one and less of the other as a function of the fairness of their actions.</p>
<p>Organizations also represent ongoing social systems in which people have repeated interactions. Taking this feature of organizational life as a point of departure, fairness heuristic theory may add insight to basic justice theory regarding <italic>how</italic> people use fairness information. In particular, while the fairness of any single decision is important, in organizational settings a single instance of justice-relevant information may be viewed not in isolation but rather in the context of an ongoing series of events and exchanges. Fairness heuristic theory suggests that incoming justice-relevant information associated with a particular event could serve as a basis for making fairness judgments, or it could be an impetus for using already-formed fairness judgments (known as heuristics). Specifically, incoming information that is consistent with prior justice information built up over time will reinforce and thus stimulate use of the fairness heuristic, while incoming information that is inconsistent with prior information may stimulate a reassessment of the heuristic in the form of a judgment process. Consistent with this reasoning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2041386611428501">Brockner et al. (in press)</xref> recently showed that the well-established positive relationship between employees’ trust in organizational authorities and their willingness to support the authorities and the organizations they represent was attenuated only when incoming fairness-relevant information clearly differed from their extant levels of trust. Thus, employees responded relatively positively to authorities they previously did not trust only when incoming outcome <italic>and </italic>procedural information reflected high fairness. Furthermore, they responded relatively negatively to authorities they previously trusted only when incoming outcome and procedural information reflected low fairness. If either the outcome or procedural information was consistent with their existing views of the authority, employees used their extant trust perceptions as a heuristic to guide their support for the authorities and the institutions they represent. However, when the incoming outcome and procedural information was incongruent with their prior views of the authority, employees responded as if they had reevaluated their judgments of the authority, showing levels of support more in accordance with the nature of the incoming information rather than their prior judgments.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature of organizations and thus a key point of leverage for organizational psychology is the fact that organization members often serve as agents or representatives of others. That is, organizations are entities created to satisfy the goals of stakeholders, many of whom are external to the organization. However, it is organization members themselves, with their own goals and motivations, who engage in activities to satisfy the goals and needs of these other stakeholders. This fact of organizational life has a number of important psychological implications. For example, given that most organization members are simultaneously aware of the pressure to satisfy personal and role-based imperatives, they may experience <italic>intra</italic>personal conflict. Moreover, the prevalence of numerous distinctive goals combined with the need for coordinated action associated with task accomplishment creates the potential for <italic>inter</italic>personal conflict. Organizational psychology may therefore be especially equipped to advance basic theory on conflict.</p>
<p>In this vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386611428501">Jehn (1995)</xref> distinguished two different dimensions of conflict—task conflict, which refers to work-related disagreements regarding the content of the tasks being performed, and relationship conflict, which refers to interpersonal friction between group members. Moreover, Jehn theorized that while relationship conflict usually has negative effects on group performance, task conflict has potentially positive effects. Thus, the more nuanced view of conflict contributed by organizational psychology advances existing theory regarding conflict not only by explaining that conflict is nonunitary but also by altering assumptions about how detrimental it may be. Delving further into the potentially interrelated effects of task and relationship conflict may provide further insight into the psychology of conflict itself.</p>
<p>The fact that people in organizational settings fill an “agent” or representative role also means that most organization members, and especially managers, frequently find themselves in the position of making decisions on others’ behalf. Organizational psychology may therefore provide insight into the psychology of decision-making by exploring how decision-making differs depending upon whether decisions are made for oneself or for others. For example, prior research on choice overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2041386611428501">Iyengar &amp; Lepper, 2000</xref>) suggests that people may prefer to have fewer alternatives rather than many options because having many choices increases their sense of responsibility over the choice they make, which may lead them to blame themselves for a choice they regret. Recent research in organizational psychology suggests, however, that choice overload may not apply to instances in which people make choices for others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2041386611428501">Polman (in press)</xref> theorized that being offered many options is demotivating for people making decisions on their own behalf because having numerous options when choosing for oneself elicits prevention focus, in which people are motivated to avoid losses and focus their attention on the possibility of unfavorable outcomes. In contrast, when people make choices for others, having many alternatives elicits promotion focus, in which people are motivated to seek gains and thus what is salient to them is the possibility of favorable outcomes. While feeling personally responsible for unfavorable outcomes is aversive, personal responsibility for favorable outcomes is quite pleasurable, suggesting that people making decisions on others’ behalf will not exhibit choice overload. This line of research is just one example of how organizational psychology, by leveraging the fact that organizations involve decision-making on others’ behalf, may extend research on the psychology of choice derived from nonorganizational settings.</p>
<p>The aforementioned distinctive features of organizations (presence of hierarchy, repeated interactions, and acting on behalf of others) are certainly not an exhaustive list. Other distinguishing aspects of organizations potentially suggest a path to developing theory that may inform more basic research. For example, organizations are goal-directed with weighty and tangible rewards and incentives for all parties, creating a situation in which extrinsic motivators may be viewed as symbolic of individuals’ competence, and therefore less autonomy-reducing. If so, extrinsic motivators in organizational settings may be less likely to attenuate intrinsic motivation, enabling a reconsideration of theory regarding how intrinsic and extrinsic motivation combine (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2041386611428501">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). Organizations also tend to be relatively more socially diverse than other social entities (e.g., families, communities, and voluntary groups) because competitive and social pressures prioritize task accomplishment, enabling diversity to flourish more than when homophily is prioritized. The prevalence of diversity, in turn, may create opportunities to more fully understand how diversity influences social dynamics and intrapersonal processes. Whatever distinctive feature of organizations an organizational psychologist chooses to focus on, the challenge/opportunity is to articulate how, when and why that particular distinctive feature refines, extends, or otherwise “gives back” to our understanding of more basic theoretical matters.</p>
<p>Applied organizational psychology also differs from basic psychology in several other ways, some of which may serve as a platform for organizational psychology to contribute to theory in the discipline. For example, organizational psychology is inherently <italic>situated </italic>in a particular context—the organizational context—which enables organizational psychologists to identify hidden assumptions that are built into existing theory. Before, we mentioned a paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2041386611428501">Brockner and Wiesenfeld (1996)</xref> which summarized and integrated a wide set of theoretical perspectives on the psychology of justice suggesting that process fairness and outcome fairness (or favorability) interact to influence employees’ support for decisions, decision-makers, and organizations. One way to describe this process/outcome interaction is that high process fairness reduces the effect of outcome fairness on employees’ support for decisions, decision-makers, and organizations, relative to when process fairness is low. A hidden assumption in this research, however, is that decision recipients occupy positions of lower status than those of decision-makers. The motivations salient to interaction partners are likely to be strongly associated with their status relations; specifically, lower status parties interacting with higher status decision-makers may be particularly concerned about their vulnerability, and thus use fairness information as an indicator of how much they can trust decision-making authorities. As long as process fairness is relatively high, lower status people feel trusting of the decision-making authority, thereby reducing the effect of outcome fairness on employees’ support. However, if we recognize this limiting assumption it becomes clear that different motivations may be salient when interacting partners are of equal status or when decision recipients are higher in status than the decision-makers.</p>
<p>Exploring this question, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2041386611428501">Chen, Brockner, and Greenberg (2003)</xref> theorized that among those with higher status, the primary motivation may be to retain their existing, favorable status relationship rather than to evaluate the extent to which the other party may be trusted. As a result, instead of high process fairness reducing the effect of outcome fairness, which was found when participants were of relatively low status, high process fairness was expected to heighten the influence of outcome fairness on participants’ support. That is, high process fairness accompanying a fair outcome affirms people’s high status, whereas high process fairness accompanying an unfair outcome threatens people’s high status. For interaction partners of equal status, neither concern about vulnerability and trust nor concern about maintaining the status quo are as salient, suggesting that they may respond to fairness information in a more straightforward, additive manner. Thus, they may exhibit two main effects rather than the interactive relationship between outcome and process expected for different-status partners. Conducting several studies in negotiation settings in which these different status relations could be represented, Chen et al. demonstrated support for exactly these predictions, thus providing insight into the way that fairness information is interpreted differently for those in different status relationships.</p>
<p>The situated nature of organizational psychology also allows organizational psychologists to more easily bridge multiple disciplines to advance theory. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2041386611428501">Aime, Van Dyne, and Petrenko (2011)</xref> draw upon research in the field of sociology on social networks to highlight the previously neglected contextual factors that shape role innovation behaviors. For example, they suggest that many instances of role innovation (or its absence) that have been attributed to role occupants’ motivations and initiative may actually be a function of their position in the social structure and thus attributable to the context rather than the individual. Their work implies that integrating psychological and sociological theory may advance theory in both disciplines. The salience of context (e.g., in the form of social structure) that is essential to organizational psychology motivates such integration.</p>
<p>In sum, good theory in organizational psychology explains why an important relationship exists or a phenomenon occurs, and does so in interesting and creative ways. Moreover, good theory in organizational psychology is not merely the effective application of existing theory in the basic disciplines to the organizational context. It can and should include conceptual work that elaborates and extends basic research. We have suggested that an important starting point for thinking about how research in organizational psychology may advance more basic theory is by identifying important distinguishing features of organizations, and then by thinking through the implications of these distinguishing features for more basic psychological processes. Along the way, such efforts are likely to expose and call into question taken-for-granted assumptions of our more basic theories, and thereby open up new pathways for consideration.</p>
