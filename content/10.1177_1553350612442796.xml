<abstract>
<p>The authors report the results of a multicenter prospective study evaluating a novel technology: dermal suture using absorbable staples composed of polylactic and polyglycolic acids. From January to June 2009, 59 dermal sutures were performed with Insorb absorbable staples and 41 with absorbable thread. All patients in the study underwent abdominal dermolipectomy (N = 65) or surgery for breast hypertrophy (N = 35). The purpose of the study was to compare the closure time and healing quality obtained with the 2 methods. Ninety-five patients were reexamined by the surgeon after 1 year of follow-up to assess scar width, suppleness, inflammation, and hypertrophy. The overall results were good and quite similar for the 2 groups. Thus, the use of Insorb staples reduced closure time while ensuring good healing quality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The quality of skin suture is fundamental for all types of surgery, but especially for plastic surgery. The length of the procedure required for satisfactory skin closure entails a “time cost” that is difficult to reduce. However, a novel method of skin suture using Insorb (Incisive Surgical, Inc, Plymouth, MN) absorbable subcuticular staples, allowing more rapid closure than with conventional techniques providing equivalent healing quality, has recently been marketed. We performed a multicenter prospective study to evaluate the facility of use, time saving, and healing results at 1 year obtained with this technology as compared with classical closure techniques using absorbable thread.</p>

<sec id="section2-1553350612442796">
<title>Description of the Insorb Stapler</title>
<p>The Insorb staple, composed of 70% polylactic acid (PLA) and 30% polyglycolic acid (PGA), is totally absorbable by a hydrolytic process. The inversion of the PLA/PGA ratio, as compared with that of braided absorbable threads Vicryl (Ethicon Inc, Cornelia, GA) using the same materials, limits inflammatory absorption considerably while providing good mechanical resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612442796">1</xref></sup> (60% at 7 days and 40% at 15 days). A stapler is used to position the staple parallel to the skin edges. Initially, a double Adson forceps is applied to close up the edges and facilitate staple placement. The forceps also allow optimal performance of the procedure by a single operator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612442796">Figure 1</xref>). The 2 skin edges are grasped equidistantly (around 2 mm) and then lifted upward to allow good positioning of the stapler (mating of the forceps with the stapler; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612442796">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612442796">B</xref>). The methodology is quite simple, but requires a good understanding of the mechanism. Wound closure with staples is characterized initially by an eversion of the suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612442796">Figure 3A</xref>), which is more marked than that usually occurring after closure with thread. This effect is transient, reverting to normal within 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612442796">Figure 3B</xref>). An additional intradermal stitch can be performed quite easily and rapidly if the alignment of the skin edges is not satisfactory. Some surgeons add only sterile adhesive skin sutures Stéri-strip (3M, Inc, St Paul, MN). Ultimately, the healing result will be at least equivalent to that obtained with conventional closure methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612442796">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>This nonrandomized observational prospective multicenter study includes all patients from January to June 2009 who had skin suture (staples or thread) during anterior abdominal dermolipectomy or surgery for breast hypertrophy as performed by 7 operators in 7 different centers (4 public and 3 private; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612442796">Table 1</xref>). The operators were requested not to modify their usual procedure, except for replacement of absorbable thread with Insorb staples during subcutaneous closure (dermal stitches). For each operator, the first 2 patients receiving staples were considered as constituting a learning curve and therefore excluded from the study.</p>

<p>For each patient included, the length of the suture to be performed was noted, as well as the times required for the different closure phases (deep, subcuticular, and additional). For breast hypertrophy, only the horizontal submammary suture was taken into account. Likewise, each operator evaluated the facility of use and handling of the stapler, according notes ranging from 0 (<italic>very difficult to handle</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very easy to handle</italic>). Finally, at 1 year of follow-up, healing quality was evaluated by the surgeon according to the degree of swelling and inflammation/hypertrophy, with scores ranging from 0 (<italic>very poor result</italic>) to 5 (<italic>excellent result</italic>), and by the patient, with scores ranging from 0 (<italic>very poor result</italic>) to 10 (<italic>excellent result</italic>).</p>

<p>The time required for deep closure at the level of the superficial fascia in abdominal dermolipectomy could only be measured for the patients (14%) who had this suture. Closure time for additional suture ranged from 1 to 3 minutes according to the choice of the surgeon: Stéri-strip type sterile adhesive skin sutures (52%), stitching with absorbable thread (35.5%), or Dermabond (Ethicon Inc, Cornelia, GA) type liquid skin adhesive (12.5%). However, as the deep and additional closure phases were independent of the subcuticular phase, the results were not taken into account in our comparison of sutures performed with staples or thread.</p>
<p>All operators considered the stapler to be easy to handle (mean 4.3, range 4-5). Ninety-five patients (the 5 others were unaccounted for) were reexamined for healing evaluation at 1 year of follow-up. Five of 59 stapled patients (8.5%) had an early postoperative extrusion (sometimes inflammatory) of the staples, probably because of too superficial positioning, which had no clinical consequences and did not cause any healing problems.</p>
<p>The overall results were good and not different for the 2 groups by the surgeons and by the patients (Wilcoxon signed rank test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05):</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although remarkable progress has been made with skin sutures in all surgical specialties, resulting in a considerable reduction of requests for postoperative scar improvement in plastic surgery, there is still a need to reduce the supposedly incompressible time required for performance of a quality closure.</p>
<p>The evaluation of Insorb staples in pharmaco-economic terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612442796">2</xref></sup> has shown that the added cost of the material can be more than compensated by the reduced time per act for use of the operating room, thereby increasing the number of acts performed per work session.</p>
<p>The evaluation of this type of staple in experimental terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612442796">1</xref></sup> has shown that the absorption phase is less inflammatory than with other materials used and that the infection rate is lower. No other comparative study of staples versus thread has been conducted clinically, but experience with the Insorb stapler reported for another surgical specialty emphasized facility of use, rapidity of closure, and comfort for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612442796">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study clearly shows that the use of staples reduces skin closure time 5-fold on average. For purposes of consistency, we studied 2 types of operations common in plastic surgery. We have used staples for other types of surgery (bodylift, cruroplasty, brachioplasty, removal of a latissimus dorsi muscle flap) not included in this study.</p>
<p>The advantage of using Insorb staples seems to vary, depending on the type of operation. Skin closure in abdominal dermolipectomy is ideal since the 2 edges to be sutured have approximately the same length and tension is slight. These features make this operation the best choice for learning how to use this novel material. However, in some cases staples do not appear to be preferable, for example, when there is marked tension between the 2 edges that cannot be controlled as it could be with a slipknot or when the skin is too thin to allow good positioning of the stapler. However, if the 2 edges are not of the same length, it is possible to make a little fold, as when using thread. When the 2 edges are of different thicknesses (which is the case for horizontal sutures in breast surgery), it is necessary to make an asymmetric grasp with the double Adson forceps, that is, less application on the thicker edge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350612442796" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although the ultimate result for a surgical scar is multifactorial, the good initial quality of a skin suture, especially at the dermal level, is an essential prerequisite. This surgical act can be time consuming in terms of use of the operating room, but our study indicates that there is a definite reduction of closure time through the use of Insorb staples, at least in the 2 types of operations investigated, both of which are common in plastic surgery.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found this stapler easy to use, providing an evident savings of time, while ensuring healing quality equivalent or better than that observed for conventional sutures performed with thread. However, our analysis would benefit from the inclusion of a greater number of patients.</p>
