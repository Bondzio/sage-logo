<p><bold>About KOP:</bold> The Kenya Orthopaedic Project (KOP) is a non-profit making charity which seeks to work collaboratively with government orthopaedic institutions in Kenya. We aim to enhance existing services through sharing knowledge and skills. Teaching and training, rehabilitation, follow-up and audit of practice are all vital elements of KOPs progression.</p>
<p><bold>Why is KOP needed?</bold> In Kenya, many patients with traumatic injuries cannot afford treatment and are left with permanent pain and disability. Skills in orthopaedic surgery and limb reconstruction are sparse within the government sector in Kenya. This has led to an inequality in trauma care provision. Few charities offer orthopaedic and trauma care in the developing world due to difficulty funding and transporting equipment and implants.</p>
<p><bold>What does KOP do?</bold> Each mission contains a volunteer multidisciplinary UK trauma team providing free treatment for needy patients identified by local colleagues. We encourage the transfer of knowledge and skills through teaching and learning opportunities for local surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and physiotherapy colleagues.</p>
<p><bold>Future of KOP:</bold> We always audit ourselves to evaluate how effective our missions have been and what we can do to improve the subsequent missions. Whilst KOP missions are only able to help a small proportion of patients requiring trauma care, the impact to the lives of those treated is great. To help a wider population, future visits will see increasing focus on working with local healthcare professionals to provide tailored teaching programmes to suit local needs.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> This complete audit cycle has assessed cases that were correctly alerted into Birmingham Heartland’s ED as a trauma alert before and after the creation of pre-hospital alert criteria for Trauma Team activation (TTA), and also assesses the attendance of each member of the trauma team at each alert.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients eligible for entry to TARN were identified from a locally kept database to identify alert cases arriving into the ED which qualified for Trauma Team assembly. The pre-hospital alert criteria went live in BHH on 27/07/11. All trauma cases between 01/01/11–26/07/11 were compared with those from 27/07/11– 31/10/11. Cases which qualified for a TTA were audited to assess whether the trauma team was alerted, and the presence of General Surgery, Anaesthetics and Trauma and Orthopaedic’s (T&amp;O) was also audited. All information was gathered from ED documents. The standard used was that 100% of cases qualifying for a TTA should be alerted as such.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Pre-27/07/11, only 16% of cases (7 of 44) qualifying for a TTA were correctly alerted into the ED. After the initiation of the TARN criteria, 40% were appropriately alerted. An improvement in the immediate attendance of trauma team members was also noted: Anaesthetics improved from 85% to 100%, T&amp;O improved from 29% to 100% and General Surgery remained static (57% to 60%).</p>

<p>Department of Health guidelines for best practice treatment of neck of femur (NOF) fractures stresses the importance of adequate preoperative hydration and nutrition. We present a completed audit cycle looking at our compliance to the following audit standards: All patients should be starved for 2 hours for oral fluids; 6 hours for oral solids; should receive maintenance intravenous fluid; patients should not be postponed unless medically unfit.</p>
<p>2007 audit of 144 consecutive trauma cases, including, showed the most vulnerable group, 59 NOF fractures, oral fluid mean starvation time was 5 hours (range from 2 to 14 hours) Oral solids starvation mean was 11 hours (range from 6 to 20 hours). 29% received no IV fluid during starvation. 43% of patients had at least one postponement. Evening lists were introduced twice per week, providing a further 8 hours of operating time. Staff were encouraged to prescribe IV fluid and breakfast was provided for evening list patients. The 2010 audit of 43 cases showed no change. Increased operating time has lead to no improvement in preoperative starvation times, intravenous fluid prescription and postponement for neck of femur fracture patients.The postponements improved in all other injury groups.</p>

<p>The establishment of major trauma centres enables rapid treatment of severely injured patients with onsite imaging, input from a range of trauma specialties, and rapid access to emergency theatres. The secondary survey is a systematic full body examination of the patient to identify and treat injuries after establishment of initial resuscitation in the primary survey. The aim of this audit was to assess completion of the secondary survey in trauma patients at a major trauma centre, St George’s Hospital, London. The gold standard set for this audit was the guidelines for completion of the secondary survey in the seventh edition of the ATLS manual. Data was retrospectively analysed for all major trauma patients admitted to St George’s Hospital between July and August 2011 (n = 144). After implementation of the recommended changes at the local trauma clinical governance meeting, the audit was repeated for the period October to November 2011 (n = 107). The initial audit identified significant deficiencies in completion of all areas of the secondary survey. Recommendations for improvement included posters with secondary survey guidelines in the examination bays, designating the Orthopaedic SHO to complete the secondary survey, ensuring all doctors attending trauma calls were ATLS certified, and case based discussion with feedback at the end of every trauma call. Following implementation of the recommendations, completion of the secondary survey in trauma patients improved.</p>

<p>Department of Emergency Medicine, Manchester Royal Infirmary Foundation Trust, Oxford Road, Manchester</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Previous studies regarding the effect of pre-injury warfarin use on mortality in trauma patients have produced conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the effect and magnitude of effect of pre-injury warfarin on trauma patients.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Studies comparing all trauma patients (nb. not head injury patients only) on pre-injury warfarin to all trauma patients not on <italic>pre-injury</italic> warfarin were included in the meta-analysis. The search was performed using Medline via the Pubmed interface; no limits were placed on the language. The key words <italic>Trauma</italic> AND <italic>Warfarin</italic> were used. A second search was performed using the key words <italic>Trauma</italic> AND <italic>Anticoagulation</italic> AND <italic>Mortality.</italic></p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Ten papers were found to be suitable for the meta-analysis. There were two case control studies and eight retrospective cohort (nested case control) studies. Significant heterogeneity was present as measured by the Q test (Q value = 126.366, df = 9, p = 0.000) and also the I<sup>2</sup> test (I<sup>2</sup> = 92.878). Heterogeneity was predominantly due to the great variation in the size of the cohort studies. The preferred model for this meta-analysis was considered to be the Fixed effect model which produced a common OR 1.952 (95% CI; 1.888 – 2.018, p = 0.000).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results of this meta-analysis show that pre-injury warfarin does increase mortality in trauma patients by an odds ratio of nearly two.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck or ‘‘Boxer’s fracture’’ commonly results from axial loads applied to a clenched fist. The weakest point is the extra-articular neck, which is commonly treated conservatively. In our institution the current practice is to refer those patients to Fracture Clinic. The audit aims to assess if the referral changes management.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> We looked at 6 months data retrospectively. A total of 36 patients were seen in the Emergecny Department (ED), with 35 referred to Fracture Clinic. Our local computer system was used for x-rays, ED and fracture clinic letters. Fracture assessment included angulation (50°), rotational deformity and whether it was an open injury. Also grade of examining health professional in Fracture Clinic has been recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 97% of patients have been seen by registrar level or above. All injuries were closed, with no angulation &gt;50° or rotational deformity. All patients were treated by neighbour strapping for 1–2 weeks and given advice regarding subsequent mobilisation. There were no instances of change of management with attendance at fracture clinic. 60% were discharged at first appointment. Each Fracture Clinic attendance costs just over £350.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients with fifth metacarpal neck fractures should be managed in the emergency department through an agreed pathway, unless they have rotational deformity, are open or angled beyond 50 degrees in which case they should be referred to the fracture clinic or on call orthopaedic team as appropriate. This will not only provide significant cost saving, but also avoid an unnecessary attendance at Fracture Clinic.</p>

<p>Trafford General Hospital, Manchester</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Introduction</bold>: Coagulopathy is a recognised complication of severe head injury and also a risk factor for increased mortality in patients with blunt head trauma. The impact of coagulopathy on intracranial haemorrhage progression (intracerebral or extracerebral) has not been fully evaluated.</p>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the risk of haematoma progression in patients with coagulopathy with isolated blunt head trauma.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A Medline search was performed via the Pubmed interface. The search strategy was performed using the words <italic>head injury AND clotting.</italic> This produced 1054 citations of which 121 abstracts were reviewed for relevance. Forty-six full papers were reviewed of which six papers were included. Cross-referencing produced two further studies. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using Stata v11 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) to account for study heterogeneity. Forest and Funnel plots were generated to evaluate effect size and bias respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Eight studies were identified as being suitable for the meta-analysis. Significant heterogeneity was present between the studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 69.1%). Heterogeneity was due to differences in the study sizes and inclusion criteria. The random effects model produced a pooled relative risk of 2.62 (95% CI: 1.69, 4.05). The Funnel plot did not demonstrate bias.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This meta-analysis has demonstrated that coagulopathy is a statistically important risk factor for haematoma progression in patients with traumatic intracranial haemorrhage.</p>

<p><bold>Open lower limb fractures: Are we up to standard?</bold></p>
<p><bold>S Barkley* and NM Shaath</bold></p>
<p>Barnsley District General Hospital</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The guidelines for open lower limb fractures stipulate standards for initial assessment, wound management, splintage, antibiotics, and transfer to a tertiary centre for combined orthopaedic and plastic care. No surgical intervention should be performed excepting certain circumstances. Regional tertiary centre data shows these guidelines are not always followed in district general hospitals. We wanted to see if our patients are being managed appropriately.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The notes of all patients admitted with an open lower limb fracture between September 2009 and January 2011 were reviewed. Twelve standards were identified from the guidelines, which needed 100% compliance.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> All fractures were splinted with prior neurovascular assessment. Most patients received correct antibiotics within 3 hours of injury. All patients received pre-operative antibiotics, although not the ones recommended. The senior trauma consultant identified ten patients (after radiograph review) requiring referral for specialist management. Only 50% were. All were debrided prior to transfer.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our initial open fracture management is adequate in most patients, although some aspects can be improved. Our antibiotic policy needs updating to incorporate the guidelines and circulated amongst clinical staff. Half of patients who should have been referred were not, and those who were had debridement first, which is not recommended. However, some patients were debrided based on tertiary centre advice. Our open fracture management needs improving, by departmental education and re-auditing, and better communication with tertiary centres.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Blunt chest trauma accounts for over 15% of all trauma admissions to Emergency Departments in the UK and has high reported morbidity and mortality rates. Reported risk factors for mortality in blunt chest wall trauma include patient age, pre-existing morbidity and three or more rib fractures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether isolated blunt chest wall trauma patients with COPD had higher rates of mortality and ICU admission than those without COPD.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective study was completed in which the notes of 1056 blunt chest wall trauma patients’ who presented in2010 to the ED a large Regional Trauma Centre in Wales were examined. Data were recorded for each of the patients including demographic and several dependent and independent variables. Patients were grouped according to presence of COPD. Pearson’s chi square analyses were performed to determine if any differences existed between the two groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There was no significant difference in patient age or severity of injury between the two groups. Mortality and ICU admission rates were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the isolated blunt chest wall trauma patients with COPD.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Isolated blunt chest wall trauma patients have a significantly higher rate of mortality and ICU admissions if they have COPD than those with no history of COPD.</p>

<sec id="sec21-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Helicopter based pre-hospital trauma care has been in use within the military (and civilian) setting for many years. This literature review aims to explore current evidence with regard to which skills are required by an attending helicopter based, military pre-hospital medical emergency response team (MERT), and who is best placed to provide those skills?</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A comprehensive review of current literature incorporating electronic (MEDLINE, BNI, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed) and paper journals published in the past 5 years was conducted.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-five articles were identified and studied in detail; fourteen were most relevant to the clinical questions. Evidence ranged from cohort studies to editorial and literature reviews. Internal audit data from recent UK military operations is also included. Profession specific skills are highlighted. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is the most frequently identified skill in the literature, other skills include advanced life support (ALS), surgical airway, analgesia, and advanced vascular access. The role of a doctor is quantified with skills such as in-flight diagnostics, senior supervision, instigation of ‘right turn resus’, and the provision of command and control. Paediatric demands on MERT and possible areas of additional training are also identified.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Published literature continues to support the role of a doctor within helicopter platforms. Some interventions currently delivered are profession specific. Literature to help guide exact crew composition appears to be minimal. Continuing research is required into which interventions are associated with improved outcome, and who is best placed to deliver them.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Hands are particularly vulnerable during DIY tasks<bold>.</bold> In an economic climate lending itself to increased DIY activity, this has never been more relevant to emergency medicine and reconstructive surgery. To date there is a distinct lack of understanding of the behaviours leading to such injury.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 1806 cases of domestically sustained hand injuries from power tool use were identified on the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) Home and Leisure Accident (HASS/LASS) database. From this, demographic, outcome and behavioural analyses were carried out.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 51.4% of hand injuries had a behavioural root cause; most commonly atypical positioning (20.4%), complacency (16.4%), and distraction/inattention (10.1%). The elderly age bracket required the highest provision of care, a significant finding considering an ageing population.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study showed that the majority of hand injuries are avoidable, in that they have a behavioural root cause. This Insight opens doors for specific preventative strategies to be developed.</p>

<sec id="sec25-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> This is the first European prospective study of more than six thousand eight hundred patients at Queens Hospital NHS Trust, Burton on Trent, collected prospectively from November 2007. We separated orthopaedic trauma (5936 patients) from head, chest and spine injury (902 patients) with combined total of 6838.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The total number of orthopaedic trauma cases increased from 1134 in 2008 to 1671 in 2011. There was a peak in June and July of each year with exception in 2010, when there was another peak in winter due to snow and ice. There were variations in case presentation and case mix. Age of the patients range from 2 months to 106 years. Although the majority of admissions are hip injuries with 1419 patients (1020 hip fractures). Other common injuries were ankle (701), knee (604), wrist (593) and hand (533). About 64 % patients were operated with in one day of injury and 80 % within three days. Majority (75 %) of the patients were operated during the week between 9 am and 5 pm, 18 % over the weekend between 9 am and 5 pm while 7 % were operated after 5 pm. Average length of stay was 11.3 days ranging from 1 day for upper limb injuries to 28.5 days for femoral fractures. Overall complication rate was 5% for both operative and non-operative management. Number of patients with neck of femur fractures has increased from 228 (2008) to 293 (2010). The time to surgery was reduced from an average of 22 hours in 2009 to 18 hours in 2011. Hospital stay for hip fracture patients fell from an average of 32 days (2008) to 16 days (2011).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study allows analysis of particular groups; provide information about trends of admissions, type of injury, time to surgery etc., most importantly about the morbidity and mortality outcomes, especially for the fractured neck of femur. The outcomes from the data have helped in the implementation of allocation of resources and service improvement for the trauma patients. To our knowledge there has been no prospective study of this nature in the European literature.</p>

<p>Lister Hospital, Stevenage</p></sec>
<sec id="sec27-1460408612458744"><title/>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Research has shown consent is poorly obtained in the trauma setting. By better consenting patients doctors fulfil their ethical obligations to properly inform patients of their treatment, and increase patient satisfaction and decrease litigation cases against hospitals.</p>
<p><bold>Aims:</bold> The East and North Herts’ Trust came close to the bottom 20% of Trusts in the National Patient Survey in regards to all aspects of consent for operative procedures. We hoped to improve these figures by increasing the standard of obtaining consent in trauma patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The consent forms of all orthopaedic trauma inpatients from 31/10/2011–04/11/2011 were reviewed. We noted: legibility; the grade doctor who completed the form; whether the patient received their copy; whether any supplementary information was given. Afterwards we introduced teaching, provided one-page guidelines on consent on the hospital intranet, and supplied supplementary written information in the trauma setting. We re-audited all orthopaedic trauma inpatients between 05/12/2011–09/12/2011.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We reviewed 42 consent forms and found 22 (52%) were illegible, 36 (86%) were completed by an SHO, and in 42 (100%) neither the patient copy nor any supplementary information was given. After implementation of our recommendations to improve the consenting, we reviewed 29 consent forms. We found that 10 (34%) forms were illegible, 24 (83%) were filled in by a SHO, and 29 (100%) patients were given their copy of the form, with 6 (21%) given additional written information.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> We showed simple measures, including increased teaching on consent and making available short aide-mémoires available, increases the standard of obtaining consent in the trauma setting.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Motorbike racing is considered by many to be a dangerous sport but there is little data within the literature to support this view point. The objective of this study was to determine injury severity scores (ISS) for injured riders to assess injury severity.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Injury data was prospectively collected from all riders who attended the circuit medical centres at all rounds of the 2011 British Superbike Season. An Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were calculated for each rider and recorded along with other rider demographics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 259 riders presented to the circuit medical centres with injuries during the 2011 season. They suffered 382 injuries between them. There was one fatality. The average ISS was 3.3 (range 1–48). 0.27% of riders competing during the 2011 series required acute hospital treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The majority of riders with injuries had an with ISS ≤8 which is likely related to the high degree of protective clothing worn and safety measures at circuits including air fencing. The ISS scores presented here for motorbike racing are less than or comparable with those seen in other physical sports such as elite level horse riding.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Investigation of coagulopathy in trauma currently revolves around the use of traditional lab-based methods; however, drawbacks of this method include a long waiting time and sub-optimal management of the condition by means of blood product wastage and the increased incidence of transfusion injury. Thromboelastography (TEG) has recently been implicated for use in the context of trauma. In the present study we aim to ascertain the use and knowledge of TEG in South London EDs.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> ED registrars from across South London were surveyed using a written structured survey ascertaining method of investigation and assessing knowledge of TEG. Data was analysed with respect to registrar grade, location (South East versus South West) and ED type (major trauma centre versus trauma unit).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 66% (n = 20) questionnaires were completed, of which 95% (n=19) indicated that traditional lab-based methods were in use. Between 5–10% (n = 1 to 2) of registrars had “good” (&gt;66% of responses correct) knowledge of the indications of, information gained from, and advantages of TEG, and 15% (n = 3) correctly identified the relevant clinical scenario from the sample thromboelastographs. No significant differences were observed between type and location of ED, however there was a slight trend towards better knowledge in the lower-grade doctors.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Knowledge of TEG in EDs is poor and constrained by a limited evidence base and consequent lack of training. Lack of usage may stem from cost of implementation. We recommend further clinical trials and a cost-benefit analysis to ascertain the practicalities of TEG and widen the evidence base.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Injuries are a neglected epidemic with over 90% of injury deaths occurring in low income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612458744">Gosselin et al., 2009</xref>). Despite this, expensive surgeries and challenges of sourcing and transporting heavy equipment means few western charities offer trauma and orthopaedic care in the developing world. The Kenya Orthopaedic Project (KOP), a charitable group, undertakes trips to Kenya providing trauma care to patients that would otherwise not have access to this treatment, aiming to improving pain and disability.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> For each mission, a multidisciplinary UK trauma team, equipped with large quantities of surgical equipment, were hosted by a Kenyan hospital. Working alongside local staff, outpatient clinics, surgical procedures, teaching sessions and twelve week clinical follow-ups were performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Four one-week trips were completed at two sites, Mombasa and Nanyuki. 13 patients were lost to follow up and only two patients developed post-operative infections. Seven patients, all of whom had not received physiotherapy following departure from KOP, were progressing poorly with range of joint movement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612458744">Figure 1</xref> details the 92 trauma cases.

</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> KOP data shows that 10% of patients develop a complication post-operatively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408612458744">Table 1</xref>). This is low compared to with UK neck of femur complication rates (20%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612458744">Goldacre et al., 2002</xref>). This demonstrates that trauma missions to the developing world can make a significant difference to patients’ lives. Through well designed charity projects, complication rates are within UK national guidelines. Following the results of non-surgical complications, KOP is aiming to improve through increased education of patients and local staff.
