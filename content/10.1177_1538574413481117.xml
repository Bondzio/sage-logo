<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the aging US population and improved survival from nonrenal diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), a larger group of patients with renal disease have emerged. The prevalence of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has soared more than 10-fold from a mere 47 982 in 1983 to a 283 527 by 2008. The current incidence is calculated from 351/million people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413481117">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Consequently, with the improved life expectancy of patients with renal disease, successful vascular access creation has become paramount. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services implemented the “Fistula First” initiative to increase the number of fistulas placed, as opposed to arteriovenous (AV) grafts and dialysis catheters. Its goal was to have fistulas placed in at least half of all new patients who underwent hemodialysis and to have a minimum of 66% of all existing patients who continue dialysis to use a fistula.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413481117">2</xref>
</sup> Although this movement is both groundbreaking and necessary to prevent catheter-based infections and ultimately morbidity and mortality, there remains a subset of patients with ESRD who have exhausted all possibilities of utilizing a fistula or an AV graft.</p>
<p>Central venous occlusive disease (CVOD) is the greatest impediment to creating a functional AV fistula or graft, and ultimately these patients are left with no options for hemodialysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413481117">3</xref>
</sup> They may have attempted peritoneal dialysis but had the complications of peritonitis, or their occlusive venous disease may severely impede outflow of a graft or fistula. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new type of vascular access device called the hemodialysis reliable outflow (HeRO) graft (Hemosphere, Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota). This device is a hybrid AV graft and dialysis catheter that has so far shown some promise in a population with no other options. This study evaluates the outcomes of HeRO placement in a series of patients with CVOD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574413481117" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis was performed in all patients with HeRO graftfrom implant of the graft until the last follow-up at 2 centers from September 2009 to November 2010.</p>
<p>Data were collected on race, gender, age, date of HeRO implantation, date of interventions, history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), CAD, etiology of renal failure, smoking history, approximate number of dialysis accesses prior to the HeRO, number of years on dialysis, and previous episodes of bacteremia.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574413481117">
<title>Patency</title>
<p>Primary patency was defined as the interval following the implant until the first intervention. Secondary patency was defined as the interval after any intervention until the access was surgically declotted or revised to maintain function. Functional patency was defined as the length of time the access was successfully used for dialysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574413481117">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous measures and frequencies for categorical measures, were generated.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574413481117">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 11 patients underwent 12 HeRO graft implants at 2 institutions. There were 10 males and 1 female, and the mean age of the series was 52.0 ± 17.1 (29-87). All of the patients had CVOD to varying extents, including subclavian vein stenosis or occlusion, innominate vein stenosis, and superior vena cava stenosis. Most of the patients were African American (72.7%, 8 of 11) and had HTN as the primary etiology of their ESRD. The average duration of dialysis prior to HeRO graft placement was 5.55 ± 3.6 years, with a range of 0.5 to 10 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574413481117">Table 1</xref>). Mean follow-up time was 277 ± 245 days (6-730).</p>

<p>All of these patients had multiple vascular accesses (catheters and AV fistulas or grafts) placed prior to the HeRO, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of &gt;14. Only 3 patients had a history of bacteremia, leading to removal of their access prior to HeRO placement.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis reliable outflow device primary patency at 3 months was 54.5% and secondary patency was 81.8% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574413481117">Table 2</xref>). At 1 year, primary and secondary patencies were 9.1% and 45.5%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413481117">Figure 1</xref>). A mean of 1.5 ± 2.8 interventions were performed. The most common reasons for HeRO graft interventions or explants were thrombosis and bacteremia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574413481117">Table 3</xref>). At 1 year, there were 5 patent HeRO grafts. Four HeRO grafts were never cannulated, and the remaining 11 had a functional patency of 14 ± 3 months (2-20). In the most recent follow-up beyond 1 year, 3 HeRO grafts remain patent, and another patient received a new graft implant after failure of the first.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The HeRO device is reportedly a superior option to dialysis catheters as it allows for flow rates comparable to AV grafts, it has lower rates of infections and bacteremia, and additionally, it has the capability of overcoming the devastating manifestation of CVOD after multiple prior accesses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413481117">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In our study, the HeRO device demonstrated patency rates that were much lower than the series published by Katzman et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413481117">4</xref>
</sup> In that reported experience, 36 patients had a secondary patency of 72.2% at 8.6 months when compared to the present series of 54.5% at 6 months. Additionally, in our series, venous HTN played a role by creating significant upper extremity edema. Two of the patients required revision to make the graft segment more superficial, and one of these patients required stab phlebectomy in the upper extremity for extensive varicosities producing difficulty in cannulation. Our patients were comparatively younger (mean 52.0 years) versus 62.7 years,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413481117">4</xref>
</sup> which may be an indication for more accelerated and/or severe disease. There was similar mean dialysis duration of the patients at 5.1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413481117">4</xref>
</sup> years, when compared to our mean of 5.7 years.</p>
<p>The 2 most common comorbidities accounting for the incidence of ESRD are diabetes, at 44% of all incident cases, and HTN at 27.9% of all incident cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413481117">1</xref>
</sup> In our study, we found HTN to be the overwhelming cause of ESRD at 72.7%, with DM at 36.4% of the cases. Epidemiologic studies from 2005 demonstrate that the incidence rates of ESRD were highest in African Americans (991/million) versus Caucasians (268/million). Furthermore, Hispanics had a higher incidence than non-Hispanics (490 vs 337/million).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413481117">1</xref>
</sup> Although our study is small, the demographics reflect the trend of the US population, with 72.7% of our patients being African American and the remainder being Hispanic. Additionally, the literature has thoroughly documented the racial inequalities with respect to the accessibility and quality of health care for African American patients with chronic kidney disease. When compared to Caucasians, they are less likely to be under the care of a nephrologist, be referred for peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation, or have a fistula placed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413481117">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413481117">6</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, in a cross-sectional study of the 2005 Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services End-Stage Renal Disease Clinical Performance Measures Project for adult patients who underwent hemodialysis, African Americans were significantly more likely to be on long-term catheter use than Caucasians because all fistula/graft sites had been exhausted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413481117">7</xref>
</sup> The Katzman et al study population consisted of 50% Caucasians,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413481117">4</xref>
</sup> which may explain the high patency rates; this demographic may not be as “access challenged,” and close prospective follow-up may have precluded more HeRO graft failures.</p>
<p>Finally, all of our patients had radiographic documentation of CVOD. The patients in the Katzman et al study were described as having “peripheral or central venous stenosis.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413481117">4</xref>
</sup> This difference may suggest why the patients in our study had poorer patency rates, as their venous occlusive disease was more extensive.</p>
<p>Limitations of our study are the small sample size, and the data collection was retrospective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1538574413481117">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the HeRO access offers a more long-term option to patients with ESRD who have exhausted possibility of successful AV fistula or graft placement. Considering that this group of patients with CVOD is ultimately the most complex, it is no surprise that patency rates are much lower in comparison to AV grafts or fistulas. Yet, the data on this new device are still sparse, and larger studies with longer follow-up need to be performed. Ultimately, more information needs to be obtained on what factors may contribute to a greater success with the HeRO device.</p>
