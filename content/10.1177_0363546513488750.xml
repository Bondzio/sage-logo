<sec id="section1-0363546513488750">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Acromioclavicular (AC) joint separation is a common injury, usually affecting young adults. Controversy exists regarding whether to excise the distal clavicle when surgical intervention is required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513488750">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To evaluate the biomechanical strength of AC and coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction with and without concurrent distal clavicle excision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513488750">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513488750">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Nine matched pairs of cadaver shoulders were used. All shoulders were tested with intact CC and AC ligaments, and the ligaments were sectioned. For 1 shoulder in each pair, a 7-mm distal clavicle excision was performed. The contralateral distal clavicle was left intact. Single-tunnel CC ligament reconstruction was performed, and excess graft length was extended and secured across the AC joint to reconstruct the superior AC joint ligaments in all specimens. Specimens were then potted and cyclically loaded for 500 cycles in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior planes using an MTS Minibionix load frame to evaluate displacement across the AC joint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513488750">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Regarding the clavicle–intact reconstructed versus the intact state, there was significantly greater AC joint translation in the reconstructed state in the anterior-posterior (20.2 ± 7.0 mm vs 6.0 ± 1.5 mm; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and superior-inferior directions (12.3 ± 3.3 mm vs 4.2 ± 1.2 mm; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In the clavicle–excised reconstructed versus the intact state, there was also significantly greater translation in the reconstructed state in the anterior-posterior (21.7 ± 5.1 mm vs 8.9 ± 4.3 mm; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and superior-inferior directions (12.3 ± 6.1 mm vs 5.8 ± 3.1 mm; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). When the difference in translation between the reconstructed and intact groups in the clavicle-intact versus the clavicle-excised group was compared, no statistically significant difference was noted in anterior-posterior (14.2 ± 7.8 mm vs 12.8 ± 5.0 mm; <italic>P</italic> = .67) or superior-inferior translation (8.1 ± 2.9 mm vs 6.6 ± 3.9 mm; <italic>P</italic> = .39).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513488750">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Excision of the distal clavicle did not have a significant effect on anterior-posterior or superior-inferior motion at the AC joint following single-tunnel CC and AC ligament reconstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546513488750">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The study suggests that excision of the distal clavicle in this procedure is not associated with increased anterior-posterior or superior-inferior instability in this model.</p>

<p>Acromioclavicular (AC) joint separation is a common injury, usually affecting young adults. The most common mechanism of this injury is a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513488750">5</xref></sup> Depending on the force absorbed by the AC joint capsule and ligaments, injuries can range from mild to severe. Classically, type 1 and type 2 AC joint injuries are treated nonoperatively, and a majority of patients return to their preinjury level of sport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488750">11</xref></sup> Types 4 through 6 represent substantial disruption to the AC joint complex and typically are treated with surgical reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513488750">15</xref></sup> Treatment methods for type 3 injuries vary widely, including operative versus nonoperative methods and a wide range of surgical options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513488750">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488750">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513488750">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513488750">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513488750">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lateral clavicle resection is often included as one part of reconstruction for AC joint separations. Lateral clavicle resection was originally performed to prevent development of posttraumatic arthritis at the AC joint and osteolysis of the distal clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513488750">12</xref></sup> A clinical study reported that 85% to 100% of patients had good to excellent outcome after arthroscopic distal clavicle excision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488750">6</xref></sup> Kowalsky et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488750">9</xref></sup> found that distal clavicle excision may be performed safely during coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction without subjecting the graft to detrimental in situ forces. However, Dawson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513488750">4</xref></sup> speculated that resection of the distal clavicle and the resultant loss of the superior AC joint capsule have a detrimental effect on CC ligament reconstruction. Some patients have reported persistent pain and/or instability after distal clavicle excision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513488750">14</xref></sup> Excision of the distal clavicle may fail as a result of underresection or overresection, heterotopic ossification, postoperative stiffness, and postoperative infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488750">17</xref></sup> In a subset of young patients experiencing AC joint symptoms without radiographic evidence of AC joint arthritis or distal clavicle osteolysis, one study reported successful treatment with arthroscopy and debridement of the AC joint rather than distal clavicle excision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513488750">2</xref></sup> Distal clavicle excision in the setting of AC joint reconstruction has not been studied biomechanically.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that there would be no difference in translation at the reconstructed AC joint based on whether the clavicle was intact or excised. The purpose of this study was to compare anterior-posterior and superior-inferior translation of the reconstructed AC joint in a clavicle-intact versus a clavicle-excised model.</p>

<title>Specimen Preparation</title>
<p>Nine pairs of fresh-frozen cadaver shoulders were used in this study (mean age, 78 years; range, 50-95 years). Cadavers were thawed at room temperature overnight and then disarticulated at the glenohumeral joint. Shoulders were inspected visually for evidence of prior surgery, including arthroscopic portals in the skin. Each shoulder was then dissected free of soft tissues superficial to the ligaments; the coracoacromial ligament, the AC joint capsule and surrounding ligaments, and the CC ligaments were preserved. One side of each pair was randomly assigned to receive distal clavicle resection in conjunction with ligament reconstruction, and the contralateral side had ligament reconstruction without resection of the distal clavicle. The inferior aspect of each scapula was trimmed to fit into a stainless steel box. Three K-wires (1.6 mm) were placed, 2 along the lateral border and 1 along the medial border, all in the anterior-posterior direction. The scapula was then embedded in Durabond plaster of paris (DAP, Baltimore, Maryland) and allowed to set for 40 minutes.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513488750">
<title>Mechanical Testing</title>
<p>Specimens were mounted in an MTS Minibionix load frame (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). The clavicle was secured to the MTS actuator piston in 2 places via hose clamps. This setup allowed for the specimens to be mounted such that anterior-posterior or superior-inferior loading could be applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513488750">Figure 1</xref>). The specimens were then cyclically loaded for 500 cycles at a rate of 0.25 Hz. Anterior (clavicle displaced anteriorly relative to the scapula)–posterior loads were 70 N in the anterior direction and 25 N in the posterior direction. Superior-inferior loading was 70 N in the superior direction (clavicle relative to scapula) and 25 N in the inferior direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488750">11</xref></sup> Load and displacement data were recorded continuously at a rate of 10 Hz. Measurements were obtained with intact specimens and in specimens with AC joint reconstruction after simulated joint rupture. Total anterior-posterior and superior-inferior displacement was determined and compared between the intact and excision groups.</p>

<title>Surgical Reconstruction</title>
<p>Single-tunnel AC joint reconstruction was performed on all specimens by use of a technique described by Yoo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513488750">20</xref></sup>; the graft was anchored to the acromion as described by Grutter and Petersen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513488750">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513488750">Figure 2</xref>). Semitendinosus grafts harvested from other cadavers were stripped, and the tendons were cut to a length of 20 cm. This length preserved the tendinous portion of the graft and provided adequate length to perform the reconstruction. A nonlocked running whipstitch was then placed in each end of the graft by use of a No. 2 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey) suture. To simulate rupture of the joint, both the AC joint ligaments and the CC ligaments were sectioned, disarticulating the clavicle from the acromion. A 5.5-mm tunnel was drilled in the clavicle 2 cm from the distal end, slightly anterior to the midportion to recreate the insertion of the trapezoid ligament. To reduce the risk of fracture, this tunnel was created with a 2.0-mm drill bit followed by sequential increases in size by 1-mm to 1.5-mm increments. Two 3.5-mm tunnels were then drilled from medial to lateral in the acromion, starting with a 2.0-mm drill bit and increasing gradually. A bone bridge of at least 1 cm was maintained to avoid suture cut-through.</p>

</fig>
<p>Three No. 5 Ethibond (Ethicon) sutures for augmentation were passed from superior to inferior positions through the clavicular hole along with the semitendinosus graft. The graft and sutures were passed medially around the base of the coracoid with a wire loop suture passer (Arthrex, Naples, Florida). The AC joint was then reduced, and the reduction was held with a 2-mm K-wire. The augmentation sutures were then tied over the superior surface of the clavicle with a standard surgeon’s knot. The graft was then tied in a similar fashion, and a single No. 2 Ethibond suture was passed through the knot in a figure-of-8 fashion for reinforcement. The loop suture passer was then used to pass the augmentation sutures and the graft ends through the acromial drill holes, and these were sutured to themselves on the lateral aspect of the acromion. The reduction pin was then removed.</p>
<p>For specimens undergoing distal clavicle excision, the single-tunnel drill site was identified with the distal clavicle intact, and then a 7-mm distal clavicle resection was performed with a microsagittal saw (Stryker, Mahwah, New Jersey). The reconstruction was then performed in the same fashion described for the clavicle-intact model, with the 2-mm K-wire maintaining the reduction with a 7-mm gap between the clavicle and the acromion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We sought to evaluate the importance of the distal clavicular articulation in the setting of CC and AC ligament reconstruction by comparing stability in specimens with an intact distal clavicle versus specimens in which the distal clavicle was excised. Our findings of no significant difference between the groups suggest that the AC articulation itself contributes little stability to the reconstructed specimen, and therefore excision of the distal clavicle is unlikely to cause instability after AC and CC ligament reconstruction.</p>
<p>Lateral clavicle resection, as described by Mumford,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513488750">12</xref></sup> was originally performed to prevent the development of posttraumatic arthritis at the AC joint and osteolysis of the distal clavicle. Several studies have examined the role of the distal clavicle articulation and its surrounding ligaments in maintaining the stability of the AC joint complex. Dawson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513488750">4</xref></sup> subjected the AC joint to varying levels of compression and found significantly more anterior-posterior translation when the AC joint capsule was cut compared with the intact state. The authors noted that the distal clavicle may therefore confer stability to the AC joint and should be left intact during reconstruction. Using a posteriorly directed force, Jari et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513488750">8</xref></sup> demonstrated a 200% increase in in situ graft forces after an augmented AC ligament transfer procedure that included a distal clavicle excision. The investigators postulated that this increase could have resulted from the loss of the distal clavicle articulation, and they suggested that preservation of the distal clavicle would enhance the strength of the construct. Kowalsky et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488750">9</xref></sup> demonstrated a statistically significant increase in in situ graft forces only at a load of 210 N when loaded in a posterosuperior direction. These investigators concluded that the AC articulation itself has only a minor role in protecting the graft, and distal clavicle excision can perhaps be safely performed in the setting of CC ligament reconstruction. Our results appear to support the conclusion that the distal clavicle can be excised without adverse effect on the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Neither reconstruction, with the distal clavicle intact or with the distal clavicle excised, replicated the intact ligament state. We postulate several reasons for this. First, neither reconstruction recreates the true anatomic features of the AC or CC ligament complex. The native AC ligaments circumferentially surround the AC joint, whereas our reconstruction only recreates the superior portion of the AC ligaments. Second, the native CC ligaments, the trapezoid and conoid, insert independently on the undersurface of the clavicle, whereas our single-tunnel reconstruction brought both limbs of the graft through the same location. There was also no biologic incorporation of the graft in this cadaver study, whereas the native intact ligaments by definition have better incorporation with the bone. Mazzocca et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488750">11</xref></sup> were able to achieve replication of the intact ligament state with 2 different reconstructions in their study. Two potential explanations for this are the nature of the reconstruction and the nature of the testing. Their study involved a 2-tunnel reconstruction, which is potentially more of an anatomic reconstruction; however, their specimens were loaded for a single cycle, whereas our specimens were loaded and displacement data were collected over 500 cycles. The purpose of our study was to compare the 2 reconstructions, distal clavicle intact and distal clavicle excised, to help determine the role of the bony articulation of the distal clavicle on AC joint reconstruction stability; it was not our primary goal to recreate the intact ligament state. Clinical results of the single-tunnel reconstruction used in our study have been favorable as reported by Yoo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513488750">20</xref></sup> and Nicholas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513488750">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. Specimens may have had poor bone stock because of old age. We did not evaluate bone mineral density of the specimens. Additionally, cyclical testing was performed sequentially, with superior-inferior loading performed first followed by anterior-posterior loading. There may have been alterations to the graft or the graft construct resulting from the first set of tests that affected the second set of measurements. There may also have been changes in the clavicle, which was attached to the loading device. In an earlier study, a 40% decrease in bending stiffness of the clavicle was noted after repeated testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513488750">3</xref></sup> We did not measure rotational stability of the clavicle. Finally, our custom testing apparatus is only capable of loading the construct in a single plane of motion at one time, which does not replicate in vivo conditions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, resection of the distal clavicle did not result in any increase in anterior-posterior or superior-inferior translation after reconstruction of the CC and AC ligaments.</p>
