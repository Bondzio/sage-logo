<abstract>
<p>Women typically earn higher grades than men, even though they tend to score lower than men on the SAT, a pattern known as the <italic>female underprediction effect</italic> (FUE). In three samples, we tested our hypothesis that gender differences in Conscientiousness can explain this effect. Within each sample, we created a regression-based measure of under (vs. over) prediction, which reflects the extent to which an individual student’s actual grade point average (GPA) exceeded (or fell below) the GPA predicted by his or her SAT score. Significant gender differences in this measure documented the presence of the FUE. Next, we demonstrated that Conscientiousness significantly mediated the link between gender and underprediction. Specifically, women were higher in Conscientiousness, and students who were more conscientious earned grades that were higher than their SAT scores would predict. Thus, our expectation that Conscientiousness is a partial explanation for the FUE was confirmed.</p>

<p>Judge Sonia Sotomayor, the recently appointed U.S. Supreme Court Justice, once described herself as the “perfect affirmative action baby” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550612469038">Savage, 2009</xref>), who would not have been admitted to Princeton University if admissions decisions were based solely on SAT scores. Sotomayor’s case vividly demonstrates both the dangers of relying too heavily on standardized tests and the importance of the work done in admissions offices whose job it is to look beyond such tests to other personal qualities.</p>
<p>Despite calls to de-emphasize standardized tests of academic ability, they remain an integral part of admissions at most colleges and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550612469038">National Association for College Admissions Counseling, 2008</xref>). Given the importance of these decisions, the fairness of these tests has been investigated for decades (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612469038">Linn, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550612469038">Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997</xref>). A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that the SAT and other standardized tests are useful predictors of college grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612469038">Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw, Mattern, &amp; Barbuti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550612469038">Morgan, 1989</xref>). However, an interesting gender difference consistently emerges: Although men generally score higher on the SAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550612469038">College Board, 2008</xref>), they do not typically earn higher grades than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612469038">Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612469038">Perkins, Kleiner, Roey, &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550612469038">Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550612469038">Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997</xref>). In other words, standardized tests overpredict men’s grades but underpredict women’s grades. This gender difference, documented in several empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550612469038">Duckworth &amp; Seligman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612469038">Leonard &amp; Jiang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612469038">Linn, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550612469038">Stricker, Rock, &amp; Burton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550612469038">Young &amp; Kobrin, 2001</xref>), is referred to here as the “female underprediction effect” or “FUE” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550612469038">Hyde &amp; Kling, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that gender differences in personality can help explain the FUE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1948550612469038">1</xref>
</sup> Specifically, we hypothesized that women earn higher grades than their SAT scores would suggest because they are more conscientious than men. In meta-analytic studies of the relationship between personality and academic performance, Conscientiousness (i.e., the tendency to be careful, deliberate, and thorough) consistently emerges as the strongest and most consistent predictor of earning higher grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612469038">Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550612469038">O’Connor &amp; Paunonen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550612469038">Poropat, 2009</xref>). This suggests that Conscientiousness may be an especially important predictor of the more proximal behaviors, such as developing good study habits, that translate aptitude into earning good grades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550612469038">Crede &amp; Kuncel, 2008</xref>). Regarding gender and Conscientiousness, several studies have documented small but replicable gender differences in Conscientiousness, with women scoring higher than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550612469038">Donnellan &amp; Lucas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550612469038">Feingold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550612469038">Schmitt, Realo, Voracek, &amp; Allik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550612469038">Srivastava, John, Gosling, &amp; Potter, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The FUE exists because gender “matters” in the testing environment, in the classroom, or both. Thus, proposed explanations of the FUE should focus either on gender differences during the testing of academic ability or on gender differences in the behaviors that lead to good grades. One potential test-based explanation is that the SAT is a biased measure of female ability because stereotype threat artificially lowers the scores of females, especially on the math portion of the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612469038">Inzlicht &amp; Ben-Zeev, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550612469038">Nguyen &amp; Ryan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612469038">Rydell, McConnell, &amp; Beilock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550612469038">Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999</xref>). While not discounting the possibility of test-based explanations, we have chosen to focus on the process of earning good grades, and the traits that might influence this process, as a potential explanation for the FUE.</p>
<p>We used data from college students at three different institutions to test our hypothesis that Conscientiousness can explain why women earn higher grades than their SAT scores would suggest. Within each sample, we used multiple regression analysis to determine the degree to which each participant’s grade point average (GPA) was underpredicted versus overpredicted by his or her SAT scores. A significant gender difference in this regression-based measure would document the presence of the FUE. Next, we tested whether Conscientiousness mediated the relationship between gender and underprediction versus overprediction by the SAT.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<sec id="section3-1948550612469038">
<title>Sample 1</title>
<p>Data for Sample 1 were drawn from the Berkeley Longitudinal study, starting in the Fall of 1992 (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550612469038">Robins, Noftle, Trzesniewski, &amp; Roberts, 2005</xref>). Participants were students at the University of California at Berkeley, ranging in age from 17 to 30 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = 18 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.10) and were ethnically diverse (7% African American, 43% Asian, 36% Caucasian, 13% Hispanic/Latino, 1% Native American). Analyses were conducted on the 439 participants (56% female) who had complete GPA and personality data from their first year of college.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1948550612469038">
<title>Sample 2</title>
<p>Data for Sample 2 were collected in the Spring of 2000 at Carleton College, a small, liberal arts college in Minnesota. Students were paid $8 for participating and were recruited by an undergraduate researcher working at a table in the student union. Students were given an envelope containing the study materials and were paid when they returned the forms. The 118 participants (58% female) ranged in age from 18 to 24 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = 21 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17). The majority reported their ethnicity as White/not Hispanic (84%), with the remaining reporting their ethnicity as Hispanic (4%), Asian/Pacific Islander (4%), African American (4%), and “mixed” (4%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550612469038">
<title>Sample 3</title>
<p>Data for Sample 3 were collected from 2002 to 2005 at the University of California, Davis. Students received psychology course credit for participating. The ethnically diverse sample (2% African American, 42% Asian, 34% Caucasian, 8% Hispanic/Latino, 2% Middle Eastern, 11% “Other/Multicultural,” and less than 1% Native American) included 10,492 undergraduates (63% female). Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 30 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = 19 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.51). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612469038">Noftle and Robins (2007</xref>) reported analyses of this data set but did not report results related to the primary hypothesis of the present study.</p>

<title>Sample 1</title>
<p>Participants completed the 60-item NEO-FFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612469038">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>), which includes a 12-item Conscientiousness scale (α = .81). The questionnaire was administered during the first week of college. Items were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not very true of me</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very true of me</italic>). GPA at the end of the first academic year and SAT scores were obtained from the University registrar.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550612469038">
<title>Sample 2</title>
<p>Participants completed the 240-item NEO-PI-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612469038">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>), which includes a 48-item Conscientiousness scale (α = .91). Each item was rated using a 5-point response option (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). SAT scores and current GPAs were obtained from the registrar and admissions offices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550612469038">
<title>Sample 3</title>
<p>Participants completed the 44-item Big Five Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550612469038">John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008</xref>), which includes a 9-item Conscientiousness scale (α = .81). Items were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Participants self-reported their current GPAs and their SAT scores. Previous research has shown that self-reported GPA and SAT scores are very closely associated with GPA and SAT scores obtained from university records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612469038">Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1948550612469038">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In order for Conscientiousness to explain the FUE, a specific pattern of gender differences needs to exist. First, females must score lower than males on a test of academic ability, in this case, the total SAT score (i.e., Math plus Verbal scores).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1948550612469038">2</xref>
</sup> Second, female GPAs must be similar to, or higher than, the GPA of males. Third, females need to score higher in Conscientiousness. These conditions held in all three samples (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550612469038">Table 1</xref>). A correlation matrix for the study variables, presented separately for males and females, can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612469038">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>To quantify the FUE, we created a measure of individual differences in the degree of underprediction versus overprediction by regressing SAT onto GPA in each sample, and saving the unstandardized residuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550612469038">Stricker et al., 1993</xref>). These residuals, hereafter referred to as <italic>GPA Underprediction</italic>, reflect the discrepancy between predicted and observed GPA, and thus provide a measure of the extent to which a student’s GPA was higher (i.e., underpredicted) or lower (i.e., overpredicted) than would be expected based on his or her SAT score. Positive residuals indicate a GPA that was higher than predicted by the SAT (i.e., participants’ actual GPA was above the regression line), whereas negative residuals indicate a GPA was lower than predicted by the SAT (i.e., participants’ actual GPA was below the regression line).</p>
<p>Consistent with the FUE, women, on average, had positive GPA Underprediction scores in all three samples (<italic>M</italic>s =.06, .06, and .07, respectively), whereas men had negative scores (<italic>M</italic>s = −.07, −.09, and −.12, respectively). <italic>T</italic>-tests showed that these gender differences were significant<italic>, t</italic>(1, 437) = 2.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01<italic>, t</italic>(1, 116) = 2.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and <italic>t</italic>(1, 10,490) = 17.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively. Thus, we replicated the FUE in all three samples.<sup>

For Samples 1 and 3, the mediation was partial, with the main effect of gender on GPA Underprediction remaining significant.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Researchers have long known that college women earn higher grades than men despite the fact that men score higher than women on tests like the SAT that are intended to predict such grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612469038">Linn, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612469038">Ramist, Lewis, &amp; McCamley-Jenkins, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550612469038">Stricker et al., 1993</xref>). Our work offers the personality trait of Conscientiousness as an answer to this performance paradox. Specifically, in samples from three different universities, we have shown that college women earn higher grades than their SAT scores would predict because they are more conscientious than men.</p>
<sec id="section12-1948550612469038">
<title>Interpreting the Results</title>
<p>Given that the FUE has been documented for decades, several arguments have been posited that could potentially influence the interpretation of our results. First, it has been argued that the FUE is a by-product of men’s higher probability of taking more difficult math and science-based courses in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550612469038">Elliott &amp; Strenta, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612469038">Ramist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550612469038">Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997</xref>). That is, men earn lower grades than their SAT scores would suggest because they take harder classes while their female counterparts with similar SAT scores take courses that are graded more leniently (i.e., humanities courses). We were able to conduct a partial test of this hypothesis in Sample 3, which provided the necessary data and sample size. Participants were divided into three categories, based on their major (math/science/engineering, social science, humanities), and gender comparisons on the GPA Underprediction scores were made. The FUE replicated in all three groups; that is, women tended to receive better grades than predicted by their SAT scores, regardless of their choice of major, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(math/science/engineering)</sub>(1, 2944) = 7.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(social science)</sub>(1, 3347) = 13.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(humanities)</sub>(1, 565) = 6.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Second, some have pointed out that SAT scores are only part of an admission process that takes into account variables like high school GPA, which may compensate for any gender bias in the SAT. However, in order for high school GPA to be an “appropriate corrective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612469038">Leonard &amp; Jiang, 1999</xref>, p. 393) to the FUE, it would need to <italic>overpredict</italic> college grades for females. This is not the case; high school GPA does not systematically underpredict or overpredict college grades for either gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612469038">Leonard &amp; Jiang, 1999</xref>). Consequently, a weighting system that puts more emphasis on high school GPA would indeed yield a final pool of applicants that has a larger number of women, but the women who would be “added back” to the pool by virtue of their superior high school GPAs would not be the women who were eliminated because of their SAT scores. Thus, high school GPA cannot be used to “undo” the gender bias in the SAT.</p>
<p>Third, some have minimized the importance of the FUE, noting that the differences are generally small by statistical standards (ranging from about one eighth to one fifth of a grade point across the three samples). Despite the small size of the FUE we believe that the effects reported here have, indeed, negatively impacted college-bound women and that these effects deserve attention beyond the readers of technical reports published by the College Board (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612469038">Mattern, Patterson, Shaw, Kobrin, &amp; Barbuti, 2008</xref>). For example, small gender differences can have a large absolute impact (i.e., impact a large number of women or men) if the difference is on a variable that is central to large numbers of admissions decisions. Taking the University of California as a case in point, approximately 160,000 submissions from prospective undergraduates were submitted in the fall of 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550612469038">Irwin, 2012</xref>). When admissions decisions like these are influenced by SAT scores, it is likely that some of the men who are admitted will earn lower grades than some of the women who were rejected (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612469038">Leonard &amp; Jiang, 1999</xref> for an estimate of the magnitude of this effect at the University of California, Berkeley). Moreover, many merit-based scholarships weight the SAT in the selection process and consequently the recipients will likely include men who will ultimately perform worse in college than some female applicants who were eliminated from consideration because of their lower SAT scores.</p>

<sec id="section13-1948550612469038">
<title>Focusing on Conscientiousness</title>
<p>Conscientiousness has long been recognized as a predictor of grades (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550612469038">O’Connor &amp; Paunonen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550612469038">Poropat, 2009</xref>). Our work is consistent with these previous findings and provides insight regarding the influence of Conscientiousness on grades. Specifically, when Conscientiousness was correlated with GPA Underprediction in our samples, all three correlations were positive and significant, <italic>r</italic>(439) = .16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01<italic>, r</italic>(118) = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and <italic>r</italic>(10,492) = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively, indicating that Conscientiousness was associated with earning grades that were higher than expectations based on the SAT. In other words, Conscientiousness has significant incremental validity over and above the SAT when predicting college grades (e.g., Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007). As such, admissions procedures might be usefully improved by including a direct assessment of Conscientiousness or other, related, individual difference measures.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>First, although a strength of our study is the replication of the findings across samples from three different universities, all three of these universities are academically selective. This raises the question of whether the same gender effects on personality and GPA would emerge at less selective institutions. Accordingly, it would be useful to attempt to replicate our findings at other institutions. Second, our data were collected prior to 2005, meaning that our data do not include the new Writing section of the SAT. It is possible that this change might influence the magnitude of the FUE. However, a College Board report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612469038">Mattern et al., 2008</xref>) based on data from over 150,000 test takers indicated that the FUE still exists for the new version of the SAT, and that the magnitude of the effect is essentially the same as it was in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612469038">Ramist et al., 1994</xref>). Whether the influence of Conscientiousness on the FUE remains the same when the newer SAT scores are used remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Third, our data collection method relied on self-report for our personality measures in all samples, and for GPA and SAT scores in Sample 3. Although we acknowledge that recollections of GPA and SAT scores may not be as accurate as scores obtained from official sources, we note that the pattern of findings in Sample 3 replicates that of Samples 1 and 2, for which official, nonself-report sources were used. The self-report method in personality research has been extensively validated across many decades, and self-reported personality traits have been demonstrated to predict a wide range of important life outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612469038">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612469038">Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, &amp; Goldberg, 2007</xref>). However, information from informants can provide unique information about a person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550612469038">Connelly &amp; Ones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550612469038">Vazire, 2010</xref>); therefore, future work of this sort would benefit from including other raters of personality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550612469038">Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-1948550612469038">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The gender effects found in our samples, on the SAT, Conscientiousness, and college grades, have been documented in numerous other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550612469038">College Board, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612469038">Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550612469038">Srivastava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550612469038">Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997</xref>). What distinguishes our work from prior research, however, is our simultaneous focus on gender and Conscientiousness in the prediction of grades. In doing so, our analysis is conceptually similar to that presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550612469038">Duckworth and Seligman (2006</xref>), who showed that female elementary students earn higher grades than their IQ scores would predict because they are higher than boys on self-discipline. This tendency for girls and women to exceed performance predictions based on ability scores is especially important within the context of admission decisions. To document the magnitude of the FUE within the context of college admissions, we conducted regression analyses that predicted SAT scores from GPA and gender within each sample.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1948550612469038">5</xref>
</sup> With this approach, the unstandardized regression coefficient for gender indexes the magnitude of the gender penalty in each sample. Our analyses indicated that the gender penalty was 75 points in Sample 1 and 71 points in both Samples 2 and 3. In other words, to accurately predict the GPAs that they ultimately attained, women would need SAT scores that were 75 points higher in Sample 1 and 71 points higher in both Samples 2 and 3. One policy recommendation that could be made based on our findings is that individual institutions could conduct analyses like those reported here to document the extent of the gender penalty in their samples of students. This information could then be used by admissions officers as they evaluate potential applicants for admission.</p>

<p>Other researchers have examined whether variables such as academic preparedness and high school GPA can explain the FUE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550612469038">Stricker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550612469038">Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997</xref>).

<p>The 2006 revision of the SAT includes a new Writing section. Although women earn slightly higher scores than men on this section, College Board researchers report that the FUE exists with the revised SAT, and is approximately the same magnitude as it was with the previous version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612469038">Mattern et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Tests can be biased because there are group differences in the intercepts or in the slopes when predicting a validity criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550612469038">Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 1987</xref>). The FUE reflects a gender difference in the intercepts. However, we can also test whether the SAT shows a predictive bias in the slopes, which would suggest that the SAT is a more valid predictor of academic performance for one gender. Consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550612469038">Morgan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550612469038">Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2007</xref>), SAT scores were significantly correlated with GPA in all three samples across both genders (<italic>r</italic>s were .44, .39, and .26 in Samples 1–3, respectively, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01). Moreover, the magnitude of the correlation between SAT and GPA did not vary as a function of gender, as indicated by a nonsignificant interaction effect (i.e., gender by SAT interaction when predicting GPA) in all three samples, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .05. Thus, there was no predictive bias with respect to slopes.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1948550612469038">
<label>4.</label>
<p>To test whether the personality effects were unique to Conscientiousness, we conducted parallel analyses with the other four Big Five traits, separately, in each of our three samples. Conscientiousness was the only trait that significantly mediated the relationship between gender and GPA Underprediction in all three samples. Importantly, additional analyses revealed that in each sample the mediation effect of Conscientiousness remained significant when all of the Big Five traits were simultaneously included in the model (i.e., the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550612469038">Figure 1</xref> was expanded to include mediation pathways for all Big Five traits).</p>
