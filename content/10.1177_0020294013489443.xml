<title>New High-Throughput Spectrometers from Ocean Optics</title>
<p>Ocean Optics has expanded its Elite Series of high-performance modular spectrometers with the introduction of the Ventana line of high-throughput spectrometers. Ventana spectrometers combine an optical bench configuration with, Ocean Optics claims, very high collection efficiency and a high-efficiency volume phase holographic (VPH) grating to provide unprecedented throughput and sensitivity for low light-level applications. Three preconfigured Ventana spectrometers are available: 532 and 785 nm excitation wavelength Raman models, and a visible to near-infrared (VIS-NIR) model for general purpose fluorescence applications.</p>
<p>With its high-sensitivity performance and compact size, Ventana is ideal for academic and corporate research and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and system integrators seeking a cost-effective alternative to traditional integrated systems. It is well suited for applications in life sciences, pharmaceuticals, materials analysis and more.</p>

<p>The 785-nm Ventana system has a spectral range of 250–2000 cm<sup>−1</sup> and resolution of 10 cm<sup>−1</sup>; the 532-nm version covers 35–4300 cm<sup>−1</sup> with 20 cm<sup>−1</sup> resolution. The VIS-NIR Ventana spectrometer is configured for fluorescence measurements from 430–1100 nm with a resolution of 4.0 nm (full width at half maximum (FWHM)). Also, the 785-nm Raman Ventana spectrometer can be configured with an integrated laser with free space collection optics for the highest throughput possible. Additionally, complete Raman sampling systems, including laser, probe and software are available.</p>

<title>Kistler Press Force Sensor Range Upgraded</title>
<p>Kistler Instruments has upgraded its press force sensor range to provide full consistency throughout the measuring range from 0.1 to 700 kN. The piezoelectric sensor element provides a compact design with a low sensor weight, offering, Kistler claims, significantly smaller dimensions and mass than equivalent strain gauge devices. With three calibrated measurement ranges, the same sensor can be used for a wide spectrum of forces. The feasibility of switching measuring range when using suitable amplifiers bolsters this advantage while accommodating the general trend towards production and measuring stations handling a greater variety of parts. However, Kistler states, the wide-range measuring chain also offers critical advantages in laboratory applications, where frequent changes of sensor are common practice, and the extremely high degree of overload protection eliminates the need for involved protective measures when using the lowest measuring ranges.</p>

<p>The range of eight force sensors has been developed specifically for use in production environments, especially for quality assurance monitoring in assembly applications. The piezoelectric sensors cover measuring ranges from 0.1 to 700 kN and are supplied as standard with 1%, 10% and 100% measuring range calibrations. In most applications, the sensors may be fitted directly into presses, punches and rams, but, where this is not possible, a variety of flanges and adapters are available.</p>
