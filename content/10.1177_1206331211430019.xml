<abstract>
<p>After the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre, landscape architects in North America have been called on to design public landscapes that are not only more secure but also aesthetically pleasing. In this article, the author explores the cultural and political implications of certain plant-based design strategies drawn from the Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design movement—in particular those that facilitate visual surveillance of public landscapes. Taking a broadly socio-semiotic approach, the author attempts to use a consideration of the way particular techniques work, socially and practically speaking, to reveal forms of significance that would not otherwise be apparent. The author concludes with a brief analysis of the winning design for the new American Embassy in London, as an example of a landscape attempting to be both environmentally friendly and secure.</p>

<p>The September 2002 issue of <italic>Landscape Architecture</italic> magazine marked the first anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center with an issue on the role of landscape architects in designing more secure public spaces. Lamenting the “landscape of anxiety” resulting from hastily implemented security measures, authors suggested that landscape architects could play a role in creating landscapes both secure and “harmonious” in their design—that is, landscapes that feel safe without drawing too much attention to their security features. Although the necessity of including technologies of access control and surveillance was taken for granted, the use of “softer” strategies—including certain plant-based techniques promoted by advocates of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)—was considered a means of both providing a supportive environment for the deployment of such measures and making them less intrusive, more aesthetically pleasing and, on my reading, more <italic>natural</italic>. In this article, I explore the cultural, political, and environmental implications of some of these security-oriented landscaping strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1206331211430019">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the special issue of <italic>Landscape Architecture</italic> appeared, landscape architects have indeed helped design security improvements to several symbolically important public landscapes in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1206331211430019">2</xref></sup> Perhaps more important, for many designers, incorporating security requirements has become part of the design process. As Laurie Olin, whose firm was chosen to redesign the site of the Washington Monument put it, “You just absorb it and it becomes part of what you do” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1206331211430019">“Discreet landscapes,” 2004</xref>, p. 34). At the same time, the question of aesthetics and its intersection with the psychology and phenomenology of security measures in the urban landscape has been taken up outside the realm of design professionals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331211430019">Coaffee, O’Hare, &amp; Hawkesworth, 2009</xref>, for an overview). Designers, planners, and commentators alike are now talking about landscapes that are not only secure and aesthetically pleasing but also socially vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1206331211430019">National Capital Planning Commission, 2004</xref>) and environmentally sustainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331211430019">Coaffee &amp; Bosher, 2008</xref>). In interrogating the role of plants in such landscapes, I hope to be able to speak, not to the prospects so much as some of the underlying implications of these intersecting objectives. Broadly socio-semiotic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1206331211430019">3</xref></sup> in orientation, my approach is also strongly influenced by the work of Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1206331211430019">Wilson (1991)</xref>, whose analysis of North American landscapes in <italic>The Culture of Nature</italic> demonstrated that a critical reading of landscape requires a consideration of the material practices of its construction and use, as well as a range of discourses and cultural codes articulated with those practices in one way or another.</p>
<sec id="section1-1206331211430019">
<title>Plants in the City</title>
<p>Perhaps the most straightforward use of plants in security-enhanced landscapes has been their incorporation in, or as, barriers. The <italic>Urban Design and Security Plan</italic> for Washington, D.C., provides several examples of how mature trees, shrubbery-enclosed bollards, and reinforced concrete planters can be deployed both as a means of defending buildings against vehicular bombs and beautifying the streetscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1206331211430019">National Capital Planning Commission, 2004</xref>). A consideration of the range of connotations that plants can have in this setting is a good starting point for exploring the complexities of their semiotic potential. The following blurb is taken from the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://planterbarrier.com">planterbarrier.com</ext-link>:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Plants are natural. Plants are alive. Plants are integrative. Plants exceed manmade objects in providing infinite variations in shape and finish detail. Plants represent and are adapted to local conditions and micro-climates. Plants are abundant and universally available. They can be large like trees and provide shade or small like plants providing seasonal color. Plants are good. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1206331211430019">Stonewear, 1997</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of course, not all plants bring with them this host of positive connotations; it is particular kinds of plants, in particular forms. This is an observation I will return to shortly, after a brief discussion of the significance of plants in the city more generally.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331211430019">John Dixon Hunt (2000)</xref> characterizes the creation of designed landscapes as an “art of milieu,” where “milieu is not just objective, physical surroundings, but involves the inscription on that site of how an individual or a society conceives of its environment” (p. 8). In this context, the selection of plants, the style of their arrangement, and the intensity of their care can all be read as meaningful by attentive observers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1206331211430019">4</xref></sup> That said, and especially for nonexperts, plants tend to convey meaning in a relatively subtle, even obscure manner. Particularly in the city, where people generally encounter plants in the midst of other activities, they register most often as part of an overall impression or operate as unnoticed cues to comportment and movement through different city spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1206331211430019">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly with respect to security, as living beings, plants also act as indexes: not only of the conditions at a given site—signaling changes in weather and season, for example—but also the nature and degree of human intervention there. Though people may have little specific knowledge of the plants they encounter in the urban landscape, most can tell the difference between plants that are growing wild and those that are tended. Or at least, this difference can be exaggerated through various means. It is this quality, along with specific social connotations, which makes them particularly well-suited to conveying meanings related to safety and security.</p>
<p>In the city, plants and “green space” are considered to be psychologically and socially, as well as environmentally beneficial. They give people a “contact with nature” considered both calming and restorative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211430019">Kaplan &amp; Kaplan, 1992</xref>); they encourage people to spend time in public spaces, thus enhancing community safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331211430019">Kuo, Bacaicoa, &amp; Sullivan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331211430019">Kuo &amp; Sullivan, 2001</xref>); and they produce various well-known positive environmental effects—such as detoxifying the air and soil, providing habitat for bird and animal species, generating cooling effects, absorbing carbon dioxide, and so on. As I hinted above however, plants do not always convey these positive connotations. Thus, there is an important caveat to the promotion of vegetation in the city: it must be well maintained. This is related to what landscape ecologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1206331211430019">Joan I. Nassauer (1988)</xref> calls the “aesthetic of care.” She writes, “[P]eople see beauty in well-kept landscapes, and tend their own fields, gardens and yards to show they care” (p. 973). They also make social and moral attributions about others based on the appearance of the plants and cultivated spaces associated with them.</p>
<p>While in a rural setting, variety in patterns of growth is accepted and even appreciated, plants in the city are perceived in terms of human intention: either someone planted them or failed to prevent their planting (by birds, the wind, etc.). Weeds and overgrown plants are seen to signal neglect, disorder, and even the provision of hiding places for criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1206331211430019">Nasar &amp; Fisher, 1993</xref>). Although evidence linking plants with crime in a causal relationship is at best anecdotal in nature, the <italic>perception</italic> of that relationship is strong. Excessive plant growth and secluded spaces are for many a source of fear in the urban landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331211430019">Kuo &amp; Sullivan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1206331211430019">Nasar &amp; Fisher, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1206331211430019">6</xref></sup> The characterization of invasive plant species as threats to “biosecurity” only adds a greater urgency to popular discourses about such plants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1206331211430019">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, it is on the tension between the positive and negative connotations of plants in the city that landscaping strategies for security ultimately depend. The capacity of plants to get out of control, and of gardens to become weedy, is what makes a neatly trimmed hedge or a well-tended garden capable of acting as an index of human intention and intervention. As a result, plants can be used in landscapes in a variety of ways that are simultaneously functional and meaningful, giving them a special communicative capacity thought to be particularly effective in discouraging opportunities for crime, terrorism, and other “undesirable” activities.</p>
<p>The premise of environmentally based crime prevention is that criminal and so-called nuisance activities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1206331211430019">8</xref></sup> are significantly influenced by environmental factors and that design improvements can help reduce crime. Although there have been a range of different approaches put forward since the 1970s, when the early seminal texts appeared (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1206331211430019">Schneider, 2005</xref>, for a history and review), CPTED is the approach that seems to have caught on most convincingly, at least in North America, and particularly within the landscape architecture profession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1206331211430019">9</xref></sup> It has also been considered useful (in conjunction with other strategies) in designing landscapes less vulnerable to terrorist attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331211430019">Demkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1206331211430019">Hopper &amp; Droge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1206331211430019">Mather, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1206331211430019">Speckhardt &amp; Dowell, 2002</xref>). More generally, CPTED strategies are supportive of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331211430019">Boddy (2008)</xref> calls an “architecture of reassurance,” in part because they are explicitly designed to make so-called intended users feel more comfortable in public spaces, at the same time “unintended users” are made to feel unwelcome. As such, these strategies function according to a logic of exclusion—one which, after 9/11 and other major terrorist attacks of the last decade, is understood to address terrorists as well as criminals. Of course, just as CPTED is designed to address fear of crime as much as actual crime, it seems likely that it is the promised departure of suspicious “others” from public spaces rather than the direct thwarting of terrorist activities that makes this approach an appealing response to widespread and generalized anxieties generated by the “war on terror” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1206331211430019">Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1206331211430019">Sorkin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>I present here a consideration of the treatment of plants according to CPTED principles, focusing on those concerned with facilitating the visual surveillance of public spaces—whether by police, private security personnel, or citizens; in person or remotely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1206331211430019">10</xref></sup> Broadly speaking, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331211430019">Lyon (2007)</xref> observes, this form of surveillance is based on a “categorical suspicion . . . in which a risk calculus identifies certain groups as potential offenders” (p. 105). As I will argue, the landscape itself helps settle the identity of different users—as “intended” or “unintended.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1206331211430019">11</xref></sup> There are two main ways in which plants are implicated: first, by helping to maximize visibility across a given site; and second, by ensuring that the landscape and intentions regarding its use are sufficiently legible. As I indicated above, my approach here is to examine the way such techniques work, socially and environmentally speaking, to bring out aspects of their significance that might otherwise remain obscure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1206331211430019">
<title>Visibility</title>
<p>Proponents of CPTED generally recommend that only plants with a height lower than 3 ft or higher than 8 ft be used. This is to keep the so-called middle plane of the landscape open, enabling what is often characterized as “natural surveillance” across the landscape—by users and passersby as well as security personnel—and eliminating opportunities for concealment. The classic way in which this requirement is met is through the pairing of high canopy trees with groundcover, grasses, or flower beds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1206331211430019">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1206331211430019">12</xref></sup> Similar effects can be achieved, however, by vigilantly pruning shrubs so that it is possible to see <italic>through</italic> them (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1206331211430019">Figure 2</xref>) and also by avoiding close groupings of shrubs and trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1206331211430019">Michael, 2002</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>These strategies ultimately limit the range of plants and growth habits considered suitable for urban landscapes and also prescribe a relatively vigilant control of growth processes. This is bad news for many bird species as well as small mammals that use dense shrubs and hedges as shelter from predators, or sites for their nests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211430019">Dawson, 1992</xref>). It also entails a reduction in environmental benefits associated with greater density and diversity of vegetation, such as cooling effects, erosion mitigation, and resilience to pests, disease, and extreme weather conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331211430019">“High Performance Landscape Guidelines,” 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1206331211430019">13</xref></sup> Thus, although new designs for secure landscapes may claim to be “sustainable,” there are serious constraints on the nature and diversity of the ecosystems they can support, as well as the environmental benefits they generate. I will have more to say about this below.</p>
<p>In comparison with more “fortress-like” security solutions, the transparency achieved through such techniques may have a positive cultural significance—conveying, for example, an atmosphere of “openness” in turn associated with democratic ideals, especially in the United States (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331211430019">Chipley, Lawson, &amp; Holzheimer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1206331211430019">National Capital Planning Commission, 2004</xref>). However, there is also a considerable narrowing of the ways in which such spaces can be used and experienced. Although dense vegetation provides opportunities for concealment, it can also provide experiences of the urban landscape that are out of the ordinary—in the form, for example, of encounters with birds and animals, or a heightened sonic awareness of one’s surroundings as external noise is dampened. More generally, dense vegetation provides an experience of enclosure in public and an opportunity to reflect or relax in a secluded setting. It can also enrich the phenomenology of public spaces with the potential to experience suspense or surprise.</p>
<p>The decrease in opportunities for such experiences can be seen to affect not only individuals but also the health of democratic societies more generally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1206331211430019">Gumpert and Drucker (2001)</xref> argue that the provision of spaces enabling unplanned interactions with a variety of others is an important communicative aspect of democratic societies. Furthermore, opportunities for concealment can be used in a variety of ways, not only for the sake of causing harm to others. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1206331211430019">Wood (1981)</xref> argues in an essay on the importance of “<italic>in</italic>defensible spaces,” the existence of private spaces in public has facilitated forms of experimentation important to broader processes of social and cultural change. He writes, “Change of all sorts is brewed in the shadowed spaces. It is here that behaviors are practiced in preparation for becoming defiant, which is where our current norms were hatched from the mold of previous generations” (pp. 94-95). At the same time, it is often the most marginalized members of society who depend on the existence of such spaces. A more open aesthetic does not, for them, reassure, but rather leads to greater vulnerability: declining opportunities for shelter and the increasing likelihood that they will become visible to authorities.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the exclusion of large or dense shrubs and hedges from public landscapes corresponds with increased constraints on activity and ways of being in public. The techniques described here were developed to discourage not only activities associated with crime and terrorism but also those considered “undesirable”: loitering, public drinking, graffiti, skateboarding, sexual acts, sleeping outdoors, and so on. Given that the prohibition of such activities disproportionately affects marginalized groups, it may be the social status quo that is at stake here, at least as much, if not more than security. Indeed, this is a critique of much research on surveillance in public spaces: that it serves not only to secure or protect but also to “sort”—that is, to enable the identification and removal of certain types of people from particular settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331211430019">Lyon 2007</xref>, pp. 105-117, for a review). Considered in the context of plant-based landscaping strategies, the elimination of opportunities for concealment can be seen as a way of <italic>naturalizing</italic> practices of social exclusion and effectively inscribing what counts as desirable, or who is an “intended user” into the landscape itself. The familiar combination of high canopy trees with groundcovers or low-growing flowers thus takes on a new, more ominous and paradoxical significance: one in which a physical and symbolic opening of the landscape corresponds with a narrowing of possibilities for use and experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1206331211430019">
<title>Legibility</title>
<p>It is important to realize that although control of access to certain sites may be based on positive identification—that is, being able to prove you are authorized to enter—surveillance generally operates in a more contextual manner. That is, by detecting what is out of the ordinary, or—where access is controlled—what is “out of place.” Plants used to mark boundaries between different kinds of space, as well as entry and access points and preferred paths for movement, can facilitate such judgments by helping delineate a landscape and the way it is intended to be used. For example, rows of trees can be used to mark a landscape perimeter, or boundaries between different spaces within it (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1206331211430019">Figure 3</xref>); low hedges or linear flower beds can be used to encourage people to stay on a path. Such features contribute to what is sometimes referred to as the <italic>legibility</italic> of the landscape. The assumption here is that, in general, if people understand the intended uses of different spaces, they will adjust their behavior accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331211430019">Crowe, 2000</xref>). This in turn produces certain predictability in people’s behavior, which makes anything unusual stand out more. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1206331211430019">Mather (2002)</xref> explains, in his description of the design for a security upgrade of a military base in Florida, a well-delineated landscape “helps residential occupants know where their boundaries are and helps security guards recognize transitions in what they should expect, so that something that looks out of place is obvious” (p. 44).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1206331211430019" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>Palm trees delineate the boundary between park space designated for sports on one side and passive recreation on the other (Erin Despard)</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1206331211430019-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The legibility of the landscape can only be maintained, however, to the degree that the growth and reproduction of plants is sufficiently controlled. Overgrown plants and weeds tend to blend together, making boundaries and other demarcations harder to perceive and less intentional in appearance. Thus, the plants in landscapes designed to facilitate surveillance must either be selected for their tendency to retain a particular shape or be vigilantly maintained: grass must be cut, trees and shrubs regularly pruned, and weeds pulled. These activities also contribute to what is referred to by some CPTED advocates as the “image” of a given site. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331211430019">Saville (2008)</xref> writes,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[I]f a property is well maintained, it shows that management, or the owner, care for and will defend the property against crime. A property that is not maintained may indicate that management is not concerned about the property and might overlook or ignore criminal activity. (p. 6)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other words, if attention is being paid to the plants, attention will also be paid to people.</p>
<p>Given the powerful yet obscure semiotic functioning of plants in the city, the potential influence of such analogies needs to be taken seriously. As any experienced gardener can confirm, the practice of weeding a garden depends less on the correct identification of each plant encountered and more on the ability to distinguish between intended and unintended patterns of growth. Indeed, the designation of a weed is both geographically and culturally variable: A weed, as it is often put, is simply a “plant out of place.” Thus, although verification of a plant’s identity is sometimes required, the primary perceptual process is based on what the gardener knows about what was planted, where, and the growth habits of cultivated plants in general. This makes the perceptual processes for distinguishing between categories of plant, and categories of people under surveillance, quite similar.</p>
<p>The thing about weeding of course is that it quickly becomes habitual, making the distinction between “weed” and “not-weed” effectively ontological. Although perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this analogy is the way a similar slippage is facilitated by surveillance practices based on categories of risk, I want to emphasize the difference between the two. That is, while weeds never learn their proper place, people do. In other words, to the extent that it is the plant-delineated structure of urban landscapes that facilitates surveillance, we may forget, or not even notice in the first place, that our use of public spaces is being constrained. This is one of the main ways in which so-called natural surveillance blends into a <italic>naturalization</italic> of surveillance. How might plant-based contextual cues as well as actual encounters with either security personnel or surveillance technology influence the way people act and interact in public? To the extent that such measures are integrated with pervasive and apparently natural ways of structuring the landscape, we may lose both the impetus and the opportunity to pose such questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1206331211430019">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the context of increasing surveillance of public spaces, low-growing, well trimmed hedges, and neat, carefully edged flower beds can be seen to signify, not only the preferred trajectory of movement through a landscape, or a delineation between areas intended for different uses, but also the marking out of <italic>proper</italic> places: invoking not only notions of ownership and control but also social norms of comportment and interaction.</p>
<p>To conclude my reading of these techniques associated with creating visibility and legibility, let me observe that both require a considerable amount of control be exercised on plants, in particular, on processes of reproduction and growth. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211430019">Nassauer (1995)</xref> warns, “tidy” landscapes tend not be very biologically diverse or ecologically healthy. Taking into consideration, however, the range of negative connotations associated with excessive or unplanned plant growth, and calls for security measures that make people <italic>feel</italic> safe, the control exerted over plant growth must be seen, not simply as a means to security but also as an end in itself. The clean contours of recently trimmed hedges and weed-free flower beds signify a form of human intervention in the landscape, which is both active and ongoing—an <italic>occupation</italic> of a given space projected indefinitely into the future. It is the symbolic production of a specific, knowable future, one designed according to the tastes and routines of the present. Especially in the context of the rising urgency of invasive species discourse, as well as anxiety over a diverse range of urban threats, it is perhaps not coincidental that we should deal with terrorism by designing perfectly controllable landscapes.</p>

<title>Conclusion: From Aesthetically Pleasing to “Environmentally Friendly” Secure Landscapes</title>
<p>If the use of plants to create aesthetically pleasing, surveillance-friendly landscapes helps naturalize both the practice and effects of surveillance, then presenting such landscapes as “environmentally friendly” takes things one step further, promising a wider scope of care while at the same time throwing the implications outlined above into even sharper relief. This is especially the case in the design of sites such as embassies, which, to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331211430019">Boddy’s (2008)</xref> term, are particularly <italic>emblematic</italic> of the social and political relations entailed by a war on terror.</p>
<p>In February 2010, it was announced that the architectural firm of KieranTimberlake had won the design competition for the new American embassy in London. Although this choice was not without controversy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1206331211430019">15</xref></sup> it was defended by U.S. Ambassador Louis Susman as being the design that best met the competition criteria and was the most “environmentally friendly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331211430019">Hogg, 2010</xref>). It is characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211430019">KieranTimberlake (2010)</xref> as an attempt to “give form to the core beliefs of our democracy—transparency, openness, and equality—and do so in a way that is both secure and welcoming.” Although the building itself contains the majority of the environmentally innovative features, the landscape (designed by OLIN) helps underscore these achievements. As one critic points out, “[T]he abundance of green space contributes to the design’s environmentally friendly image” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331211430019">Oursoussoff, 2010</xref>). As if to confirm this association, the cube-like exterior of the building will include an excision into one corner containing a small garden—an echo of both indoor gardens and the landscape below that signifies their integration with the building itself.</p>
<p>Located on top of a “gently rising earthen mound” protected by security barriers that are “incised into the hillside and hidden from view,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1206331211430019">16</xref></sup> the embassy is surrounded by a pond on one side and public paths and park space that spiral upwards around the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211430019">KieranTimberlake, 2010</xref>). Planted mainly with trees and grasses, which enable maximum visibility across it, the landscape attempts to disguise various security features, as well as signify openness. Although it does not really succeed on the last two counts, at least as far as the critics are concerned,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1206331211430019">17</xref></sup> what is more interesting is its potential for generating experiences of exclusion that are in direct contradiction with the values it is intended to represent. For example, the “prospect” onto both levels of the park areas will be freely available to all who pass by, but public access will only be granted at the lower level. Calling this an “architectural sleight of hand,”<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331211430019">Oursoussoff (2010)</xref> comments that “the effect is likely to be oddly disquieting: an array of clearly visible public zones that will actually be inaccessible to the public.” It will in other words generalize an experience of exclusion formerly only familiar to the more marginalized users of public space. The selection of plant species underscores this exclusivity: all the trees will be species native to North America, though some “were long ago brought to England and are now common to the English landscape” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211430019">KieranTimberlake, 2010</xref>). Thus, the trees—either “native” American or American-naturalized-British—will further specify exactly who is in their proper place here, both aestheticizing and naturalizing the myth of an original, unitary homeland, even while growing on foreign soil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1206331211430019">18</xref></sup> As such, the landscape is made not only to signify openness and environmental sustainability but also to serve as a surreptitious reminder of what exactly is being defended via extensive security measures.</p>
<p>All in all, despite, or perhaps in part because of its various contradictions, what this design does most successfully is give expression to a fantasy, one I suspect underlies other attempts to join security with sustainability: this is the fantasy that, through innovative design, we can have it all, without disrupting the existing social order. We need not become embroiled with a messy, unpredictable nature, or a diversity of human needs and experiences; we can design security <italic>and</italic> environmental well-being, and in the process, pick and choose who benefits from both. My fear is that over time, we will come to believe in this fantasy and allow our sense of what openness and environmental well-being <italic>feel</italic> like, to be shaped by how things have been made to look.</p>

<p>For example, designed landscapes have historically been particularly persuasive means of signifying wealth and power. The extensive, rigidly controlled gardens of King Louis the XIV at Versailles is probably the most famous example, but English landscape gardens of the 18th and 19th centuries also used particular forms of vegetation to signify a new order of social and economic relations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331211430019">Pugh, 1988</xref>).</p>
