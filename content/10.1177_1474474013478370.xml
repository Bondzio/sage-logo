<p>This volume of the <italic>Reimagining Ireland</italic> series, like others, deals with literature from Ireland’s coastal islands that speaks to the significance of islands here and elsewhere as cultural repositories, the old ways, including here often the old language, having survived in such isolated locations. Two authors from the now-abandoned Great Blasket Island, Tomás O’Crohan and Peig Sayers, have been celebrated in <italic>Reimagining Ireland</italic>. Together with Maurice O’Sullivan they published autobiographies between 1929 and 1936, now key works for students of Irish (in both senses) literature and for those interested in island life. Their fame led to the ‘Blasket library’, a canon including books from other islanders that may not have been published without the interest in this particular island. Irish island literature study became somewhat dominated by Great Blasket, and the appearance of Mairéad Conneely’s book on the Aran Islands is welcome. Aran is Irish speaking and is often considered and certainly marketed as a quintessential example of traditional Irish life. The literary heritage is strong, its range wider than Great Blasket. Conneely’s book focuses on two visiting and two local writers. Emily Lawless, from an aristocratic mainland family, a ‘forgotten writer’ (p. 10), wrote <italic>Grania, the Story of an Island</italic> (1892); John Millington Synge, the Dublin playwright, after four summers on Aran, especially Inis Meáin, published <italic>The Aran Islands</italic> in 1907. The locals are from Inis Mór: Irish language works from Liam Ó Flaithearta, his collection of short stories, <italic>Dúil</italic> (1953) and the poet Máirtin Ó Direáin’s, <italic>Danta: 1939-1979</italic> (1980).</p>
<p>After the introduction comes a chapter on the writers, while others place their work within literary and other theory. Postcolonialism is discussed in Chapter Three, highlighting Aran’s experience as a landlord’s estate, in relation to the Great Famine and the islands’ role in the Irish cultural revival of the late-19th century, connected with the survival here of the Irish language. Chapter Four considers utopianism, not uncommonly associated with islands. Chapter Five takes the ‘island metaphor’: ‘island studies … has begun to redirect and re-focus its scope of vision from thinking with islands, using the island as a mirror to hold up to the nation, for example, to thinking about islands themselves’ (p. 196). Matters such as marketability and its tendency towards exploitation are sensitively handled: ‘if one debunks, or, at the very least detracts from the myth of Aran as a type of prelapsarian Eden of Gaelic purity and spirit … the Islands may suffer economic consequences and face further de-population’ (p. 197). A scheme to attract migrants to Inis Meáin is discussed in this vein: how far should the advertising stray from lauding this ‘real heart of Gaelic Ireland’ into the contemporary reality that Inis Meáin was losing population and had few employment opportunities. Pride of place here is given to Conneely’s Aran writers to whom the islands ‘were both real places and imagined spaces’. The book’s final sentence looks to islanders to ‘stake their place in the pages waiting to be written’ (p. 260). Mairéad Conneely, an Aran Islander herself, has followed her own advice. Her <italic>Between Two Shores/Idir Dhá Chladach</italic> makes a significant contribution to ‘writing the Aran Islands’ and, given its confident handling and breadth of coverage, to island cultural studies generally.</p>
