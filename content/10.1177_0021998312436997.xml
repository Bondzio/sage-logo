<abstract>
<p>Drilling is one of the most important method for hole making in composite materials. Drilling of polymer matrix composites causes substantial damage around the drilled hole. Damage free holes can be made using modified drill geometry. The present research investigation focuses on the drill geometry as candidate parameter that influence drilling forces and drilling-induced damage. The four different drill geometries (solid and hollow in shape) are used for drilling in composite materials. The cutting mechanism of these drill geometries is substantially different, and therefore influences the drilling-induced damage. The experimental results suggest a strong relationship between the drill point geometry and the drilling-induced damage.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312436997" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymer matrix composite (PMC) materials have found increasing applications as structural materials due to their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties like high strength-to-weight ratio, high damping, low thermal expansion, good corrosion, and wear resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436997">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436997">2</xref></sup> Composites made by primary manufacturing processes are generally in near net shape. Intricate or complex composite products are always made in parts and are finally assembled. Therefore, drilling is most important machining operation practiced widely to ensure the assembly operation of the complex PMC products. A summary of research publications in the area of drilling of PMC materials has been presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312436997">Figure 1</xref>. The percentage contribution in terms of number of papers (total 182) published in the last 20 years has been used as the data. It can be observed that about 31% of the total papers published are in the last 3 years. Therefore, it can be stated with confidence that the area of drilling of PMCs has generated extensive interest among the research fraternity. The main focus has been to minimize the drilling forces (thrust force and torque) and the resulting drilling-induced damage.

<p>Mohan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312436997">3</xref></sup> optimized process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, drill size, and laminate thickness) in drilling of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) laminates for minimum drilling forces and delamination. Palanikumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312436997">4</xref></sup> studied the effect of feed rate, cutting speed and drill point angle on the resulting delamination factor. It was concluded that the feed rate is the most important factor which has greatest influence on the delamination factor. Drill point angle has limited influence on the delamination factor.</p>
<p>El-Sonbaty et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436997">5</xref></sup> investigated the influence of process parameters on the drilling forces, and surface roughness in drilling of GFRP composites. The drilling force increased with increase in the drill diameter, due to the increase in the shear area. Drill diameter and feed rate had significant effect on surface roughness. Faraz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436997">6</xref></sup> studied in-process drilling load profile and exit delamination in drilling GFRP laminates using various specialized and conventional uncoated carbide drill bits. Specialized drill bits produced much reduced thrust peaks as compared to conventional drill bits. Piquet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312436997">7</xref></sup> analyzed the effect of drill geometry on the drilling quality of thin carbon/epoxy composites. A decreasing feed rate improves drilling quality, but leads to increased wear and machining time. The modified drill geometry minimized or avoided the entrance damage, roundness and diameter defects and plate exit damage. Velayudham and Krishnamurthy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312436997">8</xref></sup> carried out drilling of GFRP composites with different drill geometries. It was found that drill point has considerable influence on thrust force and delamination, and tripod point geometry produced least damage due to delamination. Rubio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312436997">9</xref></sup> studied the effect of three different drill geometries, i.e. Twist drill (115°, 85°) and Brad and Spur in high-speed drilling of GFRP composites. Delamination decreased as the cutting speed increased, probably owing to the fact that cutting temperature was elevated with cutting speed, thus promoting the softening of the matrix and therefore induced less delamination. Tsao and Hocheng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312436997">10</xref></sup> studied the effect of eccentricity of Twist and Candle stick drill on delamination in drilling of composite materials. The delamination decreased with increasing degree of eccentricity. Lin and Shen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312436997">11</xref></sup> investigated high-speed drilling of GFRP composites using both Multifacet and Twist drill. It was found that Multifacet drills worn out much faster than Twist drill as cutting speed increased. Cutting speed does not decrease the thrust force, but delamination is slighlty improved by using multifacet drill. Paul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312436997">12</xref></sup> optimized drill geometries in order to minimize drilling forces. Three commonly used drill geometries (Conical, Racon and Helical profile) were optimized for drilling forces while maintaining the inherent characteristics of each of the profiles. A significant reduction was observed in the drilling forces for the optimized drills. Bhattacharya and Horrigan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312436997">13</xref></sup> investigated the drilling of kevlar fiber reinforced plastic (KFRP) composite with normal and modified drill under cryogenic and ambient temperatures. The thrust force generated while drilling at cryogenic and temperatures with modified drill was higher than that produced at ambient temperatures with a normal drill. Abrao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312436997">14</xref></sup> investigated the effect of the drill geometry and materials on the thrust force and delamination produced when drilling GFRP composites. The influence of cutting speed on the thrust force was negligible. The delamination increased on increasing the feed rate. Tsao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312436997">15</xref></sup> investigated the drilling of composites with two different drill geometries (Core saw and Core drill). It has been found that the Core saw drill was more advantageous than the Core drill. A low feed rate produce minimum thrust force in drilling, which can reduce the extent of induced delamination. Durão et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312436997">16</xref></sup> studied the five different drill geometries namely: Twist (120°, 85°), Brad, Dagger, and Step drill. It was concluded that Twist 120° should be used for minimum delamination as compared with other drills. Mathew et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312436997">17</xref></sup> studied the drilling of PMCs with two different drill geometries (Trepanning tool and Twist drill). It was found that drilling with Trepanning tool decreased the thrust force. Fernandes and Cook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312436997">18</xref></sup> proposed a drilling process of carbon composites using one shot drill bit.</p>
<p>A large number of modified drill geometries have been conceptualized and developed to produce the damage free holes in composite materials, but maximum of these are solid in nature. The work has been done towards understanding the drilling behavior of PMCs, but there has been limited studies on the analysis of the drilling forces in context of cutting mechanism of different drill geometries (solid and hollow in shape). The cutting mechanism of solid and hollow drills is substantially different which affects the drilling forces. The drilling forces can define the drilling behavior and drilling-induced damage in the composite laminates. The present research endeavor is an attempt to investigate experimentally the relative significance of the drill geometry, the cutting speed and the feed rate on the drilling forces as well as the drilling-induced damage in drilling of GFRP composites.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998312436997"><title>Experimental set up</title>
<p>The GFRP laminates were manufactured using the hand-layup technique. The woven glass fiber was used as the reinforcement in epoxy matrix. Araldite AW 106 was used as the matrix with hardener HV 953. A radial drilling machine with a power of 1.5 kW and a maximum cutting speed of 4500 rpm was used for drilling holes in GFRP laminates. The cutting speed was selected as 900, 1800, and 2800 rpm and the feed rate was 0.05, 0.12, and 0.19 mm<italic>/</italic>rev. The diameter of drill geometry was taken as 14 mm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312436997">Figure 2</xref> shows the different types of drill point geometries used, namely Twist, Jo drill, Trepanning tool, and U shape. The drilling forces; thrust force and torque were recorded with a four component drill dynamometer (KISTLER, Type 9272) with sensitivity of 3.576 ρC/N and 1.737 ρC/(Ncm), respectively. The signal was amplified with a Kistler charge amplifier (Type 5070). The technique of digital image analysis was used to quantity the damaged area around the drilled hole. Most of the researchers have used the ratio of the maximum diameter of the damaged zone to the hole diameter as the delamination factor. In the present experimental investigation, the drilling-induced damage was quantified in terms of the ratio of the damaged area to the hole area. The ratio of the damage area to hole area gives a more realistic measure of comparison than the ratio of diameters as the maximum diameter sometimes may not be the true representation of the actual damage around the drilled hole.

<sec id="sec4-0021998312436997"><title>Cutting stages in drilling</title>
<p>The drilling force signals were recorded using a Kistler piezoelectric drill dynamometer during the drilling process of GFRP laminates. The complete drilling cycle in composite laminates can be divided into three main cutting stages, i.e. indentation, cutting, and reaming action. The Twist and Jo drill consist of two cutting edges, and cutting starts from chisel edge of the drill. The drilling action starts from the center of the drill and further results in complete engagement of the drill with the composite laminate. During the drill movement, through the thickness of the laminate, the uncut portion under the drill acts as a overhanging beam and thus tend to be pushed down under the downward force generated by the solid drill point (Twist) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312436997">Figure 3</xref>. This type of phenomenon is not observed in drilling with hollow drills. Trepanning tool and U shape drill consist of two cutting edges on the periphery of a hollow cylindrical shank, and cutting starts from the outer periphery of the tool. This places the fibers under tension during the entire cutting operation.
<fig id="fig3-0021998312436997" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Cutting mechanisms of solid and hollow drills.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436997-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The force signals (thrust force and torque) while drilling GFRP laminates with different drill point geometries are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436997">Figure 4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436997">Figure 4(a) and (b)</xref> represent the variation of the thrust force signal with time while drilling with two different drill geometries, i.e. Twist drill and Trepanning tool. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436997">Figure 4(c) and (d)</xref> shows the variation of torque signal generated during drilling with U shape drill and Jodrill. In the initial stages, contact of cutting edge is ensued when the top layer is extruded to create an indentation. There is a sharp increase in thrust force due to the initial entry of the drill into the composite laminate. This is followed by further increase in the thrust force as the drill starts cutting of the laminate. When the cutting edge cuts through the bottom ply of the laminate, the reduction in force becomes more gradual. In the final stage of drilling action, reaming action takes place between the drill and laminate. It must be noted that the periodic oscillations of the thrust force within one revolution of the drill have been detected. It has already been reported by Di-Ilio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312436997">19</xref></sup> that the large oscillations of the thrust force during drilling are due to the inhomogenity inside the single lamina and to the presence of interface between the laminae. The continuous decrease of the thrust force during drilling can be attributed to the reduction of the laminate strength with reduction in the uncut laminate thickness. Finally thrust force drops to zero on completion of the process.
<fig id="fig4-0021998312436997" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Typical drilling force plots with different drill geometries: (a) Twist drill, (b) Trepanning tool, (c) U shape, (d) Jo drill (Cutting speed: 900 rpm, Feed rate: 0.05 mm/rev).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436997-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Similarly, the general form of the torque profiles with U shape and Jo drill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436997">Figure 4(c) and (d)</xref>) also comprise three distinct stages. The initial entry of the drill into the composite laminate causes a sharp increase in torque. This is followed by further increase in the torque as the cutting edges engage with the laminate completely. Therefore, as the tip of the tool breaks through the bottom ply of the laminate, the torque reaches a maximum. In case of drilling with the Jo drill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436997">Figures 4(d)</xref>), the cutting action is completed in two stages. In both the stages, the cutting action is similar, that is, engagement of the cutting edges leading to increase in the torque and subsequent fall of the signal on completion of the cutting process. Jo drill combines the cutting action of both the solid and the hollow drills. The primary cutting edges initially generate a smaller hole which is subsequently enlarged by the secondary cutting edges. Therefore, the drilling forces in case of Jo drill are lower as compared to the other solid drill point under investigation, that is, the Twist drill.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998312436997"><title>Drilling forces</title>
<p>It has already been proved that the thrust force varies with different drill point geometries at the same operating conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312436997">20</xref></sup> The drilling forces directly influence the drilling-induced damage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436997">Figure 5</xref> shows the comparison of thrust force signals recorded with different drill point geometries at the same operating conditions (cutting speed: 1800 rpm, feed rate: 0.05 mm/rev). The cutting mechanisms of the drill point geometries (as discussed in the previous section) directly influence the drilling forces. It can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436997">Figure 5</xref>, that the maximum thrust force is generated in case of solid drills (Twist and Jo drill) as compared to the hollow drills (Trepanning tool and U shape). The thrust force generated with the Twist drill is 2.5 times higher than the U shape drill.

<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312436997">Figure 6</xref> presents the comparison of torque signals generated during drilling with different drill point geometries at the similar operating conditions (cutting speed: 900 rpm, feed rate: 0.05 mm/rev). The torque also varies with the change in the mechanism of cutting with different drill geometries while drilling in composite laminates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312436997">21</xref></sup> It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312436997">Figure 6</xref>, that the torque generated with the Twist drill is 1.5 times higher than the U shape drill. It was also noted that the maximum torque was observed in case of both solid drills (Twist and Jo drill) as compared to the hollow drill point geometries (Trepanning tool and U shape).

<p>The feed rate has a substantial statistical influence on the thrust force as higher feed rate leads to maximum thrust force. Drilling forces are major factor responsible for drilling-induced damage which mainly depends on the drill point geometry and the feed rate. It is important to understand the variation of the drilling forces with the change in input process parameters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436997">Figure 7</xref> shows the variation in thrust force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436997">Figure 7(a)</xref>) and torque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436997">Figure 7(b)</xref>) with change in input parameters. It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436997">Figure 7</xref> that the maximum drilling forces were found in case of Twist drill as compared with the other drills. The minimum drilling forces were observed while drilling with U shape drill. The Jo drill results in lower drilling forces as compared to the Twist drill. This is in accordance with the findings reported by Kishore et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312436997">22</xref></sup> Mathew et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312436997">23</xref></sup> established that the thrust force generated with Twist drill is 2.5 times higher than the Trepanning tool. A similar result was found in present study. U shape drill was better as comparison to Trepanning tool, because U shape drill has minimum contact area with the laminate and facilitates easy removal of chips. As the feed rate was increased, torque increased for all drill point geometries considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436997">Figure 7(b)</xref>).

<p>Drilling in composite laminates leads to drilling-induced damage around the drilled hole. Caprino and Tagliaferri<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312436997">24</xref></sup> stated that drilling-induced damage in composite laminates during drilling is strongly dependent on the feed rate. When feed rate is high, the failure modes show the features typical of impact damage, with step like delamination, and interlaminar cracks. If feed rate is low, the failure consists of delamination mainly originating near the intersection between conical surface generated by the main cutting edge and cylindrical surface of the hole. Different techniques can be used to characterize and quantify the drilling-induced damage. Visual examination was used initially to get an idea about the damage area around the drilled hole. The drilling-induced damage area was quantified using digital image analysis using Image J1.42, (public domain software (National Institute of Health)). The drilling-induced damage was quantified in terms of a ratio of the damaged area (including the hole area) and the hole area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312436997">25</xref></sup> Drawing the circle at outer periphery touching the farthermost point in the damaged area gives <italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312436997">Figure 8</xref>. Bhatnagar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312436997">26</xref></sup> observed that the drilling-induced damage in woven GFRP laminates is spread all around the drilled hole.

<p>Similar to the findings of Bhatnagar et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312436997">26</xref></sup> the drilling-induced damage in the present experimental investigation was spread all around the drilled hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312436997">Figure 8</xref>). It can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312436997">Figure 8</xref> that maximum damage is visible in case of the Twist drill and a clean cut hole has been drilled with the U shape drill under similar operating conditions.</p>
<p>It can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312436997">Figure 9</xref>, that as the feed rate is increased, the delamination factor increases which are in agreement with the findings of other researchers. An important point to note is that the delamination factor with hollow drills (Trepanning tool and U shape) is lower as compared to the solid drills (Twist and Jo drill), which may be attributed to the difference in basic cutting mechanism of the two types of drills. The drilling forces recorded were also lower for the hollow drills which substantiates the fact that higher drilling forces causes extensive damage in the laminated composites. Similar results have been reported by Mathew et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312436997">23</xref></sup> and Tsao and Hocheng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312436997">27</xref></sup> establishing hollow drill point geometries as superior alternatives to the solid geometries. The findings further corroborate the idea of developing critical force models for minimizing the drilling-induced damage. The drilling of laminates below the critical level of forces will result in damage free holes. It has been found in the present investigation that the modification of the drill point geometry minimizes the drilling forces, which subsequently lead to lowering of the drilling-induced damage.

<p>The primary objective of the present research initiative was to experimentally investigate the effect of drill point geometry on the drilling forces and subsequently on the drilling-induced damage in GFRP laminates. The cutting mechanisms of the different drill point geometries were analyzed. The following conclusions can be drawn from the present research endeavor:
<list id="list1-0021998312436997" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The cutting mechanism of the drill point geometries under investigation is substantially different and it affects the drilling forces and subsequently the drilling-induced damage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The cutting mechanism of hollow drills is especially suitable for drilling in laminated composites. In Trepanning tool and U shape drill, the cutting starts from the outer periphery of the tool which places the fibers under tension during the entire cutting operation leading to lower magnitudes of forces and the drilling-induced damage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The thrust force generated with the Twist drill was 2.5 times higher than the U shape drill, therefore the Twist drill is not recommended for the drilling of GFRP laminates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The drilling forces recorded with the hollow drills (U shape and Trepanning tool) were lower than the forces recorded with the solid drills (Twist and Jo drill).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The minimum drilling forces and the minimum delamination factor were found with the U shape drill.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The drill point geometry has a substantial effect on the drilling forces and the drilling-induced damage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In future, intra-drill analysis (focussing on the hollow drills) can be attempted for optimizing the various tool angles of the hollow drills for specific composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics or kevlar fiber reinforced plastics.</p></list-item>
