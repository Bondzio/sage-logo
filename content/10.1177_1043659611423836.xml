<abstract>
<p>Guided by the cultural competence and confidence (CCC) model, the Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool (TSET) was used to evaluate the influence of cultural competence education on the transcultural self-efficacy (TSE) perceptions of undergraduate nursing students following an integrated approach to cultural competence education. Results continue to support that TSE is influenced by formalized education and other learning experiences. As hypothesized, compared with novice students, advanced students’ scores were higher for all subscales in both cross-sectional (<italic>n</italic> = 147) and longitudinal (<italic>n</italic> = 36) study designs. Results from analysis of variance and covariance demonstrated that none of the demographic variables predicted change; semester was the sole predictor, lending additional support that (a) the educational interventions throughout the four semesters influenced TSE changes and (b) all students regardless of background benefit (and require) formalized cultural competence education. Implications for nurse educators conclude the article.</p>

<p>Eliminating health disparities, improving patient outcomes, recruiting and retaining a more diverse workforce, preventing multicultural workplace conflict, and facilitating patient and employee satisfaction requires cultural competence. Providing culturally specific (competent) health care to a multitude of culturally diverse patients and promoting multicultural workplace harmony among an increasingly diverse workforce demand that all health care professionals become actively engaged in the process of cultural competence development. Such engagement necessitates an ongoing commitment to lifelong learning that goes beyond a minimum level of competence toward the pinnacle—<italic>optimal cultural competence</italic>. “<italic>Optimal cultural competence</italic> embraces the diversity of diversity, requires ongoing active learning, fosters multicultural workplace harmony, and promotes the delivery of the highest level of culturally congruent patient care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>, p. xvii).</p>
<p>Nurse educators are in a unique position to spark and nurture cultural competence development in students. Unquestionably, implementing innovative, evidence-based educational activities that promote positive learning outcomes for culturally diverse students remains a challenge. Although the need to prepare students to become culturally sensitive and competent is extremely urgent, ongoing research in the area of understanding the teaching–learning process of cultural competency is needed. Research priorities, guided by conceptual models must shift toward developing diagnostic–prescriptive teaching interventions partnered with ongoing evaluation of teaching–learning outcomes. Such an approach must recognize that despite the learning opportunities presented, some individuals are intrinsically motivated to engage in cultural competency development whereas others are not.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611423836">Bandura (1986)</xref>, learning and motivation for learning are directly influenced by self-efficacy perceptions (confidence). Self-efficacy is the perceived confidence for learning or performing specific tasks or skills necessary to achieve a particular goal despite obstacles and hardships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611423836">Bandura, 1986</xref>). Self-efficacy has been strongly linked to commitment, persistence behaviors, and motivation. Consequently, confidence is a vital component in the process of learning cultural competence and has been conceptualized as <italic>transcultural self-efficacy</italic> (TSE). TSE is the perceived confidence for performing or learning transcultural nursing skills. It is the degree to which individuals perceive they have the ability to perform the specific transcultural nursing skills needed for culturally competent and congruent care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2000</xref>). Within the context of self-efficacy theory, individuals with resilient TSE perceptions will be motivated and committed to learning, and performing culturally competent nursing care.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of cultural competence education on the TSE perceptions of associate degree nursing students following an integrated approach to cultural competence education at a particular institution. Results would be used to guide ongoing curricular evaluation and innovations. The following research questions were addressed: (a) What are the differences in TSE perceptions between novice and advanced students?, (b) What are the changes in TSE perceptions following formalized educational experiences and/or other learning experiences integrated throughout the curriculum?, and (c) What is the influence of select demographic variables on TSE perceptions? We hypothesized that advanced students would display higher TSE perceptions compared with novice students; students’ TSE perceptions would enhance following a formalized educational experience and that there would be no relationship between select demographic variables and TSE perception or changes in TSE perception. Another purpose of this article was to compare and contrast findings between a cross-sectional design and a longitudinal design. Both study designs have advantages and disadvantages when evaluating curricula; yet few articles have examined curricula using a multimethod approach. Implications for nurse educators conclude the article.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework and Background</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys’s (2010a)</xref> cultural competence and confidence (CCC) model is a theoretical framework for teaching cultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611423836">Douglas &amp; Pacquiao, 2010</xref>).The construct of TSE (confidence) is as a major influencing factor within this framework. Cultural competence is defined as a multidimensional learning process that integrates transcultural skills in all three educational learning domains (cognitive, practical, and affective), involves TSE (confidence) as a major influencing factor, and aims to achieve cultural congruent care. Transcultural nursing skills are those skills necessary for assessing, planning, implementing, and evaluating culturally congruent care. They include cognitive, practical, and affective dimensions. Consistent with Bandura’s theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611423836">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611423836">1989</xref>), the model recognizes that self-efficacy and skill attainment can change over time as a result of formalized education and other learning experiences. The CCC model acknowledges that cultural competence is a lifelong learning process, not an endpoint or product of learning. Formalized educational and client learning experiences that (a) weave cognitive, practical, and affective transcultural nursing skills; (b) include assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation; and (c) incorporate self-efficacy appraisals and diagnostic-specific interventions are essential to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>As lifelong, ongoing cultural competence development is an essential professional expectation among many health professions, it is extremely urgent that initial professional education emphasizes cultural competence. Entry-level education offers the greatest possibilities, particularly the first fundamentals course, because it provides the foundation for all future courses and professional practice. A required prerequisite or corequisite transcultural nursing course optimizes the possibility for a stronger foundation for cultural competence development. Unfortunately, the time and credit constraints of associate degree nursing programs may prohibit an added course. Numerically, associate degree nursing programs have the potential to make enormous strides in cultural competence development because (a) enrollment in such programs is greatest than any other nursing degree program and (b) the student population represents the greatest diversity than any other nursing degree program. This goal of cultural competence development can only occur with well-qualified, committed nursing faculty and through the use of culturally congruent teaching–learning strategies that address the unique needs of nontraditional students whose academic needs, cultural values and beliefs, age, and lifestyle are quite diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Nurse educators are empowered to make a tremendous difference by introducing, fostering, and nurturing cultural competence development. Each individual faculty member is empowered to make a positive difference; however, the greatest impact will be achieved through a coordinated, holistic group effort that thoughtfully weaves together nursing course components, nursing curriculum, and supplementary resources. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>, p. 119)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, nursing faculty at a northeastern United States public institution worked collaboratively to prioritize, strengthen, and integrate cultural competence education for a nontraditional nursing student population more visibly throughout all curricula (AAS, RN-BS, MS) and the nursing department. Namely, the following strategies were implemented to enhance the already existing cultural competence attributes within the department: (a) faculty professional development program on enhancing nontraditional nursing student retention and success; (b) faculty professional development program on enhancing cultural competence education throughout the curriculum; (c) book purchases, raffles, and distribution on the above two topics; (d) development of a state accredited advanced certificate program in cultural competence; (e) unanimous approval by curriculum committee to measure cultural competence education initiatives using the Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool (TSET); (f) faculty’s unanimous verbalized commitment to integrate and share new teaching–learning strategies and topics to enhance cultural competence throughout courses; (g) expanded supplementary resources (library books, journals, databases, and personnel expertise) addressing cultural issues and health; and (h) publicity of transcultural nursing and the events of the local Northeast Chapter of the Transcultural Nursing Society on a student-designed bulletin board that visibly showcased the value of diversity within nursing and society.</p>
<p>The associate degree clinical nursing curriculum consists of two 15-week medical–surgical nursing courses followed by four 7.5-week courses that include clinical rotations in critical care, mental health, pediatrics, and maternity/nursery. Nursing fundamentals and cultural competence is introduced on the first day of the first nursing course and is integrated throughout the curriculum in clinical, classroom, and laboratory components. For example, the first course included several comprehensive learner-centered strategies to provide substantive foundational learning such as <italic>Cultural Discovery</italic> (CD) and Integrated Skills (IS). With a focus on culture, aging, and health, CD emphasized learning outcomes in the cognitive, practical, and affective domains and comprised several components in conjunction with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611423836">Leininger (1991)</xref>, “Acculturation Health Care Assessment Enabler for Cultural Patterns in Traditional and Nontraditional Lifeways.” Specifically, CD included the following: background reading assignments, classroom activity component, collaborative library introductory program, online cultural resource tutorial program, videotape program, interview, literature review, reflection, and written paper assignment. Implemented over an 8-week period, CD assisted beginning nursing students to systematically conduct a basic cultural assessment, identify some similarities and differences among individuals within cultural groups, distinguish between varying dimensions of acculturation, and discover the importance of culturally competent care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; O’Donnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, O’Donnell, &amp; Xiao, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The IS strategy aimed to integrate and synthesize key concepts, skills, and professional values addressed through the semester in lecture/theory, nursing skills lab (NSL), and clinical. Cultural competence was an integral component. In preparation for the IS strategy, NSL faculty met with course leaders and skills lab technicians. An IS template for charts, reports, scenarios, medications, treatments, and so on, were created; each of the 10 patients (mannequins) were given a name, background information, and cultural scenario script representing different ethnic, racial, gender, socioeconomic, health care insurance, age, sexual orientation/lifestyle, and religious groups. Strategy components included: prerequisite assignment, preconference, paired group assignment, data gathering, culturally congruent nursing actions within the 2-hour time frame (assessment, treatments, medications, teaching, referral/collaboration, delegation, report, nursing diagnoses, documentation), large group debriefing, individual written reflection, large group discussion, and summary conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>). In addition, the first course and subsequent courses incorporated and expanded culture within such strategies as case exemplars for clinical and workplace topics, exam questions, in-class 2-minute written reflections, computer-assisted instructional programs, small group activities, videos, clinical pre- and postconferences, nursing care plans and/or other written assignments, and students’ end-of-semester clinical evaluation forms. Culturally and linguistically diverse nursing student mentors assisted students throughout the curriculum via multidimensional services implemented in the Nursing Student Resource Center and Nursing Student Test Prep Center, components of the “nursing neighborhood” to enrich learning, enhance professional and social integration, promote retention, and maximize success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2004</xref>). The center showcased posters and articles featuring culturally diverse nurses and patients in a variety of health care settings, creating an open, caring, learning community that outwardly embraced diversity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1043659611423836">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Approval for the study was obtained from the institution’s institutional review board (IRB), chairperson, faculty, and the grant-supporting agency. Personal and written collaboration with the faculty emphasized the need for consistent data collection procedures. A packet consisting of (a) cover letter describing the nature of the study with a detailed instruction sheet for instrument administration and collection, (b) student consent form, and (c) the questionnaires was distributed to faculty. Course instructors distributed the consent form and questionnaires to nursing students and then stepped outside the classroom while students completed questionnaires voluntarily; students had the right to opt out of the study without penalty.</p>
<p>The TSET was administered at the beginning of the semester to all students enrolled in the first semester nursing course during Fall 2007 or Spring 2008 and then again during the last 6 weeks of the Spring 2009 or Fall 2009 semester. Because the first semester students would be aggregated into the longitudinal study, an IRB-approved personal coding system was used to match questionnaires while still maintaining anonymity. For the cross-sectional study, fourth semester students completed the TSET anonymously during the last 6 weeks of the Fall 2007 semester without the personal coding system cover sheet. All students were asked to complete a brief demographic data sheet (DDS) attached as the last page of the TSET. Students placed completed questionnaires and consent forms in the designated collection box; course instructors returned all materials to the researcher. Because the researcher taught the first semester nursing course, another faculty member collected data from the researcher’s class using the prescribed protocol.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The purposive cross-sectional sample of novice (first) and advanced (fourth) semester students was derived from a larger study sample (<italic>n</italic> = 272) of all associate degree nursing students enrolled at a public northeastern U.S. university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Dogan, 2010</xref>) and yielded a final sample size of 147. The purposive longitudinal sample, drawn from the same university, consisted of all consenting students with usable and matching data (<italic>n</italic> = 36). As anticipated with high numbers of academically diverse, nontraditional commuter nursing students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611423836">Bean &amp; Metzner, 1985</xref>), high attrition rates from the first nursing course (typically, 25%-30%) and subsequent stopouts and/or dropouts throughout the four nursing semesters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2007</xref>) yielded high mortality with the longitudinal sample over a 2-year period. First semester pretest data was collected from 186 students, yet only 81 students completed posttest data and of those students, only 36 could be matched with pretests. Students stopping out and reentering the program at any given point during the 6 nursing courses contributed to the low matching capability. Imputation of missing data for a few students is detailed under the data analysis section. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611423836">Table 1</xref> describes both samples in more detail.</p>

<title>Instrument</title>
<p>TSET is a valid, reliable tool effectively used to measure changes in TSE perceptions following educational interventions with nursing students and nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Dogan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Smodlaka, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611423836">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611423836">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611423836">1999b</xref>). In addition, the TSET has been (a) adapted into a multidisciplinary health care provider version for use with multidisciplinary health provider groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611423836">Marrone, 2010</xref>); (b) adapted into a physician version for use in Australian medical schools (Shadbolt, personal communication, October 29, 2004); (c) used to evaluate/guide curriculum in California medical and dental schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611423836">Wilson &amp; Houghtaling, 2001</xref>); d) requested by researchers worldwide in various disciplines; and e) translated into several languages from English. Based on the literature and the results of a preliminary two-phase evaluation study, the 83 item TSET was originally designed to measure and evaluate students’ confidence for performing general transcultural nursing skills among diverse populations. The TSET design process included item development, item sequence, subscale sequence, expert content review, expert psychometric review, revised draft, pretest, minor revisions, and a second pretest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Smodlaka, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Three subscales tap the three dimensions of learning: Cognitive (25 items), Practical (28 items), and Affective (30 items). First, the Cognitive subscale asks respondents to rate their confidence about their knowledge concerning the ways cultural factors may influence nursing care among clients of different cultural backgrounds. “Different cultural backgrounds” was defined as clients representing various racial, ethnic, gender, socioeconomic, and religious groups. Sample items included health history and interview (Item 1), diet and nutrition (Item 11), patient teaching (Item 12), and grieving and loss (Item 21). Next, the Practical subscale asks respondents to rate their confidence for interviewing clients of different cultural backgrounds to learn about their values and beliefs. For example, respondents are asked to rate confidence for interviewing clients of different cultural backgrounds about ethnic food preferences (Item 41), role of family during illness (Item 49), folk medicine tradition and beliefs (Item 46), discrimination and bias experiences (Item 50). Last, the Affective subscale addresses attitudes, values, and beliefs, such as the following: accepting differences between cultural groups (Item 63) and similarities between cultural groups (Item 64) and recognizing the need for cultural care preservation/maintenance (Item 77) and the need to prevent cultural imposition (Item 81). Consistent with self-efficacy tool development recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611423836">Bandura (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611423836">1986)</xref>, the TSET uses a 10-point rating scale from 1 (<italic>not confident</italic>) to 10 (<italic>totally confident</italic>). Self-Efficacy Strength (SEST) scores are calculated for each subscale by dividing the total sum score by number of items (subscale average).</p>

Most recently, with data from the present study sample included as part of a larger study sample (<italic>n</italic> = 272), a common exploratory factor analysis (CEFA) using the most recent imputation techniques for missing data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Dogan, 2010</xref>), yielded four factors: Knowledge and Understanding; Interview; Awareness, Acceptance, and Appreciation; and Recognition with internal consistency ranging from .94 to .98. Reliability of the total instrument was .99. Analyses of the present cross-sectional and longitudinal studies yielded high estimates of high internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from .97 to .98 for the total TSET and from .95 to .99 for individual subscales.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Plans for dealing with missing data were mutually agreed on by the researcher and statistician. The cross-sectional sample had less than one missing response across the 83 survey questions. Nonparametric tests such as the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Kruskal–Wallis test confirmed that missing responses were random. Next, responses were imputed using a two-way imputation method using factor loadings (TW-FL) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611423836">Van Ginkel, Van der Ark, and Sijtsma (2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Dogan, 2010</xref> for more details). Missing data on the pretest and posttest (longitudinal sample) was also random with less than 0.01% missing variables. Imputation of missing data was done by replacing the missing responses with the mean response of the given student for all other items in the survey’s subscale.</p>
<p>Guided by the predetermined research questions and also typical of educational intervention studies, the data analysis plan included independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests to examine differences between novice and advanced groups for the cross-sectional samples and dependent <italic>t</italic> tests to examine changes between novice and advanced groups for the longitudinal samples. Statistical power for the independent <italic>t</italic> tests was smaller than .50. For the dependent <italic>t</italic> tests, power exceeded .80. In the case of cross-sectional sample, an analysis of variance (ANOVA), using regression, was conducted to explore the impact of select demographic variables on the dependent variable (TSE) and to test whether semester was significant in predicting TSE scores controlling for demographic variables. For the longitudinal sample, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to answer the same questions. Pretest scores served as the covariate in these analyses. Rigorous review by the IRB and grant-supporting agency provided support for the planned data analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To explore the first two research questions: (a) What are the differences in TSE perceptions between novice and advanced students? and (b) What are the changes in TSE perceptions following formalized educational experiences and/or other learning experiences integrated throughout the curriculum?, SEST subscale scores were computed by summing scores on individual items. Next, mean SEST scores were computed and compared each semester. For the cross-sectional sample, an independent sample <italic>t</italic> test was conducted to compare the mean SEST scores of novice (first semester) and advanced (fourth semester) students. For the longitudinal sample, a paired sample <italic>t</italic> test was conducted to test if SEST scores changed over time within the same group of students. When compared by subscale, the means were numerically higher during the fourth semester than during the first semester in both research study designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043659611423836">Figure 1</xref>). In the longitudinal study, statistically significant differences were found for all subscales (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043659611423836">Table 2</xref>); in the cross-sectional study, statistically significant differences were found on the Cognitive subscale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043659611423836">Table 2</xref>). Except for the longitudinal posttest results, means in all other comparison groups were highest on the Affective subscale and lowest on the Cognitive subscale. The exception pertained to the Practical subscale posttest mean being lowest among posttest means within the longitudinal group.</p>

<p>To explore the impact of demographic variables on TSE (dependent variable) among student subgroups (Research Question 3), an ANOVA was conducted for the cross-sectional sample, and an ANCOVA was conducted for the longitudinal sample, using regression. In the longitudinal study, gender, race/ethnicity, English as primary language (EPL), ability to speak another language besides English fluently, birth in the United States, and previous health care experience were not significant predictors on any of the subscales. The only statistically significant predictor was the semester (novice or advanced student), implying that the differences between the novice and advanced students were statistically significant controlling for the demographic factors mentioned above.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional study yielded some different results. A total of 20% of variance in cognitive scores was explained by demographics and semester. The strongest statistically significant predictor (the variable with the largest standardized regression coefficient) was semester; previous health care experience was also statistically significant. Only 6% of variance in cognitive scores was explained by demographics. Semester explained an additional 14% in variance above and beyond the demographic variables. On the Practical subscale, a total of 19% of variance in scores was explained by demographic variables and semester. The single significant demographic predictor was EPL. Only 11% of variance in practical scores was explained by demographic variables. Semester explained an additional 8% variance in practical above and beyond demographic variables. Last, a total of 35% of variance in affective scores was explained by demographic variables and semester. The strongest significant predictor was previous health care experience. A small amount (18%) of variance in affective scores was explained by demographic variables. Semester explained an additional 17% variance in affective scores above and beyond demographic variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results continue to support that TSE is influenced by formalized education and other learning experiences as proposed in the CCC model (Assumption 2). As anticipated, compared with novice students, advanced students’ SEST scores were higher for all subscales in both study designs, lending continued support for the underlying assumption (10) that “novice learners will have lower self-efficacy perceptions than advanced learners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>, p. 53). Notably, statistically significant positive changes in SEST scores demonstrated TSE changes in the expected direction among an intracohort group of associate degree students, despite the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 36). This finding supports the hypothesis that cultural competence education throughout the curriculum leads to positive change in self-efficacy perceptions. This finding also is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611423836">Bandura’s (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611423836">1989)</xref> propositions that different dimensions within a particular content area, measured by separate subscales, will result in expected changes in all dimensions (subscales) following an intervention. In other words, intercorrelations between dimensions (subscales) are expected; however, subscales should not be used as predictors for each other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, results demonstrated that none of the demographic variables predicted change; semester was the sole predictor, lending additional support that (a) the educational interventions throughout the four semesters influenced TSE changes and (b) all students regardless of background benefit (and require) formalized cultural competence education. This finding continues to lend support for Assumption 6 of the CCC model, which states that “all students and nurses (regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, lifestyle, religion, socioeconomic status, geographic location, or race) require formalized educational experiences to meet culture care needs of diverse individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2010a</xref>, p. 54). Sample size limitations did not permit testing possible mediational interactions between demographic variables and semester; future researchers can explore this if large enough data are collected.</p>
<p>Small sample size and the high mortality rate within the longitudinal sample must be acknowledged as a study limitation; however, the benefits of tracking a cohort group within the ideal completion time of associate degree clinical nursing courses outweighs the advantages of discarding data. Mortality is an anticipated disadvantage of longitudinal study design; yet only longitudinal study design permits the measure of changes within a particular group over time. Because students serve as their own control, the pretest–posttest design is more powerful than having a control group that might be different from the experimental group in many ways. Tracking the progress of academically and culturally diverse nontraditional students throughout a nursing program presents many trajectory pathways (such as stopouts) that further complicate longitudinal data analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611423836">Jeffreys, 2007</xref>). Despite these limitations, the data provide continued support for substantive introduction of transcultural nursing knowledge, skills, and values within all components of the first semester nursing course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611423836">Jeffreys et al., 2010</xref>) followed by integration throughout the curriculum. Ongoing curricular evaluation within the specific program as well as comparison with other nursing program curricula using similar methodology will add depth to currently existing data and guide curricular modifications.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional study design results permitted a snapshot approach, yielding a larger sample captured at the same point in time; however, changes in particular students could not be assessed. Such an approach permits quick feedback about general differences between novice and advanced students but is limited in demonstrating the significance of changes based on consistent (exactly the same) educational interventions given to the same group of students. Nevertheless, results in the cross-sectional study demonstrated higher means for the advanced student group on all subscales, although statistically significant differences were only detected on the Cognitive subscale.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious explanations related to cross-sectional methodology, several other explanations may be proposed but warrant further exploration. First, a recent factor analysis study using the cross-sectional sample as part of the larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611423836">Jeffreys &amp; Dogan, 2010</xref>) generated all 25 Cognitive subscale items into Factor 1. The Cognitive subscale targeted the cognitive learning domain conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611423836">Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl (1956)</xref>, focusing on the first two levels of “knowledge and understanding”; therefore, Factor 1 was labeled “Knowledge and Understanding.” From an educational standpoint, cognitive learning (especially at the basic knowledge and understanding levels) is easier to teach, learn, and measure changes than practical skills or attitudes, values, and beliefs (affective learning domain). The CCC model (Assumption 8) also proposes that learners are most confident about their attitudes (affective) and least confident about their transcultural nursing knowledge (cognitive). This assumption held true except for the rather small longitudinal posttest group. Typically, changes in affective learning is the most difficult to evaluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611423836">Oermann &amp; Gaberson, 2009</xref>), so difficulty in detecting intergroup differences on the Affective subscale is not surprising.</p>
<p>In contrast, detecting statistically significant intra group Affective subscale changes for the longitudinal study becomes even more meaningful as does the Practical subscale changes. Another explanation is that the research questions between the longitudinal and cross-sectional designs are slightly different even though at first glance they may appear to be the same. Research Question 1 aims to explore the “differences” between novice and advanced learners whereas the second question aims to explore “changes.” Although both the longitudinal and cross-sectional designs permit comparison of differences between novice (first semester) and advanced (fourth semester) students, the longitudinal design is best for exploring “changes” because the same student group is tracked and more consistency in educational interventions can be expected.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations related to cross-sectional methodology, several other interesting findings/issues must be addressed. First, the larger sample size permitted a more robust ANOVA and a more diverse sample. Second, the ANOVA analyses substantiated that semester was the strongest significant predictor of differences between the novice and advanced groups, suggesting that the impact of the formalized cultural competence educational experiences made a difference. Third, the strongest predictive demographic variables on each of the subscales made sense conceptually. For example, previous health care experience was significant for the Cognitive and Affective subscales. Previous health care experience fits within the CCC model as part of the “other learning experiences” listed with “formalized learning experiences.” On the Practical subscale, respondents were asked about their confidence for interviewing patients about various topics. It makes sense conceptually that EPL would be a predictor on this subscale. Students whose primary language is English were more confident about interviewing culturally different patients. Focus groups to follow-up with students about this issue would provide greater insight into this finding and potentially offer feasible, helpful suggestions.</p>
<sec id="section9-1043659611423836">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The validity and reliability of the TSET was examined by psychometric methods such as reliability analysis and linkage of findings with assumptions in the CCC model’s underlying conceptual framework, adding depth to the existing TSET validity and reliability estimates. As with all instruments, ongoing psychometric testing is recommended. The findings suggest that the TSET was a valid, reliable instrument for evaluating the influence of cultural competence education on the TSE perceptions of associate degree nursing students in this study sample following an integrated approach to cultural competence education. The cross-sectional design permitted a snapshot approach, indicating that advanced (fourth semester) students have higher confidence scores (SEST scores) on all subscales than novice (first semester) students; ANOVA supported that the strongest significant predictor for subscale scores was the semester rather than demographic variables. The longitudinal design permitted the tracking of a student cohort from first semester through fourth semester over 2 years; statistically significant changes (increases) in TSE perceptions occurred from first to fourth semester and no demographic variables predicted scores. Results were consistent with findings of other researchers and with the underlying CCC model. Although maturation and history are always a concern in education evaluation studies, there is no real way to control for all extraneous variables. Maturation and history are presumed to have been minimal with this age cohort of college students; however, it must be acknowledged as a methodological limitation. Other methodological limitations, such as sample size and high attrition (mortality) in the longitudinal study, typical with nontraditional student populations enrolled in associate degree programs, suggest that results should be viewed with these limitations in mind and recommend repeated studies with larger, diverse samples in a variety of geographic locations to enhance generalizability beyond one institution.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Implications for nurse educators include the ongoing design, implementation, and evaluation of cultural competence educational strategies within courses and throughout the curriculum using a coordinated faculty group effort guided by a conceptual model and measured by a psychometrically valid instrument. Use of the CCC model and the TSET among diverse undergraduate and graduate student populations will add more depth to the growing body of empirical evidence concerning TSE. For the program studied, the results provide valuable information to guide future cultural competence initiatives. For example, repeating data analyses when implementing a new cultural competence teaching intervention will permit quantitative comparative data to guide ongoing curricular development. The results demonstrated that even within the time and credit constraints of a 2-year nursing curriculum, (and a small sample size), cultural competence education integrated throughout the curriculum makes a difference. Consistent data collection techniques, well-planned research designs, repeated TSET validity and reliability tests, and detailed description of cultural competence educational strategies are highly recommended. Furthermore, sharing and dissemination beyond a single institution must be conducted to enhance the scholarship of transcultural nursing education and the profession. Nurse educators in all degree programs must become increasingly diligent in valuing educational and evaluation research and take the appropriate steps to assure quality dissemination via publications, conferences, webinars, and other professional forums.</p>
