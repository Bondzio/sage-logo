<p>The E. P. Pope Memorial Award is presented in memory of Dr. Edward P. Pope who was one of the founders of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD) and who served with distinction as its Secretary-Treasurer from 1950 to 1972. The award was established in his honor in 1974. The Pope Award is the highest award given by the Association and is presented to an individual who has made noteworthy and significant contributions to the Association in regard to implementing and advancing the recognition of the specialty of veterinary diagnostic laboratory medicine.</p>
<p>The 2011 E. P. Pope Memorial Award was presented to Dr. Barbara E. Powers of Colorado State University during the 54th Annual Meeting of the AAVLD in Buffalo, NY. Dr. Powers has worked tirelessly for many years on behalf of animal health and laboratory diagnosticians throughout North America, and her list of achievements and service to AAVLD is long: member of the Accreditation Committee for 12 years (1998–2010); member of the Executive Board for 5 years (2001–2006); chair of the Foundation Committee for 4 years (2002–2006); AAVLD Vice President, President-Elect, and President (2006–2007); chair of the Nominations and Awards Committees (2007–2008); co-chair of the Government Relations Committee (2006–2008); AAVLD liaison to the Government Coordinating Council since 2006; member (2006–2008) and then chair (2008) of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) Steering Committee; and most recently, co-chair of the Joint AAVLD/U.S. Animal Health Association Committee on the NAHLN.</p>
<p>Dr. Powers, originally from Schenectady, NY received her BS degree in 1977, and her MS and DVM degrees in 1981 from Purdue University. She then moved to Colorado State University (CSU) where she earned her doctorate in veterinary pathology in 1986. She became a Diplomate in the American College of Veterinary Pathologists in 1987. Dr. Powers has spent her entire academic career at CSU, moving up the ranks from assistant to full professor, where she continues to be a respected and effective teacher of pathology for veterinary and graduate students, serving on nearly 50 graduate student committees—all an indication and strong testament to her mentoring skills. Dr. Powers has served as the director of the CSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory since 1998. She has received numerous honors and awards, including the Smith Kline Beecham Research Award in 1993, the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) Outstanding Faculty of the Year Award in 2002, and the CVMA Veterinarian of the Year Award in 2005. In 2004, she was recognized for the Best Manuscript of the Year by the <italic>Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation</italic>. Dr. Powers also served her state organization as a member of the Board of Directors and then as President of the CVMA. In addition to her service, Dr. Powers has authored and/or contributed to over 200 abstracts and presentations, has been an invited speaker numerous times, and has published over 180 refereed manuscripts.</p>
<p>It is an honor and privilege to present the E. P. Pope Award to Dr. Barbara Powers, a distinguished scholar, diagnostician, and devotee to advancing animal health throughout the United States.</p>
