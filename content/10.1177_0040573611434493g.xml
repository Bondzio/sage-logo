<p><italic>Justified in the Spirit: Creation, Redemption, and the Triune God</italic></p>
<p>Frank D. Macchia</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010. 354 pp. $32.00</p>
<p>University of Vanguard professor Frank D. Macchia has established himself as a premier Pentecostal theologian, ably navigating other theological traditions as well as his own. <italic>Justified in the Spirit</italic> is a pneumatological enquiry into the doctrine of justification that attempts to resolve the ecumenical impasse between the Roman Catholic emphasis on infused love and the Protestant emphasis on declarative righteousness and individual faith.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections. In the first section Macchia explores the Roman Catholic and Protestant views of justification as well as offering a Pentecostal one. He plumbs the different traditions in an ecumenically sensitive manner in order to set the stage for his own pneumatological proposal. At times he includes some theologians that could be questioned by theologians of the tradition. For instance, Macchia attempts to rehabilitate Andreas Osiander, who was criticized by John Calvin for purporting a theology of infused grace. Macchia thinks that because Calvin saw union and participation in Christ as essential to justification, Osiander could help bring a Spirit-centered perspective that integrates justification and regeneration more closely. He subsequently constructs a Pentecostal theology of justification that makes divine love the highest expression of the Spirit’s indwelling expressed in the root metaphor of Spirit baptism. Macchia understands Spirit baptism in its broadest theological sense in order to articulate the role of the Spirit in the divine act of justification.</p>
<p>The second section begins with a discussion of righteousness in the Old Testament that is defined as God’s relationship with humanity and not as some abstract concept. According to Macchia, righteousness includes mercy and compassion and does not fit the later penal-satisfaction theory of the atonement. He then addresses his main concern: that the Spirit is at the core of justification as the triune divine act, in Christ as the Son of the Father and the man of the Spirit, and in Christ as the Spirit baptizer. By integrating Easter and Pentecost, Macchia attempts to overcome the dichotomy prevalent in Western theology that sees objective elements of justification as the christological orientation and the subjective elements as pneumatological. To accomplish this integration Macchia adopts the new perspective on Paul that asserts that the faithfulness of Christ to the Father is the basis for participation in the triune life. The rest of the book seeks to give the new perspective a firmer pneumatological basis. Macchia ends the section with a discussion of justification and Spirit baptism that strives to overcome the gridlock between Catholic notions of the fruit of righteousness and Protestant notions of declarative righteousness to assert that justification is God’s covenant faithfulness mediated in Christ’s death and resurrection through the Spirit’s impartation and indwelling. Throughout the rest of the section Macchia explains how the gift of the Spirit is related to justification, looking to the New Testament witness for support.</p>
<p>The final section explores the role of the Spirit in mediating Christ’s faith so that humanity can participate in justified life. “Believing faith” is mediated in individuals by the Spirit that allows people to participate in the communion of love of Christ and the Father. Faith, hope, and love are integrated in the Spirit’s justification. However, the ecclesial dimension of justification is mediated by the Spirit relationally in the embrace of the other. In other words, justification in the Spirit embraces a social reality through relationships, but also all created reality that is eschatologically oriented. Finally, Macchia addresses the Catholic/Protestant impasse that prioritizes love and faith respectively to argue that justification is divine infilling and new birth that draws one to participate in triune fellowship. This proposal has important ecumenical potential to break through the Catholic/Protestant divide.</p>
<p>Not everyone will agree with Macchia’s reading of the Catholic and Protestant traditions or with his position on the new perspective on Paul. Macchia not only embraces the new perspective but also gives it robust pneumatological breadth, though it would have been helpful to highlight his use of the new perspective earlier in the book. Nevertheless, <italic>Justified in the Spirit</italic> is a mature theological work that points in new ecumenical directions. The book is written for theological and ecumenical scholars who will find it thought-provoking. The fact that it is written by a Pentecostal theologian bodes well for the future of a Pentecostal voice in theological and ecumenical conversations.</p>
