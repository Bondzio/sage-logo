<p>“Facts” are seemingly everywhere. But how do they get there? This engaging and innovative collection of essays charts the lives and fortunes of these small, separable pieces of knowledge and explores how certain facts travel well, while others are consigned to stasis and the annals of epistemic aberration. The authors portray facts as potentially mobile through time, physical space and varieties of social space through diverse media, such as formal scientific publications, popularizations or embodiment in material objects. This departure from constructivist concerns with the social technologies of fact <italic>production</italic> in favour of a focus on <italic>travel</italic> renders the volume particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>A particular strength of the collection is its broad disciplinary scope, in both authorial expertise and subject matter. Historian and philosopher Mary S. Morgan’s edifying introduction outlines an analytical framework which posits that to “travel well” a fact must remain intact whilst acting “fruitfully,” i.e. inspiring new users and uses, and thus taking on a “life of its own.” Fifteen case studies explore these characteristics of well-travelled facts as the reader is taken on a journey of astounding contextual diversity. For example, we follow the Odyssean voyage of classical architectural tropes from Ancient Greece to nineteenth-century America (Schneider), the “battle” between competing claims over the science of climate change (Oreskes), and the mobilization of facts about rodent behaviour in cross-disciplinary discussions about the effects of crowding on human psychology (Ramsden).</p>
<p>Those interested in science communication will feel that the authors’ notion that facts travel better with appropriate “packaging” and “companions” could have been more thoroughly problematized, perhaps through consideration of the cultural cognition of scientific claims (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511407888">Kahan et al., 2011</xref>). The book may also have benefitted from giving greater critical attention to the production of facts, as there are some instances in the text where certain chunks of knowledge are treated as seemingly pre-given, stable entities capable of being inherently correct, or even “good.” However, the volume offers an analytically coherent and engrossing picture of the travels of facts which has a particular synergy with emerging work on the geographies of science (i.e. its spaces of production and circulation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511407888">Meusburger et al., 2010</xref>), while insights into the variable mutability of travelling facts will be of particular interest to those working within the social worlds tradition in science and technology studies. As a collection of analyses of a category of knowledge which has until now been under-researched, this landmark book should serve as an inspiration for similarly vibrant and inventive work on the dynamic lives of facts.</p>
