<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the emergence of a trans-disciplinary discourse of ‘visual culture’ must be understood as, above all, a constitutively urban phenomenon. More specifically, it is in the historically new form of the capitalist metropolis, as described most famously by Simmel, that the ‘hyper-stimulus’ of modern visual culture has its social and spatial conditions. Paradoxically, however, it is as a result of this that visual culture studies is also intrinsically ‘haunted’ by a certain spectre of the invisible: one rooted in those forms of ‘real abstraction’ which Marx identifies with the commodity and the money form. Considering, initially, the canonical urban visual forms of the collage and the spectacle, these are each read in a certain relation to Simmel’s account of metropolitan life and of the money form, and, through this, to what the author claims are those forms of social and spatial abstraction that must be understood to animate them. Finally, the article returns to the entanglement of the visible and invisible entailed by this, and concludes by making some tentative suggestions about something like a paradoxical urban ‘aesthetic’ of abstraction on such a basis.</p>

<p>‘The beginning of the twenty-first century is an exciting time for those wanting to understand the city’, assert the editors of one of a number of anthologies seeking to take stock of the field of contemporary urban studies. For ‘there is’, they write, ‘a growing realisation that the “cultural turn”, through its emphasis on meaning, identity and the politics of difference … provides the cutting edge of urban research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470412912468708">Eade and Mele, 2002</xref>: 3). Ten years on, the ‘politics of difference’ may seem neither quite so cutting edge nor so exciting. Nonetheless, such a so-called ‘cultural turn’ shows little signs of fading. This is not without its political risks – not least in a context in which we confront today what is evidently an emergent global urban society, largely expanding in the impoverished metropolises of the global South, with all the questions of economic inequality and social division that this entails. Yet if it continues to have a significance, it should undoubtedly lie in its reminder that such a condition involves not only the consequences of quantitative expansion, but also qualitative shifts: transformations within and between different urban lifeworlds, forms of experience, and processes of urbanization. Indeed, if, as Walter Benjamin once wrote, humanity’s ‘mode of perception’ changes ‘over long historical periods’, in a form which is therefore ‘conditioned not only by nature but by history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912468708">2002[1936]</xref>: 104), then it is the contemporary development of metropolitan form that is most evidently continuing to transform the modes (and not only, that is, the ‘contents’) of human sense perception – and hence of what Benjamin calls ‘the entire mode of existence of human collectives’ – in our contemporary moment.</p>
<p>It is in this light that one central aspect of the emergence of a trans-disciplinary discourse of ‘visual culture’ over the last few decades must thus be understood. Polemically put: the rise of visual culture is a constitutively <italic>urban</italic> phenomenon. More specifically: it is in the historically new urban form of the capitalist metropolis, and the forms of human collectivity which it produces, that what one theorist calls the ‘hyper-stimulus’ of ‘modern visual culture’ – its image ‘bombardment’ and ‘overload’ – has its social and spatial conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470412912468708">Mirzoeff, 1999</xref>: 26–27). While this may not be a contentious assertion per se, the more specific argument elaborated, by way of a re-reading here of the work of Georg Simmel – a source, if rarely acknowledged, of many of the most persistent tropes of recent discourse (including those of Mirzoeff above) – is that it is precisely as a result that visual culture studies is also intrinsically ‘haunted’ by a certain spectre of the <italic>invisible</italic>, and must be so; a spectre which is, in fact, central to Simmel’s own account of the metropolis’s new ‘sensory foundations’. Such ‘invisibility’ is not that of the ‘hidden’ or the to-be-visualized, as it has been for much of the Marxist tradition – recently criticised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470412912468708">Bruno Latour (2010)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470412912468708">1</xref></sup> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470412912468708">Jacques Rancière (2009)</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470412912468708">2</xref></sup> among others – but of that which is essentially suprasensible: what, in his late work, Marx came to term the <italic>real abstraction</italic> of that ‘self-moving substance’ to be located in the dynamics of capital itself, as it comes to structure the forms or logics of modern urban life (Marx, 1976[1876]: 255–256; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2005</xref>). Given ‘shape’ in the form of money (the central form, as we shall see, in Simmel’s theorization of the metropolis also) – and, hence, in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468708">Marx (1976[1867]</xref>: 168) calls ‘the finished form of the world of commodities’ – abstraction here is, crucially, not merely an effect of subjective consciousness (which might thereby dispelled by ‘seeing through’ it) but is that which is <italic>objectively</italic> constituted in the process of exchange, and thus assumes a contradictory ‘reality’ as such.</p>
<p>At the heart of this is that ‘very strange thing’, the commodity (p. 163), with its ‘double, <italic>differentiated</italic> existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470412912468708">Marx, 1973[1857]</xref>: 147, original emphasis), at once ‘perceptible and imperceptible by the senses’, as one translation of <italic>Capital</italic> has it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470412912468708">3</xref></sup> Formed via exchange’s abstraction from, or absenting of, the substance of use value (so as to make concretely different ‘things’ exchangeable), what is historically specific about capitalism, on this account, resides in the manner in which what ‘originates’ in this determinate negation of substance comes to take on a strange ‘presence’ of its own – a spectral or ghostly objectivity, to allude to the notoriously metaphysical language of <italic>Capital</italic>’s first chapter, realised ultimately in the form of ‘self-valorizing value’. Assuming primacy over those physical commodity objects that exchange is initially supposed to mediate, value acquires the ‘occult ability to add value to itself’ and thus becomes ‘the <italic>subject</italic> [or independent agent]’ of that process determinative of capitalism as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468708">Marx, 1976[1867]</xref>: 255, emphasis added). While this abstraction does not <italic>destroy</italic> the sensuous materiality of the bodies of commodities, whether these be coats, tables or buildings, insofar as, outside of ‘pure’ financial speculation, it needs them to be the bearers or avatars of value – indeed, in a crucial sense, it is the impetus behind their proliferation – it subjects such materiality to its own reality and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468708">Arthur, 2001</xref>: 33, 39–40). In doing so, value effectively ‘takes possession’ of its own material conditions, which thus become subordinated as ‘moments’ within its self-propulsion.</p>
<p>In this way, the commodity can be understood as both the ultimate source of a hyper-intensification of the visual within metropolitan life – ‘capital to such a degree of accumulation that it becomes an image’, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470412912468708">Debord’s (1983</xref>: §34) famous definition of the spectacle – but also of a growing sovereignty of that which, in its very essence, precisely <italic>eludes</italic> all visualization. Frequently confused with later, mostly Freudian accounts of the fetish – as the two are brought together in the work of Benjamin, Adorno, Marcuse, and others – it is important to recognise that Marx’s own conception of the commodity’s fetish-character<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470412912468708">4</xref></sup> is not, as is often supposed, that of a subjective desire as seduced by the sensuously perceptible advances of the consumable object – via the visual media of advertising, design or fashion – but rather of what is defined as the entirely abstract character of the commodity form as ‘value’ itself. For if, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468708">Marx (1976[1867]</xref>: 165) writes, ‘the products of labour become commodities, sensuous things which are at the same time suprasensible’ – <italic>sinnlich übersinnliche: ‘sensory super-sensory’ –</italic> nonetheless, as commodity <italic>form</italic>, the commodity is, he insists, absolutely abstract, indeed actually ‘ideal’; a ‘pure’ form without pre-given ‘content’. In the words of <italic>Capital</italic>: ‘Not an atom of matter enters into the objectivity of commodities as values; in this it is the direct opposite of the coarsely sensuous objectivity of commodities as physical objects’ (p. 138). Or, to put it in reverse, the ‘visible reality’ of the commodity has ‘<italic>nothing of value</italic> in it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468708">Arthur, 2001</xref>: 36; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468708">Marx, 1976[1867]</xref>: 177). And this is not because it is somehow hidden behind what customarily appears to vision, but because it is, in its very essence, non-perceptible. (Indeed, in a sense, fetishism just <italic>is</italic> the mistaking of value for its sensuous appearance.) The question is then: how to understand, as such, the character of this ‘invisible’ objectivity of abstraction into which not ‘an atom of matter enters’? What are the consequences of its apparently opposed relation to the physical or visible nature of those objects in which it is nonetheless ‘embodied’? And, above all, how is it that this contradictory ‘unity’ of the visible and invisible, the sensuous and suprasensible, comes to be paradoxically incarnated nonetheless in metropolitan form, visual culture and experience?</p>
<sec id="section1-1470412912468708">
<title>Abstraction and Visual Culture Studies</title>
<p>Not so often thematized as such, abstraction has certainly had a significant presence in visual culture studies nevertheless. Customarily, this manifests itself, at one pole, in terms of a certain name for that which lies outside the realm of the sensible, aesthetic or visual altogether – most obviously, the conceptual – and, at another, as a continuation of contemporary visual culture studies’ roots in specific forms of post-war social analysis, including Debord’s conception of the spectacle and, later, the Baudrillardian simulacra. More recently, there is an evident sense that the engagement with digitisation – with new digital media and modes of data accumulation – requires some sort of coming to terms with new forms of abstraction, although exactly what this is an abstraction of or from is not always clear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470412912468708">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, a certain problematic of abstraction appears in the guise of various accounts of a visual <italic>style</italic> of abstraction, usually connected to a particular delineation of ‘modernism’ and largely drawn from art history. This takes perhaps two main forms: either abstraction as a kind of visualised deracination of an otherwise vital and variegated reality – the panoramic or planner’s representational view from above, famously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470412912468708">Michel de Certeau (1999[1984]</xref>: 91) standing at the top of one of the World Trade Center towers, and captured in a certain mode of ‘modernist’ painting (Mondrian) or photography (Moholy-Nagy) as much as architectural or urbanist design, and, indeed, in the interrelation between the two – <italic>or</italic> abstraction as a form of flight from the commercial everyday <italic>tout court</italic>, as in much discourse surrounding post-war painting, which, paradoxically, presents itself as the assertion of a concrete and sensuous particularity to be found precisely within the materiality of the aesthetic object. In the case of the latter, abstract expressionism can, for example, be read then as combating ‘societal abstraction’ with a specifically ‘artistic abstraction’ which in fact ‘re-enchants’ the artwork by demonstrating that ‘sensuous particulars can <italic>mean</italic> … in defiance of any form of identifying mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912468708">Bernstein, 2006</xref>: 151–152, original emphasis); putting, so to speak, an Adornian spin on Greenbergian accounts of ‘abstraction’ as a reduction of painting to its essence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470412912468708">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The abstraction that I am concerned with here, however, is, while not unrelated to these meanings, neither that which simply distorts or misrepresents, lies above or beyond what is <italic>really</italic> everyday, a mystification, escape or structure of illusion – as it has customarily appeared in urban studies’ ‘cultural turn’, from Williams to De Certeau – but that which is, in many ways, the very stuff of everydayness itself: a kind of meta-physical ‘being’ which, following both Marx and Simmel, is nonetheless immanent to material social reality, and which, if it is undoubtedly intensified by new digital technologies, certainly does not begin with them. (This is also why, despite certain structural similarities, the problem posed by commodity fetishism should not be conflated with what in Marx’s earlier texts is defined as ‘ideology’ – for if fetishism is a kind of ‘false consciousness’ it does not belong to any ideological ‘superstructure’, but is precisely active at the very centre of the economic ‘base’ itself. Indeed, provocatively, one might claim the reverse: it is a rhetoric of the concrete which appears, increasingly, to take the form of an ideology today, a cover for the real dominance of abstraction in contemporary capitalist societies.) As far as the broad delineation of a modern visual culture is concerned, this must then be seen as the inescapable dialectical other to that new ‘dominant model of what an observer was’ that took shape in the 19th-century metropolis, and which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470412912468708">Jonathan Crary (1992</xref>, 6–7, 11) defines, via Adorno, as the training of the eye to perceive ‘reality as a reality of objects and hence basically of commodities’. In this sense, despite the recent enthusiasm for all things thingy within cultural studies – from Latour to Bill Brown to the so-called ‘new materialism’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470412912468708">7</xref></sup> – the problem of abstraction imposes itself in this instance <italic>not</italic> in fact as a removal from material culture, affectivity, or the everyday experience of the visual, towards some otherworldly theoretical realm, but precisely as a historical question of a material and visual culture organised according to that actual abstraction which is inherent to the capitalist system as such. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912468708">Adorno (2003[1968]</xref>: 120) puts it, in this regard:
<disp-quote>
<p>If it seems abstract, this is the fault not of fantastic, wilful thinking, hostile to the facts, but of the objective abstraction to which the social process of life is subject – the exchange relation. (translation modified)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘fault’, in other words, lies not simply in ‘us’ – in, say, an insufficiently materialist failure to attend to the reality of objects and things – but lies out there, and ‘moves within the object itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468708">Arthur, 2001</xref>: 41).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470412912468708">8</xref></sup> Yet, and as the juxtaposition of the two very different citations from Adorno suggest – and here is the difficulty, as well as the critical point – practically, the condition of this abstraction as itself actual does indeed require that it takes on paradoxically sensuous forms of some kind once it <italic>is</italic>, of necessity, embedded and ‘embodied’ within the whole range of spatial and material experiences of metropolitan culture. Hence, the sense in which the social ‘reality’ of the metropolis can, like the ‘world of commodities’ itself, be, simultaneously, a reality of all-too-concrete objects <italic>and</italic> a reality of abstractions.</p>
<p>If, as far as visual culture is concerned, this is, then, partly a question of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470412912468708">Crary (1992)</xref> terms, in a concept indebted to the early Baudrillard, the abstraction <italic>of</italic> vision – the redistribution of the visual according to a regime of equivalence and indifference, and an uprooting of the image from existing forms of tactile referentiality, which is canonically linked to, but not originary with, photography, or more recently, say, digital sampling – equally, on the site of cultural production, it also concerns the ways in which that which is itself (unlike the photograph) absolutely abstract – and, thereby, properly invisible – is, nonetheless, rendered paradoxically visible and sensible. It is thus in order to focus at least some of these issues that I want to begin by looking, very briefly, at two very familiar – even clichéd – forms of the visual image through which the spatial form and experience of the metropolis have conventionally been conveyed or understood.</p>
<p>The first such form is <italic>collage</italic>, canonically associated with the immanence of urban experience to modernist and avant-garde art, and emblematic of Crary’s regime of equivalence and indifference. The second is the spatial image of the metropolis as visual <italic>spectacle</italic> or ‘outward show’, which goes back at least to the coffee shop observer of Poe’s ‘The Man of the Crowd’ or to Baudelaire’s urban pageantry, with its Parisian ‘spectacle of fashionable life and … thousands of floating existences’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470412912468708">Berman, 1984</xref>: 143), but which takes on – the cinema screen displacing the theatrical stage – an intensified form in the developed commercial culture and mass media of the 20th century. Each of these will be read in a certain relation to Simmel’s account of metropolitan life, and, through this, to what I claim are those forms of social and spatial abstraction that must be understood to animate them. Finally, I want to return to the entanglement of the visible and invisible, and to make some tentative suggestions about something like a paradoxical urban <italic>aesthetic</italic> of abstraction as such.</p>

<sec id="section2-1470412912468708">
<title>Merzbild, or, Floating on the Same Plane</title>
<p>Let’s begin with a single piece of visual interpretation – indeed a single sentence – taken from the work of the great Italian architectural historian Manfredo Tafuri. Around halfway through the fourth chapter of <italic>Architecture and Utopia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470412912468708">Tafuri (1976</xref>: 88–89) remarks of the work of Kurt Schwitters:
<disp-quote>
<p>The objects all floating on the same plane, with the same specific gravity, in the constant movement of the money economy: does it not seem that we are reading here a literary comment on the <italic>Merzbild</italic>?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although it does not appear in quotation marks, the first part of this sentence is a more or less direct citation – one taken from a 1903 essay by Simmel, entitled ‘The metropolis and mental life’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel, 1997[1903]</xref>: 178) – which thus comes to function here as a way of mediating the artist’s work, reading the ‘artistic’ with the ‘sociological’, and hence opening up a particular field of transversal relations between the two.</p>
<p>In Tafuri himself, this is devoted, in large part, to an understanding of the metropolitan conditions of the early 20th-century avant-garde, both at the level of its formal structure and its context of reception. But Tafuri’s ‘transcoding’ of Schwitters and Simmel also opens onto a rather larger network of connections – establishing a relationship between, first, the forms of modern art and a hegemonic mass visual culture, and, second, between the spatiality of such a modern culture of the image and the totality of some larger urban space of which it is a part. That a certain concept of the metropolis, in particular, might broker these mediations is not a novel observation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470412912468708">Brian O’Doherty (1991</xref>: 44) also writes of the <italic>Merzbau</italic> in his classic <italic>Inside the White Cube</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The city provided the materials, models of process, and primitive esthetic of juxtaposition – congruity forced by mixed needs and intentions. The city is the indispensible context of the collage and of the gallery space. Modern art needs the sound of traffic outside to authenticate it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If this accounts for the urban conditions of collage as <italic>the</italic> core, cross-disciplinary ‘model of process’ for modernism, at the same time, Mirzoeff’s own definition of a modern visual culture as defined by ‘hyper-stimulus’, or by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470412912468708">Crary (1992</xref>: 23) similarly terms the emergence of an ‘overloaded and plural sensory environment’, owes an obvious debt to that articulation of urban form to be found in ‘The Metropolis and Mental Life’ specifically. As probably the most influential and oft-cited passage of the essay has it:
<disp-quote>
<p>The psychological basis of the metropolitan type … consists in the intensification of nervous stimulation which results from the swift and uninterrupted change of outer and inner stimuli … the rapid crowding of changing <italic>images</italic>, the sharp discontinuity in the grasp of a single <italic>glance</italic>, and the unexpectedness of onrushing <italic>impressions</italic> … With each crossing of the road, with the tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life, the metropolis sets up a deep contrast with small town and rural life with reference to the <italic>sensory foundations</italic> of psychic life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel, 1997[1903]</xref>: 175, emphases added).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In its most obvious reading, then, if Simmel’s work may be read as a kind of ‘literary comment’ on Schwitter’s <italic>Merzbau</italic>, it is because the latter’s own flow of images and objects is <italic>itself</italic> both a reflection upon, as well as mimesis of, such a ‘sensory environment’, with its ‘rapid crowding of changing images’ and ‘sharp discontinuity in the grasp of a single glance’, which defines the metropolis as a whole.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470412912468708">
<title>Metropolis as Display and Screen</title>
<p>I will come back in a moment to what can be shown, for Simmel, I believe, to be the essentially <italic>abstract</italic> character of this ‘plane’ on which such an apparently concrete flow of images unfolds. But, before doing so, let me come, first, to the second visual image of the metropolis I referred to above. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470412912468708">Benjamin (2003[1938]</xref>: 19–20) remarks, one of the more obvious features of Simmel’s 1903 essay lies precisely in the ‘preponderance of visual activity’ it traces in the big city. As such, the metropolis’s ‘deep contrast with small town and rural life’ – indeed, with all hitherto existing forms of the city as <italic>polis</italic> or <italic>urbs</italic> – is ‘set up’ not just by the increasing amount of visual imagery in the metropolis, nor by its newly discontinuous forms, but by the very preponderance of the visual within these new metropolitan ‘sensory foundations’. In this sense, if what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470412912468708">Crary (1992</xref>: 19) describes, in <italic>Techniques of the Observer</italic>, as the 19th-century ‘dissociation of touch from sight’ – its ‘unloosening of the eye from the network of referentiality incarnated in tactility and its subjective relation to perceived space’ – has itself a perceptual and spatial incarnation, it is that unfolded on the terrain of what is a specifically metropolitan space.</p>
<p>In fact, it is in just such terms that in an earlier essay, written on the occasion of the Berlin Trade Exhibition of 1896, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel himself (1997[1896]</xref>: 256) comments upon the immanently metropolitan character of the exhibition form, as concentrating, spatially, a certain new form of human sociation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Nowhere else is such a richness of different impressions brought together so that overall there seems to be an outward unity, whereas underneath a vigorous interaction produces mutual contrasts, intensification and disunity. Now this unity of the whole creates a stronger impression and becomes more interesting when one considers the impossibility of surveying the objects produced in a single city … It is a particular attraction of world exhibitions that they form a momentary centre of world civilisation, assembling the products of the entire world in a confined space as if <italic>in a single picture.</italic> Put the other way, a single city has broadened into the totality of cultural production … a city into which the whole world sends its products and where all the important styles of the present cultural world are put <italic>on display</italic>. (emphases added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘A richness of different impressions brought together so that overall there seems to be an outward unity, whereas underneath a vigorous interaction produces mutual contrasts, intensification and disunity.’ Does it not seem <italic>here</italic> that we are reading a comment on the <italic>Merzbild</italic>? Functioning as a kind of laboratory for urban forms to come, the exhibition is, then, the concentrated spatial form of what, in ‘The Metropolis and Mental Life’ essay, is termed that new ‘purchasability’ of things which the metropolis as a whole brings ‘to the fore’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel, 1997[1903]</xref>: 179): an entire object world rendered as a great accumulation of display.</p>
<p>In contemporary visual culture studies, of course, this world is most familiar as that of Benjamin’s <italic>Arcades Project</italic> and his contemporaneous essays on Baudelaire – a so-called ‘dreamworld’ populated by a cast of characters and new technologies that range from the flâneur to the ragpicker, the photograph to the daily newspaper. Here, the metropolis is precisely <italic>the</italic> site of new ‘consuming passions’: an intensely visual, new architectural instantiation of capitalist spectacle given shape in the arcades and exhibitions, boulevards, department stores, window displays (with new technologies of plate glass and show vitrines) and gas lamps lighting up bourgeois interiors and streets. The image, drawn from visual technology, most associated with Benjamin’s version of such spectacle is that of the phantasmagoria; a metaphor taken from Marx’s account of the commodity, but which is, significantly, already well established in a discourse of the metropolis as early as the 1820s: for example, in Hazlitt’s depiction of the Londoner as ‘he [who] sees hundreds and thousands of gay, well-dressed people pass – an endless phantasmagoria’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470412912468708">Hazlitt, 2005[1823]</xref>: 85). Extending this today, the media image becomes itself an architectural element, where digital technologies make the entire urban façade a potential media surface: a space of generalized display, or interfacing <italic>screen</italic>, on which, variously, television, advertising, graphic design, typography, photography and fashion interpenetrate and promiscuously co-mingle. Part of a process whereby ‘technology aims to permeate space with information – at once digital ornament and roving window’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470412912468708">Koolhaas, 2004</xref>: 327), architecture dissolves <italic>into</italic> the varied visual systems of communication at work around and across it, for which it becomes, in turn, a material-spatial ‘bearer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, and just as importantly, it is this, too, that has, in a practical sense, served to define the visible space of the metropolis as, experientially, the specific terrain of the consumer – a conception that has remained key to dominant understandings of the emergence of a properly modern visual culture, from at least Benjamin onwards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470412912468708">9</xref></sup> (As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470412912468708">Thomas Richards, 1991</xref>: 1, 3, writes of the Great Exhibition of 1851 – the inaugural space of an ‘era of the spectacle’ and a ‘specifically capitalist form of representation’ – it constituted a ‘monument to consumption, the first of its kind’.) This, of course, is the <italic>ur</italic>-form of Simmel’s exhibition as a single ‘city into which the whole world sends its products and … [puts them] on display’ (Simmel, 1997[1897]: 256). From Baudelaire’s ‘spectacle of fashionable life’ to Zola’s intoxicating <italic>Ladies’ Paradise</italic> to Simmel’s ‘purchasibility of things’, the ultimate horizon of the metropolis lies here in the fully-immersive commodity environment, extending far beyond the conventional spaces of shopping; an endless screen or ‘plane’ on which, without limit, <italic>all</italic> the ‘present cultural world’ is put on display.</p>

<title>That Strange Thing Money</title>
<p>It is at this point, however, that we need to return to the precise context of Tafuri’s citation of Simmel in his interpretation of Schwitters. For if the rapidly ‘changing images’, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel (1997[1903])</xref> marks as definitive of the metropolis, float ‘on the same plane’, whether in the artwork or everyday experience of urban life, in the collage or screen, they do so, specifically, for Simmel himself, in ‘the constant movement of the money economy’. This is worth reminding ourselves of because, certainly in visual culture as in urban studies, Simmel’s essay has too often been reduced to little more than a kind of fragmentary typology of discrete and more or less concrete urban phenomena: the blasé type, nervous energy, urbane intellectualism, and so on. In doing so, however, it has tended to occlude what is, in fact, the essential conceptual totality of the specific social and spatial dynamics that structure such phenomena in Simmel’s text: that is, their intrinsic connection to the abstractness of the money form. Suggesting, thus, in one of the essay’s two footnotes that his account of the metropolis as a whole might well be understood as merely an addendum to his monumental book, <italic>The Philosophy of Money</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470412912468708">1990[1900]</xref>), it is precisely <italic>in money</italic>, Simmel writes, that ‘all things float with equal specific gravity’ across the ‘screen’ of the metropolis. It is money, ‘with all its colourlessness and indifference, [which] becomes the common denominator of all values; [which] irreparably hollows out the core of things, their individuality, their specific value, and their incomparability’ within the metropolitan world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel, 1997[1903]</xref>: 178).</p>
<p>What does Simmel mean by this? Not, it should be noted, merely that the desire for money lies behind the production of the metropolis as generalized display, nor that the products thus ‘put on display’ are themselves realised commodities to be bought and sold. Rather, the crucial point is that their immanent unseen, and essentially unseeable, organizing logic is precisely that <italic>of</italic> the money form. It is in this sense that the metropolis corresponds to the emergence of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468708">Marx (1976[1867]</xref>: 1021, original emphases) calls ‘a <italic>specifically capitalist mode of production</italic>’: that is, where, going beyond an earlier moment of ‘formal subsumption’ in which capital ‘takes over an <italic>existing labour process</italic>, developed by different and more archaic modes of production’ (including, one might say, by older modes of urban production), capitalism comes to organise and assume possession of the processes of production as a whole (‘real subsumption’). To the degree that it thereby becomes what Simmel calls ‘the common denominator’, it is the money form that is, in turn, the <italic>condition of</italic> a generalized display, as it is of a cultural form such as the <italic>Merzbild</italic>; a ‘rapid crowding of changing images’ reflective of a system for which it is the ‘form’ of exchange that is the primary determinant of relations rather than the ‘contents’ organised by it. Reading back from Tafuri, it is to this that, in their different ways I am suggesting, both the collage and the screen give visible shape.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470412912468708">Crary (1992</xref>: 14) argues of ‘photography and other networks of commodities and signs’, both collage and screen belong then, in this sense, to a regime of equivalence and indifference that is typical of exchange.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470412912468708">10</xref></sup> Just as importantly, to the extent that this entails ‘an increasing destabilization and mobility of signs and codes’ (pp. 11–12), both also belong, at the level of form itself, alongside that mobility and uprooting which is definitive of the rhythm of the metropolis as a whole; most dynamically, when, as I have argued elsewhere, the latter reaches the point whereby it has no ‘natural limit’ as regards <italic>what</italic> can be exchanged ‘within’ it – every particular ‘place’, and every particular ‘image’, rendered speculatively equi-valent (and produced as such) in a universal circulation and exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, two consequent points require particular stress. First, if money is the dominant modern form of the abstraction of contemporary experience, the metropolis is not only its ‘backdrop’ or ‘setting’, in this sense, but its socio-spatial correlate; one that comes to set out on its own logics of development, and which is, by virtue of a global generalization of the ‘money economy’, certainly no longer restricted to any ‘classical’ Western European or North American form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2005</xref>). Second, and following from this, the space of the metropolis cannot therefore be reduced to a merely abstract <italic>negation</italic> of ‘place’ (analogous to the negation or ‘hollowing out’ of use value), any more than, say, collage can be regarded as a simple negation of traditional artistic hierarchies. The metropolis is not, that is to say, simply a form of ‘non-place’, constituted through some spatial manifestation of abstraction as pure loss or existential absence (which would itself have to be experienced, in some now enigmatic fashion).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470412912468708">11</xref></sup> Rather, it is itself the determinate formation and production of actually emergent <italic>new</italic> ‘modes of human sense perception’ and forms of relational being-in-the-world.</p>
<p>If this consequently defines the ways in which the metropolis re-places hitherto existing spaces of place with the production of new kinds of abstract spaces of encounter and interaction – in such a fashion that a certain abstract form of social relationality and experience really <italic>is</italic> its real ‘content’ (rather than something other which it has only formally subsumed) – these spaces, however, still nonetheless require various forms of the embodiment of exchange in precisely material processes: embodiments of abstraction, so to speak. Modern urban form cannot be reduced to the logics of capital accumulation, having always to be articulated with other, ‘non-capitalist’ (if not, simply, residual or archaic) social forms and relations; indeed it cannot reproduce itself without them. But <italic>it must reconstitute them in new ways</italic>. It is, in this sense, the dialectical entanglement of abstraction and sensuously perceptible difference that is condensed in metropolitan form and experience, as part of a process of socio-spatial instantiation and universalization of relations of exchange; something to which modern architecture, cinema, and several other cultural forms are key.</p>
<p>If I have gone into all this in some theoretical detail, it is because, then, what it must thereby place in question, if nothing else, is an ultimately unsustainable tendency to suppose that somehow ‘beneath’ the abstractions of metropolitan relations, at the level of everyday life or things (as well as of, say, certain kinds of aesthetic and visual experience), ‘we’ always still remain embedded in more ‘real’, concrete ways; ways that are then merely <italic>distorted</italic>, violently, in their formal subsumption by abstract forms. This is a presumption that remains apparent in, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470412912468708">De Certeau’s (1999[1984]</xref>: 128) influential account of walking as ‘an elementary form of experience of the city posed against those “theoretical” (that is, visual) simulacrum … whose condition of possibility is an oblivion and misunderstanding of practices’. Yet, in fact, the force of Simmel’s essay should be taken to demonstrate the degree to which metropolitan capitalist modernity is itself a culture <italic>of</italic> abstraction. This <italic>is</italic> its milieu; and no less in everyday (street) life. As a consequence, the very received opposition between the abstract and the concrete, the abstract and the existential, requires some re-conceptualization at this point. For, in actuality, the humanist, ‘materialist’ or vitalist search for a more sensuously real, visible or concrete praxis or objectivity buried beneath the forms of contemporary capitalism – whether in the ‘everyday’ or elsewhere – simply risk occluding the very historical specificity of those forms themselves that, in the real subsumption of the metropolis, precisely derive social cohesion predominantly from the reality of abstraction and its modes of connectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470412912468708">12</xref></sup> This just is the ‘secret’ of the ‘visual’ form of both screen and collage alike – though there is nothing ultimately secretive about it – that they are, above all, the paradoxical mediations of the irreducible actuality of abstraction in contemporary metropolitan life itself.</p>

<title>A World Which Can No Longer Be Looked At</title>
<p>In a passage that both Benjamin and Adorno were fond of citing, Brecht once wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>The situation becomes so complicated [today] because a simple ‘reproduction of reality’ says less than ever about reality. A photograph of the Krupp factories or the AEG provides virtually no information about these establishments. True reality has slipped over into functional reality. The reification of human relations, that is, the factory, no longer delivers human relations to us. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468708">Adorno, 1991[1958]</xref>: 128; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2010</xref>: 18–19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘If the world is to be seen <italic>through</italic>’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468708">Adorno (1991[1958]</xref>: 128) comments, ‘it can no longer be looked <italic>at</italic>’ (original emphases). What Brecht saw, he continues, was ‘that the <italic>ens realissimum</italic> consists of processes, not immediate facts, and they cannot be depicted’</p>
<p>While his assertion may be set forth in the first half of the 20th century, it brings us, still, to the contemporary heart of the matter. For Marx, the ‘concrete relationships of cooperation and dependency between different types of labour that are needed to produce commodities are <italic>invisible</italic>. They have no discernible social expression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470412912468708">Osborne, 2005</xref>: 14, emphasis added). This is precisely, of course, the basis for <italic>Capital</italic>’s metaphor of the phantasmagoria, in which social relations between people appear as social relations between things. And, like the phantasmagoric screen, the commodity as ‘social hieroglyph’ is indeed classically open to decoding, at one level, so as to render visible the machinery that works behind it:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470412912468708">13</xref></sup> what the money form conceals by making the social relations inherent to labour ‘<italic>appear as</italic> relations between material objects, instead of revealing them plainly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468708">Marx, 1976[1867]</xref>: 169, emphasis added). In this sense, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470412912468708">Peter Osborne (2005</xref>: 21) puts it, when ‘he wrote of commodity fetishism, Marx wrote not of a desire for commodities but of a displacement of the desire to know’. Or, of the desire to see.</p>
<p>Now, as I’ll try to show in a moment, this conception of invisibility is not nearly so straightforward as it might seem, but if the modern development of urban form, in particular, is important here, it is because it is the metropolis which, above all, spatializes this displacement in its ‘concretizing’ of that abstraction inherent to social relations of exchange. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel’s (1997[1903]</xref>: 176) words: ‘The modern metropolis … is supplied almost entirely by production for the market, that is, for entirely unknown purchasers who never personally enter the producer’s actual field of vision.’ What appears ‘directly as dissociation’ is, in reality, an ‘elemental form of socialization’ (p. 180). Crucially, then, a certain politics of the visible turns on bringing into the ‘field of vision’, via a spatial re-ordering in the image, what is otherwise invisible or ‘unknown’, abstracted or anonymous, from the position of either producer or consumer. And a well-established model of critique – as much artistic as political – resides in this possibility.</p>
<p>Visually, this is evident, to give one canonical example, in Dziga Vertov’s early soviet films, as part of their generalized claim to reveal a reality ‘without masks’, exemplified in those famous uses of reverse motion in the 1924 <italic>Kinoglaz</italic>. Here, cinematically sending meat back to the slaughterhouse and bread to the bakery, Vertov seeks to bring precisely what the commodity fetish renders invisible into the field of the cinematic vision; returning ‘food and objects to the workers and peasants who’ve made them’ and giving them ‘the opportunity to <italic>see</italic> the truth’ of production itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470412912468708">Vertov, 1984</xref>: 34, emphasis added). More recently, one might note something similar in the documentary impulses of, say, Allan Sekula’s <italic>Fish Story</italic> and <italic>The Forgotten Space</italic>, with its attempt to render visible the otherwise occluded fact that sea trade remains ‘an integral component of the world-industrial system’ – populated by ‘invisible workers on the other side of the globe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470412912468708">Sekula and Burch, 2011</xref>: 78–79) – or Steve McQueen’s film <italic>Gravesend</italic>, about the economy surrounding the mining of the mineral coltan which is used in the batteries for mobile phones. (The mine as that space which is exemplarily ‘hidden’ from view may, of course, be regarded as more broadly significant in the metropolitan spatialization of production and consumption. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470412912468708">Lewis Mumford, 1966</xref>: 508, seems to have been the first to note, in capitalism’s tendency to ‘turn every part of the city into a negotiable commodity’, the ‘generating agents’ of this increasing exchangeability were ‘the mine, the factory, and the railroad’.) Finally, we might cite, for example, the popular political writing and film-making of Naomi Klein, which traces the seemingly frictionless brand image, with its floating free of or indifference to ‘content’, back to the miserable concreteness of its conditions of possibility in labour. In each instance is found an attempt to expose, and hence bring into a field of vision, the forms and networks of production, circulation and exploitation rendered invisible within the metropolis as space of consumption and display.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is here, too, that a very particular kind of ‘collage’ practice returns. So, in his remarkable novelistic account of organised crime in the South of Italy, <italic>Gommorah</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470412912468708">Roberto Saviano (2008</xref>: 33–34), for example, traces the international systems underlying the fashion industry, in which we come across the following striking image:
<disp-quote>
<p>Pasquale had turned on the television and was flipping channels, but all of a sudden he froze … On TV Angelina Jolie was treading the red carpet at the Oscars, dressed in a gorgeous garment … An outfit that Pasquale had made in an underground factory in Arzano. All they had said to him was ‘This one’s going to America’ … He’d run his hands inside the legs and could still picture the naked body that every tailor forms in his mind – not an erotic figure but one defined by the curve of muscles, the ceramic of bones. A body to dress, a meditation of muscle, bone, and bearing … His rage was an end in itself, justified but pointless. He couldn’t tell anyone … He couldn’t say ‘I made that suit’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is a lot that could be said about this passage: about the relation between the ‘concrete’ body of muscle and bone and the ‘abstract’, spectacular body of the film star, for instance, and its relation to the spaces of production and consumption. But what I want most to emphasise is the way in which what ‘should be’ separate here, belonging to quite different spaces – ‘No one would believe that Angelina Jolie would go to the Academy Awards wearing an outfit made in Arazo, by Pasquale’ (p. 34) – are brought, momentarily, together to occupy the same metropolitan ‘reality’ in the image. If, then, as the Italian collective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470412912468708">Wu Ming (2011)</xref> put it, in a telling spatial metaphor, constructing ‘the largest possible distance between <italic>upstream</italic> and <italic>downstream’</italic> (original emphases) is the quintessential ‘operation’ of capitalism’s production of space, the kind of practice which would seek to close such ‘distance’ – if only in the moment <italic>of</italic> the image itself – no doubt remains as important as ever (whatever Rancière, for one, might seem to suggest).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470412912468708">14</xref></sup> Nonetheless, this shouldn’t be confused with some concomitant assertion to the effect that the concrete or perceptible thereby constitute the underlying ‘reality’ of capitalism per se, as if this really were all that lay behind the screen once we were to bring it into some other field of vision. Not because, pace the later Baudrillard, all is now simulation – Sekula and Klein certainly show why <italic>this</italic> is not the case – but because this can never be to grasp the actual abstraction which animates the whole, and which lies, so to speak, beyond any eye’s capacity. There are, in other words, and to put it crudely, two different forms of invisibility at stake here: that invisibility of labour and production that can, in principle, be partly rectified in the image, and that essential invisibility which just is intrinsic to capital as such, and lies inherently ‘outside’ the image <italic>tout court</italic>. One can show the forms of production and exploitation that commodity fetishism conceals, but one cannot <italic>show</italic> the abstract form of exchangeability that propels the social system ‘in the first place’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470412912468708">15</xref></sup> The problem is starkly posed in the closing pages of <italic>Gomorrah</italic>. How does one imagine that which possesses ‘no faces to visualize, nothing precise to fix in your mind’? ‘You may be able to picture the impact of the economy, but not its cash flows, bank accounts, individual transactions’, not, that is, those abstract relations constitutive of the economic itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470412912468708">Saviano, 2008</xref>: 282; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Rendering the Invisible Visible</title>
<p>Like Benjamin’s urban dreamworld of the commodity, the mobile and uprooted stuff of the <italic>Merzbau</italic> is all-too-material, sensual and visual. Yet what propels such stuff ‘floating on the same plane’ is therefore that which – like cash flows and financial transactions – can never be shown ‘in’ any urban stuff as such. To the extent that capital ‘appears’, it appears only in the peculiar nature of the <italic>relations</italic> between such stuff it establishes (i.e. in the abstract and ‘invisible’ form of that relation itself). And it is to this that, in their own ways, both the collage and the metropolitan screen give a ‘visual’ form. As such, it is important to emphasise that this relates less to what any such work, however epic, must leave out by virtue of its very finitude – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel (1997[1896]</xref>: 256) describes as ‘the impossibility of surveying the objects produced in a single city’ ; an empirical richness and complexity that is often manifest, as in Sekula’s <italic>Fish Story</italic>, in what lies unrepresented in the intervals between those images which can be displayed – but to what determines the fundamentally unrepresentable flows of the modern image-world, like that of money, itself. This just <italic>is</italic> the ‘dilemma of representation’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470412912468708">Fredric Jameson (2011</xref>: 6) has re-stated it in his own recent reading of <italic>Capital</italic>. ‘No one has ever <italic>seen</italic>’ capitalism, nor is it ‘ever visible as such … only in its symptoms’. Yet if, from this perspective, broader cultural anxieties concerning representation are, first and foremost, to be read then as consequences of the essential unfigurability of capitalism per se – for which, in Jameson’s words, <italic>Capital</italic> ‘gives us’ what may be ‘the supreme example of a dialectical effort’ precisely to ‘<italic>express the inexpressible</italic>’ (p. 7, emphasis added) – equally, this is less a question of an aesthetics of the sublime (‘postmodernist’ or otherwise), to which Jameson himself has often assimilated it, than it is about that dilemma posed by a reality of abstraction as such.</p>
<p>Culturally, in this sense, at least part of the history of what is conventionally perceived as ‘modernist’ abstraction might thus also be re-thought at this point, given that it is here, characteristically, that such problems of ‘representability’ and ‘inexpressibility’ are most clearly thought to be posed. (If a certain history of collage crosses over at this point with one of abstract painting or design, however, this is by no means limited in its significance to a ‘modernism’ in any restricted art-historical sense.) Abstraction, from this perspective, would thus constitute less an anti-realist flight from the social or historical – as, say, Lukács conceived it in his notorious readings of Kafka or Beckett – but, instead, something like the attempt to give a sensible form <italic>to</italic> abstraction, as it is generated within its social sites in metropolitan everyday life. And, indeed, it is in fact something very like this conception that we can, I think, locate in another famous analysis of metropolitan culture: Siegfried Kracauer’s 1928 essay ‘The Mass Ornament’:
<disp-quote>
<p>Despite what they [‘educated people’] think, the <italic>aesthetic</italic> pleasure gained from the ornamental mass movements is <italic>legitimate</italic>. Such movements are in fact among the rare creations of the age that bestow form upon a given material. The masses organized in these movements come from offices and factories; the formal principle to which they are moulded determines them in reality as well. When significant components of reality become invisible in our world, art must make do with what is left, for an aesthetic presentation is all the more real the less it dispenses with the reality outside the aesthetic sphere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470412912468708">1995</xref>: 79, original emphases)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This should no doubt be placed alongside Kracauer’s contemporary metropolitan sketches, in which urban space is itself conceived, typically, in terms of the encroaching power of geometrical form (pp. 37–39) – as he writes at one point: ‘The [mass] ornament resembles <italic>aerial photographs</italic> of landscapes and cities in that it does not emerge out of the interior of the given conditions, but rather appears above them’ (p. 77, original emphasis) – a shift from an historical space grounded in tradition to that ‘grounded’ only in abstraction. Yet, one should note that, precisely in this mediation of urban space and cultural form, Kracauer’s analysis here is not the standard or simple criticism <italic>of</italic> abstraction that it is most often taken to be. We should read carefully what Kracauer actually writes: an ‘aesthetic presentation is all the more <italic>real</italic> the less it dispenses with the reality outside the aesthetic sphere’ (p. 79, emphasis added). And this ‘reality’ – taking place within the ‘domain of body culture’ itself (p. 75) – <italic>is</italic> that of a ‘predominance of abstractness’; one ‘that encompasses all expression’ (p. 81).</p>
<p>Despite the evident critique of the consequences of a society in which ‘community and personality perish when what is demanded is calculability’ (p. 78) – with its strong echoes of the Simmelian account of money – such perishing is then precisely not ‘unreal’, the distorted version of reality produced by an abstraction imposed ‘above’ a still more real and persistent metropolitan reality that would underlie it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470412912468708">16</xref></sup> Rather, abstraction here is, at some level, the ‘realistic’ depiction of a situation in which ‘significant components of reality [have themselves] become invisible in our world’ (p. 79), where, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468708">Adorno (1991[1958]</xref>: 128) puts it, ‘the <italic>ens realissimum</italic> consists of processes … and they cannot be depicted’. In this sense, to cite another key text of early metropolitan thought, the mass ornament’s legitimacy as aesthetic – in opposition to the artwork’s cultivation of ‘outdated noble sentiments in obsolete forms’ (p. 79) and a ‘false mythological concreteness’ (p. 81)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470412912468708">17</xref></sup> – means that, <italic>contra</italic> Wilhelm Worringer’s famous distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470412912468708">1963[1908]</xref>), this does not so much oppose forms of aesthetic empathy <italic>to</italic> abstraction, but suggests that the possibility of a paradoxical empathy <italic>with</italic> or <italic>of</italic> abstraction might constitute the most appropriate aesthetic of modern, metropolitan cultural form: an abstraction ‘become flesh’, to use another of Kracauer’s phrases.</p>
<p>How, asks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468708">Adorno (1991[1958])</xref> in his essay on Balzac, is it possible ‘to conjure up in perceptible form a society that has become abstract’ (pp. 122–123)? The question remains a resonant one, as it did for the 19th-century urban novel; but perhaps never more so than in an era that unfolds under the dominance both of financial capital and of the global extension of metropolitan form. Nonetheless, whatever answer we might proffer to it – and in whatever way the ‘visual’ might be put to work in doing so – this can <italic>only ever be</italic> contradictory. The contradiction is, however, a real one; a contradiction formed in reality. A spectre of abstraction does indeed haunt visual culture, one that cannot merely be willed away via some call to the particularity of material or affective things, only appropriated and negotiated, rendering the invisible visible <italic>as</italic> invisible in criticism, as it is in the images that float, according to the same gravity, on the contemporary metropolitan screen itself. In this entanglement of the visible and invisible, there remains, still, a whole history of modern visual culture to be written.</p>

<p>One may be more or less convinced by Latour’s polemic against ‘critical thought’ and what he terms ‘anti-fetishism’ – though, personally, I’m not quite so willing to give up on critique. At any rate, it has little to say about what is so <italic>distinctive</italic> about Marx’s account of the commodity form: that is, the reality of its abstraction (which has little to do with ‘belief’, and which is, equally, quite different from that ‘regime of invisibility’ which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470412912468708">Latour [2010</xref>: 94] associates with science). This would seem to be a function of the ‘flat ontology’ that underpins actor-network theory in general, insofar as it dissolves any analysis of the relative power that different ‘constructions’ exert, while, ironically, rendering its own regime of equivalence a mirror of that very equivalence characteristic of the dominance of exchange. In ‘What is <italic>Iconoclash</italic>?’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470412912468708">Latour (2010</xref>: 76) writes that the ‘more art has become a synonym for the destruction of art’, the more this has constituted ‘a fabulous source of new images’: ‘a sort of “creative destruction” that Schumpeter had not anticipated’. Yet, despite the citation of Schumpeter – who is, after all, describing the dynamic of capitalism – there is no capacity here to think the very specific and <italic>overdetermining</italic> role that capitalism might play in this creativity. It is no surprise then that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470412912468708">Latour (1988</xref>: 173) should blithely conclude that capitalism is ‘universal only in the imagination of its enemies and friends’. But ceasing to ‘believe’ in money will scarcely serve to eradicate its very real, ‘universal’ effects.</p></fn>

<p>Rancière’s objection to such a notion of the ‘hidden’ rests on a democratic critique of claims to intellectual mastery, which would claim to ‘know’ the truth of domination unknown to the dominated themselves. Crucially, he traces this back to a specifically metropolitan world of the 19th century, in which begins the ‘image … of the poor cretin of an individual consumer, drowned by the flood of commodities and images and seduced by their false promises’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470412912468708">Rancière, 2009</xref>: 45–46). Although Simmel is not named here, Rancière’s formulations would seem specifically to allude to ‘The Metropolis and Mental Life’ in his attack upon what he calls a ‘paternalistic’ attitude for which the ‘stimulation’ of the urban multitude’s ‘nervous energy’ appears as a ‘grave danger’ (p. 46; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470412912468708">Simmel, 1997</xref>: 175). The major problem with this account though is, as I have argued elsewhere, that it has no means, on its own terms, of distinguishing between that ‘democratic’ indifference characteristic of a newly de-hierarchised circulation of images and that ‘democratic’ indifference characteristic of money, with which Simmel himself is principally concerned (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470412912468708">Cunningham, 2011</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470412912468708">Keston Sutherland (2011)</xref> points out, there is a sense in which the standard English translation of <italic>Capital</italic>’s first part as ‘Fetishism of Commodities’, rather than, as the original German (<italic>Fetischcharakter</italic>) suggests, simply ‘fetish-character’, is itself misleading, insofar as it wrongly implies ‘a mode of apprehending commodities, rather than … a character belonging to commodities themselves’ (p. 33).</p></fn>

<p>Famously, the beginning of McKenzie Wark’s <italic>Hacker’s Manifesto</italic> re-words the opening to the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic> to read: ‘There is a double spooking the world, the double of abstraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470412912468708">Wark, 2001</xref>). See also, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470412912468708">Manovich (2002)</xref>, in which of particular significance is Manovich’s definition of the visualization <italic>of</italic> abstraction as naming
<disp-quote>
<p>situations when quantified data which by itself <italic>is not visual</italic> – the output of meteorological sensors, stock market behaviours, the set of addresses describing the trajectory of a message through a computer network, and so on – is transformed into a visual representation. (original emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both Manovich’s and Wark’s text are interesting for the ways in which each – particularly Wark – defend the emancipatory and productive dimensions of abstraction against its usual designation as a mere form of loss or distortion of reality. However, and despite Manovich’s reference to the stock market, neither really develops the relation here to the specific forms of real abstraction inherent to capitalism, or to the peculiar ‘ontological’ questions it raises in Marx’s terms.</p></fn>

<p>The likes of Rothko and Newman similarly present, of course, an attempt to escape from the commercial everyday in painterly abstraction, but, more usually, in terms of a rather different emphasis on the spiritual aura of the art experience itself (the abstraction of quasi-religious experience here combating the ‘bad’ abstraction of commodity culture).</p></fn>

<p>In cultural studies, the most influential text has no doubt been the collection, <italic>Things</italic>, edited by Bill Brown, which originally appeared as a 2001 special issue of the journal <italic>Critical Inquiry</italic>, along with his own monograph <italic>A Sense of Things: The Object Matter of American Literature</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470412912468708">2003</xref>). Brown’s own engagement with Marx’s account of the commodity is, it should be said, rather more nuanced and lucid than much subsequent work, acknowledging, as it does, that, for Marx himself, ‘the aesthetics of the commodity itself are utterly beside the point’ (p. 27). Nonetheless, in describing as a ‘poignant contradiction’ (p. 27) Marx’s presentation of a ‘metaphysical condition as a physical event’ (p. 28) – specifically, here, the famous image of the wooden table in <italic>Capital</italic> that, as a commodity, ‘stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas’ – Brown elides the crucial point: that this is a <italic>real</italic> contradiction, definitive of the commodity itself. True, Marx does not ‘address the mystery of consumer desire’ (p. 29) or of ‘aesthetic fascination with objects’ (p. 31) – something that will, as Brown notes, be taken up by the likes of Benjamin – and equally, of course, Brown is right that the notion of commodity fetishism does not <italic>exhaust</italic> the object (the very notion of use value would make little sense if it did); indeed, capitalism positively requires forms of relation other than those of exchange (even if the latter does tend increasingly to overdetermine all the others). Yet, too often, in ‘thing theory’, such observations seem merely to be the pretext for having done with the problem of abstraction altogether, such that cultural studies may happily get on with indulging its <italic>own</italic> ‘fascination with objects’. The notion, at any rate, that psychological issues raised by ‘the human fascination with objects’ have become the ‘more pressing object of our historical attention’ than the ‘economic relation’ named by commodity fetishism in <italic>Capital</italic> says rather more about the ‘historical’ state of cultural studies than about capitalism itself, I fear (p. 31). For an extreme instance of the turn to the object or thing, and for an indication of some of its political consequences, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912468708">Bogost (2012)</xref>; in particular, its final chapter ‘Wonder’ (pp. 113–136). Provocatively, of course, one might well claim that the broader contemporary obsession with objects and things – the whole return of the ‘traumatic’ real – manifests itself here, above all, as the displaced result of a pervasive cultural <italic>anxiety</italic> about the very status of the ‘real’ under the conditions of advanced capitalism today. For an excellent and thoughtful critique of the ‘new fascination with the object’, the ‘seductions of immediacy’, and what she terms a ‘new animism’ in cultural and art theory, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470412912468708">Wolff (2012)</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>It also, of course, may be said to ‘move within’ the subject as well, or to turn the subject into a kind of ‘object’ in this sense; a different kind of ‘bearer’ or ‘avatar’. Appearing to the subject as simply a means to satisfy our needs or desires in exchange, from this perspective, capital in fact ‘uses’ <italic>us</italic> as the means towards its own propulsion and expansion. This is, no doubt, part of what Marx has in mind when he refers to individual capitalists as ‘personifications’ of capital.</p></fn>

<p>It is also crucial to the emergence of visual culture <italic>studies</italic>, by way of the latter’s partial roots in cultural studies’1970s shift towards a focus on ‘creative’ consumption in such pivotal Birmingham School notions as that of ‘resistance through rituals’. Where, however, in the writings of Stuart Hall or Dick Hebdidge, for instance, this shift still remained, in principle at least, oppositional – based in an assertion of the capacity of the inhabitants of mass culture to speak back in defiance of their seemingly suppressed or subaltern status – in much work from the 1980s on, this dissolved into a mere fantasy of consumption (or object fascination) as <italic>itself</italic> a ‘political’ act, effectively severed from its actual economic conditions in capitalist exchange. Finally, an emphasis on the point of view of the consumer, rather than the producer, is less a chosen ‘tactic’ than it is simply a function of the very spatial and social form of the metropolis itself, and the separation of production and consumption that its abstract form works to generate.</p></fn>

<p>This is a relation made explicit in Allan Sekula’s brilliant essay, ‘The Traffic in Photographs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470412912468708">2004</xref>), in which he traces such a connection back to the very beginnings of photography in an 1859 text by Oliver Wendell Holmes. As Sekula cites Holmes on the photographic process’s divorce of ‘form’ from ‘matter’, the latter articulates an explicit parallel to the capitalist exchange process, imagining photography as the production of a global encyclopaedic economy of images governed by ‘a comprehensive system of exchanges’ and the development of ‘a universal currency’ (pp. 147–148).</p></fn>

<p>‘If place can be defined’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912468708">Marc Augé (1995</xref>: 77–78), ‘as relational, historical, and concerned with identity, then a space which cannot be defined as relational, or historical, or concerned with identity will be a non-place’. As a concept, ‘non-place’ is, in this sense, exemplary of a failure to conceive of the negation of place in anything other than a negative form – akin to conceiving of ‘value’ as nothing more than the mere <italic>absence</italic> of use values – and hence as constitutive of a straightforward ‘<italic>emptying</italic>’ of individual subjective experience in what Augé terms a ‘solitary contractuality’ devoid of the anthropological markers of concrete sensuousness and orientation.</p></fn>

<p>Let’s take a typical example: in an interesting, if somewhat confused online piece entitled ‘Can Objects Perform?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470412912468708">2010</xref>), Pil and Galia Kollectiv rather ambiguously connect the concomitant turn to the ‘thingly’ in recent art practice – ‘flimsy yet carefully balanced assemblages, often incorporating appropriated bits and pieces, the detritus of everyday life’ – to calls, in the wake of the recent financial crisis, for a return to the ‘real economy of manufacturing and circulating goods at the expense of … incorporeal transactions’. The turn against an ‘economy of pure branding’ here mirrors a growing revolt, they suggest, against the conceptualist ‘dematerialization of art’ (always a peculiar notion). Yet they miss the essential point: capital as ‘self-valorizing value’ is, in a fundamental sense, <italic>the</italic> most ‘real’ dimension of the capitalist economy – in the sense that it is the most determinative – and the one that drives so-called ‘real’ production (including manufacturing) in general, just as it lies at the very core of the dynamic development and ‘creative destruction’ of contemporary metropolitan form. Here, too, today’s artworks of ‘appropriated bits and pieces’, drawn, like Schwitter’s <italic>Merzbau</italic>, from art’s surrounding metropolitan environment, are ‘all floating on the same plane’, still immersed in abstraction, still needing the metropolis as their ‘indispensable context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470412912468708">O’Doherty, 1991</xref>: 44).</p></fn>

<p>It is here, of course, that Marx shows most closely his debt to an ‘Enlightenment ideal of a world rendered transparent by scientific knowledge’, in which the commodity form is ‘something to be subjected to interpretation, a puzzle to be solved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470412912468708">Osborne, 2005</xref>: 20). Nonetheless, Marx is clear that any <italic>actual</italic> dispelling of the ‘veil’ of the commodity is not simply something that can be achieved in thought – such as through some speculative ‘turn’ to things – but only via the ‘real’ overcoming of capitalism itself. In this sense, it is <italic>socialism</italic>, as a qualitatively different non-capitalist future, that would actually provide a ‘transparency’ of socio-economic relations impossible within capitalism and at the level of everyday life.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1470412912468708">
<label>14.</label>
<p>In the context of contemporary art, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470412912468708">Rancière (2009</xref>: 76) may be right to express doubts about the ongoing standardization of practices of <italic>détournement</italic>, which no longer <italic>détourne</italic> anything very much, but it is far more questionable to suggest that such ‘devices’ which seek ‘the production of awareness’ fail because in fact ‘nobody is unaware of these things’. The problem turns, as I see it, on what it means to say that these are things ‘we already know’ or are ‘aware’ of. Even accepting this to be the case in general terms – which seems to me doubtful – it is precisely a facet of the forms of abstraction at stake here that ‘we’ may always both know and not know. When I buy a pair of trainers, I ‘know’ they probably weren’t made under the best of conditions, but this ‘knowledge’ is entirely abstracted – I don’t ‘know’, don’t <italic>see</italic>, the people who made them – and hence it is always easy, precisely in everyday life itself, to give in to the desire not to know, or to see. Of course, conversely, and as such, the sheer fact of ‘seeing’ does not in itself automatically generate any actual political response – this much may be conceded to Rancière – something evidenced by the shoddy emoting generated by a new television genre, in which subjects from the rich ‘West’, such as spoilt teenagers or footballers’ wives, are sent to the global South to see the suffering and exploitation behind the consumer products they enjoy, for ‘our’ entertainment and ‘their’ apparent education. The ‘lesson’, however, most often appears to be that we should learn to be more grateful and empathetic, but not enquire too deeply into the actual political and economic structures that produce such suffering and exploitation in the first place.</p></fn>

<p>Symptomatically, we can in fact see both of these relations between the visible and invisible, concrete and abstract, at work in Debord’s articulation of the spectacle, and what he terms commodity culture’s ‘generalized abstraction’, where they are frequently conflated. As that whose ‘<italic>mode of being concrete</italic> is precisely abstraction’, the spectacle appears, simultaneously, in <italic>The Society of the Spectacle</italic> as ‘the common ground of the <italic>deceived</italic> gaze’, which is to be penetrated, and as that which, nonetheless, ‘cannot be understood as an <italic>abuse</italic> of the world of vision’ insofar as it has indeed ‘become actual, materially translated’. Whether this means that the turning right side up of what Debord calls a world that ‘<italic>really is</italic> topsy-turvy’ – ‘at once present and absent’ – in the possible return of a transparency of concrete social relations, embodied in the urban form of the soviet or worker’s council, continues to find its basis somehow in situations that would still be possible <italic>behind</italic> the screen of the spectacle, or only as projected into some entirely other historical space, remains, to me at least, unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470412912468708">Debord, 1983</xref>, emphases added). Politically and culturally, at any rate, it is hard not to think that, from the perspective of any possible global social relations, a certain abstraction is simply ineliminable here – in which case, it is no longer a case so much of an appropriation in the name of the concrete than of an appropriation <italic>within</italic> abstraction itself.</p></fn>

<p>This is why, despite the analogical resemblance to, for example, ‘aerial photographs’, the forms of abstraction at stake here must, in their reality, be considered as also quite different. Indeed, in this instance, abstraction does, in some fundamental sense, ‘emerge out of the interior of the given conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470412912468708">Kracauer, 1995[1927]</xref>: 77); something which, ultimately, Kracauer himself does not quite grasp, insofar as – while resisting any opposition to it from the perspective of a mythological return to that ‘concreteness whose aim is organism and form’ (p. 81) – he continues to see abstraction as resulting, outside of science, in an ‘empty formalism’ (p. 82) deriving solely from the <italic>negation</italic> of sensuousness or material difference in exchangeability. However, like Augé’s non-places, this definition does not begin to account for the specific reality of capital as an actual (and productive) social form when it reaches the point of ‘real subsumption’ in Marx’s terms.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1470412912468708">
<label>17.</label>
<p>This, of course, concords with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470412912468708">Kracuaer’s (1995[1927]</xref>: 80) judgement that the ‘<italic>capitalist epoch</italic> is a stage in the process of demystification’. Its limits however lie not in this ‘demystification’ itself, for Kracauer, but in the fact that it is never rational <italic>enough</italic>; it is a ‘murky reason’ (p. 81) in which ‘mythological ties’ continue to persist by virtue of its failure to ‘encompass man’. As he notoriously puts it: ‘regressive’ critiques of capitalism ‘fail to grasp capitalism’s core defect: it rationalizes not too much but rather <italic>too little</italic>’ (original emphases).</p></fn>
