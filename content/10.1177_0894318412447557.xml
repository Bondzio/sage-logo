      <p>The integration of nursing theory into nursing practice is a challenge given that often those outside of nursing design the infrastructure and develop the policies for the many care settings in which nurses practice. This is particularly ironic because the majority of care and services provided to patients is by nurses. Hospitals exist in order to provide nursing care, however, nurses are challenged every day to find ways to work through and around systems that have little congruence with the values most nurses deem as significant and essential to good nursing practice, good patient outcomes, and satisfying work. In this column, Dr. Barbara Harris provides some ideas for connecting nursing theory with policy and practice by looking at a unique conceptualization of policy-as-environment. While many nurses understand the importance that environment has on fostering good patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction, many do not include national, state, and institutional policies as part of the notion of environment. Nurses generally are willing to make changes in the environment as commonly understood, but miss active participation in politics and policymaking. To create significant healthcare change nurses need to be leaders in the political arena and in institutional reform. We are grateful to Dr. Harris for addressing this disconnect and providing insight into the very real circumstance that is policy-as-environment.</p>
