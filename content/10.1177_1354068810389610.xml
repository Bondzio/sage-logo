<abstract>
<p>This article presents an inquiry into the causes of party-switching under two different electoral regimes. It exploits a natural experiment in South Africa, where a large number of local legislatures are elected using the same mixed system, to examine how the party-switching behaviours of legislators elected under proportional representation (PR) rules may differ systematically from those of legislators elected from single-member districts. It confirms the findings of other single-legislature studies in concluding that PR legislators are more likely, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, to defect. It highlights several characteristics of legislative bodies and legislative districts that influence defection rates for legislators in South Africa. In so doing, it uncovers evidence that, despite the young age of South Africa’s post-1994 party system, the unexpectedly large volume of party-switching that occurred there was neither a simple party realignment nor an opportunistic scramble, but rather a highly organized, structured and strategic market for parties.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When legislators are elected under the banner of one political party and, between elections, decide to switch parties, it raises interesting questions about representative democracy and its core institutions. There have been many studies of the correlates and consequences of this behaviour in the United States, where, compared to many other democracies, it is quite rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810389610">Grose and Yoshinaka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810389610">McCarty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810389610">Nokken, 2000</xref>). Studies examining party-switching in contexts outside the United States have produced insights about why and when legislators switch parties as well as what they gain by doing so. Even so, the number of comparative studies on party-switching remains small and analysis of party-switching remains an insufficiently exploited opportunity in the study of comparative party politics.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate because, as the authors of comparative party-switching studies have pointed out, party-switching provides an interesting window into some of the larger and more provocative questions in comparative politics concerning representation and the institutions and processes that facilitate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810389610">Desposato, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810389610">Mainwaring and Linan, 1997</xref>). In 2002, eight years after its first open democratic elections, South Africa enacted legislation legalizing the previously prohibited practice of party-switching or ‘floor-crossing’ in the national, provincial and local legislatures. The result was what Susan Booysen has called a ‘scramble’ to defect (2006). The broad political patterns of defection were not entirely surprising, as much of the floor-crossing clearly resulted from the break-up of South Africa’s primary opposition alliance, but neither were they entirely predictable. Especially at the local level of government, where there are nearly 300 separate legislatures, defections occurred with greater frequency and in more directions than many expected.</p>
<p>This study capitalizes on a South African natural experiment to probe two lines of inquiry. First, the study investigates the extent to which the ‘scramble to defect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810389610">Booysen, 2006</xref>) in South Africa was, as some have described it, a largely unconstrained, unpatterned and opportunistic affair. Second, the study probes the extent to which electoral rules structure and constrained the party-switching behaviour of those they placed into office. The study finds evidence that, despite the high volume of party-switching that occurred in South Africa, there is strong evidence that the switching patterns observed there were highly structured by an electoral connection between representatives and their parties as well as between representatives and their constituents. The study is therefore of interest and importance to students of South African politics, to students of party-switching and to those with interests in the effects of electoral systems.</p>

<sec id="section2-1354068810389610">
<title>The logic of switching parties</title>
<p>Existing studies of party-switching in legislatures cover a diverse range of contexts, including the United States, Brazil, Ukraine, Mexico, Italy, Japan, Poland and others. The central theme that emerges from these studies is that legislators use party-switching as a strategic tool to obtain a wide variety of benefits and that, once these benefits are identified, it is possible to model the conditions under which party affiliations in legislators are likely to become fluid.</p>
<p>Some studies locate their explanation in the characteristics of parties and party systems themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810389610">Heller and Mershon (2005)</xref>, in their study of party-switching in Italy, highlight the importance of the significance – or lack thereof – of party labels. Scott Desposato’s study of Brazil argues that understanding the causes of party-switching requires an understanding of the types of distributional, electoral and ideological benefits parties provide, along with characteristics of the voters in legislators’ districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810389610">Desposato, 2006</xref>). While it is clear that legislators might consider switching parties when doing so might bolster re-election chances, parties might also control access to positions of influence within a legislature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810389610">McElroy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies draw attention to the characteristics of individual legislators themselves, arguing that the costs and benefits of switching parties are likely to be shaped by legislators’ goals, career stage and constituency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810389610">Reed and Scheiner, 2002</xref>). In Brazil, for instance, representatives of wealthier and more educated constituencies are likely to defect for different reasons than those representing poorer or less-educated areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810389610">Desposato, 2006</xref>). Still others focus on the structure of the legislature itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810389610">Laver and Benoit (2003)</xref> use computational methods to show how the relative sizes of parties in a legislature can contribute to defection dynamics, concluding that ‘as the size of the dominant party increases, it is typically <italic>not only attractive to, but also willing to accept, defectors</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810389610">Laver and Benoit, 2003</xref>: 231). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810389610">Mershon and Shvetsova (2008)</xref> highlight the importance of the legislative policy cycle as an underpinning driver of party-switching patterns for legislators who may have different motivations at different points in the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810389610">Mershon and Shvetsova, 2008</xref>). Other recent work also focuses on the importance of context by highlighting the role of party system institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810389610">Kreuzer and Pettai, 2009</xref>) or the uncertainty generated by the relative sizes of parties in a legislature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810389610">Kato and Yamamoto, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies focus on a single legislative body, however, examining legislators elected using the same method. One exception is Heller and Mershon’s (2005) analysis of party-switching in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Because the authors focus on a period in which Italy used a mixed system to elect deputies, they were able to compare the party-switching behaviour of those elected in single-member districts and those appointed to their seats under a list proportional representation (PR) method. They predict that ‘electoral rules that encourage MPs to build personal-vote coalitions’ will produce much lower rates of party-switching, as party-switching ‘threatens a loss of much or all of an MP’s investment in personal support’ (p. 538). The authors argue that this prediction should hold as long as party labels are clearly defined (p. 539). In their analysis, they find that SMDP legislators do indeed switch parties at a lower rate than their PR counterparts.</p>
<p>A second exception is a study of the Ukrainian Rada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810389610">Thames, 2007</xref>) in which the author examines party switching in Ukraine’s mixed-member national legislature over time and uncovers evidence that the electoral rules that place a legislator into office affect the types of parties that will likely be attractive switching destinations for a legislator. Thames frames his study as a search for the ‘electoral connection’ between parties and legislatures in the Rada. The question of whether the parties and the legislators are ‘connected’ by electoral systems in South Africa – or in most African states, for that matter – is a useful one to ask.</p>
<p>The South African case is valuable for several reasons. First, and most simply, systematic empirical research on party-switching in the African context is rare. There have been some efforts to address the phenomenon of party-switching cross-nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810389610">Janda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068810389610">Owens, 2003</xref>), but very little empirical analysis of African defections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068810389610">1</xref>
</sup> Many studies of party politics in African states have emphasized the clientelistic nature of parties and their weak connections to civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810389610">Erdmann 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810389610">Van de Walle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068810389610">Wantchekon, 2003</xref>). Others have assessed the relatively low levels of party system institutionalization in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810389610">Kuenzi and Lambright, 2001</xref>) and sought to explain those systems’ unusual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810389610">Mozaffar and Scarritt, 2005</xref>). Whether African parties are sufficiently different from parties elsewhere as to require a different framework for analysis is a question still up for debate, and further research is needed.</p>
<p>A second argument for South Africa’s importance is that it is possible to observe defection behaviour in a very large cross-section of legislative bodies, all embedded in the same national context, in which a significant amount of party-switching occurred at the same point in time.</p>
<p>Finally, all these local legislatures use a 50/50 mixed electoral system. Half of the members of these legislatures are elected via closed party lists in a low-threshold PR system. The other half are elected from districts or ‘wards’ within municipalities using single-member district plurality rules (SMDP). This setup amounts to a natural experiment that presents new comparative opportunities. Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810389610">Heller and Mershon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810389610">Thames, 2007</xref>) have used single mixed legislatures to address the differences between PR and SMDP legislators but, as mentioned before, no study has done so comparatively across many legislatures.</p>

<title>The ‘scramble to defect’ in South African local governments</title>
<p>The constitution South Africa adopted in 1996 prohibited party-switching within the legislature, as is common in African democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810389610">Janda, 2007</xref>). The ANC quickly became the dominant party, winning approximately 63 percent of the national parliamentary votes in 1994 and increasing its national lead to more than 66 percent in 1999 and again to more than 69 percent in 2004. After the 1999 elections, three parties that had opposed the ANC separately – the Democratic Party (DP), Federal Alliance (FA) and the New National Party (NNP) – joined together to form the Democratic Alliance (DA). Anti-floor-crossing language in the constitution prevented legislators from these three parties from formally allying and creating a new party without losing their seats, so the alliance was <italic>de facto </italic>only and legislators from the DP, FA and NNP continued to represent their own parties in the legislature. In the local elections of 2000 (local elections are held independently of the national and provincial elections, which are held concurrently), the DA entered local races under its new alliance’s name.</p>
<p>By 2002, tensions between the NNP and other DA members led the ANC to consider staking out a new position on the legality of party-switching. At the local level, where NNP legislators were elected under a DA label, the constitution’s anti-defection clause prevented them from splitting from the DA without losing their seats. The ANC, sensing opportunity and believing that it could ‘gain the symbolic victory of swallowing the former oppressor party and thereby extending its catch-all base’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810389610">Booysen, 2006</xref>: 734), guided four bills through the national parliament in June 2002 to legalize the practice of party-switching and permit elected legislators to change party affiliation between elections without losing their seats.</p>
<p>The so-called ‘floor-crossing bills’ were indisputably designed to favour larger parties. The bills stipulated that no defection from a party could occur unless the defection represented at least 10 percent of the number of seats held by the party the defector was leaving. Large parties in large legislatures (like the national legislature and provincial legislatures) were thus well insulated from losing members. A legislator in a party with ten or fewer delegates, on the other hand, could defect unilaterally.</p>
<p>The legislation passed with an 86 percent majority in parliament. Two parties, the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), posed a constitutional challenge to the floor-crossing legislation, arguing that it contradicted anti-defection language in the 1996 constitution. The challenges ultimately failed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810389610">Devenish (2003)</xref> for a good account of the legal issues involved), and by 2003 ‘floor-crossing’ was legal behaviour in South African legislatures at all levels, although it was permitted only during two 15-day windows between elections held every five years.</p>
<p>Beginning in mid-2003, South African legislative politics was characterized by what Susan Booysen calls a ‘scramble to defect’ (2006: 739). The intended effect of the legislation was realized in that the DA did break apart and patterns of party-switching did benefit the ANC. The ANC consolidated its national parliamentary majority and the DA did lose members. Some minor parties disappeared altogether. In the provinces, the ‘scramble’ was less pronounced, but those who did switch parties were often ‘strategically targeted’ for defection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810389610">Booysen, 2006</xref>: 740), and the ramifications of the switches that did occur were often significant.</p>
<p>Because of the sheer number of legislatures at the local level, it was in local politics that most instances of party-switching took place. Five-hundred-and-twenty-six legislators switched parties during the first 15-day window in October 2002. In 2004, during the second 15-day window two years later, 459 legislators (some of whom had also switched parties in 2002) changed affiliation. Thirty-one municipalities changed hands across the 2002 and 2004 windows and most of these power shifts went in favour of the ANC. While most of these defections appeared to be directly related to the dispute between DA partners (a large number of DA legislators left the DA and became NNP members), a large amount of additional – and, to many observers, unexpected – party-switching occurred. This was so much the case that some media sources described the process at the municipal level as a game of legislative musical chairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810389610">Devenish, 2003</xref>), a nakedly opportunistic power grab by the ANC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810389610">Mattes, 2002</xref>) or, more bluntly, a ‘circus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810389610">Lange and Ngalwa, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>All of this makes local level governments in South Africa an important laboratory for the study of party-switching; 1,025 party switches occurred within only two 15-day windows in nearly 300 similar legislatures sitting in the same country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354068810389610">
<title>Electoral regimes, the balance of power and party-switching</title>
<p>A vast body of literature in comparative politics asserts that electoral rules matter in campaigns and elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810389610">Lijphart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810389610">Norris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810389610">Powell, 2000</xref>), even in the context of new democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810389610">Barkan, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810389610">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068810389610">Lindberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810389610">Mozzafar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810389610">Reynolds, 1999</xref>). Among other differences, both electoral regimes establish notably different lines of control and accountability for those elected under them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068810389610">Huber and Powell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810389610">Powell, 2000</xref>). SMDP elections bind elected candidates to an established subsection of the population. In closed-list PR elections, no such bonding to constituents occurs. While parties may lose shares – and therefore seats – in the next election for poor performance, legislators will be insulated from the effects as long as they have a high enough position on the party list.</p>
<p>This study’s initial assumption is that legislators, whatever their identity and whatever the macro-political context, use parties to secure both personal and policy related benefits (which need not be mutually exclusive). A legislator – if she or he has legal recourse to do so – will switch parties when the new party is better poised to deliver those benefits and when the expected increase in benefits to be obtained from switching outweighs any expected cost, such as retaliatory measures taken by the former party or electoral penalties dealt out by constituents who do not approve of the change. Heller and Mershon note in their 2005 study that ‘switching springs from ambition but also and even more … reflects the pursuit of ambition under great uncertainty’ (p. 556). Party-switching is most likely to be beneficial to individual legislators when the value of a legislator’s initial party affiliation is most uncertain and/or when the future of his or her position in a legislature is highly uncertain. Similarly, it is under precisely these conditions that political parties are most likely to be receptive to receiving additional members and, indeed, to employ enticement strategies in an effort to secure them.</p>
<p>If the flurry of party-switching in South Africa during the first windows of opportunity was simply the result of a between-election realignment, party affiliations of legislators should predict most of the switching behaviour. If the party-switching patterns are the result of spurious or idiosyncratic factors connected to individual legislators, the scramble to defect should be largely random across legislatures. If, however, the market for parties is strategic and structured, then the switching behaviour of individual legislators should be conditioned on predictable <italic>structural</italic> factors.</p>
<p>Given the available data on party-switching in South Africa (discussed in greater detail below), three such structural variables are readily identifiable. The first is the size of the largest party in the legislature. When one party holds a commanding majority, as is the case in many South African municipal legislatures, there is limited uncertainty about which party will likely hold power in the future. As the largest party in a legislature becomes smaller, the utility of attracting new members should increase. The size of the largest party is a variable that should affect what Laver and Benoit term the ‘susceptibility’ of the system to between-election movements. This variable operates at the level of the legislature. Two additional structural variables concern the positional relationship between individual legislative seats and the legislature as a whole. One is whether or not a given seat is held by the largest party. A legislator in a seat held by the largest party faces a different set of incentives than other legislators. Defections away from positions of power should be less likely than defections toward positions of relative power. A final variable, a product of the unique South African legal context, is the threshold for unilateral defection that emerges from the ‘10 percent rule’ that governed inter-party movement during the defection windows. Legislators sitting in parties with 10 or fewer members can defect unilaterally and should be more likely to do so than others.</p>
<p>These three structural variables are determined by number and relative sizes of parties in a legislature. They should be useful predictors of defection behaviour for all South African local legislators. SMDP legislators, however, who must rely on voters within a specific district if they are to access <italic>any </italic>benefits from parties, should be concerned with a number of factors in their home districts <italic>in addition to </italic>these structural factors. For SMDP legislators, switching can come at a significant risk if it alienates constituents. Legislators who won their previous elections by a slim plurality may be more likely to consider switching parties than those who won previous elections by landslides. For legislators in the latter category, their popularity with constituents is not in question. Those in the former category, however, are more likely to reason that they might fare better should they return to compete in the next electoral contest wearing a different uniform. Similarly, legislators in more politically active and more politically engaged districts may be more hesitant to engage in defection in an environment where citizens are more likely to hold legislators accountable for their actions. Party-switching in a less engaged or politically active district could easily be seen as an opportunity to pursue benefits – whether office-seeking or policy-seeking – with lower potential costs. Voter turnout in the 2000 municipal elections in South Africa varied widely across the country’s municipalities, as well as across wards within municipalities, and this measure could serve as a proxy indicator of civic engagement.</p>
<p>The following six hypotheses are suggested by the foregoing discussion:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: PR legislators will be more likely to switch parties than SMDP legislators.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: All legislators should switch more often in legislatures in which the largest party holds either a plurality or a bare majority of seats. The greater the size of the majority commanded by the largest party, the lower the rate of switching should be.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Legislators who sit in the largest party in their legislature should be less likely to defect than legislators who sit outside this party.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Legislators who sit in parties with 10 or fewer members (and who thus need no ‘co-defectors’ in order to cross the floor) will be more likely to defect than legislators who sit in parties with 11 or more members (and who therefore require co-defectors).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: The larger an SMDP legislator’s winning margin in the 2000 election, the less likely he or she should be subsequently to defect.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: The higher the voter turnout in a SMDP legislator’s ward in the 2000 election, the less likely he or she should be subsequently to defect.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>A seventh hypothesis is also implied by hypotheses 5 and 6. The ‘structural factors’ highlighted in hypotheses 2, 3 and 4 should influence the probability of all legislators’ switching, but only SMDP legislators must also weigh district level concerns. Because of this, it is reasonable to suggest that the structural factors will serve as stronger predictors of switching behaviour for PR legislators than for SMDP legislators.<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: The magnitude of the relationships suggested by hypotheses 2, 3 and 4 will be greater for PR legislators than for SMDP legislators.</p>

<title>Methods and analysis</title>
<p>This analysis relies on between-election floor-crossing behaviour during the two 15-day windows in 2002 and 2004 for local municipal legislatures in South Africa. Mixed method elections (50 percent PR, 50 percent SMDP) were held in December 2000 before party-switching was allowed.</p>
<p>Between the 2000 and 2006 local elections in South Africa, the South African Demarcation Board altered the boundaries of some of the country’s municipalities as well as the boundaries of some of their constituent wards. This study includes only those 161 local or metropolitan municipalities (of 237) in which no alterations were made between 2000 and 2006. Restricting the number of legislatures in this way is a significant step, since it is important to eliminate the possibility that any switching or lack thereof could be due only to a change in geography.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis in the study is the 4,712 legislative seats in the 161 legislatures (2,390 SMDP and 2,322 PR) that were filled in December 2000 elections. While it is true that councillors’ resignations, deaths and other exigencies will mean that not every seat was occupied by the same individual, the data available for this analysis do not include individual level characteristics and so it is not possible to account for this. It is important to emphasize, in other words, that the unit of analysis is the <italic>seat </italic>and not necessarily the individual who occupies it. For each seat, there are two key observation points. The first is the 15-day window in 2002 when legislators had the first chance to defect. The second is the 15-day window in 2004. The master dataset used for this analysis therefore contains 9,424 observations, two for each legislative seat. The dataset was compiled using publically available data on party-switching from the Independent Electoral Commission in South Africa. Data about the 161 legislatures and the defection behaviour associated with their seats are married to demographic and electoral data for each of the individual wards. For the purpose of empirical analysis, the master dataset is broken into two time-specific datasets, one for the 2002 decision window and one for the 2004 decision window.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810389610">Table 1</xref> offers an overview of the broad patterns of defection in 2002 and 2004. There were 638 defections in 2002 and 504 in 2004 (although some of these defections come from the same seat). A first glance at the table reveals little that is unexpected given the foregoing discussion of the politics of party-switching in South Africa. The ANC proved to be the primary beneficiary of switching at the local level. The DA’s losses reflect the unrest within the alliance in 2002 – the gains made by the NNP are attributable to the same forces. While the ANC and DA were, respectively, the ultimate winners and losers, other parties were involved in the party-switching game. Not all moves were to the ANC or away from the DA. The macro-political narrative about the DA’s breakup or the ANC’s strategic effort to consolidate its dominant party regime may account for the broad outlines of the defection activity, but it cannot account for the details and nuances of it.</p>

<p>To explore these nuances in the study, further empirical analysis is needed. Any empirical estimation strategy will need to account for the manner in which the observations are clustered in 161 legislatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810389610">Steenbergen and Jones, 2002</xref>). Each of the hierarchical models discussed below uses a random effects estimation procedure with a logit link in which each of the 161 local legislatures in the study is allowed to have a random intercept. Separate models will be estimated for each of the two decision points in the data: 2002 and 2004.</p>
<p>The dependent variables in each of the models estimated will be a dichotomous indicator of whether or not the legislator occupying each legislative seat defected (1) or not (0). This analysis is concerned with identifying contextual variables that probabilistically influence defection across a large number of legislatures and not with the dynamics of individual legislators’ selection of particular parties. Data on the characteristics of South African local parties in the many local legislatures is difficult to obtain, and so a meaningful modelling of party selection would be difficult. To examine the first hypothesis, a dummy variable is included indicating whether each seat is a PR seat. The next three hypotheses concern the effect of ‘structural’ factors on the likelihood of a seat’s occupant defecting. To assess these hypotheses, three independent variables are important. The first is a legislature-level measure. A variable is included to indicate the size (0–100 percent) of the largest party in each legislature. The next two are seat-level variables. The first of these is a dummy variable indicating whether the occupant of the seat is a member of the largest party. The other is a dummy variable indicating whether the seat occupant is able, under the 10 percent threshold rule, to defect unilaterally.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 5 and 6 require variables that apply only to SMDP legislators. To assess hypothesis 5, a seat-level variable is included indicating the percentage of the vote the seat occupant received in the 2000 elections. Furthermore, a variable is included indicating the voter turnout in those elections.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 7 is concerned with the differential effects of the three structural variables – the size of the largest party, whether or not the seat occupant is <italic>in </italic>that largest party, and whether or not she can defect unilaterally – on PR legislators vis-à-vis SMPD legislators. In order to determine whether or not any of these three structural variables, as hypothesis 7 suggests, affects PR seats <italic>more</italic> than SMPD seats, it will be necessary to generate three interaction terms. Accordingly, each of the three structural variables is interacted with the dummy ‘PR’ variable to create these terms.</p>
<p>In addition to these independent variables of interest, a number of important controls are included. Each model estimated to explain party-switching will include a variable for the total number of parties seated in the legislature. Control variables are also included for each of South Africa’s nine provinces (Gauteng serves as the reference category), as all local municipalities are embedded in provincial political contexts.</p>
<p>At the seat level, the initial party identification of the seat occupants is controlled for in the models. Dummy variables are included for ANC, DA and IFP party affiliation (the three largest parties in local municipal legislatures).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068810389610">2</xref>
</sup> When the 2004 defection choices are analysed, an additional variable is included for the NNP.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068810389610">3</xref>
</sup> All models that examine the 2004 floor-crossing window will also include a dummy variable indicating whether or not the legislator holding the seat switched parties in 2002, as switching parties twice was not uncommon.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810389610">Table 2</xref> presents the results of six random effects logit models, three for the 2002 decision window and three for the 2004 window. Three models are estimated for each window because of the three interaction terms needed to test hypothesis seven. Each of the three models for each floor-crossing window includes one of the three interaction terms. Following Booysen’s (2006) discussion of the dynamics of party-switching in South Africa, it is unsurprising that in all six models the single strongest predictor of defection is the partisan identity of the legislators elected to the seats. Specifically, DA affiliation is the strongest predictor of defection in the 2002 window and NNP membership the strongest predictor in the 2004 window. Undeniably, the scramble to defect was highly structured by partisan politics. Related to these results is the discovery that, in all three 2004 models, defection in 2004 is strongly predicted by defection in 2002. The effects of provinces, the number of parties in the legislature, or of partisan identities <italic>besides</italic> the DA (in 2002) and NNP (in 2004) are not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Hypothesis 1</title>
<p>The first hypothesis is confirmed in five of the six models presented. PR seats do appear to be systematically more likely than SMDP seats to be party to defection. While the actual effects may not be large in probability terms, as PR seat occupants have a probability of defection that is 0.01 higher than their SMDP counterparts, this difference is not insignificant, especially since the overall defection rate was only 6.7 percent in the 2002 window and 5.5 percent in the 2004 window. These results confirm the results obtained in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810389610">Heller and Mershon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810389610">Thames, 2007</xref>) and suggest that, irrespective of party identification, legislators in South Africa did defect more readily from seats owed to parties than they did from seats owed to voters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1354068810389610">
<title>Hypotheses 2–4</title>
<p>The structural factors predicted by hypotheses 2–4 are predicted to affect PR and SMDP seats alike. Seats affected by the break-up of the DA and the subsequent dissolution of the NNP are by far the most likely to experience defection in South Africa’s local legislatures, but even these defections are more likely to occur in some structural contexts than in others? All three of these hypotheses are strongly confirmed in all six models. Irrespective of electoral regime and other control factors, legislators were more likely to defect when their seats were in legislatures with smaller largest parties. This evidence supports the notion that the numerical balance of power in legislatures is an important factor in determining the vibrancy of the ‘market for parties’ and the overall levels of inter-party movement. So, too, is it true that seats belonging to the largest party are less likely to be involved in defections in all six models. Finally, the models suggest that legislators who can defect unilaterally are indeed more likely to do so.</p>

<title>Hypotheses 5 and 6</title>

<p>Structurally, the models are effectively identical to the pooled (PR+SMDP) models presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810389610">Table 2</xref>. They include the same control variables and the same three variables for the ‘structural’ factors hypothesized to influence defection probabilities for all legislators. The results provide a modest level of support for both hypotheses. In short, both hypotheses are confirmed, but only in the 2002 window. Interestingly, the membership in the DA for SMDP seats is <italic>not</italic> statistically related to defection. Instead, ANC and IFP membership statistically inhibits defection. No other variables are significant in the 2002 model. This is noteworthy, since these other variables include the three structural variables found to be universally significant in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810389610">Table 2</xref>, in which PR and SMDP legislators were pooled. That the variables for winning margin and turnout cease to be significant in 2004 is not entirely surprising, as legislators in 2004 would have gained additional insight into their and their parties’ standings in their home districts as a result of their constituents’ reactions to the 2002 defections. Signals provided by winning margin and turnout would be far less salient in 2004, after a round of legal defection had already occurred, than in 2002.</p>

<title>Hypothesis 7</title>
<p>The six models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810389610">Table 2</xref>, discussed above in reference to hypotheses 2–4, include a number of interaction terms to help assess the validity of hypothesis 7. Interacting each of the three structural variables with the dummy ‘PR’ tests whether or not the nature of the structural variables’ effects differs between the two electoral regimes.</p>
<p>Of the six interaction terms, three for each crossing window, only one returns a statistically significant result. In the 2004 crossing window, the interaction between ‘PR’ and ‘In Largest Party’ is negative. Although seats belonging to the largest party are less likely to see defection than other seats irrespective of the electoral regime that filled the seat, this relationship is particularly strong for seats filled by PR elections. In substantive terms, the difference in the probability of defection from an SMDP seat held by the largest party versus an SMDP seat held by another party is 0.0117, while the different in the probability of defection from a PR seat held by the largest party versus an SMDP seat held by another party is 0.0406, nearly four times greater. Because the other five interaction terms are not statistically significant, confirmation for hypothesis 7 is weak at best. There is no evidence that the size of the largest party or the ability to defect unilaterally affects PR seats any differently than SMDP seats. It is intuitive, however, that SMDP legislators would find it easier to defect <italic>away from</italic> a position of relative power in a legislature. Because SMDP legislators have constituents to please and district level factors to consider, they are more likely to find themselves in a position where ‘abandoning a sailing ship’ could be a necessary move for political survival. PR legislators, once in the largest party in their party-centred elections, find it more difficult to find good cause to change uniforms midgame.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study advances our understanding of party-switching on several fronts. First, the article provides insight into the logic of party defection in South Africa, a case where patterns of defection were broad. At first glance, most party-switching in South Africa appears to be easily explained by a narrative about an alliance break-up and a set of politically opportunistic floor-crossing laws spearheaded by the ANC. The evidence presented here shows that defection activity was more complex than the aggregate data might indicate. While a broader political narrative may account for the emergence of party-switching, the nuances of the pattern itself conformed very much to the logic of what Desposato has called the ‘highly structured, rational, and constrained’ market of ‘parties for rent’ (2006). All legislators were influenced by factors such as the size of the largest party, their position vis-à-vis the largest party and whether the law required them to make their moves with co-defectors or allowed them to go it alone. The size of the largest party in a legislature and, more broadly, the relationship between the sizes of all major parties in a legislature and the importance of certain size thresholds, have emerged in several recent studies as explanatory variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810389610">Kato and Yamamoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810389610">Laver and Benoit, 2003</xref>). This study confirms these earlier results. In particular, it provides suggestive evidence that it is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810389610">Kato and Yamamoto (2009)</xref> suggest, important to consider how the environments within which legislators operate create <italic>uncertainty</italic> about the future and how legislators may use defection as a strategy for coping with this uncertainty. At their core, parties in legislatures and those who seek membership in them live by the logic of thresholds even when they speak in the language of ideas.</p>
<p>Additionally, this study contributes to our understanding of how electoral rules can structure the party-switching behaviours of legislators. This article is the first effort to test these effects using a large number of similar legislatures and their members. PR legislators were found to be more likely to switch in all analyses. Additionally, weak evidence was uncovered suggesting that PR legislators may also be more likely to condition their switching decisions on their legislature’s internal power structure. Specifically, PR legislators were found to be more likely than their SMDP counterparts to take the extraordinary step of surrendering political power by defecting away from the largest party. While a principal contribution of this study is its analysis of switching in a large number of simultaneous legislatures, further research should employ different methods to explore the causal mechanisms underlying this inferred difference between SMDP and PR legislators. Mixed-member legislatures are obviously excellent laboratories in which to explore the consequences of electoral rules for elite behaviour, between elections campaigns as well as during them.</p>
<p>While a flurry of floor-crossing like the one that occurred recently in South Africa might look to the casual observer like nothing more than the consequence of a one-time spat between two major parties or a shameless opportunistic free-for-all, there was nevertheless a clear logic to the proceedings. What began as a bid to encourage the break-up of an opposition alliance and solidify an already strong lead set in motion an extended – but nevertheless structured and predictable – game of legislative musical chairs. The natural experiment that took place there, unfortunately, is not likely to be replicated soon. In 2008, the South African parliament put a definitive end to the practice of party-switching at all levels of government. The practice had always been controversial. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, claimed that floor-crossing ‘robs the political system of all honour, holding political parties hostage by rendering them unable to discipline their own members’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810389610">‘My Party …’, 2006</xref>). Buthelezi further claimed that the practice allowed for ‘the emergence of careerists, self-serving politicians, which are a very strange breed because they do not honour the sanctity of the vote cast in the ballot box’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810389610">‘My Party …’, 2006</xref>). Even within the ANC, which disproportionately benefited from the country’s floor-crossing regime, some discontent stemmed from the fact that defectors to the ANC could bump older, more senior members off the top of party lists. Even the ANC, then, ultimately conceded and permitted the closure of the floor-crossing regime it had designed. As a result, the natural laboratory for party-switching closed down as quickly as it was opened. The game of ‘musical chairs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810389610">Devenish, 2003</xref>) is over, but in the shadow of that game lurks important information about electoral regimes and the ways that they work – between elections as well as during them – to constrain the behaviour of those who represent us in democracies.</p>
