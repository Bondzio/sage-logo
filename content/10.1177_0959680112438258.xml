<p>This issue of the <italic>European Journal of Industrial Relations</italic> provides an intriguing juxtaposition of papers. The first two examine trade union responses to migrant and ethnic minority workers. In the first, Stefania Marino compares approaches in the metal-working sector in Italy and the Netherlands. In both countries, unions declare a commitment to recruiting and representing such workers, but there is a gap between programme and practice, particularly in the Netherlands. The difference, she suggests, reflects in part a stronger Italian commitment to an ideology of class, in part the stronger Dutch embeddedness in a network of concertative political institutions.</p> <p>The second article, by Line Eldring, Ian Fitzgerald and Jens Arnholtz, examines the construction industry in Denmark, Norway and the UK. In all three countries, unions consider it essential to organise migrant workers from the new EU member states in order to regulate low-wage competition, but their approaches differ according to national opportunity structures and union strategic capacity.</p> <p>The next two papers explore aspects of bargaining decentralization. Anna Ilsøe discusses working time regulation in the metal industry in Denmark, Germany and the USA. How far are unions willing to accept a more flexible organization of working hours? She shows that the approaches differ according to the degree of union capacity to control wages and conditions at company level: Danish unions possess such capacity and do not oppose flexibility, American unions are weakest in this respect and oppose flexibility most strongly.</p> <p>Markku Sippola presents case study evidence on local bargaining and codetermination in Finland, fitting his findings within a broader Nordic comparative framework. The trend towards more participative forms of workplace decision-making challenges the traditional bargaining role of workplace union representatives, and calls for the development of new types of representational skill if unions are to retain their traditional influence.</p> <p>The final article, by Charles Umney, compares approaches to international solidarity in British docks and seafaring unions, applying the categories of mobilizing and managerial unionism. Are union approaches to internationalism primarily top-down or bottom-up? Much depends on the inherited patterns of union organization and relations with employers. The findings have interesting implications beyond the national context of the research.</p>
