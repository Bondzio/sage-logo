<abstract>
<p>How to select candidates with appropriate personal qualities for medical school is an important issue. This study examined the psychometric properties and group differences of the Personal Qualities Assessment (PQA) to test the feasibility of using it as a tool to assess the medical school applicants in a non-Western culture. Seven hundred forty-six medical students in Taiwan completed two psychometric measures: Mojac to assess moral orientation and NACE to assess four aspects of interpersonal relationships. Thirty-one students completed the tests twice to establish test–retest reliability. A subsample of 127 students also completed a measure of the “Big Five” personality traits to examine the construct validity of these scales. Both Mojac and NACE had acceptable internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Conceptually, coherent and significant relationships were observed between test components and between the NACE and Big Five. NACE but not Mojac varied significantly between different sociodemographic groups. Both tests demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. However, the predictive validity of PQA requires future studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ultimate outcome of medical education is the graduation of competent doctors with adequate knowledge, good clinical skills, and a capacity for life-long learning. In addition, they should exhibit appropriate ethical and empathic behavior and have good communication skills. The latter goals can be achieved in two ways. One is to select students with appropriate attitudes and communication skills; the other is to cultivate these soft skills through medical education. Medical education has been criticized for “emphasizing scientific knowledge over biological understanding, clinical reasoning, practical skill, and the development of character, compassion, and integrity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163278712454138">Cooke, Irby, Sullivan, &amp; Ludmerer, 2006</xref>). How to select candidates with appropriate academic background and personal qualities for medical school entry has always been an important issue. There is a need to put more emphasis on medical students’ personality traits, empathy, and ethical reasoning ability in the entrance selection process. Assessment of these noncognitive attributes in candidates seeking entry to medical school is rarely attempted, and the methodology is at an early stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore, Munro, Kerridge, &amp; Powis, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the majority of medical schools in Western cultures, admission to medical school is a multistep process and usually includes a personal interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163278712454138">Harasym, Woloschuk, Mandin, &amp; Brundin-Mather, 1996</xref>). It is presumed that the interview can identify candidates with appropriate motivation and personal qualities. However, admission interviews are labor intensive and time consuming. Besides, concern about the reliability and validity of the interview has been an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163278712454138">Albanese, Snow, Skochelak, Huggett, &amp; Farrel, 2003</xref>). Psychometric tests can be used to measure personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden, Bore, Miller, Jack, &amp; Powis, 2005</xref>) and have been used by some institutions to measure noncognitive attributes of medical school applicants in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>). But most of the tests only focused on personal qualities and neglected the moral orientation, which is important in ethical decision making in medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712454138">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712454138">Powis, Bore, Munro, &amp; Lumsden, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The personal qualities assessment (PQA) developed at the University of Newcastle, Australia, is an instrument designed to assess the cognitive ability, moral orientation, and a range of personal qualities considered to be important for the study and practice of medicine, dentistry, and other health professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712454138">Powis et al., 2005</xref>). This instrument has been used to assess the noncognitive traits of applicants in medicine, occupational therapy, social work, and other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163278712454138">Gibbons, Bore, Munro, &amp; Powis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163278712454138">James et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712454138">Lyons, Mackenzie, Bore, &amp; Powis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro, Bore, &amp; Powis, 2005</xref>). It has been shown to have good reliability and construct validity in studies involving medical school applicants, medical students, and psychology students in Australia, Israel, Fiji, New Zealand, Scotland, and England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163278712454138">Bore, Munro, Kerridge, &amp; Powis, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>). However, there are no published data on Asian students and many schools have now questioned the selection outcomes for medical school applicants in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163278712454138">Fan et al., 2010</xref>). Before adopting any psychometric tool for student selection, the tool’s reliability and validity must be evaluated with the appropriate applicant group because of variations in medical education curricula and difference in cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of using PQA as a tool to assess the moral orientation and personal qualities of medical students in the context of an oriental culture.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0163278712454138">
<title>Participants and Settings</title>
<p>All first-year medical students from 4 of the 11 Taiwan medical schools were invited to join this study in 2006 and 2007. Two of the schools are located in northern Taiwan, one in central Taiwan, and one in southern Taiwan; One is a public-funded school and three are private schools. Third-year medical students from one school and third- and fifth-year medical students from another school were also invited to take the PQA. Student volunteers were not compensated for their participation.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Human and Ethical Committee of the medical schools and informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0163278712454138">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>The PQA test battery consists of three instruments: the mental agility test to measure high-level reasoning ability; Mojac to measure moral orientation prior to the making of a moral decision and to separate libertarian from communitarian moral orientation; and NACE to identify an involved or detached personality trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712454138">Powis et al., 2005</xref>; see also www.pqa.net.au). Because the focus of this study was on moral orientation and personal qualities of medical students, only the Mojac and NACE instruments of PQA were used here. The original English version of Mojac scale and NACE were translated into Chinese and then back translated into English by bilingual persons. Three authors examined each translated version. Any inconsistencies were resolved by discussion among the three authors.</p>
<p>The Mojac scale consists of three moral dilemmas with 45 statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163278712454138">2005b</xref>). Respondents were asked if they <italic>strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree</italic>, or <italic>yes, probably, unlikely, no</italic>, in response to each statement. A score of 1–4 was given to each statement accordingly (with some items reversed). A total score (LibCom) is derived from the responses to the 45 statements. High scores indicate a communitarian moral orientation, where greater value is given to the needs, rights, laws, and norms of society; while low scores indicate a libertarian moral orientation, where the needs, right, and well-being of individuals are highly valued. An earlier study has shown the Mojac scale to have high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α coefficient of .90) and construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>The NACE scale consists of 100 statements, all using a common 4-point response scale (<italic>definitely true, true on the whole, false on the whole, definitely false</italic>). Accordingly, a score of 1–4 was given to each statement, with some items reversed. The NACE scale measures Narcissism (N), Aloofness (A), (Self-) Confidence (C), and Empathy (E). Narcissism refers to preoccupation with one’s own needs and ambition, feelings of self-importance, treating other people as inferiors, and negative emotional reactions to anyone who threatens one’s preeminence. Aloofness means keeping apart from others either physically or emotionally, being reserved and difficult for others to maintain relationships with. Confidence means having a belief in one’s own abilities in leadership, social skills, in dealing positively with other’s problems and feelings, and in being attractive. Empathy refers to awareness and appreciation of the viewpoints of others, awareness of one’s effects on others, being warm in interpersonal relationships, and being welcomed by others who are seeking help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>). Scores are generated for each of these four traits as well as an overall ECAN score. High ECAN scores indicate a tendency to be involved with others (<italic>Involved = High Empathy and Confidence</italic>) and low scores indicate a tendency to be detached from others (<italic>Detached = High Aloofness and Narcissism</italic>).</p>
<p>Evidence of the construct validity of NACE and Mojac tests has been examined by correlating scores from the Goldberg “Big Five” Personality test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712454138">Goldberg et al., 2006</xref>). These “Big Five” traits are Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to experience. Through extensive empirical research in many countries, including those in Asia, the five broad personality traits have been confirmed as reliable and valid, and form the basis for the Five Factor Theory of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712454138">Goldberg 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712454138">McCrae &amp; Allik, 2002</xref>). Each item of the test consists of a short statement about a person’s normal behavior, thinking, or feelings. A 4-point response scale identical to that used for the NACE (see above) was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0163278712454138">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>In 2006 and 2007, Chinese versions of Mojac and NACE were administrated to the medical student participants either after their regular classes or at the time set by students after full explanation by a research assistant. Thirty-one second-year students from one medical school were invited to fill in the questionnaires again 2 weeks later to evaluate the test–retest reliability of both scales. The Big Five was administered at the same time as Mojac and NACE to a subsample of 127 medical students from one medical school in 2007 to evaluate the construct validity of these scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0163278712454138">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics including frequency, mean, and standard deviation were calculated. The scores of Taiwan medical students were also compared with other cohorts derived from Western cultures. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> measure of effect size was also calculated for the difference in scores between two cohort samples (<italic>d</italic> &lt; .5 considered as small effect size, .5 to .8 as median effect size, and ≥ .8 as large effect size; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712454138">Hojat et al., 2002</xref>). Candidates were grouped by gender, level of education, years of medical school, parents’ education and occupation, and family socioeconomic status. Comparisons of the LibCom, ECAN, and its subscores between each two groups were performed by <italic>t</italic> test, between three or more groups were performed by analysis of variance.</p>
<p>The reliability of LibCom, ECAN, and their subscores was evaluated by calculating Cronbach’s α coefficient. To assess validity, correlations between Mojac and NACE scales, between the four factors in NACE, and between Big Five and total and subscores of NACE scale, were examined by Pearson correlation analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-0163278712454138">
<title>Profile of Students</title>
<p>From December 2006 to December 2007, 746 medical students from four medical schools completed the tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0163278712454138">Table 1</xref>). The response rate was 77.9% of their entire class. Several students did not fill in some basic variables such as gender, years of medical school, education status at admission, family income, parents’ education, and occupation. However, the missing number in any variable constituted less than 3% of the total. The cohort consisted of 488 males (65.8%) and 254 females (34.2%). The gender distribution overall was similar to that which prevailed in their classes. Their mean age was 20.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.2) years. Of the 746 participants, 481, 186, and 76 were first-, third-, and fifth-year medical students, respectively. There were 32 students (4.3%) having a bachelor’s or higher degree before entering the medical school (graduate entrants). For parents’ education, 560 (75.4%) students’ fathers and 459 (61.8%) students’ mothers had a bachelor’s or higher degree. Four hundred thirty-four (58.4%) students’ father and 258 (34.7%) students’ mother had professional work; and 383 (52.4%) students identified that their family income was above average.</p>

<title>Mojac and NACE Scores</title>
<p>Among the 746 students, their mean LibCom score was 111.5 ± 10.7 (range 83–150) and ECAN score was 256.2 ± 17.1 (range 189–310). Scores for Taiwan medical students were compared with the “norms” from Australian and other Western samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al. 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712454138">Powis et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0163278712454138">Table 2</xref>). Significant differences between the Taiwan group and the PQA norms were found for all the traits as indicated by Student <italic>t</italic> test. The Taiwan group was found to have lower scores in LibCom, Confidence, Empathy, and ECAN overall and higher scores in Narcissism and Aloofness, than the PQA norms. But if the effect size of each scale was considered, the difference was only significant for ECAN overall, Confidence, Aloofness, and Narcissism.</p>

Those with higher family income had higher scores in ECAN overall and Confidence, and lower scores in Aloofness. Parents’ education and occupation did not correlate with the scores of the NACE scale, except in relation to mother’s occupation. Students whose mother had a professional job had a higher score for Confidence than those whose mother had a nonprofessional job.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A mixture of measures covering a broad range of attributes should provide the best way of selecting the most suitable candidates for medical school. It is desirable that applicants who have personality traits and values that are inappropriate for ethical medical practice can be screened out by the admission procedures. In this study, we examined the psychometric properties of the PQA scales for medical students in Taiwan. These scales attempt to measure two important qualities of students applying for entry to medicine; their moral orientation and their relationships with others. We found that the Mojac scale had good internal consistency and test–retest reliability, and the NACE scales also had acceptable internal consistency and test–retest reliability within our study sample. Correlations between Mojac and the NACE scales, and between these scales and those from the Five Factor model of personality (the Big Five), support their construct validities, and indicate that this Chinese-language version of Mojac and NACE scales performs similarly in most respects to the English-language version with Western samples. Nevertheless, the predictive validity of PQA requires future confirmation studies. Our next steps are to see how it would work with the actual applicant population under high stakes conditions and how these scores correlate with the performance of the students in their clinical years or early years in clinical practice.</p>
<p>The theory underlying the Mojac scale is that moral behavior is influenced more by one’s ethical orientation than the ability to engage in moral reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>), which can be seen as an individual’s cognitive ability to utilize abstract ethical principles in addressing ethical issues. The concept of moral orientation was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712454138">Gilligan (1993)</xref>, and refers to the individual’s moral values and beliefs prior to the making of a moral decision. The Mojac scale was designed to measure the moral orientations of Libertarianism (individual rights) versus Communitarianism (rights of the wider society). In other studies, women were found to be more communitarian than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al. 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>). Age and years of medical education were also found to have positive correlations with the LibCom scores, with younger and Year 1 medical students having a more libertarian orientation than older or Year 3 and Year 5 medical students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>). However, our results showed some differences compared with these findings. As in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>), we observed that among Taiwan medical students, younger students were more libertarian than older students. However, we could not find any group difference in gender and years of medical school in the moral orientation. The possible explanation for this difference is not clear.</p>
<p>The mean LibCom score for moral orientation was 111.5, which is lower than that obtained from mostly Western medical school candidates or students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al. 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712454138">Powis et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore, Munro, Kerridge, and Powis (2005a)</xref> compared the LibCom scores between different samples and noted that the two Israeli samples had significantly higher (i.e., communitarian) scores than all other samples tested. These observations suggest that cross-culture differences in the meaning of the scores should be taken into consideration. The Mojac scale uses four dilemmas from different areas of life, none of which have “medical” subject matter. While the tests performed well in terms of internal consistency for both Western and Taiwanese samples, it is possible that the four dilemmas could produce different reactions due to varying cultural standards and experiences of the students. Further longitudinal studies of the influence of age, gender, culture, and medical education on the moral orientation are required.</p>
<p>One important trait of a good doctor is the capacity or tendency to be aware of or to appreciate the viewpoints of others and to react with empathy to the emotions of others. Empathy is positively associated with openness, agreeableness, and extraversion, moving toward others; and negatively with aloofness and tough-mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>). In reviewing the literature, it was consistently noted that female students scored higher than male students in empathy. This gender difference in empathy has been attributed to either intrinsic factors (e.g., evolutionary–biological gender characteristics) or extrinsic factors (e.g., interpersonal style in caring, socialization, and gender role expectation). In this study, we did not find a significant difference in empathy scores between males and females, though the overall ECAN scores were significantly higher for females, the difference coming from lower aloofness and narcissism scores.</p>
<p>It was also noted that students’ empathy scores declined with increased years in medical school; usually first-year medical students had the highest scores, either in a cross-sectional study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712454138">Chen, Lew, Hershman, &amp; Orlander, 2007</xref>) or a longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163278712454138">Newton, Barber, Clardy, &amp; Cleveland, 2008</xref>). We also found a lower score in empathy for the third- and fifth-year students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712454138">Rezler (1974)</xref> had stated and others have echoed his views that there was a decline in humanism during medical school training and the medical school environment was largely responsible for this decline. Our study and the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163278712454138">James et al. (2009)</xref> showed that high school leavers had higher scores in empathy than graduate entrants. We also noted a negative correlation between the empathy score and age. These results suggest that besides learning environment, maturity and different values of interpersonal relationship might have some effect on the development of empathy.</p>
<p>Not many studies investigated the influence of socioeconomic status on the personality traits. Our study showed that parents’ education and fathers’ job did not correlate with the personality trait. However, students from average or poor income family or whose mothers had nonprofessional job, had significantly lower ECAN and confidence scores, and higher aloofness score than students from above-average income family. These results are different from the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden, Bore, Miller, Jack, and Powis (2005)</xref>, who studied the personality traits of Scottish medical school applicants and noted that students from more deprived backgrounds scored significantly higher on total ECAN score. Further study is needed to establish whether in Oriental society, children brought up in low socioeconomic families tend to have lower self-esteem.</p>
<p>The Taiwan group performed differently from other PQA groups, which were derived from research in Western countries including Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712454138">Bore et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712454138">Powis et al., 2005</xref>), in that the Taiwan group had higher scores in narcissism and aloofness, and lower scores in ECAN overall and confidence than the students in the other PQA groups. Could this be related to differences in culture? Our population was different from the other PQA cohorts in several aspects. The other groups were based on data obtained mostly from medical school applicants and with a predominance of females. In this study, we enrolled only medical students and more than 60% were male. As stated previously, female students were observed to be more empathetic than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712454138">Gilligan 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163278712454138">Kataoka, Norio, Ochi, Hojat, &amp; Gonnella, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>). Gender difference in moral orientation and other personal traits, such as narcissism and aloofness, were also noted. Male typically scored higher on narcissism and aloofness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454138">Lumsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454138">Munro et al., 2005</xref>). Besides, applicants to medical schools were found to have lower scores for narcissism and aloofness and higher scores for confidence and empathy than medical students. Furthermore, the expression of noncognitive attributes might be different in different cultures. Mean empathy score for the Japanese medical students were noted to be lower than that reported for American and Mexican students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163278712454138">Kataoka et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163278712454138">Kataoka, Norio, Ochi, Hojat, and Gonnella (2009)</xref> suggested that the difference in the student selection and education of medical school in different countries, delayed clinical exposure, and different expression of empathy in different cultures are some of the factors that contributed to the difference. Little is known about the influence of culture on interpersonal traits. Therefore, a further study is needed to investigate whether these differences reflect cultural difference or the difference in study population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both Mojac and NACE had acceptable psychometric properties, such as good internal consistency, test–retest reliability, showing convergent and divergent construct validity, among Taiwan medical students. NACE can discriminate among different sociodemographic groups of Taiwan medical students. However, no group difference in the moral orientation apart from a weak correlation with age could be detected. Furthermore, significant differences between the Taiwan group and the other PQA groups were found for most of the traits measured. These differences indicate the importance of establishing the predictive validity of the test in Oriental medical students and the need for developing population-derived norms for these tests before they can be used as instruments to aid in student selection for medical school.</p>
