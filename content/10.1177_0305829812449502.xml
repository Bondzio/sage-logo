<p>Gathering together some of the sharpest authors studying the beyond-modern-state evolution of politics and law, <italic>Political Theory of the European Union</italic> (<italic>PToEU</italic>) is a milestone that will undoubtedly inspire further studies on European Union (EU) integrative, legal and normative theories. The book deeply illustrates the complex academic debates associated with understanding the EU. It questions the normative implications of adopting any theoretical approach to study the EU. <italic>PToEU</italic> thus adopts a middle-range theoretical approach whose flexibility should overcome the heuristic rigidity of the traditional EU integration theories. To this end, <italic>PToEU</italic> is divided into three interdisciplinary parts respectively emphasising the problems of authority, legitimacy and justice unavoidably brought about by the uniqueness of the EU polity. Accordingly, many contributors emphasise, with different arguments, the EU’s uniqueness, which prevents scholars from both understanding past events and anticipating future ones. In other words, contributors generally consider the EU as an essentially controversial and unpredictable project. In this regard, <italic>PToEU</italic> well illustrates the internal dialectic between scholars dealing with the EU as a political <italic>sui generis</italic> phenomenon. Moving from the initial assertion that understanding the EU requires new conceptual and lexical tools (Grande and Beck), the book enumerates various examples of incoherence characterising the EU’s institutional shape, rule of law, political action and democratic legitimacy. Although highlighting the EU’s possibility to become a pioneer of new forms of politics (e.g. Müller’s demoi-cracy, Manner’s cosmopolitics, etc.), contributors implicitly signal the substantial pliability of the EU’s historical and, perhaps, future trajectory. This is not simply determined by the unpredictability of the future <italic>per se</italic>, but also by the EU’s inability to unambiguously define and illustrate its political plan and identity. Consequently, the book suggests the existence of two substantially different ways of approaching the EU.</p>
<p>The first approach claims that the EU, despite temporary setbacks and difficulties, follows a precise trajectory that could even be of a self-powered nature. Accordingly, the EU would correspond to an autopoietic system more and more able to define its own rules of behaviour and normative projects. This approach assumes the EU to be rational and based on a clear political and moral <italic>telos</italic>, difficult to reach because of the presence of resistant conceptions of politics delaying its achievement. Examples can be seen in Kumm’s description of the EU’s proactive, and somehow obstinate, constitutionalism, showing the interpretative tension between the purely teleological and deontological grounds of EU legal practices and legitimacy. This unresolved tension is between two opposite extremes characterising any constitutional project concretely called to locate itself between strict respect of norms and capacity of decision, or <italic>nomocracy</italic> and <italic>teleocracy</italic>. The teleological approach thus moves from the assumption that the EU may find political and legal legitimacy through output legitimacy, or through utility. Accordingly, the EU legal decisionism could, and perhaps ought to, finally prevail also thanks to the adoption of concrete political principles and measures. An example is Forst’s right to justification presented in Neyer’s chapter (p. 174) and called on to smooth over and pacify procedural tensions and recriminations potentially issuing from the prevalence of utility. The main property of this approach therefore consists in the belief that the EU – despite problems of democratic legitimacy, accountability and so on – has a legitimate moral goal associated with its utility and makes, or should be free to make, legitimate efforts to reach it. This approach is particularly present in Neyer’s chapter, which concludes that ‘even the best procedures only provide incentives. They will only be effective if the powerful actors realize that it is, indeed, in their best interest to accept the discipline that is imposed upon them by supranational legal norms’ (p. 186). This EU <italic>telos</italic>, if it exists, remains, however, hazy or risks depending on dehumanised political and legal practices whose rationality and legitimacy may be questioned, as Everson does by explicating the dehumanised violence of the EU single market based on the imposition of neo-liberal utility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second opposite deontological approach assumes the EU is similar to any other contemporary polity suffering postmodern problems related to the lack of a clearly constituted sovereign authority. To this end, Walker diagnoses a number of concurrent problems converging in the still unanswered ‘who decides what?’ question (p. 107), reminding us that the EU is still unable to illustrate and justify its idea of how sovereignty and democracy ought to work. If <italic>PToEU</italic> is thus highly recommended thanks to its valuable key to the reading of the EU’s problems and contradictions, it is not equally conclusive in providing the ‘analytical and normative criteria that we should use when dealing with the EU’ (p. 6). As an edited book, it is unable to identify a unique body of ultimate normative principles defining the EU’s moral legitimacy. Wiener’s proposal for constitutionalism as the heuristic instrument and normative principle for a political theory of the EU seems to satisfy only analytical ambitions. Indeed, European constitutionalism as a political practice may at best provide a procedural legitimacy rather than a substantial definition of a real moral content. To conclude, even if only marginally mentioned (e.g. by Beck and Grande, Eriksen, Everson, Neyer, and Follesdal), political Europeanisation seems to be the missing concept of the interesting <italic>PToEU</italic>’s overall debate. The question that the contributors do not sufficiently answer is indeed if, how and especially what the EU is bringing, or willing to bring, to <italic>politics</italic>. Is Europeanisation, also through EU constitutionalism, bringing something new and/or different to what we have until today called politics? What is the EU’s normative added value to politics? What is the difference between politics and <italic>Europeanised</italic> politics?</p>
