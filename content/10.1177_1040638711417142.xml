<abstract>
<p>The role of <italic>Bovine viral diarrhea virus</italic> (BVDV) in the development of <italic>Porcine circovirus-2</italic> (PCV-2)-associated disease (PCVAD) was investigated in 2 experimental studies. In the first, separate groups of germ-free pigs were inoculated with filtered tissue homogenate (from diseased pigs) containing PCV-2b + BVDV-1–like virus (group 1), PCV-2a + BVDV-1–like virus (group 4), BVDV-1–like virus only (group 3), or PCV-2b + BVDV-1–like virus following a BVDV vaccination protocol (group 2). This last group was used to test if BVDV vaccination would prevent clinical PCVAD in this model. Many of the inoculated pigs had mild multisystemic inflammation consistent with classic PCVAD. One vaccinated, dually inoculated pig had acute respiratory distress followed by death at 21 days postinfection. Lesions in this pig resembled the severe form of PCVAD observed in the field since the fall of 2004, suggesting a role of ruminant pestiviruses and/or vaccination in the development of this disease. In the second study, cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs were inoculated with PCV-2b and a cytopathic strain of BVDV-1 (cpBVDV-NADL) either alone or in combination. Clinical signs of PCVAD were seen in a single animal inoculated only with PCV-2b. This pig had growth retardation followed by acute respiratory distress leading to death 30 days postinfection. Pulmonary lesions in this animal were similar to those seen in the pig that died in the first study. Infection with cpBVDV-NADL did not enhance PCV-2b replication or lesion formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Porcine circovirus-2</italic> (PCV-2; family <italic>Circoviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Circovirus</italic>) is one of the most important viral pathogens in the U.S. pig population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1040638711417142">39</xref></sup> Systemic PCV-2–associated disease (PCVAD) was first recognized in Canada in 1991 as a chronic, insidious, and sometimes protracted disease characterized by progressive weight loss typically affecting pigs 2–3 weeks postweaning, or at about 5–6 weeks of age (Harding JCS, Clark EG: 1997, Diagnostic notes. Recognizing and diagnosing postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). J Swine Health Prod 5:201–203). Morbidity is usually low, but case fatality rate is often high among affected animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638711417142">32</xref></sup> In addition to wasting, clinical signs of PCVAD include pallor or icterus, respiratory distress, and diarrhea (Harding JCS, Clark EG: 1997, Recognizing and diagnosing PMWS). Gross lesions are observed primarily in the lungs, lymph nodes, and kidneys: lungs often fail to collapse and are mottled tan, lymph nodes are enlarged, and kidneys have scattered white foci (Harding JCS, Clark EG: 1997, Recognizing and diagnosing PMWS). Characteristic microscopic lesions consist of lymphoid depletion, lymphohistiocytic or granulomatous inflammation, and intracytoplasmic intrahistiocytic inclusions in 1 or multiple organs (Harding JCS, Clark EG: 1997, Recognizing and diagnosing PMWS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1040638711417142">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pathogenesis of PCVAD is still not fully understood. PCV-2 is considered essential for the development of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638711417142">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638711417142">22</xref></sup> One or more of a variety of co-factors are thought to be necessary for full expression of clinical disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711417142">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638711417142">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638711417142">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1040638711417142">40</xref></sup> The co-factors include other infectious agents such as <italic>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</italic> (PRRSV), <italic>Porcine parvovirus</italic> (PPV), and <italic>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</italic>. Experimentally, immune stimulants such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin in incomplete Freund adjuvant and oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccines appear to similarly enhance PCV-2–associated lesions, suggesting that up-regulation of the immune system may contribute to the development of PCVAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638711417142">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638711417142">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638711417142">25</xref></sup> Additionally, factors inherent to the host and environment may play important roles in the development of PCVAD.</p>
<p>A significant increase in both the incidence and severity of PCVAD has been observed in North America since the fall of 2004, mainly in 10–15-week-old pigs rather than in recently weaned pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638711417142">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638711417142">18</xref></sup> Animals that died had unique gross and histologic lesions, including cavitary effusions, marked pulmonary and mesenteric edema, typical PCV-2 intracytoplasmic inclusions in renal tubule and bronchial gland epithelial cells, and vasculitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638711417142">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638711417142">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638711417142">26</xref></sup> Links have been established between a new genotype of PCV-2 (PCV-2b), not reported earlier in North America, and the increased incidence and severity of PCVAD (DeLay J, McEwen B, Carman S, et al.: 2005, Porcine circovirus type 2-associated disease is increasing. AHL Newsletter 9:22).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638711417142">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638711417142">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638711417142">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638711417142">26</xref></sup> Reasons for this relatively sudden emergence of a more virulent viral strain include virus escape of existing herd immunity to previously circulating PCV-2a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638711417142">18</xref></sup> or introduction of a formerly undetected cofactor, such as <italic>Bovine viral diarrhea virus</italic> (BVDV), that resulted in increased replication of a previously unrecognized type of PCV-2 (Segalés J, Torremorell M: 2006, What we know and do not know about PMWS. <italic>In</italic>: Proceedings of the Allen D. Leman Swine Conference, pp. 121–125. St. Paul, MN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1040638711417142">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pigs are susceptible to infection by all known pestiviruses. They are the only natural host of <italic>Classical swine fever virus</italic> and likely also of a novel pestivirus named Bungowannah virus that appears to be associated with the porcine myocarditis syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638711417142">21</xref></sup> In addition, natural infection of swine with BVDV and <italic>Border disease virus</italic> (which have cattle and sheep as their primary host, respectively) have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638711417142">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1040638711417142">42</xref></sup> Ruminant pestiviruses are pathogenic for pig fetuses, but are generally considered to be relatively nonpathogenic for pigs after birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638711417142">29</xref></sup> Nonetheless, disease syndromes characterized by growth retardation and wasting have been reported in pigs infected with these viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638711417142">31</xref></sup> Concurrent infection with BVDV in pigs may intensify the effects of Transmissible gastroenteritis virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1040638711417142">54</xref></sup> In addition to PCV-2, BVDV type 1 (BVDV-1) was isolated from an outbreak of acute, high mortality in pigs in southern Minnesota in 2004 (Torrison J: 2004, Clinical and diagnostic considerations for an acute, high mortality syndrome in grow-finish swine. <italic>In</italic>: Proceedings of the Swine Disease Conference for Swine Practitioners, pp. 92–100. Ames, IA). The Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (West Lafayette, Indiana) has detected both BVDV-1–like virus and PCV-2b in tissues of diseased pigs from severe epidemic outbreaks of PCVAD since 2005. In these animals, the aforementioned unique gross lesions have been observed in conjunction with unique microscopic lesions, namely vasculitis and intracytoplasmic inclusions in renal tubule and bronchial gland epithelial cells (unpublished data), that mirror the tropism for endothelial and epithelial cells of various pestiviruses in their host species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638711417142">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1040638711417142">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1040638711417142">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study tested the hypothesis that BVDV enhances the pathogenicity of PCV-2, triggering the severe form of PCVAD, and that the cellular tropism of BVDV might expand the tropism of PCV-2 and explain the emergence of unique lesions in renal tubule and bronchial gland epithelium as well as in blood vessels. A vaccination protocol to BVDV was tested as a possible measure to prevent development of clinical disease. Fatal interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary edema in addition to other lesions were produced that were microscopically associated with vasculitis in 1 out of 4 vaccinated, germ-free pigs inoculated with PCV-2b and a previously unrecognized BVDV-1–like virus. This animal also had typical microscopic lesions of PCVAD in lymphoid tissues. The findings prompted a similarly designed study in cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs. In the second study, clinical signs and lesions typical of the more severe form of PCVAD occurred in 1 out of 8 pigs solely inoculated with PCV-2b. This suggests that this viral genotype is by itself capable of inducing severe disease in pigs.</p>

<title>Experiment 1, germ-free pigs</title>
<p>Twenty near-term crossbreed pigs were derived by cesarean section from 2 sows seronegative for PRRSV and not viremic for PCV-2, PRRSV, or BVDV. Pigs were maintained in gnotobiotic isolator units in the Animal Resource Wing at South Dakota State University (Brookings, South Dakota). During the first 3 weeks of the study, animals were raised 4 to an isolator and thereafter were kept in groups of 2. Therefore, the initial number of 5 isolators was later increased to 10 units. Pigs were fed with commercial milk substitute<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638711417142">a</xref></sup> 3 times per day for the first 16 days, and 2 times per day for the rest of the study.</p>

At 3 days of age (study day: 21), pigs in groups 2 and 5 were vaccinated through the intramuscular route using 2 ml of a commercial killed vaccine for BVDV-1 and -2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638711417142">b</xref></sup> The pigs received a booster of 2 ml of a Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell culture lysate containing the nonpathogenic, cytopathic NADL (National Animal Disease Laboratory) strain of BVDV-1 with a titer of 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> at 10 days of age (day −14). When pigs were 24 days old (day 0), all animals in groups 1–4 were inoculated with 4 ml (1 ml each into both nostrils and right and left thigh musculature) of 1 out of 3 inocula: groups 1 and 2 received a filtered (through a 0.2-μm syringe filter) homogenate prepared from tissues of pigs with PCVAD known to contain PCV-2b (GenBank accession no.

<p>Animals were examined daily for alterations in clinical status. Specific clinical signs that were monitored included behavioral changes (such as lethargy), dyspnea, cough, icterus, and wasting. Two pigs from each group were humanely euthanized at days 10 and 21/22. At necropsy, samples of selected tissues were collected from each pig and preserved at −80ºC for virus detection and in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathologic analysis. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Purdue University and South Dakota State University.</p>

<p>Pigs were kept under strict biosecurity conditions and were observed daily. Animals were scored for severity of respiratory disease, wasting, and icterus. At each of days 0, 4, and 14, 2 pigs from each group were euthanized; the remaining pigs of each group were euthanized at day 35. On the same days, serum samples were collected from all animals. At necropsy, samples of selected tissues were collected into 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathologic examination and were frozen at −80°C for virus detection. Additionally, serum samples from each pig were tested for antibodies to PCV-2, BVDV, PRRSV, and PPV, and samples from pigs that remained until the end of the study were tested for antibodies to <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>. The experimental protocol was approved by the Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>In situ hybridization for PCV-2</title>
<p>In situ hybridization (ISH) to demonstrate PCV-2 nucleic acid was performed on sections of lung, lymph nodes, tonsil, spleen, ileum, liver, kidney, gonad, and brain and spinal cord of all pigs of the germ-free and CD/CD study. Two digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes (DIG-5′-AAGTTCAGCCA GCCCGCGG-3′ and DIG-5′-CATTCCAACGGGGTCTG ATTGCTGG-3′) were designed for ISH based on highly conserved regions of the PCV-2 genome (nucleotide positions 491–509 and 811–835, respectively).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clinical signs and lesions typical of those observed in North America since 2004 in a more severe form of PCVAD were experimentally reproduced in 1 pig of each of the experimental studies. The germ-free pig that died was vaccinated for BVDV followed by inoculation with filtered homogenate containing PCV-2b and a previously unrecognized BVDV-1–like virus. A two-step vaccination protocol was used in order to combine the safety of an inactivated vaccine (administered at an age when the immune system was still developing in the piglets) with the good immune response induced by an attenuated live cytopathic vaccine strain (administered when the pigs were old enough to mount an adequate immune response). It was anticipated that clinical PCVAD in the vaccinated pigs would be prevented; instead fatal disease in 1 of 2 pigs that remained until the end of the study was produced. Therefore, vaccination with a commercial inactivated BVDV vaccine followed by infection with a viable cytopathic vaccine virus did not prevent PCVAD in this model. This was thought to be due to 1) the effect of immune stimulation (a single dose of a vaccine containing the adjuvant Quil A, a saponin derivative, was used), or 2) the much higher dose and effective replication of pestivirus used as modified live vaccine as compared to the low dose of the BVDV-1–like virus in nonvaccinated pigs, or 3) a combination of these 2.</p>
<p>Results of the germ-free study prompted a similarly designed study in CDCD pigs using the same PCV-2b virus and modified live vaccine BVDV as used in the first study. This culturable BVDV strain was chosen over the field virus because it allowed for a higher inoculum titer and therefore a better evaluation of the effect of BVDV infection in pigs co-inoculated with PCV-2b. In the second study, clinical signs and lesions typical of the more severe form of systemic PCVAD occurred in 1 out of 4 pigs solely inoculated with PCV-2b. The results contradict the hypothesis that ruminant pestivirus is a novel triggering agent in systemic PCVAD that accounts for the difference in clinicopathologic manifestation of the disease. The results are also in contrast to recent observations that PCV-2b is by itself not sufficient to induce severe disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638711417142">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The occurrence of high viral load and lack or reduced amounts of anti–PCV-2 antibodies in the pigs that died supports a strong relationship between immune response, viral load, and outcome of viral infection. The efficacy of the immune response early in the viral infection seems to determine whether clinical PCVAD develops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711417142">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1040638711417142">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1040638711417142">37</xref></sup> It has been hypothesized that most animals become infected during the preweaning period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638711417142">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1040638711417142">46</xref></sup> Passively acquired antibodies through ingestion of colostrum and cellular immunity have previously been discussed as important in reducing viremia levels and protecting pigs from severe PCV-2–associated lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638711417142">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638711417142">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vasculitis accompanied by pulmonary and mesenteric edema and cavitary effusions in the pigs that died was likely induced by PCV-2, given the intense labeling for circoviral nucleic acid within and around the affected vessels. In the germ-free study, the vascular lesions were restricted to the animal that died naturally. In the CDCD study, however, 6 out of the 12 animals inoculated with PCV-2b and necropsied at days 30 or 35 had vascular lesions, 1 with acute and the other 5 with more chronic vascular and perivascular lesions. These vascular lesions were recently described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638711417142">27</xref></sup> Interestingly, all 6 CDCD pigs were the offspring of 2 related Landrace sows. This suggests a hereditary predisposition to the development of vascular lesions. This is consistent with previously reported experimental evidence that host genetics may increase susceptibility of animals to PCV-2–associated lesions and disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1040638711417142">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pigs inoculated solely with BVDV-1 lacked gross lesions. Microscopic alterations were subtle and restricted to mild lymphocytic inflammation in multiple tissues. This confirms previous observations that BVDV infection in pigs usually develops without any clinical signs or significant lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638711417142">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638711417142">31</xref></sup> Subclinical infection and mild disease are also the most common consequence of post-natal infection with BVDV in cattle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638711417142">44</xref></sup> Infected animals of this species may be viremic from 4 to 15 days after initial infection. Similarly, pigs in the current study were only transiently viremic, with lower levels of virus being present in the serum of vaccinated animals.</p>
<p>Multiple pigs in both studies were positive for TTV-1 and/or TTV-2 by the end of the experiments. TTV has been shown to be highly prevalent and widely distributed in pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1040638711417142">33</xref></sup> Infection with this group of viruses has been found in association with co-infections with several other viruses, primarily PCV-2 and porcine Boca-like virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638711417142">4</xref></sup> Both TTV-1 and -2 have been implicated by some authors as another virus that facilitates PCV-2–induced systemic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638711417142">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638711417142">20</xref></sup> Lesions of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome were detected in pigs with combined experimental infection with TTV and PRRSV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638711417142">24</xref></sup> and there may be a relationship between TTV-2 infection and reproductive failure in sows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1040638711417142">47</xref></sup> Other studies demonstrated that pigs with PCVAD were similarly more likely infected with TTV-2 than nonaffected pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638711417142">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638711417142">20</xref></sup> In a different study, however, TTV viral load did not differ significantly between pigs that were PCV-2–negative and those affected with clinical disease by PCV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638711417142">30</xref></sup> Additionally, it has been shown that also pigs without PCVAD were positive simultaneously for PCV-2, TTV-1, and TTV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638711417142">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638711417142">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638711417142">30</xref></sup> In the animal experiments reported herein, TTV-1 and -2 were detected in the filtered inoculum containing PCV-2b and BVDV-1–like virus. As a result of this, vaccinated germ-free pigs that received this inoculum were positive for TTV-1 at day 10, and all (vaccinated and nonvaccinated) germ-free pigs that received this inoculum were positive for TTV-2 at days 21/22, including the germ-free pig that died. In the second study, all but 1 CDCD pig of each group (or 2 in the negative control group) were positive for TTV-2 at the time of euthanasia. Most importantly, the CDCD pig that died in the second study was negative for TTV. Thus, the role of TTV as an aggravating factor of PCV-2 infection remains to be determined.</p>
<p>In the CDCD pig that died, no infectious agent that would serve as an immunostimulatory co-factor was detected. This is in contrast to the multiple other pigs in the same study that became infected with TTV or PPV before the termination of the study. PPV is a well-known co-factor of PCVAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711417142">1</xref></sup> Although co-infection with PPV did not lead to development of clinical disease, it may have influenced the severity of the lesions and the amount of circoviral nucleic acid, which at 35 days post–PCV-2 infection were higher in multiple tissues of the animals co-infected with PPV than in the other pigs inoculated with PCV-2b.</p>
<p>Multiple CDCD pigs of various treatment groups developed polyarthritis at 6–7 weeks of age that resolved in 1–3 days in association with antibiotic therapy. Polyarthritis is a common problem in young pigs that is usually a sequel to bacteremia or septicemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1040638711417142">52</xref></sup> Early treatment reduces the duration of illness and mortality. Bacterial cultures were negative on joint fluid collected from affected animals that were necropsied at the time of the outbreak (day 0). This was likely due to interference from therapeutic antibiotics. PCV-2 and BVDV were detected in synovial fluid of affected animals in the groups inoculated with each respective virus; however, negative control pigs had similar clinical and pathologic findings despite testing negative for both viruses. The animals with polyarthritis had fibrous tags on multiple serosal surfaces, in addition to the typical lymphocytic synovitis that may persist after acute fibrinous synovitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1040638711417142">48</xref></sup> These findings are indicative of infectious arthritis associated with bacteremia. Lack of colostral immunoglobulins likely predisposed the animals to such disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1040638711417142">48</xref></sup> which was probably further complicated by PCV-2 and BVDV infection. The potential for interference by such a systemic bacterial infection in the proliferation of PCV-2 and/or in the immune response to this virus cannot be disregarded in the CDCD pig that died.</p>
<p>Evidence was found that variability in (subclinical) disease expression may be influenced by host genetics, which is different from the so-called “sow effect” on litter mortality as it relates to sow PCV-2 viremia and antibody titer against this virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638711417142">5</xref></sup> Additionally, the findings suggest that the vascular system is a replication site of PCV-2, which could explain the multisystemic distribution of lesions in PCVAD. Further experimental studies are necessary to confirm these findings.</p>
