<abstract>
<p>This article exploits the previously unused private papers of the General Headquarters doctrine writers to examine the process by which the British Expeditionary Force’s combat doctrine was produced and the influences upon it. It also reveals SS.198, a hitherto unknown manual from the autumn of 1917, which illustrates Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig’s influence upon doctrine writing at the time of the controversial Third Ypres offensive. It concludes that the doctrinal process raises serious questions about the notion of a consistent ‘learning curve’ within the BEF.</p>

<body>
<p>In May 1917 Captain Lord Gorell, then a ‘staff learner’ with an infantry brigade,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968344512455971">1</xref></sup> received a letter from General Headquarters (GHQ) explaining why he was being summoned unexpectedly to work there:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have a pamphlet regarding Training in France which in its present style of English does not suit the critical tastes of the [Chief of the General Staff] and we therefore are availing ourselves of a well-known master of English like yourself. We hope about three days will see you through with it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968344512455971">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The pamphlet, entitled <italic>Instructions for the Training of the British Armies in France</italic>, was published the following month,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968344512455971">3</xref></sup> but Gorell did not return to the front, and almost a year later he was still writing doctrine manuals at GHQ. Printed by the army’s Stationery Service these documents became part of the SS series of official publications that carried the imprimatur ‘issued by the General Staff’. This article will examine the process by which these important doctrine manuals were produced. Although other historians have already identified the existence and significance of the British Expeditionary Force’s (BEF) doctrine, the process by which it was produced has not been examined properly. This article seeks to fill that gap by exploiting the previously unused private papers of the GHQ doctrine writers. Although still fragmentary, the insight provided by their letters and diaries is a useful one. Understanding the BEF’s way of war demands an examination of how its doctrine was written and in particular the ‘keystone’ all-arms manuals focused at the divisional level. To achieve that end, the article has adopted a roughly chronological approach delineated primarily by the tenures of the doctrine writers themselves. First, the work of Lord Gorell from the spring of 1917 to the spring of 1918 is surveyed. Second, the brief contribution of Edward Grigg in the autumn of 1917 is explored. Finally, the work of Cuthbert Headlam from the spring of 1918 until the November armistice will be examined.</p>
<p>The British conduct of operations on the Western Front remains a controversial issue. Stephen Badsey has provided a useful encapsulation of the ongoing debate:
<disp-quote>
<p>Recent study of British fighting methods on the Western Front has largely followed a hypothesis first advanced in the early 1990s by Peter Simkins (then of the Imperial War Museum) as the ‘learning curve’, although the expression has been criticised on the fair but over-literal grounds that a ‘curve’ is too smooth a metaphor for a very disjointed process. The ‘learning curve’ hypothesis raises the question of how far the Allied victories of 1918 may be attributed to improvements in the British army rather than to other factors, and whether and how such improvements were made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968344512455971">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the BEF’s combat doctrine is of obvious importance to this debate, studies of it have tended to be focused at the tactical level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968344512455971">5</xref></sup> An exception to this is Andy Simpson’s groundbreaking analysis of corps command, which highlights the evolution of higher-level doctrine from the pre-war period and its influence upon the conduct of operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968344512455971">6</xref></sup> Although we should also note Simpson’s note of caution about projecting backwards our modern understanding of military doctrine, some preliminary observations are necessary before proceeding into the minutiae of this case study. At its simplest, doctrine can be understood to be that which is taught, but within a military context this might encompass a very broad spectrum of ideas from abstract theory down to unit-level ‘standard operating procedures’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968344512455971">7</xref></sup> A month before the armistice GHQ’s main doctrine writer captured the fundamental challenge in such work:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have been in the office all day – very busy, muddling away in the production of ‘doctrine’ … The factor that makes any writing upon things military rather difficult is that war is not a science … one has to weigh very carefully anything that one writes in a manual or pamphlet which is to be a textbook in the army. One can avoid pitfalls if one puts a thing absolutely generally – but if one does that, the work is not likely to be of much practical value. One has to come down from one’s pedestal and to try and give practical advice and accurate information that will be of real value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968344512455971">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although models for the production of doctrine do exist,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0968344512455971">9</xref></sup> there has been no attempt to impose such a structure upon the historical evidence in this article. The discussion of military doctrine is sometimes also hindered by a tendency, often on the part of political scientists, to use the word to encompass also broader strategic policy choices rather than just the narrower confines of operational or tactical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0968344512455971">10</xref></sup> The article confines itself to the latter, following the example of military historians who have framed doctrine more firmly in terms of ‘method’ or ‘procedure’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0968344512455971">11</xref></sup> It is also important to recognize that formal written doctrine is not necessarily synonymous with the realities of front-line practice. As General William Depuy put it, ‘doctrine, or the method of war an army employs, doesn’t work unless it’s between the ears of at least 51 percent of the soldiers who are charged to employ it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0968344512455971">12</xref></sup> In this respect, particularly in wartime,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0968344512455971">13</xref></sup> the contribution of training systems and the tactical beliefs of commanders and their staffs are probably more important than pamphlets issued by higher headquarters. But these sources of informal doctrine are much harder to pin down, precisely because they remain unwritten. That said, it could be argued that formal written doctrine is central to the creation of any learning process that is ‘objectively generated and communicated’ rather than one reliant upon organizational myths and word of mouth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0968344512455971">14</xref></sup> Thus the codification process can itself bring both rigour and uniformity to military practice. There is also an obvious need for such formal doctrine to be responsive to front-line realities and to be continually reviewed and updated. Otherwise there is the risk that even an apparently successful military organization might fall into a ‘competency trap’ whereby favourable performance leads it to persist with and gain even greater experience using an inferior procedure rather than replace it with a new one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0968344512455971">15</xref></sup> However, doctrine manuals can be interpreted as clear expressions of what is deemed to be ‘best practice’ by higher authorities. These are endorsed in the expectation that they will determine, or at least influence, the aforementioned training systems and tactical beliefs.</p>
<p>Because of the sheer scale of the question, this article cannot address fully the extent to which GHQ’s doctrinal pamphlets influenced the BEF’s front-line practice. However, this does not invalidate the investigation; regardless of the utility of its output, the doctrine-writing process is important because it tells us what GHQ wished the reality to be and this is itself revealing. Within the ongoing ‘learning curve’ debate, doctrinal codification is crucial because it is a fundamental part of any serious learning process. Put simply, if the BEF’s learning processes were really good, we would expect its doctrine-writing process to have been a strong one. To understand the overall condition, we must examine this symptom in great detail.</p>
<sec id="section1-0968344512455971">
<title>I. Lord Gorell</title>
<p>Upon his brother’s death in January 1917 Ronald Barnes assumed the family title, becoming, at the age of 32, the third Baron Gorell. Remembered by his military contemporaries as an earnest and hard-working young man,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0968344512455971">16</xref></sup> Gorell was not a career soldier. He had edited the <italic>Times Educational Supplement</italic>, and his pre-war military experience had been limited to two years in the Harrow School cadet corps. Having been refused entry initially in 1914 because of poor eyesight, in May 1915 Gorell joined the army and in August deployed to France, where he joined 7th Battalion, Rifle Brigade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0968344512455971">17</xref></sup> After serving as their signals officer, he became the battalion’s adjutant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0968344512455971">18</xref></sup> Having been wounded on the Somme in September 1916, Gorell recuperated in England before attending the staff course in Cambridge. He returned to the Western Front in April 1917 with a Military Cross for his earlier service, and was summoned to GHQ the following month. There he joined the Training Branch headed by Brigadier General Arthur Solly-Flood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0968344512455971">19</xref></sup> Having led 35th Brigade on the Somme, Solly-Flood had then commanded Third Army’s school for a couple of months before his appointment to GHQ in early February 1917 to head the new branch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0968344512455971">20</xref></sup> His successor would later sum up the role as being:
<disp-quote>
<p>In charge of the Schools of Instruction directly under GHQ – [spending] a good deal of time visiting divisions – learning their experiences in order to keep everyone up to date with any tactical developments that take place by sending round pamphlets on subjects of interest and generally helping the staffs of Armies and other formations with training work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0968344512455971">21</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is the production of these pamphlets that is the focus of this article but, as this quote shows quite clearly, that activity was only one of the Training Branch’s responsibilities. Its main focus was the BEF’s burgeoning training infrastructure, with army and corps ‘schools’ developing rapidly from 1915 onwards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0968344512455971">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, plenty of doctrine writing had already taken place before Gorell’s arrival at GHQ. The publications from March 1916 to April 1917 are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0968344512455971">Table 1</xref>. Surveying the 1916 output, one is struck by the relatively small number of pamphlets and their low-level focus. Thus the infantry manuals cover trench warfare (SS.101), ‘minor enterprises’ (SS.107), machine guns (SS.122), and the use of bombers (SS.126), while the artillery ones focus on the integration of air observation (SS.121, SS.124). More significant are the all-arms pamphlets. In addition to the July summaries of French operational practice (SS.117) and the initial lessons learnt on the Somme (SS.119),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0968344512455971">23</xref></sup> we also see the first instalments in a series of ‘keystone’ manuals focused overtly at the divisional level. SS.109, <italic>Training of Divisions for Offensive Action</italic>, preceding the offensive and the first edition of SS.135, <italic>Instructions for the Training of Divisions for Offensive Action</italic>, came immediately after it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0968344512455971">24</xref></sup> The genealogy and development of this series is very significant, as it effectively formed the highest level of combat doctrine published by the BEF.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Following its establishment in February 1917 the new Training Branch published a series of pamphlets with a more tactical focus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0968344512455971">25</xref></sup> These included the SS.139 collection, which codified artillery practice, similar guidance for engineers (SS.145) and communicators (SS.148), but perhaps most significantly three infantry tactical manuals: SS.143, <italic>Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action</italic>; SS.144, <italic>The Normal Formation for the Attack</italic>; and SS.600, <italic>The Organization of an Infantry Battalion and the Normal Formation for the Attack</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0968344512455971">26</xref></sup> Of these, SS.143 is an important doctrinal milestone that has received much attention within the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0968344512455971">27</xref></sup> Surveying the evidence on its antecedents and likely authorship, Alistair Geddes has argued persuasively that its content derived from French infantry tactics that were adapted by Solly-Flood during his time at the Third Army School.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0968344512455971">28</xref></sup> Such prior preparation of SS.143 and SS.144 would also explain their dissemination within a few weeks of his arrival at GHQ, further supporting Geddes’s contention that Solly-Flood was their primary author.</p>
<p>But in early 1917 the normal process of doctrine writing appears to have been more committee-based. The March 1917 publication of SS.148, <italic>Forward Inter-Communication in Battle</italic>, provides an illustration of what was probably the common practice. After the Somme the need to standardize communication procedures had been recognized, and so following a four-day ‘Staff and Signal Conference’ it was written up in four days, presumably by some of the participants, and then published within two weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0968344512455971">29</xref></sup> By bringing current practitioners together to codify their work, the pamphlets would reflect what was actually happening at the front and would thereby allow the dissemination of experience across the BEF, particularly to armies not engaged on active battlefronts. But there are potential limits to this approach. Although we can assume some GHQ staff officers would have been involved in the conference and the writing-up, the process is almost wholly ‘bottom-up’. Although this has obvious benefits, GHQ’s capacity to influence doctrine through these committees was diluted. Therefore, over time, there is the danger of incoherence across the body of doctrine as individual groups of specialists adopt their own parochial focus. Also, as illustrated by the quote at the start of this article, the structure or quality of the writing might not be deemed suitable for dissemination to the wider BEF.</p>
<p>We can therefore see Gorell’s appointment as marking a step change in the doctrinal process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0968344512455971">30</xref></sup> Instead of diverting operations staff officers or delegating the work to equally busy front-line practitioners, GHQ established a full-time editorial function within its Training Branch. As a former news editor, Gorell was clearly well suited to this role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0968344512455971">31</xref></sup> GHQ’s output during his tenure is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0968344512455971">Table 2</xref>. Looking at the collection held by the Imperial War Museum, the increase in the number of SS-prefixed combat doctrine manuals is obvious. As a comparison with the earlier work shows, in the 13 months prior to Gorell’s arrival, GHQ published 26 pamphlets; in the 11 months afterwards, 39. This suggests that the establishment of a dedicated doctrine-editor helped to increase the flow. From Gorell’s papers we can discern three modes for his editorial work. The most straightforward was the tidying of other people’s work. This seems to have formed the bulk of his workload.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0968344512455971">32</xref></sup> Second, he was author or part-author of at least two important publications: SS.202, <italic>The Organization of Shell-Hole Defences</italic>, in December 1917 and the 1918 edition of SS.143, which was renamed <italic>The Training and Employment of Platoons</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0968344512455971">33</xref></sup> Gorell described the latter as ‘the Platoon Commander’s Bible’; though dated January, it was not approved by the new chief of staff until the beginning of February, and only then after it had been vetted by an experienced battalion commander.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0968344512455971">34</xref></sup> Third, Gorell seems to have acted as the secretary to the doctrinal committees charged with producing manuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0968344512455971">35</xref></sup> This shows continuity with earlier practice and is well illustrated by the example of SS.210.</p>

<p>The committee ‘summoned to write’ SS.210, <italic>The Division in Defence</italic>, convened initially on 24 January 1918.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0968344512455971">36</xref></sup> It consisted of Major General Hugh Jeudwine, Brigadier Generals Cyril Macmullen and Alexander Baird, and Colonel James Edmonds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0968344512455971">37</xref></sup> They met initially for six hours, with Gorell acting as secretary. He was not greatly impressed with the proceedings, recording that he ‘found the conference full of talk and little else and that I shall have to do all the spade work’. They met again the following day before dispersing. Gorell and Baird then produced ‘a draft for them to consider’ when they reconvened on the afternoon of 30 January 1918. Drawing mainly upon Edmonds’s memoirs, Martin Samuels has criticized the work of the Jeudwine Committee, which suggested a simplified version of German defensive doctrine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0968344512455971">38</xref></sup> Gorell later recorded that the committee’s work progressed slowly owing to ‘dissensions and criticisms’, and that in mid-March the new head of operations at GHQ, Brigadier General John Dill, became involved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0968344512455971">39</xref></sup> Gorell’s papers also reveal that, bizarrely, in early March, GHQ’s new chief of staff, Lieutenant General Sir Herbert Lawrence, asked his convalescing predecessor, Sir Lancelot Kiggell, to contribute to the manual from England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0968344512455971">40</xref></sup> But SS.210 was still incomplete when the Germans attacked on 21 March 1918, and even Kiggell abandoned his work as it was ‘manifestly too late’ to be of use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0968344512455971">41</xref></sup> The British official history notes this fact and tells us that in its defensive battles the BEF was forced to rely upon the limited guidance contained in a memorandum issued by GHQ in mid-December 1917.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0968344512455971">42</xref></sup> To be fair, in a new and rambling introductory section, the January 1918 edition of SS.135, <italic>The Training and Employment of Divisions, 1918</italic>, did include some defensive guidance, but this seems to have been an attempt to justify the reissue of an attack manual under a different title. This failure to produce a defensive manual in the winter of 1917/18 is a serious indictment of the BEF’s doctrine-writing process and may help to explain the subsequent change in approach.</p>
<p>It is also clear that Gorell’s doctrine editing was put on hold when more important tasks emerged. Apparently because of a <italic>Times</italic> article that had caught the commander-in-chief’s eye, he was selected at the start of the Third Ypres offensive to act as the liaison officer between the GHQ operations staff and Haig’s forward headquarters, which was then located on a camouflaged train.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0968344512455971">43</xref></sup> Similarly in March 1918 he was also diverted to an ‘emergency job’, this time passing on lessons learnt to fresh drafts of officers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0968344512455971">44</xref></sup> Gorell’s doctrinal work ended in April 1918 when Major Cuthbert Headlam arrived at GHQ. Following considerable discord between them, he replaced Gorell as the principal doctrine-editor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0968344512455971">45</xref></sup> Gorell’s final task was to produce some ‘short papers [on] new tactics adopted by the Germans during their attacks in March and April’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0968344512455971">46</xref></sup> Gorell’s work then became the delivery of education, a new part of the Training Branch’s portfolio. This role would lead him to the War Office in July and subsequent promotion to full colonel. He would then become the driving force behind the eventual establishment of the Army Educational Corps in 1920.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0968344512455971">47</xref></sup></p>

<title>II. Edward Grigg</title>
<p>In the autumn of 1917 it is possible to discern also the involvement of Edward Grigg in the doctrinal process. Commissioned in February 1915 into the Grenadier Guards, ‘Ned’ Grigg was then a 35-year-old journalist who had been the colonial editor of <italic>The Times</italic>. Having become a year later General Staff Officer, 3rd Grade (GSO3), of the Guards Division, he became a brigade major in July. Nicknamed ‘the Scribe’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0968344512455971">48</xref></sup> from February 1917 he worked as a GSO2 with XIX and then XVIII Corps before moving to the operations staff at GHQ in September.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0968344512455971">49</xref></sup> He served there until December before returning to the Guards Division as GSO1 from February 1918 until the armistice. His performance in that role prompted Winston Churchill to write retrospectively that he had ‘won universal confidence’ and that he was ‘one of the best officers the New Army [had] produced’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0968344512455971">50</xref></sup> After the war he went into politics, and served as private secretary to the prime minister David Lloyd George and as governor of Kenya during the 1920s. Grigg’s most notable doctrinal contribution was the writing of SS.198, <italic>Tactical Instructions for the Offensive of 1918</italic>, a pamphlet drafted by GHQ in October 1917 but never disseminated to the BEF. The copy that survives in Gorell’s papers has the annotation that it was ‘mainly compiled’ by Grigg.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0968344512455971">51</xref></sup> This ‘doctrine manual that never was’ is significant. Primarily, it gives us an insight into what GHQ considered to be tactically desirable during the latter stages of the Third Ypres offensive. Given the historiographical significance of this battle, and the apparent influence of Haig upon the pamphlet’s content, we must take it seriously as a historical source.</p>
<p>Taking an overview of GHQ’s higher-level doctrinal work as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0968344512455971">Table 3</xref>, SS.198 can be seen as the missing link in the chain of all-arms manuals focused at the divisional level. The first of these, SS.109, <italic>Training of Divisions for Offensive Action</italic>, preceded the Somme offensive and was reinforced shortly after its opening by SS.119, <italic>Preliminary Notes on the Tactical Lessons of the Recent Operations</italic>. These were superseded when the experiences of the Somme fighting were captured in SS.135, <italic>Instructions for the Training of Divisions for Offensive Action</italic> in December 1916.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0968344512455971">52</xref></sup> Because they were published before the establishment of the Training Branch, the authorship of these manuals is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0968344512455971">53</xref></sup> Andy Simpson has argued that this first edition of SS.135 was seminal in that it established a less centralized system of command at the corps and divisional level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0968344512455971">54</xref></sup> The genealogical progression is interrupted slightly by SS.161, <italic>Instructions for Battle</italic>, written in May 1917 and issued in June. Like SS.119 before it, this can be seen as a supplement issued in the early part of the campaigning season. Fundamentally it is an analysis of changes to German battlefield doctrine and how British tactics should adapt to meet them. Therefore when Grigg came to write SS.198 the extant operational doctrine was the recently reissued SS.135. His work was also building upon the precedent of earlier attempts to learn operational lessons and transmit them to the BEF.</p>

<p>Marked ‘secret’ and intended to be issued down to brigade level, the 56-page SS.198 began with a recognition that ‘the enemy’s tactics [had] undergone considerable changes’ during 1917. Drawing upon captured documents, it noted that instead of continuous, linear, and parallel trench systems, the Germans were now holding their front line ‘more lightly and fighting for it rather than in it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0968344512455971">55</xref></sup> It also observed that German counter-attacks were developing more quickly and that artillery counter-barrages had become more immediate. The first chapter, entitled ‘Note on Major Tactics in the Present Stage of the War’, observed that the existing attack doctrine, as contained in SS.135, <italic>Instructions for the Training of Divisions for Offensive Action</italic> (December 1916), had been ‘designed to meet and overcome’ the old German defensive system. SS.198 therefore sought specifically to consolidate the lessons of the fighting in the second half of 1917. This also indicates a clear connection between intelligence work on German front-line behaviour and the doctrinal process.</p>
<p>In order to defeat the enemy’s new defensive system, SS.198 laid down eight ‘successive steps [for] a continuous offensive’. First was the establishment of ‘mastery over the enemy’s aircraft and artillery’; second, the protection of the infantry advance ‘by a moving barrage of artillery and machine-gun fire’; third, selection of ‘intermediate objectives’ to allow the reorganization of the infantry for further advances; fourth, selection of a final objective that was defensible against counter-attack and within ‘the zone of effective artillery support’, so that the attack might be resumed at ‘the earliest possible date’; fifth, the allocation of sufficient forces so that an immediate counter-attack could be defeated; sixth, the defence of the objective to be organized in depth to lessen the effects of German artillery; seventh, reserves to be available to ‘drive out’ any successful counter-attack; finally, concurrent preparations for the next attack in order to ‘strike a series of rapid blows’. It was envisaged that in the initial stages of an offensive ‘several carefully prepared attacks’ of this sort would be delivered ‘at intervals of a few days’ with shallow objectives. These would force the German to ‘use his reserves in counter-attack, [would] wear down his strength and his moral[e] to a point where [the BEF could] launch an attack upon deeper objectives with the prospect of far-reaching strategical results’. This approach was underpinned by a declaration of the moral and tactical superiority of the British and a belief that the Germans’ new defensive system was a response to the strength of British artillery and that they were ‘haunted by very real anxiety’ that their infantry might be ‘broken’.</p>
<p>Before subsequent chapters providing more detailed guidance to the infantry, artillery and Royal Flying Corps,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0968344512455971">56</xref></sup> SS.198 unpacked the four stages of ‘exploitation’ that were anticipated following a successful attack. The first envisaged ‘battle patrols’ being pushed out, but still under the artillery umbrella, to ‘points which are worth our occupation pending the next large advance’. Second was the relief of exhausted divisions to allow the resumption of the offensive. Third, on receipt of an army or GHQ order, was the launching of these fresh units toward further objectives, usually after the defeat of any German counter-attacks; these objectives were to be laid down in advance of the initial attack. The fourth stage describes ‘shaken’ enemy artillery and ‘demoralized’ infantry, with their immediate reserves having been ‘eaten up’ and their more distant reserves being ‘hampered by the dislocation in … transport facilities’. It went on to suggest ‘fresh infantry divisions’ being moved by rail or bus to ‘push through … at dawn next morning’ supported by mobile artillery, and with cavalry divisions ready to exploit their success. However, it cautioned against confusion and congestion, suggesting that:
<disp-quote>
<p>No deep thrust against the enemy’s communications should be attempted until the rear services are ready to make the maintenance of pressure by our fighting troops continuous. Modern battles are almost as much a struggle of organization against organization as of troops against troops.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Haig’s influence upon the conceptual framework laid down in SS.198 can be established from a manuscript note in his handwriting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0968344512455971">57</xref></sup> Gorell’s retrospective annotation associates the two documents and indicates that the initial writing process had taken place in September 1917 and it had involved Gorell himself, Kiggell, and Solly-Flood. Gorell also states that it ‘kept on being discussed [and] revised [and] eventually was rewritten’ by Grigg as SS.198. So although undated, Haig’s note is presumably initial guidance written in September 1917 and preserved by Gorell as a souvenir of his interaction with the commander-in-chief:
<disp-quote>
<p>1st Air supremacy. 2. Dominate hostile artillery. 1. When possible the ground <underline>The problem</underline>. 2 objectives. 1st defeat the hostile <underline>advanced troops</underline> holding shell holes etc. but this is only a means towards the 2nd objective, viz the subsequent destruction of the enemy’s main force which will try &amp; counter attack at favourable a point &amp; moment favourable to the Enemy. These distinct objectives necessitate a division of the attacking troops according to their roles. To make suitable dispositions rapidly to meet tactical situations as they occur and to influence effectively the action of our reserves, the Commanders position of Battalion, Brigade &amp; Div[isiona]l Com[mande]rs is of very great importance. Vide German Instru[ction]s on this. When the strategical situation permits the ground point chosen for attack should be primarily be selected on account of the advantages offered which the ground may be offered by the ground for the advance of our leading detachments by successive steps from defen one defensive position to another. As soon as the advanced troops have gained a suitable defensive position, it is to be fortified etc. <underline>without delay</underline> steps are to be taken to move forward the necessary means for exploiting the success thus gained for parrying such counter strikes as the enemy may make. Fresh troops, M[achine]-guns prepare fire positions etc. field co[mpanie]s – a few field guns etc. Barrage plans to be worked beforehand for further advance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first and most obvious correlation is the stress on air and artillery superiority, but one can also discern the two-stage break-in to the enemy’s position, the assumption of German counter-attacks and their defeat, and the prior selection of objectives based upon their defensive potential. Haig’s suggestion that barrage plans for subsequent advances should be pre-prepared would also match SS.198’s demand for concurrent preparation of subsequent attacks.</p>
<p>The methodical, bite-and-hold approach suggested by Haig’s note and encapsulated within SS.198 would seem to reflect a shift in GHQ’s informal doctrinal position during the Third Ypres offensive. This would support the argument advanced by Paul Harris and Sanders Marble that GHQ had undergone an ‘intellectual conversion … to step-by-step methods’ by early August 1917.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0968344512455971">58</xref></sup> The normal datum point for GHQ’s attitude is the guidance given by Haig to his army commanders in the planning phase. This has been subjected to close scrutiny, particularly the depth of the first day’s objectives. From the official history onwards,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0968344512455971">59</xref></sup> the central reference point for most analyses has been the 26 June memorandum sent by John Davidson, the Brigadier General (Operations) at GHQ, and the reply from General Sir Hubert Gough, the commander of Fifth Army. Although Travers does not refer to it, he does note Davidson’s cautious comments to the GHQ liaison officer at the French GHQ at the same time. Travers concludes that Haig ‘wanted to try a breakthrough offensive’ and so adopted a ‘hands-off’ approach to the planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0968344512455971">60</xref></sup> Essentially Davidson’s memorandum counselled caution and envisaged a ‘succession of operations each at two or three days’ interval’, with relatively shallow objectives of not more than 3,000 yards. Drawing upon the heavily annotated copy that survives in the Maxse papers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0968344512455971">61</xref></sup> Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson have argued that the ‘decisive voice’ against it was Haig’s, and that it echoed his earlier behaviour in the planning phase of the Somme offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0968344512455971">62</xref></sup> More recently, Andy Simpson has taken issue with this interpretation, arguing that Gough’s reply and, perhaps more importantly, his instructions to his subordinates ‘fully acknowledged the need for a careful, step-by-step approach’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0968344512455971">63</xref></sup> In his recent biography Paul Harris has taken the view that Haig did encourage the capture of deep objectives such as the Passchendaele Ridge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0968344512455971">64</xref></sup> But, as Harris has also highlighted, after the commencement of operations Haig’s preferences began to shift towards an advocacy of shallower objectives which resulted, ultimately, in the transference from mid-September of control of operations to the more cautious General Sir Herbert Plumer, commander of Second Army.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0968344512455971">65</xref></sup> Although Davidson would later claim that in writing the memorandum he had only been acting as a devil’s advocate, he also commended Haig for the speed at which he ‘reversed the whole plan and put the alternative plan [i.e. Davidson’s] into immediate operation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0968344512455971">66</xref></sup> Therefore, assuming that Gorell’s dating of the document is correct, Haig’s manuscript note represents a clear doctrinal response to the early setbacks of the Third Ypres offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0968344512455971">67</xref></sup> Having apparently taken this guidance as its foundation, the writing of SS.198 then evolved during the period of Plumer’s more successful operations with deliberately limited objectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0968344512455971">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>From Grigg’s papers we can also discern Davidson’s interest in drawing doctrinal lessons from the unsuccessful initial operations at Third Ypres, as well as their influence upon the later content of SS.198. On 31 July one of the least successful attacks had been that of 30th Division (II Corps) against the Gheluvelt Plateau.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0968344512455971">69</xref></sup> Subsequently Fifth Army ordered a court of inquiry into the division’s conduct. It made a number of concluding ‘general remarks’ regarding the planning of the barrage, communication problems particularly between the infantry and artillery, the difficulty of units ‘passing through’ others towards deep objectives, and an apparent reluctance of infantry platoons to deploy into line when advancing in section columns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0968344512455971">70</xref></sup> In early September, Grigg was tasked by Davidson to review all of the court’s papers and to summarize ‘the points of chief importance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0968344512455971">71</xref></sup> A week before Grigg completed this work, Gough disseminated his own analysis of the recent fighting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0968344512455971">72</xref></sup> In it he deplored the ‘dangerous’ tendency for troops to retire without resisting German counter-attacks. Deploying patriotic rhetoric and stressing the ‘moral superiority’ of the BEF over its enemy, Gough argued that counter-attacks could be defeated by rifle and Lewis gun fire, provided the British showed ‘a bold and resolute bearing’. He ordered that training exercises should emphasize such scenarios and that his order be transmitted orally to all officers under his command. Gough’s memorandum is similar to one issued by II Corps a few days before.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0968344512455971">73</xref></sup> Based on the testimony of a German officer prisoner who had ‘expressed genuine astonishment’ about the ease at which his half-hearted counter-attack had driven off the British, it also stressed the importance of small-arms fire. Gough’s disquiet about this failure to hold positions has already been highlighted by Prior and Wilson, who note his comments about court-martialling offenders made at a conference on 17 August.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0968344512455971">74</xref></sup> However, their judgement that this was the limit of Gough’s reflections on the tactical situation is unfair, given that two days later Fifth Army solicited the opinions of commanders down to brigade level ‘as to the best way of dealing with’ the new German defensive system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0968344512455971">75</xref></sup> Within a week this resulted in a directive that advocated adjustments to attack formations, repositioning of reserves, and more halts in the creeping barrage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0968344512455971">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although a direct connection between Gough’s strictures to Fifth Army and Grigg’s work at GHQ cannot be established, their coincidence could be interpreted as Davidson trying to establish an alternative interpretation for failure. Grigg’s review of the 30th Division inquiry’s papers made a number of recommendations about artillery barrages and the plans for attack, the echoes of which can be seen clearly in SS.198. Regarding barrages, the central point was the apparent disconnect between plans made by infantry brigade commanders and the artillery support that they received. Grigg highlighted the testimony of one brigadier general who said that ‘he thought that the barrage was an Army arrangement and that he could not interfere with it, although he realised that he could make representations about it’. Within SS.198 the requirement for the artillery to liaise during planning down to ‘brigade and even battalion’ level is made quite explicitly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0968344512455971">77</xref></sup> For attack plans Grigg stressed the need for careful management of troops passing through one another, including a pause in the barrage, so as to avoid the indiscriminate commitment of later waves. These points are also reiterated in SS.198.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0968344512455971">78</xref></sup> This evidence not only confirms Grigg’s primary authorship of SS.198, but also the clear influence of operational experience upon the doctrinal process.</p>
<p>It could also be argued that SS.198, with its overt endorsement of bite and hold, was simply a doctrinal manifestation of Davidson’s 26 June memorandum, supported retrospectively by Haig’s note. The unfolding of the Third Ypres offensive had vindicated Davidson’s warnings about the depth of objectives and the tempo of operations. Indeed, in this respect it is significant that SS.198 set a clear limit to the depth of any single attack to not more than 2500 yards and over difficult ground 1500 yards, a distance even shorter than Davidson’s earlier memorandum had suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0968344512455971">79</xref></sup> However, such strict limits were missing from the next iteration of divisional-level doctrine issued by GHQ. In January 1918, with ‘offensive action’ removed from its title, SS.135 was reissued with minor amendments as <italic>The Training and Employment of Divisions, 1918</italic>. The ‘Objectives’ section had been renamed ‘Depth of Attack and Choice of Objectives’. Although the first sentence was almost verbatim to that contained within SS.198, the specific yardage had been removed:
<disp-quote>
<p>The depth of an attack in a single day against organised positions held by good troops is limited by (a) Artillery support during the attack and during organisation for defence. (b) Physical capacity of the Infantry. (c) Nature of the ground.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0968344512455971">80</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once again Davidson’s prescriptive caution had been overruled. However, it should also be noted that the January 1918 edition of SS.135 opened with the suggestion that future operations ‘may normally be expected to take the form of a methodical and progressive battle, beginning with limited objectives and leading up by gradual stages to an attack on deep objectives’. In this respect the influence of SS.198 is clear, and this conceptualization might have contributed to GHQ’s expectations and then initial complacency in the face of the German onslaught in March.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0968344512455971">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking a step back to look at what SS.198 tells us about the doctrine-writing process, it is notable that the operations staff, rather than the Training Branch, seem to have been instrumental in its development. The priority Davidson gave this task is demonstrated by the deployment of one of his staff officers to such a substantive writing commitment. Of course Grigg, as a former divisional and corps staff officer with experience of the early operations at Third Ypres, was better equipped than Gorell to write such a manual; so the use of Grigg also says something about the perceived limits of the Training Branch’s doctrine-writing capacity. Low-level tactics and the editing of specialist pamphlets were their bread and butter, but in 1917 the ‘keystone’ divisional-level manuals required greater General Staff horsepower. The explanation might, though, be more banal: Solly-Flood handed over to Brigadier General Charles Bonham-Carter in mid-October, and this might have disrupted the continuity of the Training Branch’s work on SS.198. But ultimately, as Gorell would later note upon his proof copy, SS.198 ‘never got beyond this [draft] stage, as by Nov[ember] 1917 it was realized suddenly that what was wanted for the opening of 1918 was a book on <underline>defence</underline>’. So the significance of Grigg’s doctrinal contribution has hitherto passed unnoticed to scholars of the BEF.</p>

<sec id="section3-0968344512455971">
<title>III. Cuthbert Headlam</title>
<p>Headlam was surprised by his summons to GHQ and was irritated initially by his ‘boring and priggish’ colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0968344512455971">82</xref></sup> But he settled in eventually and in many ways was well suited to the role. A clerk in the House of Lords and a pre-war officer in the Bedfordshire Yeomanry, he had come to France with his regiment in June 1915 as a 39-year-old captain. After six months as an ADC to his brother-in-law, the Earl of Cavan, he transferred to the General Staff, and served as an intelligence staff officer at Second Army and then with VIII Corps from November 1916. After the war Headlam became a Conservative MP and editor of the <italic>Army Quarterly</italic>. The replacement of Gorell, an infantry battalion adjutant and erstwhile brigade-level ‘learner’, with an experienced corps-level staff officer is a notable development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0968344512455971">83</xref></sup> Intelligent, acerbic, and proud of the quality of his ‘literary abilities’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0968344512455971">84</xref></sup> he brought a different military perspective, and perhaps greater intellectual independence, to doctrine writing.</p>
<p>Headlam owed his position at GHQ to the patronage of his old friend Guy Dawnay, the new Major General, General Staff (Staff Duties).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0968344512455971">85</xref></sup> This role, which included the Training Branch within its responsibilities, had been established in the March 1918 reorganization of GHQ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0968344512455971">86</xref></sup> Within this restructuring a ‘Publications’ subsection had been established, thus creating Headlam’s post.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0968344512455971">87</xref></sup> Gorell recognized this change as a significant moment, noting that ‘it was [then] decided that the production of [doctrine] manuals had really become important’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0968344512455971">88</xref></sup> In justifying the increase in manpower, GHQ argued that these additional officers ‘should be able to visit commanders in the field, particularly in connection with the issue of pamphlets on lessons derived from operations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0968344512455971">89</xref></sup> The clear implication of this statement is that up to then insufficient liaison had occurred owing to the Training Branch’s limited resources.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dawnay’s leadership also seems to have been an important factor in creating a new context for doctrine writing within GHQ. With a reputation as an intellectual and something of a maverick, he had served in the Coldstream Guards until 1911 before going into business.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0968344512455971">90</xref></sup> Recalled in 1914 to work in the War Office, he then served in Gallipoli and Egypt before becoming deputy chief of staff of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force from August 1917. Dawnay’s Middle Eastern experience allowed him to look at conditions on the Western Front with fresh eyes. However, as Headlam realized, Dawnay’s intellect and wider experience were also problematic:
<disp-quote>
<p>He is inclined to be too certain about things. He believes in himself so firmly that he is apt to belittle other people. Of course he is much cleverer than the vast majority of people with whom he comes into contact – but he has not had enough experience of conditions out here to justify his attitude, at any rate in the opinion of most of the old gang.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0968344512455971">91</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Headlam also captured Dawnay’s reforming impulse when he recorded in June 1918 that ‘apparently he is going to remodel this branch from top to bottom and imagines that he is going to make a thundering good job of it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0968344512455971">92</xref></sup> This observation supports Alistair Geddes’s argument that it was Dawnay, rather than Bonham-Carter, who was the driving force behind the creation of an Inspectorate of Training in July.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0968344512455971">93</xref></sup> Led by an inspector general, Lieutenant General Sir Ivor Maxse, this new organization soon began issuing its own tactical publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0968344512455971">94</xref></sup> Arguably its assumption of this responsibility, combined with the existence of a mature doctrinal foundation in the form of SS.143, allowed the Publications subsection to address higher-level doctrinal problems. Therefore, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0968344512455971">Table 4</xref> shows, although the number of SS-prefixed manuals declined during Headlam’s tenure, their focus shifted upwards. This shift seems to have suited Headlam’s preferences. His outlook is shown when, in mid-July, Bonham-Carter moved on. His new superior had spent most of the war as a divisional staff officer, and so Headlam worried that ‘he views everything from the standpoint of a comparatively small formation – so I don’t anticipate that my “larger conceptions” will gain a hearing’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0968344512455971">95</xref></sup></p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The still-unpublished pamphlet SS.210, <italic>The Division in the Defence</italic>, was the first doctrinal challenge facing Headlam. The ‘dreary job’ of ‘cleaning up’ the draft took him about ten days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0968344512455971">96</xref></sup> Gorell noted, with perhaps a hint of <italic>Schadenfreude</italic>, that Headlam was ‘wrestling with [it] and finding how difficult and controversial it is’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0968344512455971">97</xref></sup> As Headlam explained to his wife:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have just completed my first book – or rather I have just finished the revision of a book which about fifteen people have been messing at. It was rather a tiresome job. It is bad enough to write anything yourself, but to try and cook up a hotch-potch of stuff written by other people and make it readable and good sense seems to me far harder. The authorities seem quite pleased with this first effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0968344512455971">98</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This assessment was correct, with Dawnay writing that ‘Cuthbert is a huge success, so far as I’m concerned. His views are sound, just what I want, and he can express them well.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0968344512455971">99</xref></sup> At this early stage Headlam seems to have been a little daunted by the magnitude of his task. He recorded that ‘it is rather alarming for a civilian soldier like myself to be suddenly faced with the job of having to write the new tactical instructions etc., for the whole Army’, but he consoled himself with the fact that his work would be ‘carefully vetted’ by his superiors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0968344512455971">100</xref></sup> He was also cynical about the utility of his efforts, suggesting that ‘the pathetic thing about it all is that no-one derives much benefit from the most admirably written text-books and precious few people even read them’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0968344512455971">101</xref></sup> Given that the BEF’s main defensive battles had already taken place, the belated appearance of SS.210 in May would seem to confirm Headlam’s view. However, the five British divisions deployed to the Aisne did find themselves facing another German offensive at the end of May.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0968344512455971">102</xref></sup> Dawnay later lunched with one of the divisional commanders and found him ‘high in praise of the theory of defence in our little book, he said it was exactly right’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0968344512455971">103</xref></sup> In a similar vein Dawnay also assembled the chiefs of staff of the BEF’s armies ‘in the hope of inducing them to believe what I tell them about tactical principles is right’. The discussion centred upon SS.210 and despite disagreement on ‘one or two matters of nomenclature’ they apparently ‘agreed thoroughly with the principles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0968344512455971">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the middle of May, Headlam seems to have become more confident in his work, recording that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am just beginning a new <italic>magnum opus</italic> on my own account – a very ambitious military work which I believe to be sorely needed, but which no-one has ventured to touch because the compiling of it presents so many difficulties. I shall probably give it up in despair before I get very far with it, but if I can do it, it ought to be a really useful book.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0968344512455971">105</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two days later his immediate superior, Lieutenant Colonel James Weatherby, visited Tank Corps headquarters. This prompted its chief of staff, J.F.C. Fuller, to note that ‘it is amazing the interest GHQ has suddenly begun to take in us’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0968344512455971">106</xref></sup> This coincidence along with subsequent developments suggests that Headlam’s new task was probably SS.214, <italic>Tanks and Their Employment in Co-operation with Other Arms</italic>, which was published eventually in August 1918.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0968344512455971">107</xref></sup> But at the beginning of June Fuller was not impressed with GHQ’s intentions, noting that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Dawnay now wants a Tank Tactical Manual written. A Major Headlam has been detailed to do so. He called in to see me. He knows nothing about either Tanks or Tactics … Headlam suggested that if he came here for 4 or 5 days he could pick up all that he wanted to know.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0968344512455971">108</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For his part, Headlam observed that the Tank Corps staff officers were ‘all enthusiasts [and] not very helpful’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0968344512455971">109</xref></sup> But he set to work and by the beginning of July the new manual was ready to be printed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0968344512455971">110</xref></sup> At this point he considered it to be ‘a great success’ and, noting congratulations from his superiors, he found ‘that my T[an]k Book has made me quite famous – because I have succeeded in producing a work on a disputed subject to which no-one can find an objection’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0968344512455971">111</xref></sup> As Paul Harris has argued, SS.214 coincided with a wider effort on the part of GHQ to integrate the Tank Corps more closely with the BEF’s other combat arms, contrasting directly with the more visionary and impractical suggestions embodied in Fuller’s paper of 24 May, known subsequently as ‘Plan 1919’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0968344512455971">112</xref></sup> Indeed, in comparison to that document, Harris has described SS.214 as a ‘literary embodiment of sanity and commonsense’ which was measured in its claims of what tanks could achieve, and which anticipated correctly ‘the tactical problems of tank use’ during the final stages of the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0968344512455971">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>SS.214 is therefore a significant milestone in what Tim Travers has conceptualized as the struggle between those who sought victory through the ‘traditional’ infantry–artillery approach and those who preferred ‘mechanical warfare’ solutions. Travers places Dawnay firmly in the traditionalist school, highlighting his view that there was no mechanical ‘royal road’ to victory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0968344512455971">114</xref></sup> Travers dates this argument and phrasing to August and September 1918, but we can push the overt adoption of this position further back. In early July, Dawnay signed off a letter to the Director of Military Operations (DMO) in London, arguing that ‘there is no royal road to victory, even in the direction of what Ludendorff is said to have called the too great reliance of the British on machinery’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0968344512455971">115</xref></sup> This coincides with the period of Headlam’s final touches to SS.214, which, in its introduction, states clearly that ‘the employment of tanks … does not entail any essential modifications in the … tactics of the infantry’, before noting that ‘it is unwise … to place too much reliance on mechanical contrivances’. It is unclear whether or not Headlam was acting simply as Dawnay’s amanuensis in this case. He did complain at this time about being ‘tightly controlled’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0968344512455971">116</xref></sup> but on the other hand there is later evidence that indicates his own perspective. Writing to his wife immediately after a visit from representatives of the Machine Gun Corps and Tank Corps, he reflected that:
<disp-quote>
<p>To listen to either one of them would be persuaded that [they] could win the war if only they were allowed to do so. I sit and listen to all that these people say and am gradually finding the <italic>juste milieu</italic> – which consists of working all the arms together so that one gets the full value out of each.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0968344512455971">117</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This would indicate a degree of open-mindedness and, given his greater experience upon the Western Front, it might even suggest that it was Headlam who was the influence upon Dawnay. It is also suggestive of a final consultation with the Tank Corps about its content that on 9 July Headlam recorded a ‘satisfactory interview with Fuller’ before starting work on his next manual the following day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0968344512455971">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>On 13 July Headlam was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became the GSO1 in charge of the Publications subsection. Although Dawnay’s influence upon this development is obvious, the perceived success of SS.214 within GHQ must have helped. From this point until the armistice Headlam’s main effort became a rewrite of the BEF’s primary divisional-level manual, SS.135, with the new title of <italic>The Division in Attack</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0968344512455971">119</xref></sup> Initially he found it a ‘trying and thankless job’ in which he made slow progress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0968344512455971">120</xref></sup> In early August he was still making ‘poor headway’ and found himself ‘practically dependent on Boch ideas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0968344512455971">121</xref></sup> This utilization of German doctrine might suggest that Headlam’s background in intelligence work was proving useful. By late August it was ready for submission to GHQ’s chief of staff, with Dawnay telling Headlam that ‘I hope [he] likes SS.135. It looked to me as if it was going to be A1 when I saw it in the rough.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0968344512455971">122</xref></sup> It then appears that a decision was taken to give the draft a wide circulation. While this occurred Headlam went on two weeks’ leave. He returned to GHQ on 21 September to find that a number of ‘opinions’ had been received, and, after some ‘fiddling about’, it was sent back and forth to the printers before the work was finally completed at the beginning of November.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0968344512455971">123</xref></sup> The final stages were interrupted by a further week’s leave, and the apparent lack of urgency can be explained by Headlam’s realization in mid-October that ‘the enemy has bitten the dust’ thus rendering his ‘oracular pronouncements on tactics and strategy’ irrelevant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0968344512455971">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>Its belated appearance means that SS.135 cannot have been an influence upon the BEF in late 1918, but it still needs to be taken seriously. It provides, of course, a useful datum for the British army’s post-war doctrinal development, but more importantly it represents a distillation of what GHQ considered to be ‘best practice’ during the victorious ‘Hundred Days’ campaign. Within the ongoing debate about the British army’s combat performance during the First World War, it provides a vital snapshot of its all-arms doctrine. Unlike Gorell’s tinkering with the January 1918 edition, this version of SS.135 was a complete rewrite. Headlam adopted a logical structure in two parts, with the ‘preliminary measures’ of training, planning, and preparations followed by the execution of the attack. Dawnay’s probable influence upon the content can be discerned from the aforementioned letter to the DMO. Sent two days before Headlam commenced work on SS.135, it contained a summary of ‘lessons to be learnt from our own and German practice and experience during this year’s campaign’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0968344512455971">125</xref></sup> These included the need for secrecy, for decentralization of command, and to exploit success by pushing on past centres of resistance. All of these points were addressed subsequently within SS.135: secrecy was given as one of the ‘essential conditions’ for success, and deception measures were explored in detail; all commanders were to be given ‘latitude in the execution of their tasks’ and nothing was to ‘hamper [their] initiative and freedom of manoeuvre’; and although failed attacks were not to be renewed, successful ones ‘should be pushed to the fullest extent possible’, especially against the enemy’s weak points, and even when flanking units had been ‘brought to standstill’. But although Dawnay’s letter had argued that short hurricane bombardments were insufficient against properly held positions, SS.135 gave the option of using tanks rather than a preliminary bombardment, while arguing that bombardments should be as short as possible and should seek to cut wire and neutralize the enemy’s observation or command nodes and indirect fire support, rather than pursuing his demoralization or the destruction of his defences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0968344512455971">126</xref></sup> On the vexed issue of depth of objectives, this edition followed the January 1918 one in not being specific and by listing the influencing factors. That said, it did suggest quite clearly that they ‘must not be too strictly limited’. However, in this regard the difference between operations against the German outpost zone and their main line of resistance was also stressed. Finally, the role of tanks had evolved slightly from that laid down in SS.214, suggesting successful lobbying from the Tank Corps. Whereas in the earlier document tanks were very much an auxiliary support to the infantry attack, with a possible exploitation role conceded for the Medium ‘A’ (Whippet), in SS.135 assistance to the infantry and exploiting an attack were given equal billing in the list of tasks.</p>
<p>The second substantive observation concerns SS.135’s genuflection towards the pre-war <italic>Field Service Regulations</italic> (FSR),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0968344512455971">127</xref></sup> with the earlier guidance being noted in regard to the ‘general principles’ of an attack, advanced guards, reconnaissance, operations orders, and frontages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0968344512455971">128</xref></sup> In the case of situation reports, it is even quoted in full. Although references to FSR had appeared in earlier doctrine manuals, this is more than just an accidental continuity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0968344512455971">129</xref></sup> In the earlier letter to the DMO, Dawnay had already argued that the experience of early 1918 had provided a ‘striking justification’ for the principles of pre-war doctrine, and so it is unsurprising that SS.135 argued strongly and at length for these ‘fundamental principles’:
<disp-quote>
<p>There has been a tendency during the present war to look upon trench warfare and open warfare as two separate things. This has led to a disregard of many of the fundamental principles, laid down in the training manuals issued before this war, as being inapplicable to trench warfare. Most noticeable have been the neglect of the principle of distribution in depth both in attack and defence, the loss of individual initiative, and the exaggeration of the value of ground for its own sake … Trench warfare, stripped of the trimmings and side shows in which it has been wrapped by the development of scientific appliances, stands revealed as open warfare temporarily brought to a standstill, and its general conduct is governed by the same principles as those which govern open warfare. Trench warfare is, really, only a phase or variation of open warfare, not something essentially different from it; and troops trained to fight in the open can adapt themselves easily to the more cramped and intense conditions of trench fighting, while the reverse is not the case.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During the SS.135 writing period Headlam’s own views on this issue are mixed. Initially he told his wife that because he was not a regular soldier, he refused ‘to be tied down to old shibboleths and axioms of undoubted truth but not to be taken literally’, but a week later he explained that ‘we are now engaged upon a colossal work which I am trying to make revolutionary in character – but its changes are really conservative, because they return to the oldest and most indisputable doctrines of war’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0968344512455971">130</xref></sup> Although this apparent conservatism on the part of Dawnay and Headlam might reinforce the charge that GHQ were too ‘traditionalist’, there might also be other factors at play. Dawnay was essentially a Western Front outsider seeking to gain acceptance for his own perspective of ‘best practice’ at the divisional level. The earlier experiences of producing and disseminating both SS.210 and SS.214 perhaps influenced his approach. Unlike lower-level doctrine, the key audience for SS.135 were battalion-level commanding officers, brigade, divisional, and corps commanders and their operations staffs, most of whom were regular soldiers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0968344512455971">131</xref></sup> In hailing the new operational context of 1918 but simultaneously harking back to pre-war ideas, SS.135 anchored itself in an established and familiar doctrine. The fact that Haig had been instrumental in the pre-war publication of FSR might have also eased SS.135’s passage through the approval process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0968344512455971">132</xref></sup></p>

<title>IV. Reflection</title>
<p>Until February 1917 the production of doctrine seems to have been just another task for the busy operations staff at GHQ. It would appear that they assigned a writer or simply convened committees on an ad hoc basis whenever a doctrinal need was identified. Once the Training Branch had been established, ‘ownership’ of doctrine transferred partly to them, if only because there was an obvious need for textbooks in the growing number of schools. However, the operations staff seems to have retained a powerful influence over content. Oddly, instead of concern about the potential incoherence of a growing body of doctrine created in a mainly bottom-up and piecemeal fashion, it seems to have been worries about writing style that prompted GHQ to take a half-step in the right direction by appointing Lord Gorell as a full-time doctrine editor. Despite his enthusiasm and background in journalism, his military experience was limited and so it is hard to describe him as much more than a clerk to the committee in many cases. That said, he seems to have been comfortable in the production of low-level tactical manuals such as SS.143. The fact that the operations staff diverted Grigg to update divisional-level doctrine in the autumn of 1917 shows their desire to retain control at the higher levels. More favourably, the production of SS.198 gives us clear evidence of the commander-in-chief’s involvement in the doctrinal process, albeit a limited one. Not until GHQ’s restructuring and the arrival of Dawnay and Headlam do we really see what might be termed a maturing of the process. Although they struggled initially with SS.210, the writing of SS.214 seems to mark a clear shift in GHQ’s doctrinal methodology. Instead of the old technique of forming a committee, a fluent and credible doctrine writer consulted with interested parties and then simply got on with it. But it is unclear whether or not this was a deliberate decision designed to circumvent the likes of Fuller, or simply an unconscious avoidance of the problems associated with writing by committee.</p>
<p>Gary Sheffield has argued that throughout the war the British army’s doctrine remained ‘semi-formal’ because ‘although vast numbers of pamphlets and training documents were issued, doctrine was never properly codified’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0968344512455971">133</xref></sup> This argument is certainly valid for 1916 and 1917, but is difficult to sustain from the spring of 1918 onwards. Regardless of whether their ‘traditionalist’ approach was correct or not, Dawnay and Headlam sought to harmonize the body of doctrine that they had inherited. The number of publications declined but their quality and wider coherence increased. The difficulty is that it was too little, too late. Regardless of the praise that has been heaped upon its platoon- and company-level pamphlets, it is a telling indictment that the BEF was simply unable to produce a divisional-level defence manual before the German spring offensive. Even in the summer of 1918 it was still playing catch-up; the rewrite of SS.135 was thorough and coherent across all arms but, again, it was not completed in time to be useful. Overall, between May 1917 and November 1918, the doctrine-writing system at GHQ improved considerably, but until the middle of 1918 it seems to have struggled to break out of its tactical-level ‘comfort zone’. All this raises serious questions about the learning process within the BEF, particularly above battalion level. The body of SS pamphlets are not, in themselves, conclusive proof of steadily increasing competence across the BEF. Indeed, the manner of their creation suggests an extremely uneven, almost haphazard process that does not really mature until mid-1918.</p>

<p>Around this time Headlam also recorded that he had started work on a ‘compendium’. He speculated too on whether he would bring this task to completion. However, this title does not suggest any degree of ambition or difficulty and so, given that he was juggling ‘half a dozen “literary” jobs’, this probably refers to a separate task: Pocket diary entry, 17 May, and Letter to Beatrice, 2 June 1918, Headlam papers, DRO, and Beach, <italic>Cuthbert Headlam</italic>, p. 203. Why Headlam would have decided that a tank manual was necessary is unclear. It is possible that his experiences at XIX Corps in August 1917 were an influence. He arrived less than a week after their use of tanks at Pilckem Ridge and may have picked up negative opinions within the headquarters about their contribution: Edmonds, <italic>Military Operations: France and Belgium, 1917</italic>, vol. 2, p. 168.</p></fn>

There are some differences between this and the final version but they are mainly related to a reordering of the text into five chapters rather than three: T/26, OB Training to MGRA &amp; RAF, 18 July 1918, WO 158/832, TNA.</p></fn>

<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0968344512455971">Table 3</xref> shows, the original December 1916 title specified ‘Offensive Action’ by divisions. The amended January 1918 version dropped this in order to conform to the BEF’s defensive posture at that time. With a specific defence manual now in existence, and the Allies about to take the offensive once again, the need for a separate attack manual was clear.</p></fn>

<p>This is a significant break with the earlier purpose of the preliminary bombardment as laid down in the December 1916 and January 1918 editions of SS.135 and the draft of SS.198. The development of the BEF’s artillery practice is explored thoroughly in: Sanders Marble, <italic>‘The Infantry Cannot Do with a Gun Less’: The Place of the Artillery in the BEF, 1914–1918</italic> (2003), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gutenberg-e.org/mas01/">www.gutenberg-e.org/mas01/</ext-link> [accessed 10 September 2010].</p></fn>

<p>General Pershing’s emphasis upon ‘open warfare’ and the rifle and bayonet as the primary weapon system for the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) might be seen as a similar embracing of ‘traditional’ doctrine, albeit at the tactical level: James Rainey, ‘Ambivalent Warfare: The Tactical Doctrine of the AEF in World War I’, <italic>Parameters</italic> XIII (1983), pp. 34–46. See also the wider discussion of AEF doctrine in: Mark Grotelueschen, <italic>The AEF Way of War: The American Army and Combat in World War 1</italic> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 10–58.</p></fn>

<p>SS.198 highlighted the relevance of FSR to the ‘moving warfare’ that had occurred during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line at the beginning of 1917. Like this edition of SS.135, it also made linkages to it with regard to the principles of attack and unit frontages. The January 1918 edition of SS.135 referred to it with regard to frontages and depth of attacks, while also arguing that FSR principles of attack and defence ‘hold good today’.</p></fn>
