<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if the Mastery of Stress Instrument (MSI) can assess further education needs of primary caregivers of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The MSI has been utilized to measure mastery in response to both illness and interventions, including education. The primary objective was to correlate MSI subscales and stress scores with caregiver age, ethnicity, gender, and education. Secondary objectives were to correlate MSI scores with child age at diagnosis, payer source, hemoglobin A1C (A1C), emergency room (ER) visits, or hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Caregivers from a pediatric endocrinology practice completed the MSI after basic diabetes education. Demographic data from caregivers and patients were obtained. A1C, ER, and DKA were evaluated 2 years following completion of the MSI. Descriptive univariate statistics and proportions on nominal or discrete data were used to describe the data. Bivariable analyses included <italic>t</italic> tests and ANOVAs.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Eighty-five of 88 participants completed the instrument. Caregivers between 40 and 49 years of age scored worse on change, acceptance, and growth subscales compared to those 18 to 29 years of age. Those 40 to 49 years of age reported having more stress compared to caregivers 18 to 29 years of age. Males reported having less stress and were more willing to implement change compared to females. No statistically significant relationships between secondary outcomes measurements and MSI scores were detected.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>The mastery of stress instrument identified groups of caregivers in need of further education or team interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is one of the major chronic illnesses in children and adolescence. Approximately 215 000 individuals under 20 are affected by diabetes in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721711436133">1</xref></sup> About 15 000 youth are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes per year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436133">2</xref></sup> and its diagnosis can be stressful to the child, caregivers, and family. At diagnosis, caregivers must learn a great deal of information in a relatively short amount of time and acquire certain skill sets necessary for caring for the child (use of blood glucose meter, proper injection technique, meal planning, etc). Ongoing successful management requires considerable time, energy, and daily diligence on the part of the caregiver as well as the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436133">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetes education is an essential element of a comprehensive diabetes care program. Some caregivers quickly overcome the stressful events associated with this illness and seem to master the educational concepts with ease. Others seem overwhelmed by the magnitude of daily involvement of caring for their child’s diabetes. Although behavioral and psychosocial interventions in diabetes have advanced,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436133">4</xref></sup> methods to identify families who are not managing the stress of caring for the child with type 1 diabetes are needed in the practice setting.</p>
<p>Younger created the Mastery of Stress Instrument (MSI) to measure mastery in response to both illness and interventions, including education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436133">5</xref></sup> As defined by Lazarus and Folkman, stress is defined “as a particular relationship between the person and the environment that is appraised by the person as taxing or exceeding his/her resources and endangering well-being.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721711436133">6(p19)</xref></sup> Mastery is defined not as absence of stress, but “the human response to difficult or stressful circumstances in which competency; control and dominion are gained over the experience of stress.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711436133">7</xref></sup> The conceptual elements of mastery are certainty, change, acceptance, and growth. The MSI includes these elements of mastery as well as a stress scale.</p>
<p>Younger et al utilized the MSI in mothers of preterm infants to assess mastery over the preterm birth and described the relationship with social support and depression. In this analysis, the tool identified that mastery over the health-related event (ie, delivery of a preterm infant) did not occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721711436133">8</xref></sup> In another study, the MSI and a Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale was given to patients who had been hospitalized for coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436133">9</xref></sup> Internal locus of control was shown to correlate with growth and total mastery over the event. The MSI has previously been tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711436133">10</xref></sup> and utilized in adults with type 2 diabetes. When utilized in type 2 patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721711436133">11</xref></sup> it was found that the MSI data were consistent with patient interview data. It also showed a correlation between MSI score and overt expression of concern (ie, those with a lower score on the MSI following diabetes education classes expressed greater anxiety and stress about managing their diabetes than those scoring higher). Furthermore, they indicated that they would like more one-on-one time with the diabetes educator. Knowledge of the participant’s mastery of an event (or lack thereof) can be used as an indication to provide further interventions. To our knowledge, this tool has not been utilized in primary caregivers of children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was to determine if the MSI can assess further education needs of primary caregivers of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.</p>

<sec id="section4-0145721711436133">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>Type 1 diabetes patients between the ages of 0 and 18 years, between March 2003 thru March 2007, were identified and their primary caregiver invited to participate in a questionnaire upon completion of their child’s initial basic or “survival skills” diabetes education. The primary caregiver was defined as the person within the family unit responsible for making the majority of decisions and/or responsible for most of the child’s daily diabetes management. Caregiver inclusion criteria were: age 18 years or older, primary caregiver who attended the education, ability to read and write English, willingness and ability to provide consent. Exclusion criteria were: diagnosis of type 1 diabetes outside our Center (ie, transferred into our practice after the diagnosis and initial education) and diagnosis of another type of diabetes. Families self-identified the primary caregiver. All questionnaires were completed within 48 hours after basic or “survival skills” education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145721711436133">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The project was completed at an outpatient academic pediatric endocrinology practice. In our practice, basic or “survival skills” education included pathophysiology, blood glucose meter instruction, target blood glucose ranges, insulin use, carbohydrate counting, exercise, and treatment of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Although every patient and family is unique, education time generally ranged from 8 to 10 hours provided over a few days. The remainder of diabetes education, consistent with Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) standards of care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436133">12</xref></sup> is provided at subsequent visits over the next several weeks. The DSME program provided is recognized by the American Diabetes Association. All patients were placed on an intensive insulin regimen, including carbohydrate counting, immediately after diagnosis, as per standard Center protocol.</p>

<title>Instrument</title>
<sec id="section7-0145721711436133">
<title>MSI Psychometric Properties</title>
<p>The MSI instrument has been demonstrated to have both content and construct validity as well as a high degree of reliability. Internal consistency of the total MSI and its subscales was previously shown to be high, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from .84 to .97.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436133">5</xref></sup> The MSI instrument has also been tested in several different clinical settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721711436133">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436133"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711436133"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721711436133">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721711436133">
<title>MSI Description</title>
<p>The MSI instrument has four scales, each with a 15 Likert-type questions with 29 items for the stress scale. The stress questions are intermixed, to interrupt the response set of the participant when they are completing the questionnaire. The first scale, Certainty, refers to “a state of having adopted a particular view that is free of troublesome doubts (assigns a cause for an event).”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436133">5</xref></sup> This is necessary for change and acceptance. Change is conceptualized as “the ability for effective problem-solving, decision making and action (mastery of fate).”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436133">5</xref></sup> Acceptance is defined as “the ability to acknowledge the event as true and/or normal and agree to the terms of the situation—adjusting one’s expectations realistically, giving up attempts to change events that cannot be changed and making a decision to go forward.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436133">5</xref></sup> Growth is conceptualized as “a state in which the individual has attained new competencies and feels stronger, more purposeful, and more efficacious than before the event.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436133">5</xref></sup> Growth occurs only after change and/or acceptance are in place. High scores, on all subscales, reflect agreement with these statements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721711436133">
<title>MSI Scoring</title>
<p>The author’s permission to utilize the MSI instrument was obtained. Results of the MSI were blinded from the educators until completion of the project. Upon completion of the MSI data collection, items from each MSI category (ie, certainty, change, acceptance, and growth) were summed to create each of the subscale scores. The maximum attainable score for each individual scale was 75 points. To achieve a score of 240 on the MSI means the participant, on average, agrees mastery has occurred. However, a score of less than 58 on the stress scale reflects that individual is denying stress related to the event (ie, new diagnosis of a child with type 1 diabetes). Of note, it is expected clinically that most, if not all, caregivers will have less mastery and more stress immediately after a traumatic event. The elements of mastery as defined by Younger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711436133">7</xref></sup> are processes, each beginning early in a stressful event and evolving over time. All caregivers will not experience distress over the diagnosis nor master the components of stress subscales similarly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721711436133">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Demographic data for the caregiver (age, education level, gender, and ethnicity) were gathered in the questionnaire documents. Payer source was collected from the child’s clinic registration information. Demographic data concerning the patient (ie, age at diagnosis, A1C, ER visits, subsequent hospitalizations for DKA) were obtained from the patient’s medical records (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721711436133">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721711436133">2</xref>). A1C, ER, or hospitalization for DKA were evaluated 2 years following the diagnosis, education, and completion of the MSI. Point-of-care A1C values (analyzed by DCA Vantage Analyzer [Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA]; range 2.5%-14.0%) were recorded. All details that might reveal the identity of any subjects were omitted from data collection reports. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found within the 40- to 49-year-old primary caregivers that they had the least mastery upon completion of initial basic diabetes education. This age group was the least likely to change, had less acceptance and less growth, leading to an overall lower mastery score. Furthermore, they had the highest stress score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721711436133">Figure 1</xref>). These data are contradictory to those of Streisand et al, which reported more frequent stress but also more self-efficacy in younger caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721711436133">13</xref></sup> Stress issues are highly relevant to those in midlife and often produce physiological responses as well as psychological effects. However, there is limited literature that examines whether individuals in midlife are more or less vulnerable to the effects of stress compared to other ages or whether they exhibit different skills for mastery of stress. More studies are being conducted to determine reasons that older adults may be less emotionally reactive to stressors than younger adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721711436133">14</xref></sup> While older adults may experience more stress and likewise be more vulnerable to its adverse effects, they often report less stress and may exhibit better resilience than younger adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721711436133">15</xref></sup> While stress may also have positive effects on well-being, most studies offer no conclusions as to differences this has with age. Some evidence suggests that the source or type of stress may influence the ability to appraise and manage stress. Nevertheless, Neupert and colleagues found that middle-aged and older adults evidenced a smaller increase in psychological distress in response to interpersonal stressors than did younger adults, and middle-aged adults were less physically reactive to work stressors than were younger adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721711436133">15</xref></sup> While this study examined different stress domains in which age could potentially be a factor in stress response or mastery, it did not look at stress response to chronic illness of a loved one.</p>
<p>Overall, those caregivers in the 40- to 49-year-old age range may have developed different responses in appraising and mastering stress based on the type of stressful situation; in this case, the illness of their child. Also, it is at midlife that the onset of chronic illness, particularly diabetes, becomes a possibility for themselves as well as the possibility of illness and end-of-life issues with their own parents. As such, caregivers in this age range may see their own vulnerability for illness, which increases stress and decreases perceptions of mastery. In addition to responses in appraising and mastering stress based on the situation, one might speculate why older caregivers were observed to have acquired less mastery following diabetes education: busy with multiple children, more involved careers, likely to have other children, with attendant extracurricular activities, and so on; however, this study did not address the actual associated causes. We did not observe statistically significant differences in education or age of the child at the time of diagnosis as related to the primary caregivers’ MSI scores. Relevant future clinical studies might be designed to explore such associated factors, particularly those related to caregiver age.</p>
<p>We also found differences in scores by gender of the caregiver, but only on the Change subscale of the MSI instrument. Male primary caregivers scored higher regarding willingness to implement changes (change as defined as effective problem solving, decision making, and action) following diagnosis. These data are consistent with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436133">16</xref></sup> showing higher levels of stress in female caregivers. Mitchell et al evaluated stress among parents of young children and observed that the fathers’ responses were different from those of the mothers. Fathers’ levels of stress were relatively low and related to their child’s behavior at the time (as reported by mothers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721711436133">17</xref></sup> The observation of higher stress levels in female caregivers has been reported, although using different instruments than those used in the present study. Streisand et al used the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) to measure pediatric parenting stress. The PIP assessed the domains of communication, emotional functioning, the child’s medical care, and role functioning. It was found that there were higher stress levels in female caregivers of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721711436133">18</xref></sup> Similarly, Haugstvedt et al observed mothers to have more emotional distress (assessed by the Family Burden Scale and HSCL-25) compared to fathers, although the observed increased emotional distress was related to greater perceived burden concerning medical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721711436133">19</xref></sup> In addition, studies not related to children with a chronic illness have also shown gender differences related to stress. When women and men are confronted with similar stressors, women may be more vulnerable than men to developing maladaptive coping strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721711436133">20</xref></sup> Women show a greater reactivity to stress when compared to men and this can be attributed to gender differences in self-concept and coping responses to stress.</p>
<p>Metabolic control is a common marker of physiological adaptation to a chronic illness such as diabetes. A relationship with caregiver stress and glycemic control in children and adolescents has been observed. Langrock et al showed a link between caregiver depressive symptoms and caregiver withdrawal, which one could speculate then contributes to worse glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721711436133">21</xref></sup> Stallwood found a negative association between caregiver stress levels and A1C values. They also found higher levels of home management were associated with lower A1C values, possibly due to stress being a motivator contributing to improved glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721711436133">22</xref></sup> Butler et al found increased parental perceived burden was associated with higher A1C values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721711436133">23</xref></sup> Cunningham et al found similar results when they measured anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived burden specific to diabetes management. Glycemic control of adolescents was positively associated with perceived burden of diabetes management, particularly for depressive symptoms in the caregiver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721711436133">24</xref></sup> In our analysis, A1C was a secondary outcome measure we evaluated, however, we did not find A1C to be significantly affected at 2 years after the diagnosis. Evaluations at time points further out (ie, 5 years after diagnosis) or a larger sample size may have shown statistical significance related to A1C, ER visits, and/or hospitalizations for DKA.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study should be noted. First, this analysis reflects the primary caregiver’s levels of stress and its mastery at only one point in time. Additional analyses over time and how it might change is needed. Factors contributing to stress are multifactorial, and it is possible not all stressors were captured. However, all caregivers were evaluated at the same point in time related to their child being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (ie, the same event). Second, the MSI was created and validated at a sixth-grade reading level. Eight of our participants reported that they did not complete high school; thus, it is possible that those 8 did not complete sixth grade either and the reading level might have been too difficult for them to interpret the test questions adequately. Third, the type of insulin regimen our Center prescribes, using multiple daily injections of insulin from diagnosis, has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721711436133">25</xref></sup> as more difficult compared to other insulin regimens. This may have contributed to lower overall mastery and/or higher levels of stress. Although our insulin regimen is complex and may have influenced mastery and/or stress, it was equal for all primary caregivers, since all patients were prescribed the same regimen. Collectively, these limitations emphasize the need for further studies designed to test our observations and conclusions more broadly and throughout the process of diabetes education, care, and adaptation to living with this chronic disease.</p>

<title>Implications and Summary</title>
<p>The results of this analysis suggest that certain subgroups of caregivers of children newly diagnosed with diabetes can be identified as living with more stress or having more difficulty adapting to the diagnosis of diabetes. Evaluation of learning, from the patient and/or primary caregiver perspective, is important to the ongoing success and management of diabetes. Diabetes educators should seek tools, such as the MSI, that can help identify those who may need additional education, increased telephone or other technological contacts, or child-life, psychology, or social services. Our study suggests those primary caregivers between 40 and 49 years of age may benefit from such interventions. Within the pediatric population, such tools could be used at additional time points such as 6 months, 1 year, or more after diagnosis. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and explore the effectiveness of interventions provided to subgroups in need of further education.</p>
