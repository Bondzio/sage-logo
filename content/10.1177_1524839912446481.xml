<abstract>
<p>Quality improvement is increasingly at the forefront of health care, creating a growing demand in clinical settings for health professionals adept at understanding and optimizing systems of health care delivery. Compared with clinicians, administrators, and health services researchers, health educators have to date played less of a role in quality improvement. However, as this article argues, the potential for health educators to contribute to such efforts is great because health education and quality improvement are more similar in their goals and approaches than is commonly recognized. Health educators bring important skills to quality improvement practice in areas such as needs assessment, participatory planning, and evaluation. To illustrate the mutual benefits that arise when these two practices intersect, the implementation of an electronic patient scheduling system led by quality improvement professionals in a large home care agency is described.</p>

<title>Background: Continuous Quality Improvement</title>
<p>Quality improvement is a growing and dynamic area of health care, drawing on the expertise and experience of frontline clinicians, compliance specialists, and administrators to identify areas where change is needed and to implement that change across an organization. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has begun to institute pay-for-performance measures across health care settings to spur hospitals, health plans, home care agencies, and others to provide higher quality care, while making the results available to an informed public. These initiatives have institutionalized the need for quality improvement efforts, to be led by a cadre of health professionals trained in continuous quality improvement (CQI) methodology who can deliver results for the benefit of organizations and the constituents they serve.</p>
<p>CQI was introduced to health care more than two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912446481">Berwick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912446481">Dieneman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912446481">Laffel &amp; Blumenthal, 1989</xref>), building on quality improvement methods that were developed in industrial settings. Using rapid cycles of planning, implementation, and evaluation, these methods support systematic improvements in work processes and create added value in the production of a product or service. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912446481">Shortell, Bennett, and Byck (1998)</xref> describe the defining characteristics of CQI in health care settings as (a) a focus on the needs of customers, (b) a holistic, nonpunitive approach to improvement that is based on identification of underlying causes of poor performance, (c) the explicit incorporation of data and scientific methodology in improvement efforts, and (d) the goal of empowering clinicians and staff so that quality improvement happens from the bottom up as well as from the top down. CQI is used to understand and improve the processes by which clinicians provide health services to patients, and these efforts are most often led by interdisciplinary teams of clinicians and administrators.</p>
<p>A key component of CQI methodology is a planning model that stresses the importance of carefully monitored cycles of small, rapid changes to reach both short- and long-term goals. Commonly referred to as PDSA cycles (Plan, Do, Study, Act), the goal of this approach is to understand what should be accomplished, how change will be measured, and what changes can be made—often over the course of many cycles—to result in improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912446481">Dienemann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912446481">Fraser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912446481">Langley, Nolan, Nolan, Norman, &amp; Provost, 2009</xref>). Short-term planning cycles provide the information and momentum needed to sustain care process redesign efforts that involve significant organizational and behavioral changes.</p>

<title>Health Education and CQI: Areas of Similarity and Mutual Benefit</title>
<p>Traditionally, CQI has been incorporated in clinical settings, and the tenets of quality improvement, with its emphasis on “customers” and “performance,” may sound corporate to the ears of health educators working in community settings. Nevertheless, a closer look at core concepts of quality improvement reveals parallels to health education practice. Similar to CQI’s focus on the customer, a principle of health education is the belief that it is essential to consider the intended beneficiary of health services when planning interventions. Both approaches take an “ecological” or “systems-level” approach to health, acknowledging the individual, organizational, and broader social determinants that influence patients’ health behaviors as well as the delivery of care by health professionals. Additionally, CQI and health education both rely on planning models, existing research, and evaluation data to direct their endeavors and measure their performance. Given these commonalities, health educators may find a more natural fit within CQI teams than they might initially expect. In doing so, they can offer a set of unique skills that complement those of clinician team members, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912446481">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Health educators possess many skills that translate well to the quality improvement setting, such as participatory planning, assessing community capacity, identifying key informants, and working with coalitions. These health promotion skills are highly applicable to health care settings where diverse groups of professionals and constituents—doctors, nurses, physical therapists, social workers, patients, and families—approach day-to-day operations from unique and sometimes competing perspectives. These groups form different communities within large health care settings, and research has shown that achieving long-term behavior change and sustaining quality outcomes are often deeply challenging, similar to achieving long-term health change in community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912446481">Boan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912446481">Fraser, 2002</xref>). Health educators also understand the importance of mapping and monitoring progress to achieve outcomes, and they bring expertise in longer term program planning and evaluation methodologies that can supplement the short-term planning cycles often employed in CQI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912446481">Trickett et al., 2011</xref>). The following case study describes a patient scheduling initiative undertaken by a large home health agency that illustrates how a health education perspective can contribute to quality improvement efforts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839912446481">
<title>Case Study: Visiting Nurse Service of New York and Patient Scheduling</title>
<p>Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY) is a large, nonprofit home health agency that provides in-home health services to patients in both acute-care and long-term programs. With a daily patient census of more than 30,000, VNSNY’s diverse clinical staff of nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and physical, occupational, and speech therapists are based in seven different offices across the New York City metropolitan area. Because of its complex structure, initiatives to substantially change behavior across the entire agency must overcome unique work cultures and variable processes that are resistant to standardization, a common occurrence in many organizations where quality improvement is still gaining ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912446481">Firbank, 2010</xref>). A successful initiative must have strong endorsement not only by executives but also by key frontline staff throughout the development, piloting, and introduction of the new process and/or system. To support such efforts, VNSNY relies on its Quality Management Services (QMS) Department which includes a staff of 12 quality improvement professionals including specialists, analysts, and health educators.</p>
<p>In 2006, VNSNY’s QMS identified the need for a challenging innovation: the creation of a patient scheduling system. Although difficult in any health care environment, patient scheduling is particularly complex for in-home care. A provider may face barriers such as the unpredictable length of patient visits, the dynamic nature of clinicians’ caseloads, and external concerns such as weather and traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912446481">Boan, 2006</xref>). Prior to this initiative, VNSNY lacked a central scheduling system, and clinicians scheduled appointments individually according to their own needs and organizational preferences.</p>
<p>Although clinicians did the best they could, regular surveys revealed persistent patient dissatisfaction with how staff communicated about planned visits as well as a perception among patients and families that there was a lack of planning about visit scheduling. In fact, an internal study revealed that more than 50% of patients’ calls to clinical operations involved questions about scheduling. Patients clearly needed more predictability in the delivery of their care, and providers clearly needed more support in meeting the considerable challenges related to scheduling. To address the problem of scheduling, VNSNY set a goal of creating a patient-scheduling system to be implemented across all programs and used by all clinicians. To accomplish this, the QMS team devised an approach grounded in CQI, while also incorporating aspects of health education.</p>
<sec id="section4-1524839912446481">
<title>Stage 1: Plan</title>
<p>Planning is critical to the success of any innovation, and it is in this stage that health educators can perhaps contribute the most to quality improvement initiatives. Attaining executive endorsement of new initiatives and directing staff to comply is traditionally how large, top-down organizations operate. However, an organization interested in quality improvement recognizes that this is just one step in the road to successful change. From both the health education and CQI perspectives, the next step is often to form a coalition, defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912446481">Butterfoss and Whitt (2003)</xref> as “an action-oriented group focus[ed] on reducing or preventing a community problem by (1) analyzing the problem, (2) identifying and implementing solutions, and (3) creating social [or, professional culture] change” (p. 328).</p>
<p>In the development of VNSNY’s scheduling system, an early planning step involved the development of a coalition-style working group consisting of members of all clinical departments and disciplines across the agency. The emphasis of health education on collaboration, participatory planning, and coalition building enhanced the efforts to work on targeted goals and helped bridge some of the barriers hindering progress. For example, the work group was charged with the task of identifying frontline staff opinion leaders or key informants, who would provide their expertise to design, test, and evaluate the scheduling system. Early discussions with key informants revealed that desired features of a successful system would give clerical staff a tool to respond to patient inquiries, eliminate the need to transfer non-care-related calls to nurses, and result in fewer interruptions for those in the field. Furthermore, the system should also enable clinical managers to make better decisions about clinical caseload capacity per clinician, offer a more efficient method to assign newly admitted patients, and provide the ability to reassign caseloads during unplanned absences. In this way, careful consultation with and consideration of different stakeholders’ perspectives helped inform the project’s initial goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912446481">
<title>Stage 2: Do</title>
<p>Next, the work group carefully identified 6 clinical teams out of more than 90 in the organization to pilot the scheduling system. The work group purposefully selected those teams most interested in a patient-scheduling system, as well as those that were most tech-savvy, communicative, and process oriented. Team managers were selected who welcomed the opportunity to use a new tool, rather than viewing it as a disruptive or disconcerting change in practice. This assets-based approach will be familiar to health educators who often seek to build on communities’ strengths rather than focusing solely on perceived shortcomings. From a health education perspective, it was key that partners were chosen who had the capacity to meet the goals of the test of change.</p>
<p>After six teams were identified, the quality improvement team developed and piloted a proto-scheduling system based in Excel and Outlook over several PDSA cycles. These cycles provided preliminary information about staff adoption of electronic scheduling and best practices and informed the development of policies and procedures. One cycle involved three teams adopting the scheduling prototype for a 6-week period, discovering its potential and limitations through a process of trial and error. During this time, the project’s quality improvement team, including a health educator, trained frontline staff on the new technology, offered support to address problems as they arose, and solicited feedback to inform the final design of the scheduling system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912446481">
<title>Stage 3: Study</title>
<p>Another important step in developing the scheduling prototype involved setting and assessing evaluation objectives. The quality improvement team took care to select data collection strategies that were methodologically appropriate as well as feasible, given the limited time available to frontline staff for data collection. Practical and directly measureable outcomes were selected, such as clinician participation rates, schedule timeliness, and completeness of schedule information. Later, these were analyzed to determine what factors were fostering or hindering adoption of the scheduling prototype. In the final stage of development, the work group sought to address lessons learned from the pilot: clerical and managerial staff members were most receptive to using the schedule, wireless issues affected the ability of staff to submit their spreadsheets, and clinicians who preferred phone communication saw little benefit to using electronic scheduling. These data were very useful in determining policies and procedures to be implemented in a standardized fashion across the agency’s programs and disciplines.</p>
<p>One of the key steps before piloting the scheduling system was reinforcing to frontline staff the importance of what they had taken the time to do during the PDSA cycles and communicating results and next steps back to them in order to enhance engagement in the continued development of this major change. The insights gained were extremely helpful and contributed to the success of the pilot and subsequent rollout to the entire organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839912446481">
<title>Stage 4: Act</title>
<p>Once the new scheduling system was developed, it was piloted with the initial six teams and soon disseminated across the agency. During this time, weekly reports on the key indicator of success, the percentage of patients with a next scheduled visit, were distributed to team managers by the quality improvement staff, indicating the adherence rate for scheduling patient visits for each of their staff clinicians. It was a strategic decision by QMS to make the health educator the point of contact for all managers and staff having difficulty with the system: understanding functionality, concern about accuracy of reports, and working with staff to increase adoption. The key metric showed steady improvement, climbing in the first months from an average of 65% during training months to a first-year performance of 88%, exceeding the agency target by 3%.</p>
<p>Finally, VNSNY included a patient-scheduling metric in the agency’s Quality Scorecard, which gave visibility to patient scheduling as an organizational priority and employs a variety of process, outcome, cost, and satisfaction measures monitored on a monthly basis, at the regional, programmatic, team, and individual clinician level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912446481">Russell, Rosenfeld, Ames, &amp; Rosati, 2010</xref>). A first year compliance of 88% was achieved, in the second year 90%, and in subsequent years the scheduled visit target was set at 95%. After three quarters the third year adherence is at 92% (Figure 2). Keeping a high target on the Quality Scorecard ensures a focus on this patient-centered priority, and results have shown that it is possible for most staff to consistently reach the target.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although historically only a small number of health educators have been part of CQI initiatives in health care settings, their focus on patient- and community-centered care as well as their training and experience make them excellent partners in quality improvement. At first glance, the creation of a patient-scheduling system might seem like a project best suited for clinicians, one with little need for the skills of health educators trained in health promotion. However, the case of VNSNY shows that the work of CQI in health care settings bears more than a passing resemblance to the work of health educators. In this project, the health education perspective enhanced the standard CQI approach by bridging the needs of different constituents, defining and communicating the data in engaging and accessible ways to the participants, and understanding the essential role key informants play in determining how change is accepted and best practices are built for system-wide adoption. Given the scale and complexity of health care systems, health educators stand to be a valuable addition to CQI teams so that the voice of the community and the importance of serving patients and families remain paramount in every phase of the quality improvement process.</p>
