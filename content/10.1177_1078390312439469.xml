<abstract>
<p>A multilayered implementation of safety measures in an inpatient psychiatric facility created a sustained change in culture related to patient and staff safety. The model was developed over a 5-year period in a freestanding 80-bed behavioral health facility that is part of a Level II trauma center in the Midwest. The model has nine components that the nursing leadership team saw as integral to maintaining a safe environment. The nine elements include trauma-informed care principles, aggression management, code event review, leadership involvement, quality feedback, recovery orientation, patient assessment, education, and collaboration. The metrics collected to determine the effectiveness of the model included patient violence events and staff injuries. This article describes the development of this model and its impact on the reduction of patient violence events and staff injuries at this facility. The recommendations include considerations for the replication of this model at other facilities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-1078390312439469">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Since 1998, when the Joint Commission issued a Sentinel Alert regarding the use of restraints in behavioral health settings, there has been a continual push by the federal government and the Joint Commission to eliminate the use of restraint and seclusion in psychiatric treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390312439469">Joint Commission, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390312439469">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2006</xref>). There is a growing body of literature that supports the multiple methods for reducing seclusion and restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390312439469">Gaskin, Elsom, &amp; Happell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390312439469">Scanlan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390312439469">Stewart, Van der Merwe, Bowers, Simpson, &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>). One of the first publications to suggest a broad approach to restraint reduction was produced in 2003 from a joint effort of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA), and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems (NAPHS), with the assistance of the American Hospital Association (AHA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390312439469">APA, APNA, &amp; NAPHS, 2003</xref>). This manual collected the “best ideas” at the time on methods to reduce violence, aggression, and coercive measures. In doing so, it also set the tone for a multimethod approach to restraint reduction, an approach formalized in the National Association of State Mental Hospital Program Directors’ (NASMHPD) six core strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390312439469">Huckshorn, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390312439469">Ogrinc et al., 2008</xref>), this article will describe a multifaceted approach, the patient-focused intervention model (PFI), for successfully eliminating the use of seclusion and restraint in behavioral health settings, highlighting leadership involvement, staff education, assessment, debriefing, and milieu management as key components to success. Clearly, the use of restraint and seclusion is strongly linked to patient aggression and violence. Therefore, the effort to change restraint and seclusion practices also focused on reducing violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312439469">Johnson, 2010</xref>). Although reduced restraint use was one of the outcome measures used to evaluate the model, the focus of the initiative was also building a culture of safety. To describe the hospital’s efforts to reach this goal, each intervention and its rationale will be explained, as well as the metrics that evaluated its effectiveness. Of particular note is how the hospital introduced the various methods, actions taken to promote adoption of the strategy and, in some instances, address staff response to the change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078390312439469">
<title>Patient-Focused Intervention Model</title>
<p>Although specific strategies for reducing aggression were examined and addressed, the model, PFI, embraced trauma-informed care as the core intervention to reducing violence on the units. There were several reasons why trauma-informed care was chosen. One, trauma-informed care is grounded in a patient-centered approach, a philosophy of care that was consistent with the care delivery model of the entire medical center. In the medical center, the patient-centered approach was organized around the Planetree Organization culture. The Planetree Organization awards special recognition to hospitals that put patients’ needs first and focus on creating a healing environment in the hospital setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390312439469">Planetree.org, 2011</xref>). This patient-centered philosophy includes the interpersonal, organizational, and environmental elements that contribute to building a culture. For example, in line with Planetree, units build environments that have a soothing palette of colors for the décor of a hospital. Innovations include animal-assisted therapy and aromatherapy, available for all patients.</p>
<p>Trauma-informed care, however, was just one component of the model. Starting at the beginning of our efforts, which focused on the reduction of staff injuries, nine key components have been identified as integral to maintaining a safe and patient-centered environment, thus providing the basis for the PFI model. Those components, which contain trauma-informed care principles, also include aggression management, code event review, leadership involvement, quality feedback, recovery orientation, patient assessment, education, and collaboration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078390312439469">Figure 1</xref>). The components are not listed in any priority but dynamically interact in a way that supports the ongoing prevention of violence.</p>

<title>Statement of the Problem</title>
<p>In 2005, the leadership team of this hospital assigned a multidisciplinary team to focus on staff injuries in the adolescent residential treatment program in a behavioral health facility at a Regional Level II Trauma Center in a small Midwestern town. The violence prevention model, PFI, described in this article grew out of a performance improvement project aimed at the reduction of staff injuries, which had reached an unacceptable level for the hospital (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078390312439469">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078390312439469">
<title>Intended Improvement</title>
<p>The goal of this first project team was to reduce staff injuries by 20% by June 2006, the end of the fiscal year. A second goal was to demonstrate a decrease in worker compensation costs for the behavioral health facility.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1078390312439469">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>The project was reviewed by the institutional review board (IRB) process and was deemed exempt from formal review by the coordinator of the IRB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078390312439469">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The behavioral health services hospital is an 80-bed facility that is part of the Regional Level II Trauma Center. The culture change efforts involved several of the inpatient units. The residential treatment program is a 19-bed treatment program for adolescent females aged 12 to 18 years. As the project expanded, two additional sites were added: the adult unit, a 14-bed acute inpatient unit for individuals aged 19 years and older and a subacute unit for adults requiring longer lengths of stay. The patients in the subacute unit were primarily individuals with co-occurring substance abuse disorders and mental illness. In addition, a 15-bed unit was added that provides services to adolescents (ages 12-18 years) requiring acute inpatient care. Thus, as the project reached full implementation, four units were involved in the culture change: two adult units, a residential treatment program for adolescents, and a unit providing acute psychiatric care to teens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1078390312439469">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>The following metrics were used to evaluate the success of this multifaceted program: number of hours of seclusion and restraint, number of Code Gray episodes, number of staff injuries, and results of the staff safety survey. The data were also used for continual involvement of staff in the quality projects and in implementation of the model. Rates of seclusion and restraint and number of Code Gray episodes were shared with staff on a monthly basis. Number of staff injuries and results of the staff safety survey were shared annually with staff. Traveling storyboards with data and patient comments were used as an additional communication tool with the staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1078390312439469">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The data on seclusion and restraint, Code Gray episode, and staff injuries are collected by the hospital as part of their routine monitoring of these indicators. The staff safety survey was developed by the hospital leadership. It is a biannual survey with 10 Likert-style questions focusing on staff’s perceptions of the environment, their training, and patient aggression management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078390312439469">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were performed on the raw data for each indicator. Graphs were produced to display the data. These graphs were used to both inform the leadership team and raise awareness of the outcomes of the project for the entire staff. The staff survey is scored by averaging staff scores for each question, and then aggregate scores on each question are compared across previous years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078390312439469">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The multidisciplinary team that planned and implemented the culture change model consisted of the director of clinical services, the director of risk management, the employee health nurse, and the clinical program manager for the residential treatment program. To achieve restraint reduction, administrative involvement is critical at every phase in the process of change, particularly change in the culture of clinical units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390312439469">LeBel, Huckshorn, &amp; Caldwell, 2010</xref>). The executive leadership team fully supported this project and continues to support the ongoing changes still being implemented to improve and refine the model.</p>
<p>The project team identified several decision points that were critical to attaining the goals set forth by the hospital leadership. One of the first decisions was to hire a director of clinical services with a master’s degree (MSN) in psychiatric nursing and extensive administrative and clinical experience in inpatient psychiatric settings. Another decision was to embrace a consistent model of patient care and aggression intervention that decreased the trauma of the inpatient experience. The state of Nebraska’s Behavioral Health Division created an organization called Coercion Free Nebraska, which was committed to helping behavioral health providers who helped children move toward trauma-free care environments. As part of this initiative, national experts were brought into the state to introduce trauma-free concepts, and one of those experts conducted a workshop on trauma-informed care to introduce the local staff and community providers to these principles. The planning team used these concepts in mapping out the model for violence prevention.</p>
<p>The development of the PFI model was a dynamic process that constantly evolved as new approaches were tried, evaluated, readjusted, and adopted. The theory used to manage the change was based on the continuous quality improvement cycle of Plan, Do, Check, and Act (PDCA), also known as a Shewhart cycle or Deming circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390312439469">American Society for Quality, n.d.</xref>). The ongoing evaluation of the emerging violence prevention interventions, through the continuous quality improvement cycle, contributed to the success of the interventions. For example, a review of all violent patient events was conducted (Plan). During the review of the patient events, the evaluator identified a trend toward an increase of violent patient events during shift changes, so the patient schedule was adjusted and staff members were educated about this trend (Do). The review of all violent patient events continued, and the team noted that the trend toward violent patient events decreased during shift changes (Check). The review of all violent patient events continues today, and the cycle begins if a similar or different trend is noticed (Act; Tague, 2004, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390312439469">American Society for Quality, n.d.</xref>). Using the PDCA cycle in this manner focused the team’s attention on the need to change patient schedules since external events (shift change) seemed related to the occurrence of aggression. This was an effective method for addressing the issue.</p>
<p>As planning for the model evolved, a second team of committed individuals was developed that included the director of clinical services, three program managers, the clinical educators, the director of risk management, and the quality nurse specialist. Outside consultants were ad hoc members who periodically met with the patients, staff, and experts in the field in an effort to improve the ongoing processes at the hospital. Focus groups that included consumer and frontline staff were critical throughout to identify improvements needed in the psychiatric inpatient programming.</p>

<title>Intervention: Adolescent Unit</title>
<sec id="section14-1078390312439469">
<title>Trauma-informed care</title>
<p>As described, the core of the violence prevention model was trauma-informed care, which is a model of service delivery that recognizes the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional treatment programs may exacerbate. Trauma-specific interventions are designed to address the consequences of trauma and thus facilitate healing. These interventions include a strengths-based approach for evaluating and individualizing patient care needs while recognizing the psychological and physiological effects of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390312439469">Caldwell, 2006</xref>). In a model closely related to trauma-informed care, the Sanctuary Model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390312439469">Sandra Bloom (2006)</xref> described a sensitive system’s care focused on avoiding revictimization or recurrent traumatization. Here, the emphasis is on both the identification of patients’ strengths (so that violent or aggressive behavior can be avoided) and the customization of the patient’s current coping skills and self-management. Strength-based models have empirical support; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390312439469">LeBel and colleagues (2004)</xref> demonstrated that a systems approach could reduce the use of restraint and seclusion by promoting preventative, strength-based care.</p>
<p>To facilitate the implementation of trauma-informed care, in 2005, the hospital sponsored a workshop with Beth Caldwell, Director of SAMHSA/Center for Mental Health Services/Child and Family Branch’s National Building Bridges Initiative, on trauma-informed care. Key personnel from the hospital attended the 2-day workshop, which set the stage for the next 5 years and infused trauma-informed care principles into the treatment programs at the hospital. These components were incorporated into the initial psychosocial assessment through questions about past trauma; triggers that evoke anxiety, fear, and anger; and queries about which coping skills have been successful in the past. From this psychological assessment, for each patient, a safety plan that identified triggers and coping skills was collaboratively developed. Clear expectations for patient behaviors and involvement in daily activities were incorporated. An emphasis on patient responsibility was integrated into the staff’s approach to patients in the milieu. Power struggles were reduced as the staff focused on providing a healing environment. All these efforts were seen to help reduce the violence potential of the patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1078390312439469">
<title>Aggression management</title>
<p>A new approach to aggression management was chosen based on an evaluation of the currently available commercial models. The Sorensen and Wilder Associates (SWA) aggression management program was selected as the one best fitting the organization’s current needs. In this model, using the steps of a ladder as an analogy, the stages of aggression were conceptualized as ranging from 1 to 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078390312439469">Wilder &amp; Sorensen, 2000</xref>). De-escalation techniques and hands-on skills were taught to every staff member. To assist with the adoption of the SWA process, 14 clinical staff were educated as trainers. The goal was that these trainers would increase trust in the SWA process and act as role models for other staff. Since instituting the program, staff has been recertified yearly in SWA techniques. Every 3 years, all direct-care staff complete a full certification. During their orientation phase, all new staff coming into the facility became certified prior to becoming involved in managing a violent patient event.</p>
<p>The culture of the units moved from one of quickly subduing a patient who is aggressive to allowing whatever time was necessary to work with a patient to reduce his or her anxiety and fear, or anger. The staff members were taught to use a “show of support” instead of a “show of force” with patients. This terminology was incorporated into the verbal interaction with the patient to reframe the situation into a less confrontational episode. All staff at this facility now consider touching or going “hands-on” as a failure in the de-escalation process. Of course, this approach to de-escalation is consistent with regulatory mandates for psychiatric and mental health staff to employ the least restrictive interventions prior to the use of the most restrictive interventions, restraint, and seclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390312439469">Paterson, 2006</xref>). It is also consistent with the literature that documents that the use of restraint and seclusion with patients in inpatient psychiatric units can be detrimental both physically and emotionally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312439469">McCue, Urcuyo, Lilu, Tobias, &amp; Chambers, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1078390312439469">
<title>Code event review</title>
<p>As the trauma-informed care and SWA techniques for managing aggressive patients were implemented, each of the aggressive patient events, known as a Code Gray, were subjected to a very specific review. Every incident was reviewed during a brief staff huddle (called a debriefing) immediately following an incident. In these reviews, the staff involved discussed not only the specifics of the event but also the techniques used or not used and the success of those used. To assist the staff in debriefing the event, an assigned scribe completed the “review of event” form during the discussion. This form collected data such as the patient’s aggression level, effectiveness of the response, safety concerns, and future recommendations.</p>
<p>The debriefings during the initial six months included the clinical manager, the director of clinical services, and/or a clinical educator, as well as unit staff. After the initial 6 months, the clinical program manager, the director of clinical services, or the clinical educator periodically attended an event debriefing to monitor the process and offer support to the staff. The main purpose of their participation in the debriefing was to reinforce education of the model and identify areas for improvement. Over the years, information gleaned from this process has resulted in environmental, policy, program, and physician practice changes that have also contributed to the continuous improvement process and the building of a safe environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1078390312439469">
<title>Leadership involvement</title>
<p>As part of the leadership review, the nursing management, the nurse quality specialist, and the safety committee analyzed monthly data on restraint and injury for trends such as time of day or unit where events were occurring. The team also conducted monthly in-depth reviews of the information on the “review of event” forms to determine areas of success and opportunities for improvement in the staff interventions being implemented. In 2009, daily leadership reviews of episodes of seclusion and restraint were initiated to increase the involvement of the medical staff and administration in the process. During the weekdays, there was a review of any patient aggression events with the leadership team of the behavioral health division. This review included the medical director, the director of behavioral health services, the nursing services manager, and the manager of clinical programs. A hand-off communication given by the house supervisors from the previous evening and night shifts was discussed with the oncoming nursing management staff. This frequent review by the leadership team allowed for discussion of difficult cases and formulation of recommendations for alterations in treatment plans for particular patients. It also promoted observation of trends in interventions with patients particularly the use of physical restraint and seclusion.</p>

<sec id="section18-1078390312439469">
<title>Intervention: Adult Units</title>
<sec id="section19-1078390312439469">
<title>Recovery orientation</title>
<p>The recovery model was incorporated into the adult and adult subacute programs in 2006. As an initial step, staff members were individually certified in the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) approach. WRAP is “a self-designed plan for staying well” that helps patients feel better while increasing their personal responsibility and improving their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312439469">Copeland, 2005</xref>, p. 1). The WRAP approach is evidence based, with studies showing significant increases in consumer reporting of early warning signs, identification and tools for coping, their preference for using personal supports, the use of wellness in their daily self-care, and hope of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312439469">Cook, 2005</xref>). The WRAP approach model fit well with trauma-informed care principles and provided a more specific focus on assisting patients to develop their own notebook of recovery. The unit staff assisted patients in developing daily maintenance plans, identifying triggers and early warning signs of aggression, and developing a crisis plan, advanced directives, and a postcrisis plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312439469">Copeland, 2005</xref>). WRAP groups were implemented on the adult unit and became part of the daily language used on the unit and within the broader violence prevention model. The individual patient’s recovery plan is not only a part of his or her inpatient stay but also an integral part of the patient’s discharge plan. Patients often bring their WRAP notebooks back with them if they return for an inpatient stay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1078390312439469">
<title>Collaboration</title>
<p>Also of note was the synergy of the WRAP approach and a peer support program initiated in 2007. As part of this program, a peer specialist is employed as part of the adult unit staff and functions as a patient advocate and liaison to the treatment team and administration. One of the activities of the peer specialist is conducting WRAP groups. Part of the identification of the WRAP is safety. Thus, the peer specialist also assists patients in the identification of triggers so that self-directed or other violence can be identified early and promotes more effective staff intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1078390312439469">
<title>Patient assessment</title>
<p>A recent initiative that became part of our PFI model is Caring Rounds, a process based on Quint Studer’s Hourly Rounding approach. The Caring Rounds are independent of routine 15-minute safety checks. Caring Rounds is a multidisciplinary set of rounds with the specific intent of assessing each patient’s feeling of safety, pain control, and medication response. At this time, patients can also raise questions regarding their treatment plan. The rounds, conducted by nurses and therapists, occurred at least three times per day to give each patient the opportunity to voice concerns and ask specific questions about his or her care. The focus of the Caring Rounds is the patient, but the questions for the patient can depend on the discipline of the person providing the Caring Round. For example, nurses focus on assessing suicidality and safety concerns, physical issues, medications, and the patient’s knowledge of his or her treatment plan. By setting aside a specific time for this type of rounding on patients, the time with the patient is more focused and relaxed than with the routine safety rounds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1078390312439469">
<title>Staff education</title>
<p>Education for all clinical staff included annual SWA certification, restraint and seclusion techniques, policies, and competencies, as well as many other formal, hospital-wide education topics. The main focus for education related to SWA and restraint/seclusion topics was de-escalation techniques, which contributed significantly to the increase of patient and staff safety. In addition, all new employees were oriented to the principles of trauma-informed care, safe boundaries, and patient-centered care interventions. All nurses were expected to complete a series of four modules related to the role of the psychiatric nurse, basic psychiatric diagnoses and nursing interventions, and fundamental psychopharmacology. These modules were created because many of the nurses who were hired on the behavioral health units came from medical surgical practice areas and lacked competency in mental health nursing. The team believed that improving the nurses’ competency in the area of psychiatry enhanced their ability to intervene more effectively with patients.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The following metrics were used to evaluate the success of this multifaceted program: staff injuries, restraint and seclusion rates, number of Code Gray episodes, and results of the staff safety survey.</p>
<p>Prior to implementation of the program, the number of staff injuries during fiscal year 2006 increased to 103, doubling the previous year’s number of injuries. During this fiscal year, the hospital census increased dramatically, and there were a large number of new employees in the organization with minimal behavioral health experience; both factors were seen to contribute to the increase in injuries. Also, the PFI model was in the early stages of implementation, so the staff was adjusting to the new patient aggression management system. During the first year of implementation of the PFI model, injuries were reduced by 48%, which greatly surpassed the target (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078390312439469">Figure 2</xref>). Several other metrics were reduced by significant percentages: Seclusion and restraint rates were reduced by at least 50%, along with the number of aggressive-patient incidents. In addition to the metrics improving, a change in the culture and treatment of patients occurred in all areas of the facility, as evidenced by improved patient satisfaction scores and staff safety survey data. In 2008, one year after full implementation of the PFI model, the staff safety survey data improved in 5 out of 10 areas, including the staff’s perceptions of the effectiveness of the patient aggression management program.</p>
<p>There was a marked decrease in the gross number of patient events (Code Gray events), as evidenced by reduction in the “review of event” forms produced and in the number of mechanical restraint episodes since the beginning of the culture change in 2005 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1078390312439469">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, the number of seclusion and restraint hours decreased by 75% in the first 2 years of the implementation of the SWA program and trauma-informed care principles.</p>

</fig>
<p>Thus, the PFI model successfully reduced the use of restraints, the number of patient-aggressive incidents, and staff injuries and brought about a change in culture, as evidenced by improved patient satisfaction scores and staff safety survey data.</p>
<p>Collaboration was a key component in the success of the PFI model. Collaboration with patients, staff, administrators, and external experts contributed to the process of developing this model. Feedback from these stakeholders allowed the continuous quality improvement cycle to evolve to excellence. Focus groups and surveys, as well as ongoing interaction with the security department and other ancillary departments, such as housekeeping and nutrition services, provided additional venues for feedback on the model. Collaboration is vital in providing individualized care, which in turn is critical to reducing coercive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390312439469">Mohr &amp; Pumariega, 2004</xref>). As communication flowed among all key stakeholders (patients, staff, and leadership), processes were changed and problems were identified. This practice invited the discovery and development of new interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312439469">Ashcraft, Anthony, &amp; Jaccard, 2008</xref>). We continue to collaborate with patients by conducting management rounds weekly to assess the impact of Caring Rounds and trauma-informed care. The management team takes turns rounding weekly to meet with at least 10% of the patients to assess how well the staff is implementing the Caring Rounds and to ask patients what they like about the care they are receiving and any suggestions they might have for improving it.</p>
<p>The clinical staff is a critical component in improving the quality of care and safety in the psychiatric units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390312439469">Caramanica, Cousino, &amp; Petersen, 2003</xref>). Collaboration with all levels of staff in the facility is promoted through a shared governance model where representatives from all disciplines and shifts meet on a monthly basis with a member of the management to make recommendations for changes in current practices, policies, and procedures and the current model of care. The discussion is often lively and informative at these council meetings. During monthly meetings with nursing and ancillary support staff, staff involvement continues to be reinforced, particularly through open discussion on issues related to safety and the quality improvement data.</p>
<sec id="section24-1078390312439469">
<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>This model was initiated in 2005 and continues to evolve. Retrospectively, changing and solidifying a new culture can be challenging. During the changes, the staff often reverted to previous and familiar interventions. We learned that consistency, reinforcement, and support for the new interventions were a continuous process. An example of the need to address staff concerns occurred when the SWA program was being implemented and a previous transport tool called “the boat” (a plastic search-and-rescue sled) was eliminated to reduce staff and patient injuries. The staff members were angry and fearful that they would be injured more without this device and were quite resistant to the new approach. Many meetings occurred and several interventions with patients had to happen before the staff embraced the SWA program.</p>
<p>During the second year of implementation, there was an actual increase in seclusion and restraint while transitioning to this new model of managing aggressive patients. It seemed that the new culture had not yet become fully ingrained and the old culture was still present with certain staff. The key to dealing with resistance was identifying barriers while continuing to implement interventions aimed at restraint reduction and improving patient safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390312439469">Curran, 2007</xref>). To address the resistance from staff, the management had to regroup and hold a series of staff focus groups on the changes being implemented. For example, an issue arose about the amount of staff attention required to implement aspects of the PFI model. Taking time to sit with a patient whose behavior was escalating, rather than physically intervening with him or her, often took enormous amounts of staff time. As a result, other patients expressed feelings of being neglected. To ensure that other patients’ needs would continue to be addressed while the code response team was spending time with the escalating patients, staffing patterns were altered to improve coverage at times of the day when the codes most often occurred. This approach improved patient and staff satisfaction. In addition to managing any setbacks, celebrations occurred throughout the year to accentuate the demonstrated successes. A recent example was an ice cream social in the summers of 2010 and 2011 for all staff, celebrating their success in creating a safe and patient-centered environment.</p>
<p>The core elements of trauma-informed care, aggression management, leadership, involvement, quality feedback, recovery orientation, patient assessment, education, and collaboration were essential to the success of the PFI project. As documented in the literature, a multimethod plan for restraint reduction is a common approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390312439469">Gaskin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390312439469">Scanlan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390312439469">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>). Elements of this multimethod approach are often reported, but the clinicians fail to provide details about the implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390312439469">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>). In this article, we describe components of the PFI model that had the greatest impact and the mutual influence of various inputs. Leadership was the key to success of the culture change that reduced violence and staff injuries over time, a principle confirmed in a recent examination of leadership, management, and staff factors in the change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390312439469">Bowers, Nijman, Simpson, &amp; Jones, 2011</xref>). Clearly, as any organization embarks on a total culture change, it is vital that the change be understood and embraced by the leadership of the organization, which in turn filters to unit-level management and affects the teamwork necessary to implement and sustain change.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that moving to a violence-free environment requires a multifaceted approach. Staff involvement and understanding were also crucial in the success of this program. As reflected in the literature, the nursing preference is to avoid the use of restraints and seclusion, while maintaining patient safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312439469">Janelli, Stamps, &amp; Delles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390312439469">Gelkopf, Roffe, Werbloff, &amp; Bleich, 2009</xref>). However, recognition of the change process and resistance of staff to change can become an important variable in a treatment program redesign. As noted, staff resistance and fear of change proved to be a considerable challenge in the implementation of the PFI model. We learned that staff must be given alternatives to replace the current interventions they have come to rely on, or they will continue to revert to what they know.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The model continues to evolve at our hospital. Although the goal of the organization is to get to a point of no restraint or seclusion, we recognize that at times restraint or seclusion may be necessary. To support the PFI model, ongoing nursing education regarding concepts related to restraint and seclusion is necessary. Annual staff education continues to include a thorough review of the standards for seclusion and restraint, as well as reinforcement of the PFI model, and approaching a patient by using trauma-specific interventions. Organizations must be open to continual reevaluation and revision of any changes implemented as inpatient environments change as additional evidence-based practices are published. The elements of the violence prevention model presented here will enhance this evolving evidence base and, if replicated, should help other facilities reduce patient violence and staff injuries.</p>
