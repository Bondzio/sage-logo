<p><italic>Betacoronavirus 1</italic> (BCoV-1) is an important pathogen causing diarrhea in calves. In the current study, a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for rapid detection of BCoV-1 was successfully developed. The primers were designed to target the highly conserved fragment of BCoV-1 nucleocapsid gene. The assay displayed high specificity detecting only BCoV-1 with no cross reaction with other viruses. When 418 clinical samples from 6 different geographical areas of Xinjiang province were tested by the RT-LAMP method, the results indicated that this test is a simple, rapid, accurate, and sensitive method for the detection of BCoV-1.</p>

<p>Various molecular detection methods, such as semi-nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638711425937">15</xref></sup> real-time RT-PCR,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638711425937">5</xref></sup> and multiplex RT-PCR,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638711425937">4</xref></sup> have been developed to detect the BCoV-1 infection. However, most of these assays require expensive and special instruments, and therefore may not be readily applicable, particularly in diagnostic laboratories in underdeveloped or developing countries or regions. Thus, it is necessary to develop new assays for the detection of BCoV-1 in clinical practice. In 2000, details of a novel nucleic acid amplification method, namely, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique, were published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711425937">11</xref></sup> Compared to other molecular detection assays (single RT-PCR or nucleic acid hybridization), the LAMP technique involves reagents that react under isothermal conditions with high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711425937">11</xref></sup> and has been used for the detection of different pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638711425937">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638711425937">13</xref></sup> In the current study, a novel and rapid reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay was developed to detect BCoV-1 from clinical samples.</p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted from BCoV-1–infected human rectal tumor (HRT-18G) cells with a commercial RNA kit,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1040638711425937">d</xref></sup> according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was eluted in 20 μl of RNase-free water containing 0.04% sodium azide and was stored at −80°C until use.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 63°C for 60 min in a heating block, followed by heating at 80°C for 2 min to terminate the reaction. After the reaction, a 10-μl aliquot of the RT-LAMP product was subjected to electrophoresis in 2.0% agarose gel and visualized by staining with 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide under ultraviolet light.

<p>To mimic the real scenario for BCoV-1 testing from fecal samples, different copies (10<sup>8</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, down to 10<sup>1</sup>) of plasmid pTN were mixed with feces, and the RNA was re-extracted and detected by LAMP assay.

<p>The semi-nested RT-PCR was carried out with the specific primers N1 (outer sense primer), N2 (antisense primer), and N3 (inner sense primer; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638711425937">Table 1</xref>). The N1 and N2 primers were used for the first amplification after reverse transcription reaction, while N3 and N2 were used for the second round of amplification (semi-nested). The reactions were performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638711425937">15</xref></sup> Positive amplification was determined by the presence of a 201-bp band and confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>To assess the LAMP assay, 12 BCoV-1–positive fecal specimens and 9 negative fecal specimens previously confirmed by semi-nested RT-PCR were examined. The results showed that 12 out of 12 were positive and 9 out of 9 were negative, indicating 100% agreement with the semi-nested RT-PCR.</p>
<p>A total of 418 fecal samples from diarrheic calves were collected from cattle farms located in 6 geographical areas (Urumqi, Shihezi, Altay, Qoqek, Ili, and Korla) of Xinjiang province, China during October 2009 through February 2011. Fecal samples were collected from the rectum directly into sterile bottles and kept cold while in transit. Within 24 hr, all fecal samples were re-suspended in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) at 10–20% (w/v), and then centrifuged at 5,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and subjected to total RNA extraction. The RT-LAMP assay was used to detect the presence of BCoV-1. In addition, semi-nested RT-PCR was employed to examine the presence of BCoV-1 and for testing the agreement between the 2 assays (RT-LAMP and semi-nested RT-PCR). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638711425937">Table 2</xref>, RT-LAMP exhibited high concordance with the semi-nested RT-PCR for BCoV-1 detection from fecal specimens. Sixty-two out of the 418 samples showed BCoV-1 N gene positive from both RT-LAMP and semi-nested RT-PCR assays, while 5 negative samples from semi-nested RT-PCR were BCoV-1 N gene positive by RT-LAMP assay, and 3 negative samples from RT-LAMP assay showed BCoV-1 N gene positive by semi-nested RT-PCR. Three hundred forty-eight samples were proved to be BCoV-1 N gene negative from both assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638711425937">Table 2</xref>). Accordingly, the percentage of agreement for these 2 assays was 98.2 %.</p>

<p>The current study reports the development of a novel detection method for the rapid detection of BCoV-1. The RT-LAMP assay allows the user to perform specific and sensitive RNA amplification using simple instruments such as a water bath or a heating block. After specific amplification, the operator can easily visualize the amplification results by adding SYBR Green I into the reaction tube. From the color change of reaction mixtures, the positive results were easily determined by the naked eye. Therefore, this assay is suitable for the diagnosis of BCoV-1 infection in clinical practice, especially in developing countries or regions.</p>
<p>Due to the high efficiency of the LAMP assay, which is higher than conventional PCR, cross-contamination would be a potential issue when using this assay. From the authors’ experiences, the key points to avoid cross contamination are as follows: 1) sterilization of all work areas and laboratory consumables before and after performing the assay (e.g., ultraviolet illumination for at least 30 min); 2) physical separation of the key steps and use of different staff (if possible) to perform those steps; 3) ensuring that the cap of the tubes is tightly closed during RT-LAMP reaction; 4) use of filter tips on pipettes; and 5) change of personal protective equipment (laboratory coat, mask, and gloves) when handling different samples.</p>
<p>It is very important to select a conserved fragment for the design of specific RT-LAMP primers because BCoV-1 strains/isolates exhibit heterogeneity, to a certain extent, at the nucleotide level. Recent studies showed genetic differences between enteric and respiratory BCoV-1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638711425937">12</xref></sup> and among isolates from different geographical areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638711425937">9</xref></sup> In the present study, 2 pairs of primers for RT-LAMP were designed based on the highly conserved fragment of N genes derived from both enteric and respiratory BCoV-1 strains and analyzed by BLASTn<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638711425937">c</xref></sup> for specificity.</p>
<p>The results from 418 clinical samples illustrated that the RT-LAMP assay had a high sensitivity and accuracy, a level that was the same as the semi-nested RT-PCR assay. The results also demonstrated that BCoV-1 was prevalent in calves for various geographical areas of Xinjiang province. In conclusion, a RT-LAMP assay was successfully developed for the detection of BCoV-1 genomic RNA in fecal specimens with the assay showing a high sensitivity and specificity. This rapid, easy-to-operate, and sensitive assay can be used for epidemiological surveillance of BCoV-1 and also for the diagnosis of BCoV-1 infection.</p>
