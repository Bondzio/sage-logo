<sec id="sec01-0961203312468624"><title>Background</title>
<p>While cyclophosphamide (CYC) can save the life of a young woman with severe rheumatologic disease, it may lead to the long-term side-effects of infertility and premature menopause. We compared the reproductive health histories of young women with rheumatologic disease with and without prior CYC exposure to identify the impact of this medication on this important component of health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec02-0961203312468624" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This research includes a case-series study of women diagnosed with SLE, vasculitis, and scleroderma prior to age 35. Each patient completed a questionnaire about desired childbearing, menstrual regularity, infertility, and pregnancy history. Women with prior CYC therapy were queried about the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) for fertility preservation. The responses to this questionnaire were compared for women with and without CYC exposure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec03-0961203312468624" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 43 participants, 23 had prior CYC exposure and 20 were CYC naïve. The current age of these groups was similar (average age 32), but women with prior CYC were four years younger at diagnosis than women without CYC. More women with prior CYC had cessation of menses in the year prior to the study (30.4% vs 0%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Of the women with prior CYC exposure, those with loss of menses were older at study enrollment, older at CYC treatment, and had a higher cumulative CYC dose than those with preserved menstruation. While more women with GnRH-a co-therapy during CYC had maintained menses, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Women with prior CYC without GnRH-a co-therapy had a higher frequency of nulliparity and had greater trouble conceiving than women with GnRH-a co-therapy. Few pregnancies were conceived following CYC exposure and all resulted in elective termination, miscarriage, or preterm birth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec04-0961203312468624" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this cohort of young women with rheumatologic disease, more women with prior CYC than without had amenorrhea, nulliparity, and infertility. GnRH-a co-therapy may prevent these adverse effects of CYC.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312468624" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The onset of many systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs during peak childbearing years. Though women diagnosed with SLE are thought to have equal fertility to the general population, cyclophosphamide (CYC) may increase the risk for infertility in this population. While CYC treats severely active autoimmune disease, it has significant gonadotoxic effects, decreasing the function of granulosa cells and impacting fertility. Previous studies demonstrated that the cumulative dose and patient age at initiation of CYC are the most important predictors of ovarian failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312468624">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312468624">5</xref></sup> Chemotherapy given before a girl undergoes puberty has little effect on menstrual patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312468624">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hormonal methods may be prescribed during CYC therapy in an attempt to preserve ovarian function. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) may simulate a pre-pubertal state during chemotherapy, thus preventing damage to maturing follicles. GnRH-a are protective against ovarian failure after CYC, decreasing but not completely eliminating ovarian damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312468624">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312468624">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objectives of this study were (1) to retrospectively measure the frequency of use of ovarian protection by women who underwent CYC therapy, (2) to measure the frequency of ovarian failure in these women, (3) to measure how often women with CYC were able to complete their families, and (4) to compare pregnancy outcomes before and after CYC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312468624" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312468624"><title>Participant selection</title>
<p>We enrolled women in this case series with and without CYC exposure who were diagnosed with a rheumatologic disease at younger than age 35 in this questionnaire-based study who were seen in the Duke University rheumatology clinic between September 2010 and July 2011. Enrollment was not consecutive; the CYC-exposed cohort was collected first, followed by the non-CYC exposed cohort. Women diagnosed within two years of the study were excluded. As approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board, eligible participants were recruited during their routine appointment in the Duke University rheumatology clinic, at which time informed consent was obtained.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312468624"><title>Fertility questionnaire</title>
<p>Questions included whether the woman desired future childbearing at the time of her rheumatologic diagnosis, current menstrual patterns, infertility, and information about pregnancy outcomes before and after diagnosis. Information about prior CYC treatment and use of ovarian protection methods (GnRH-a or oral contraceptives (OCPs)) during cyclophosphamide therapy was collected through the questionnaire and confirmed through chart review.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint was premature cessation of menstruation, defined as at least 12 months without menstruation at the time of study entry in women under 50 years of age without external causes, such as contraception or hysterectomy. Secondary endpoints included menstrual irregularity (defined as having a menstrual cycle within the past 12 months, but not having a menses every month), which could signify ovarian dysfunction, and nulliparity. Pregnancies were recorded as live birth, miscarriage, or termination; preterm birth was delivery more than three weeks prior to the due date; preeclampsia was determined by the treating obstetrician; babies with a birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age were designated small for gestational age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312468624"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Women with and without prior CYC were compared for demographic similarity, menstruation cessation, and pregnancy number and outcome. We then compared menstruation cessation and pregnancy number, timing, and outcomes between women who did and did not use a GnRH-a for ovarian protection during CYC therapy. Logistic regression of using the variables of current age, the age at CYC initiation, GnRH-a use, and the cumulative dose of CYC was used to determine the role these factors played in menstruation cessation. Non-parametric testing was used to analyze this small cohort. Fisher’s exact test was used for dichotomous variables and Wilcoxon testing for continuous variables. A two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05 defined statistical significance.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0961203312468624"><title>Study cohort</title>
<p>We enrolled 43 women who had been diagnosed with rheumatologic disease before age 35. Twenty-three women had received CYC therapy; the remaining 20 women who received no CYC served as controls. Women with CYC exposure were, on average, four years younger at diagnosis than women without CYC exposure. The current age of the two groups was comparable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312468624">Table 1</xref>). Among women with prior CYC exposure, the average age at initiation of therapy was 25 years and the mean cumulative dose was 21,000 mg (range 500–87,750 mg). CYC was given orally to three women, intravenously to 16, and by both routes to four. CYC treatment lasted less than six months in five subjects (21.7%), six to 12 months in seven (30.4%), and more than 12 months in 11 (47.8%).

<p>Reporting the natural absence of menses for at least 12 months prior to completion of the questionnaire were 30.4% of women who received prior CYC therapy and 0% who had not (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Three women were excluded from analysis because menstruation cessation was from contraceptive use (two) or hysterectomy (one). The mean age of menstruation cessation was 32.9 years (<italic>n</italic> = 7), ranging from four years before to 12 years after CYC treatment.</p>
<p>In this cohort, the patients’ current age, the age at CYC initiation, and the cumulative dose of CYC were three important contributing factors to natural cessation of menstruation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312468624">Table 2</xref>). Women whose menses had ceased were, on average, six years older at the time of CYC initiation, 10 years older at the time of study entry, and had a cumulative dose of CYC more than two-fold higher than those women with continuing menstruation. It did not reach statistical significance, but GnRH-a use was more common among women with continuation of menstruation. In a logistic regression model to determine the independence of these four factors with menopause, none reached statistical significance.
<table-wrap id="table2-0961203312468624" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Possible factors associated with natural cessation of menstruation include current age, age at cyclophosphamide (CYC) initiation, cumulative CYC dose, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) co-therapy.

<p>Seven women received GnRH-a co-therapy and three used hormonal contraception as means of ovarian protection. Of the remaining 13 women, six did and seven did not recall a discussion with their physician regarding ovarian protection during treatment. Women who were treated with GnRH-a were statistically significantly younger than woman who were not at CYC initiation (19.4 (4.3) and 27.6 (6.8), respectively; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008).</p>
<p>Women who received GnRH-a in combination with CYC were more likely to continue regular menstrual patterns. While not statistically significant, only one (14%) woman who received GnRH-a experienced cessation of menses compared to six (46%) women who received CYC alone (<italic>p</italic> = 0.15). Irregular menses, possibly signifying ovarian dysfunction, occurred in only one (17%) woman who received GnRH-a co-therapy compared to four (57%) who did not (<italic>p</italic> = 0.2). Of those who had used GnRH-a, two women reported they had conceived without difficulty. Of those who did not use GnRH-a co-therapy, 13 women tried to get pregnant, five (38%) reported difficulty, of whom three were never able to conceive.</p>
<p>Regardless of CYC exposure, in this cohort being diagnosed with rheumatologic disease prior to completion of childbearing prevented 70% of women from having all the children they had hoped for. More women over the age of 30 with an interest in childbearing remained nulliparous after CYC exposure (36.4%) compared to those without exposure (0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). While none of the women treated with CYC tried infertility treatments, two women without CYC exposure used in vitro fertilization (IVF) (one used donor eggs) to become pregnant. No woman in this cohort reported using adoption to complete her family.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0961203312468624"><title>Pregnancies</title>
<p>Women in this cohort reported 72 total pregnancies: 41 in women with prior CYC exposure (35 prior to and six after CYC treatment) and 31 without CYC exposure. Women exposed to CYC had pregnancies at a younger average age than nontreated women. Data were available for 39 of the CYC group and 28 of the control pregnancies; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312468624">Table 3</xref>.

<p>Pregnancy loss was not increased among pregnancies conceived following rheumatologic diagnosis among women with or without CYC exposure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312468624">Table 3</xref>). Preterm birth and preeclampsia, however, appeared to be increased post-diagnosis in women treated with CYC whether the pregnancies occurred before or after CYC, likely reflecting higher disease activity.</p>
<p>Among pregnancies conceived after rheumatologic disease diagnosis, 37.5% of women experienced an increase in symptoms, 29.2% had no change in symptoms, and 33.3% had a decrease in symptoms during pregnancy. The reported change in disease activity did not appear to be different for women with SLE compared to other diagnoses.</p>

<p>In this cohort, 30.4% of women with prior CYC developed premature cessation of menstruation. Older women who had received CYC were more often nulliparous, and very few pregnancies were conceived following CYC therapy. GnRH-a co-therapy may have decreased the frequency of premature menstrual cessation and increased fertility.</p>
<p>CYC crosslinks DNA, damaging the chromosomes of rapidly dividing cells, and results in permanent damage to the finite population of germ cells present in ovaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312468624">3</xref></sup> CYC primarily affects the function of granulosa cells of primordial follicles, suppressing estrogen production and stimulating gonadotropin release, which initiates the recruitment of a new cohort of follicles to develop. This process greatly increases the number of follicles vulnerable to the toxic effects of CYC, ultimately resulting in accelerated maturation and depletion of the ovaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312468624">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The percentage of women with premature cessation of menses following CYC was similar in this study (30.4%) to previous reports. Studies of women with SLE have reported ovarian insufficiency in 10–83% of women treated with CYC, depending primarily on the subject’s age at initiation of treatment and cumulative CYC dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312468624">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312468624">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312468624">11</xref></sup> Our study confirmed that older age at CYC initiation and cumulative CYC dose increase the risk for premature cessation of menstruation.</p>
<p>GnRH-a may protect ovarian reserve in women treated with CYC. Previous studies have demonstrated ovarian protection with a decreased number of follicles damaged after chemotherapy in rodents and primates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312468624">12</xref></sup> GnRH-a binds GnRH receptors located on the pituitary, initially causing a rise in gonadotropin release until the receptors are down-regulated, when both gonadotropin and estrogen levels decline. These hormonal changes may reduce the rate of follicular maturation, preventing follicles from developing to the point of becoming vulnerable to the toxicity of CYC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312468624">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312468624">9</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of nine studies of GnRH-a co-therapy during chemotherapy demonstrated co-therapy with GnRH-a during CYC treatment resulted in a 68% increase in continuation of menstruation over chemotherapy alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312468624">9</xref></sup> The current study supports this finding with a lower frequency of menstruation cessation following GnRH-a co-therapy, though this finding was not statistically significant. In our cohort, the current age of women who received GnRH-a was lower than those who did not, confounding the data. It is possible that the young women in this cohort who used GnRH-a co-therapy simply are not old enough to have experienced premature cessation of menstruation.</p>
<p>Another option for ovarian preservation during CYC is OCPs. A recent review of five studies that compare ovarian failure with and without OCP co-therapy found that four small studies showed no benefit, but one larger study demonstrated ovarian protection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312468624">13</xref></sup> In this study of 405 women with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, amenorrhea following therapy was increased in women who did not take OCPs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.002), were over 30 years old at the time of therapy (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0065), and had more advanced cancer (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312468624">14</xref></sup> Based on the available data, OCPs should not be depended on to prevent ovarian failure, though they can be useful in preventing pregnancy during CYC therapy. In addition, estrogen-containing OCPs may be contraindicated in women with severe SLE due to risk of thrombosis and possible disease flare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312468624">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our data suggest that CYC therapy increases the chances that a woman who wants to bear children will be unable to do so. In this cohort, a higher proportion of women who received CYC remained nulliparous involuntarily than women who had not received CYC. While a small number of women reported attempting pregnancy post-CYC, those without GnRH-a co-therapy were unable to conceive. This finding is similar to prior reports in which only one of the 11 women with non-sustained amenorrhea following CYC therapy was successful in achieving pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312468624">4</xref></sup> Despite the availability of reproductive technologies, alternative approaches to bearing children were not employed by many women in this study.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study, as well as many others measuring ovarian function in women after receiving chemotherapy, include use of cessation of menses and the number of pregnancies as the primary measures of CYC-induced gonadotoxicity. It is possible ovarian damage is not yet evident in some patients, especially young women who had a larger ovarian reserve at treatment initiation. Thus other measures of ovarian reserve, such as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), could be used in future studies to more thoroughly evaluate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on ovarian reserve. AMH indicates ovarian reserve and can be measured at any point in the menstrual cycle, is unaffected by contraceptives and pregnancy, and low levels can predict menopause prior to menstrual irregularity or other hormonal changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312468624">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312468624">17</xref></sup> Such an approach was recently published and suggests that GnRH-a co-therapy may blunt the fall in AMH caused by CYC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312468624">18</xref></sup> Further limitations include the small sample size and retrospective format.</p>
<p>In conclusion, CYC treatment in women with rheumatologic diseases increases the risk of premature cessation of menstruation, nulliparity, and decreases the frequency of pregnancy. Our study suggests that use of GnRH-a may correlate with improved ovarian function and fertility. This study highlights the importance of considering a patient’s future fertility when making treatment choices for severely active rheumatologic disease.</p>
