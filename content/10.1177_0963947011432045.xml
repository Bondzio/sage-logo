<p>(Reader, if you require a monument, look around you!)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>I am pleased and very proud to be able to offer a brief introductory note to this special issue celebrating 20 years of publication of the Poetics and Linguistics Association (PALA) journal <italic>Language and Literature</italic>. I took over as Editor in 2010 in succession to Paul Simpson after serving as Assistant Editor (2004–2009) and previous to that as Reviews Editor (1998–2004). While something of a latecomer to PALA and the <italic>Language and Literature</italic> party compared with Ron Carter, Mick Short, Katie Wales or Paul Simpson, I feel I can still claim some extended experience and first hand knowledge of the development of PALA’s journal over the years, particularly in more recent times. Over 20 years it has been exciting to witness and participate in the evolution of an originally UK journal with ambitions but limited reach, into a truly international journal serving an international association with a readership far beyond simply the core constituency membership and subscription, as nowadays download figures and other such metrics amply confirm. This issue, which considers and illustrates current developments in stylistics, includes contributors from Germany and China as well as from the UK. Volume 20 (2011) featured articles by authors from Australia, the USA and the UK, but also from Germany, Italy, Greece and Singapore, following on 2010 issues filled by writers from Spain, Brazil, the Netherlands and elsewhere. The record is not perfect, but it is better than that of most other academic journals I see. Readership can be shown to be primarily in China and the USA now, even if UK readers remain one of the top three audiences, with India and the Philippines, for example, rapidly growing and major areas for our readership as website access becomes easier around the world. Japan is also notable as a demonstrably long-established and significant centre of stylistic activity and interest. The necessary and desirable internationalisation of our research conversations is just one of the reasons to be proud of the progress <italic>Language and Literature</italic> has made in its second decade especially and I have no doubt this trajectory will continue and extend in coming years. The journal’s recent first ISI ‘Impact factor’ ranking (even though those statistics and that way of thinking should not be over-stated) places <italic>Language and Literature</italic> in a very respectable ‘top 40’ league among Linguistics journals. Moreover our readership is unusually loyal from year to year, our publisher tells us, as well as very steadily growing, even in these testing economic times when librarians are looking to trim their budgets. Much is to be celebrated then, all in all, and this sustained and growing achievement is worth stating explicitly.</p>
<p>Carter (this volume), however, rightly reminds us not to admire our own reflections too complacently in the kind of indicators I have cited. My own perspective would be that some of our strengths are also our weaknesses. Wide ranging and interdisciplinary interests could also be characterised less generously as a lack of sufficiently precise intellectual focus or even a lack of clear identity, one of Carter’s own points (‘What exactly is stylistics?’). Deliberate attempts to extend the reach of <italic>Language and Literature</italic> as in Swann and Allington’s special issue on readership (volume 19, issue 3) both rebut charges of cliquery, but also perhaps risk being perceived as a further attenuation of purpose from more hostile quarters. Another formulation of much the same two-sided dilemma might be that in avoiding too close an identification with any single approach or school (relevance theory, cognitive poetics or other possible candidates) a lack of rigour or intellectual commitment could be alleged. Again, is there too much ‘literature’ in the pages of <italic>Language and Literature</italic>, where ‘literature’ was meant to be taken in the widest possible sense by founders of PALA like Fowler (compare Simpson, this issue)? This, even as literary scholars have sometimes dismissed the journal as insufficiently responsive to debates in literary circles. Or why is the literature of <italic>Language and Literature</italic> nearly all taken from the 20th century (and very often from England too and written in English) when a more prototypical understanding of ‘literature’ would be valued or canonical imaginative works from a wider spread of centuries and origins? A distinctive enterprise then, but always in danger of falling between two or more stools. Not all is to be admired in the <italic>Language and Literature</italic> household. Even so, a willingness to encourage and publish articles on web fiction, popular culture, multimodality, advertising, translation and so many other topics, with a clearly recognisable ‘family resemblance’ in their study and analysis, for all the eclecticism also to be found, is finally to me something to be applauded not to be ashamed of. Similarly, to challenge the sadly shamefaced approach of so much academia to pedagogy is for me yet another real strength of the association and the journal since its inception, still kept up by recent articles and special issues (volume 19, issue 1; or volume 20, issue 3, for example). Leading stylisticians who can be rightly proud of their work in education and educational publications must include Carter (notably as editor of Routledge’s <italic>Interface</italic> series or in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947011432045">Carter et al., 2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947011432045">Short (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947011432045">Simpson (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947011432045">2004)</xref>, Stockwell (notably for Routledge’s <italic>English Language Introductions</italic> series, including his own title <italic>Sociolinguistics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947011432045">2002, 2nd edn 2007</xref>)), Wales’s <italic>Dictionary of Stylistics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947011432045">2011</xref> [2001]), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947011432045">Jeffries (2009)</xref>, or even my own book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947011432045">Hall (2005)</xref>, aimed primarily at the field of second-language users of language. Future stylistics and stylisticians can be expected to be stimulated to extend stylistics further by such publications and by stylistics classrooms more generally.</p>
<p>History does not make itself, a wise man once suggested. People like those I have mentioned have made stylistic history. ‘A Celebration of Style’ was the title of a one-day symposium co-organised by the University of Nottingham and the University of Sheffield in April 2011 to honour the very sustained and significant contributions to the stylistics community of retiring Professors Ron Carter and Katie Wales. Barely an individual at that large and lively meeting did not personally owe much in their intellectual and indeed career development to those two figures and it is right to repeat our respects and genuine gratitude here. Most of the articles in this collection had their origins in that celebratory but also forward-looking and self-critical meeting in Nottingham. It is a particular pleasure to highlight the thoughtful, well-informed contributions by Carter and Wales themselves to this special issue. Other contributors include the first editor of <italic>Language and Literature</italic> (Mick Short, Editor 1992–1996) as well as second Editor Katie Wales (1996–2003) and the third, Paul Simpson (2004–2009). These are inspiring colleagues and teachers as we take the literary linguistic enterprise forward in the 21st century. Note, too, how seminal researchers like Carter, Short, Wales or Simpson have kept on developing and refining their ideas where others would have been tempted to rest on their laurels many years ago. Short’s thoughtful and conscientious ongoing study of speech summary which follows is a prime instance of such work.</p>
<p>I have referred already to the relative lack of diachronic perspectives as a possible weakness of past stylistic work (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947011432045">Hall, 2012</xref>), but immediately the reader of this collection will notice Beatrix Busse’s important review article on the new <italic>Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary</italic> (a project in which Assistant Editor Cathy Emmott has had more than peripheral involvement at the University of Glasgow). Or if, again, a certain residual western ethnocentricity is alleged in <italic>Language and Literature</italic> despite, as I said, a better record than many journals, readers of this collection should immediately notice Dan Shen’s very stimulating review of 21st-century stylistics in China. Shen is known widely as one of the foremost literary linguistic scholars herself doing much to extend and deepen our research and understanding from within China with its own immeasurably rich literary and cultural traditions. If Carter, myself and most others still see the need for ‘steam-driven’ stylistics and linguistically informed and systematic close reading, Joanna Gavins (current Assistant Editor) and Peter Stockwell also rightly insist on appropriate response to the ‘texture’ of literature from their leading positions as cognitive practitioners. Elsewhere in this issue other leading ‘second’ or even now ‘third wave’ stylisticians demonstrate the value of corpus linguistic work to our enterprise (Mahlberg and Smith). Again, Moore on stylisation and related phenomena gives a flavour of the fascinating perspectives opened by new revolutions in sociolinguistics and the need for more stylistics of speech. Such an article reminds us once more that studies of everyday language use and literary language use are of the utmost value to those interested in language and literature for the sake of their genuine inter-illumination (compare, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947011432045">Carter, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice!</italic> Readers of the journal may recognise in my borrowed epigraph the inscription on Christopher Wren’s tomb in St Paul’s Cathedral, London, placed there by his son who appreciated how much his father had given his own age and to posterity. I find it an apt tag as I contemplate not just the articles in this issue but the growing collection of stylistics volumes on my bookshelves. Reader, if you wish to know what stylistics has achieved in the last 20 years, look around you at the rich variety of stylistic work on offer not just in this issue or this journal but more widely to the work referenced here or more widely by other contributors and the publications of PALA members and beyond. The stylistics building project like that of St Paul’s and the cosmopolitan London skyline still goes on. It may one day even be unrecognisable as the same project, but in the following pages readers can see that the secure foundations laid 20 years ago and more have ensured its stability and continuing viability.</p>
