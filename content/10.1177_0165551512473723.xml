<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Many countries have provided online access to law during the last decade. Various legislative access systems provide thematic, as well as keyword or chronological access using different data models. In 2011, many countries (USA, Australia, Norway, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Turkey, India, Mexico, South Africa and Canada) had significant collections of full texts available on the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551512473723">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Law documents are produced and archived in information systems, in which it is possible to access and retrieve information about them in a large-scale manner. Web standards like XML, XSLT and RDF facilitate the separation between content, presentation and metadata, thus contributing to a better exploitation of information present and/or inferred from these documents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551512473723">2</xref>].</p>
<p>One of the more challenging issues when dealing with legislative texts is the access and querying of consolidated versions. In this context, each version can be needed: its applicability to a given case is not only dependent on the current moment of time and whether it has been already being repealed in the legislative process, but also depends on whether the considered case started when that version was in force. In such a case, the version in force at the moment the case started must be taken into account.</p>
<p>Some issues can be identified related to change management: how to apply the history of changes to a version of a legislative document to obtain a new version, and what type of data model might be better to satisfy temporal queries (like the valid version on a particular date), to store the new versions or to obtain them dynamically. Access to all versions of a document is very important in legislative queries to be sure which rule to apply. The history of changes should be considered in the retrieval systems of legislative documents; however, few of them consider the dynamic feature of legal documents over time. Legal systems use several data models but with different results in cost of storage and maintenance of versions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551512473723">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551512473723">4</xref>]. Recently, some experiences of integration in Linked Data environments and semantic web have been reported. The data model used determines how to consider these issues.</p>
<p>This paper provides a survey of the models proposed for dealing with legislative document versions. A representative proposal illustrates each type of model. Section 2.1 presents a set of parameters that will guide the study. Section 2 presents and analyses the proposals. Section 3 summarizes the most relevant results of the comparison from a different perspective presenting the main conclusions for each parameter. Finally, Section 4 offers a global view of conclusions and future trends.</p>

<title>2. Data models</title>
<p>A data model is defined as ‘the data items of a certain part of the perceived reality (business domain) relevant for a specific application or a specific user in a structured way. This model includes the data relationships’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551512473723">5</xref>]. Several data models have been implemented for management of changes in legislative document systems. In this article some parameters to compare relevant data models for legislative document versions have been defined in order to acquire a good understanding of the proposals, to find their advantages and problems in managing document versions, and to identify the current trends. The parameters to be used in the comparisons are defined in Section 2.1. The data models are presented in the subsequent subsections.</p>

<p>The first distinction to consider is the type of data model used as the basis for each proposal. This parameter is the basic one, and it will have logical relevant consequences. For example, it will determine the flexibility to integrate the data model in Linked Data environments and semantic web. For each system, the data model used to represent the legislative text fragments, versions and metadata will be analysed.</p>

<title>2.1.3. Main legislative information entities</title>
<p>This parameter will be useful to analyse the accessibility to each version of a legislative document and to each version of its fragments. The types of information entities (pieces of legislation)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0165551512473723">2</xref></sup> represented by the model are considered in this parameter. As a general rule, each information entity type modelled could be target of versioning, so that instances of that type could be accessible for versioning. So, the wider the set of legislative information entity types considered, the wider the possibilities of versioning at different information levels.</p>

<title>2.2. Relational data model</title>
<p>The Agora Lex project is an example of the use of a relational database model for managing legislative document versions. The legislative document data and metadata are stored in relations of two dimensions. The Catholic University of Leuven and the Free University of Brussels developed this project, coordinated by experts of several public institutions. This project developed a model and a prototype using a RDBMS for accessing the legislation provided by the Belgian federal government [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551512473723">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The data model of Agora Lex is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551512473723">Figure 1</xref>. The main entities are legislative documents (<italic>statutes</italic>) and fragments (statute components: <italic>articles</italic> and <italic>rubrics</italic>). The smallest entity is the article. Versions are related through the <italic>next-version</italic> and <italic>previous-version</italic> attributes. Additionally, in this proposal some data about modifications made to each statute is stored in the <italic>Modification</italic> table. The stored units are fragment versions (<italic>Statute Components</italic>). The possible query operations are: (a) version of a document valid at a specific date; (b) historical evolution of a document obtained from the component versions; (c) full text search upon the text of the statutes; (d) historical evolution of a fragment; (g) validity interval of a document (statute); and (h) validity interval of a fragment (article). The time metadata stored are the validity times and intervals of fragments (start and end date).</p>

</fig>
<p>Agora Lex was one of the first projects to address the problem of legislative versions on a large scale. Dealing with fragments and fragment versions was an advance introduced by this project. The type of data model is logically influenced by the moment when the project started (XML technology was still immature, and Semantic Web technologies had not yet arrived). Some interesting lessons were learned from this project: the main problem was the existence of several legislative databases; integration was not possible in a central database owing to the migration time, political issues and costs at that time. Now, accessing several federal legislative databases through a portal, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.belgiumlex.be">www.belgiumlex.be</ext-link>, is possible, but there is not a full semantic integration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the main difficulties of the model based on relations are:</p>
<list id="list8-0165551512473723" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>propagation of errors from a preliminary version to consolidated versions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>querying a rule and the modifications require joins of at least five tables, which can be a costly operation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>link maintenance for each article is a complex task;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the tables are designed for a fix structure and the document must be separated into several fragments;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to access these tables, indexes created are indexes to relations not to documents;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a large number of APIs (application programming interfaces) must be understood and maintained by the system administrators and system programmers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>
<?h -4?>With the stabilization of XML, the relational-based proposals gave way to XML-based data models, in which the modelling and work with the structure of documents were facilitated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0165551512473723">
<title>2.3. XML-based data models</title>
<p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is the most successful among the markup languages. Its use has been extended to wide areas of information management, and it is in fact one of the preferred standards for information exchange. In the legal domain, its success was preceded by its predecessor SGML, and it has been for several years the ‘standard’ language for legal information modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512473723">8</xref>].</p>
<p>There are several reasons that support the selection of XML in legislative documents data models. First, using structured markup such as XML to represent the logical structure of a document allows more sophisticated searching within titles, part headings and the full text, allowing flexibility in the result of a search. In addition, XML is a good standard for long-term archiving thanks to its characteristic of being platform-independent. Typical legislative documents have a life span measured in months or several years and decades, and proprietary formats may be superseded in that period. Furthermore, the electronic formats chosen for delivering legislation to the public should be as diverse and widely accessible as possible; XML is a language designed for reuse and redistribution. Nowadays, it is possible to find many examples of the use of XML for drafting legislative information (such as Tasmania, Canada, USA, South Australia, Italy, Spain) and managing digital legislative documents (such as the UK, Singapore, Tasmania, Canada, NSW, USA and a number of US states) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551512473723">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551512473723">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Several legislative documents projects use XML with tree data models. The tree data models fit well when component interconnectivity is a key feature for the legislative change management systems. In addition, we could classify the legislative XML data models as <italic>Static</italic> and <italic>Dynamic</italic>. The static models store historical versions of legislative documents, their amendments and consolidated documents. The dynamic models allow the building of the history of versions at the time of query, based on information on a version and the relationship with operations in the fragments. Below we describe some representative experiences using XML with legislative systems.</p>
<p>We show three proposals, each one representing a different approach. The EnACT system models content fragments and composition rules for each document version. The relationship dynamic modelling (RDM) proposal models the first version of each document and the modifications that produce new versions as metadata. The Cronolex system also models the original versions of documents and their modifications, but here all are represented and stored together in a single XML document.</p>
<sec id="section13-0165551512473723">
<title>2.3.1. The EnACT system</title>
<p>The EnAct system is a legislation system developed for the Tasmanian Parliament by an Australian university, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). This system uses a tree data model represented with SGML. At the core of the system is TeraTex, an SGML database system developed by RMIT devoted to the storage of structured and semi-structured documents in SGML or XML format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551512473723">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In this system, statutes are fragmented at the section level. Therefore, the main legislative entities modelled are statutes (legislative document) and their sections (fragments). Additionally, schedules and appendices are fragmented if they contain Parts, Annexure or Codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551512473723">12</xref>]. That is, together with documents, several fragment types are modelled, the main ones being Sections, Parts, Annexes and Codes. Individual components can be versioned independently of the documents to which they belong. The smallest modelled, and versioned, entity in this model is a fragment (Section). The stored units are fragments and composite rules. The composite rules consist of tables of contents valid (at a specified time) for each version. When a Section is changed, the table of contents is updated conveniently, and previous versions of fragments are kept for historical reference. The retrieval of each version is done by composing it using XSLT for joining the fragments valid at the particular point in time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551512473723">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The main query operations supported in the EnAct system are: (a) legislative document valid at a specific date; (b) historic evolution of a legislative document with access to all the versions; (c) full-text search upon the legislative texts; (d) historical evolution of a legislative document fragment; (f) the amending acts; (g) and (h) the validity interval of a legislative item (document or fragment); and (k) in-force date. The operation of searching for a consolidated document is a rapid one. A filter is applied to the database, when a time point is specified, leaving only those fragments and change description documents valid at the specified time. There are also more sophisticated searching methods such as mixing searches within titles, head notes, part headings, and the full text and search in tables of contents.</p>
<p>The time metadata stored in the system are: (b) publication time; (d) validity of a fragment; (e) validity interval of the legislative document; and (f) validity interval of a fragment and table of contents. Each fragment is stored with the dates for which that piece of legislation is in force.</p>
<p>One of the main values of this system is being one of the first systems using XML and automatic consolidation based on XML technology (dynamic model). In addition, it uses sophisticated indexing to facilitate searches in document content (in fact, in fragment content). Some drawbacks in this model are the complexity of maintaining change descriptions, and the use of a specific database system made ad-hoc for this application, which decreases portability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0165551512473723">
<title>2.3.2. Relationship dynamic modelling</title>
<p>A dynamic approach to generate rule versions was proposed in Spain. In this proposal the references to other documents and modification relationships are represented as links, using XLink, in a relationship graph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551512473723">14</xref>]. The legislative documents are represented by XML documents, each of which stores the content of a legislative document as it was created by its producer source. The proposal uses a Graph data model, in which nodes are legislative items, documents or document fragments (each legislative document is a tree), and the relationships are edges that connect them. The XML documents were stored in a file system.</p>
<p>The main entities in the model are the legislative document and its fragments: book, title, chapter, section, article, disposition (different types of disposition are considered), and paragraph. This structure is reflected in the associated DTD. Thus, the smallest Entity represented in the XML legislative document is the Paragraph. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165551512473723">Figure 2</xref> shows a simplified picture of this data model (only the legislative document structure is shown). The original legislative documents are stored, in XML documents, and the modifications, represented as XLink metadata, are stored separately.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0165551512473723-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The main query operations supported by this model are: (a) document version valid at a given date (dynamically generated); (c) full text search in the text of the legislative document, and queries about the history of a legislative item (options (d–f) in parameter 2.1.6). This data model deals with one kind of time metadata: publication time. However, the model could include other dates. The dynamic version generation process (consolidation) uses a graph. The application of changes to the initial version generates a new version; the consolidated version is a virtual one, so that no physical copy of it is stored.</p>
<p>The main strength of this data model is its adaptation to the domain data model (structure of the legislative texts) and its flexibility to query and consolidate from the information originally created by legislative document producers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551512473723">15</xref>]. This data model is within the set of models favouring the flexibility of dynamic content production to avoid the maintenance problems that multiple version storage causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551512473723">16</xref>]. A limitation is the lack of multiple time metadata, which can be very useful in legal information retrieval operations. However, this limitation could be easily resolved. In fact, its main weakness is dealing with the propagation of versioning effects in information retrieval operations, as it adds complexity to query resolution.</p>

<title>2.3.3. Cronolex system</title>
<p>Cronolex is a system developed in Spain to manage all the life cycle of a legal norm from the drafting of the norm to its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551512473723">17</xref>].

A DTD captured the XML structure, which has two great parts, the metadata of the norm and the text of the norm. Every XML document contains the original text of a norm, together with information about the modifications performed in time and useful information to obtain the consolidated version at each point-in-time. As such, a single XML document condenses all the information about a given norm and its versions, which represents all of the life cycle of a given legislative document. This approach fits well with the multi-version XML document approach in XML versioning.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0165551512473723">Figure 3</xref> shows the basic elements of this structure. The metadata part contains the information about the modifications made to the legislative document. The types of modifications considered are repeal, cancellation, insertion and substitution. The body part of the XML document contains the text of the norm structured in the following parts: header, introduction, article structure, dispositions, ending and annexes. The article structure can contain itself the following element types: book, title, chapter, section, subsection, article, paragraph and statement. Modifiers (legislative documents that amend some other document) contain XLink elements embedded in their text to represent the modifications. This model is a type of model that does not store the consolidated versions, but obtains them dynamically.</p>

</fig>
<p>Cronolex uses a native XML database (Xindice) to keep the XML documents. The main legislative entities comprise the legislative document and several fragment types – those listed in the previous paragraph – so that the granularity of this model is a fine one, achieving the <italic>article</italic> and <italic>paragraph</italic> level. This is possible thanks to the flexibility of XML, that allows the storage of a whole document in an XML file, despite being able to access independently each XML fragment, that is, each legislative document fragment represented in the data model. The stored unit is the original legislative document, in fact the multi-version document, which contains the modifications, as elements inside the document metadata that will permit the consolidation of each version.</p>
<p>The main query operations supported by this data model are: (a) document valid at a specific date; (c) full-text search upon the legislative item; (f) amending acts; (g) document validity interval; and (k) in force date of a legislative item. The time metadata stored in the system are: (a) approval time; (b) publication time; and (d) validity time.</p>
<p>Cronolex has two main modules: (a) consolidation module of the law – it dynamically produces the consolidated versions of each legislative document, using the modification metadata and the original content stored in the XML document; (b) the XML database module in charge of keeping all the XML documents that represent the legal norms. This data model is efficient for consolidation, which was the main operation in which the model was inspired. Its main drawback is the complexity of queries involving multiple documents. For example, it is not possible to obtain information about the historical evolution of each fragment.</p>

<title>2.4. Mixed relational and tree (XML) data model</title>
<p>There are some experiences using mixed relational and tree-based XML data models in legislative data systems. Here we describe two proposals, representative of the two main approaches. The system in Section 2.4.1 models all versions of a legal text as parts of a multi-version XML document. The Norma System, in Section 2.4.2, also models each version of a legal text, but as independent XML documents, related by links to the previous and next version of each one.</p>
<sec id="section17-0165551512473723">
<title>2.4.1. Temporal management of a normative system (TMD)</title>
<p>In 2005, Grandi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551512473723">18</xref>] presented research concerning temporal management of normative texts in XML format using a mixed relational and (XML) tree data model. The metadata are stored in columns of relational tables, and for the legislative documents, a multi-version data model based on XML schema is used. In the implementation, a proprietary XML-enabled RDBMS is used. The system uses XML facilities, such as XQuery support, to manage XML documents. The relational table stores the XML documents (in one column) plus the time stamping metadata. In this way, the advantages of relational databases are exploited to query metadata, while legislative texts are accessed by means of the XML query language, XQuery. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0165551512473723">Figure 4</xref> shows the data model in the TDM system.</p>
<fig id="fig4-0165551512473723" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0165551512473723-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The main legislative entities represented in this model are the legislative document (norm) and fragments: Section, Article and Paragraph. The smallest Entity is the Paragraph. The stored unit is an XML multi-version document. In this XML document, <italic>ver</italic> elements are used to store versions of each legislative entity represented in the model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0165551512473723">Figure 4</xref>). The query operations are: (a) legislative document valid document at a specified date; (b) historical evolution of a document; (c) full-text search upon the legislative item; (d) historical evolution of a fragment, (f) amending acts, (g) validity interval of the document, (h) validity interval of a fragment, (i) efficacy interval of a document, (j) efficacy interval of a fragment, (k) in force date of a legislative item. Time metadata represented in the model are: (b) publication time; (d) validity time; (e) validity interval of a document; (f) validity interval of a fragment; (g) efficacy interval of a legislative document; and (h) efficacy interval of a fragment. Three time attributes – validity, efficacy and transaction time – are associated with each <italic>ver</italic> element in the XML document.</p>
<p>In contrast to the previous models, which consolidate the different versions dynamically from the information stored in the XML document, this one stores all versions in one XML document (multi-version XML document). In this case, each new modification to the content implies a modification to the XML multi-version document. However, this cost in update is compensated for by the fact that the access to a version is direct. Another positive issue of this model is the granularity level, which reaches the paragraph level.</p>
<p>This one is the system that includes more time metadata. This is the basis of the ‘multi-dimensional’ versioning offered by this proposal (time attributes represent dimensions). Query efficiency is privileged in this proposal: on one side, the metadata are stored in a relational database to improve their querying; on the other side, efficiency is improved by introducing a preliminary document-filtering phase based on the temporal predicates specified in the query.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0165551512473723">
<title>2.4.2. Norma system</title>
<p>Other experience with temporal data models using relational and XML tree data model was developed in Italy with the Norma System, integrating front-office tools (an editor) with back-office tools (document management system, DMS). The metadata are stored in a non-proprietary RDBMS. In this system, the documents are stored as XML documents in a file server. The documents are compliant with the DTD 2.0, developed in the Norme In Rete Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551512473723">19</xref>]. The standards are in use by the majority of Italian public administration and by a growing number of private operators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165551512473723">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551512473723">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The DTDs elements are: (a) structural elements (heading, preamble, sections, articles, paragraphs); (b) special elements (references to other norms, relevant entities, formatted text-embedded); (c) metadata (publication date, relationships, classification, etc.); and (d) semantic elements (provisions: obligations, prohibitions, modifications, etc.). The main entities in the model are legislative document and fragments (the structural elements). The smallest entity represented is a paragraph; however, the access to information is made at document level. Each version is stored in a different XML document. Therefore, the stored units are the legislative doc versions, plus the links that relate each version. These links are stored in metadata. The metadata E-R, in which links are represented by the <italic>linktype</italic> and <italic>link</italic> entities, is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0165551512473723">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0165551512473723-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The core of this system was an editor for drafting normative texts, which supports document versioning based on the modifications applied via the editor. The possible query operations are: (a) document valid at a specific date; (b) historical evolution of a legislative document; (c) full-text search upon the legislative document; (f) amending acts; (g) validity interval of the document; (i) efficacy interval of a document; and (k) in force date of a legislative item. The user-defined markup also involves temporal information, including publication, validity and efficacy time. Temporal query support is provided though a consolidation module, which helps the user to reconstruct norm versions related to validity time. Time metadata represented are: (b) publication time; (d) validity time; (e) validity interval of a document; and (g) efficacy interval of a document.</p>
<p>This proposal has a major difference with the TMD system: both store versions, but while the TDM used a multi-version XML document to compile all the versions of a given text, the Norma System uses links to relate versions, which are stored in independent XML documents. Updates such as the addition of new versions, and access to versions in a very different manner. While the multi-version XML document relies on the XML query language (XQuery) for retrieving each version, the Norma System provides a dedicated consolidation module to retrieve each version. Indeed, the main limitation of this proposal is its strong links to the version editor tool. Among positive aspects it is the ability to support efficient queries to metadata; as the TMD proposal does, metadata are stored in a relational database, which makes these queries very efficient.</p>

<title>2.5. Other experiences with XML</title>
<p>There have been other experiences in Europe of working with XML, like EUR-Lex, the information system of the European Union, which this article does not cover in detail here, as it does not introduce significant differences in the approaches followed. All of them are present in some of the classes covered in the XML based data models in Section 2.3 or mixed relational-XML data models in Section 2.4.</p>
<p>EUR-Lex contains a law texts database allowing multiple kinds of access to European Union Law. It also offers tools for navigation of manually consolidated documents and 20 European language supports. The website is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/tools/about.htm">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/tools/about.htm</ext-link>. Other initiatives have introduced or used standards for legal source description, such as Metalex and SDU BWB in the Netherlands, LexDania in Denmark, Normattiva.it portal in Italy (based on the Norma System), CHLexML in Switzerland, the eLaw project in Austria and AKOMA NTOSO in Africa.</p>
<p>Outside Europe, in Canada, the LIMS project manages using XML the drafting, printing and Web publishing of the consolidated legislation of the country. Now a private company [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551512473723">22</xref>] manages this project. The Ontario and Québec governments are developing similar projects for the regional legislation. The USA is also working to produce in XML both Bills and Resolutions, and the DTDs are freely accessible at the site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://xml.house.gov">http://xml.house.gov</ext-link>; XMetaL is used for drafting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551512473723">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Many of the legal private publishers are already working with XML. It is interesting to note that the approaches vary considerably: a Danish publisher developed more than 80 DTDs to cater for the whole national legislation, one for each type of normative document. Another publisher, in Sweden, developed just one DTD for the Swedish legislation.</p>

<title>2.6. Semantic Web-oriented data models</title>
<p>The legal systems are usually developed in several databases and formats that require integration. RDF offers the possibility of building a simple semantic data model with several advantages over traditional data models for legal systems. First, RDF helps to merge data from multiple sources and does it in such a way that data about the same things gets collated. The common semantics and a common data representation format enable cross-data source querying using SPARQL, allowing content or relationships between content from several sites to be discovered.</p>
<p>Properties and values can be described with a shared schema or ontology, taking advantage of RDF in legal systems. In addition to the domain conceptual model, legal models are proposed modelling provisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0165551512473723">7</xref></sup> The semantics, in terms of type of provisions and arguments, are usually added to the documents as metadata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165551512473723">24</xref>]. As a result, RDF is used in several legal system projects requiring integration and complex conceptual representation. Here two important projects, already operative, are presented.</p>
<sec id="section21-0165551512473723">
<title>2.6.1. Legislation.gov.uk</title>
<p>In the UK, the National Archives, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, launched the legislation.gov.uk site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551512473723">25</xref>]. The site contains legislation as it was originally enacted with the revised versions of the Acts of Parliament, showing changes to legislation over time. The legislation.gov.uk site helps to manage multiple versions of different fragments of legislative texts at different points in time. The data model used is a tree implemented with XML for the legislative documents, and a graph represented with RDF for the metadata. The XML structure, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0165551512473723">Figure 6</xref>, also contains metadata using Dublin Core with descriptive items, links to other parts of the legislation, unapplied effects and the content of legislation.</p>

</fig>
<p>The legislation.gov.uk site uses a native XML database allowing advanced queries in documents. The UK site provides a Restful API to serve different versions of a legislative document in different formats at the same URI, to give developers full and open access to the data. The website and the API are now operational, with new legislation and new revisions added every day. The UK government is using linked data to meet the diverse needs of data consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165551512473723">26</xref>]. Versions are stored in a native XML database and the metadata in RDF format. RDF triples are stored in the RDF store.</p>
<p>The main entities in the data model are legislative document and Fragment (Section). The smallest entity is a Section. The stored unit is the initial legislative document plus metadata about the modifications it suffered.</p>
<p>The main query operations in this system are: (a) obtaining the legislative document valid at a given date; (b) historical evolution of a legislative document; (c) full text search in the text of the legislative document; (d) historical evolution of a legislative fragment; (e) laws repealed by a law; (f) the amending acts; (g) validity interval of a legislative document; and (k) in force date of a legislative item.</p>
<p>The time metadata identified in the system are: (b) publication time; (d) validity time; and (e) validity interval of a legislative document. However, the model allows new metadata to be easily included. Moreover, legislation.gov.uk gives accurate information related to the repealed section date, by what piece of legislation, and when that repeal comes into force.</p>
<p>This system makes an extensive reuse of vocabularies: FOAF, FRBR (Functional Requirements of Bibliographic Records), Dublin Core and Metalex ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551512473723">25</xref>]. These vocabularies provide the ability to reuse. Using FRBR vocabulary, each Work (legislative item) has a number of Expressions, each one representing a different version of the legislation. The versioned documents point to their Manifestations (formats) with properties such as: <italic>dct:hasFormat</italic>.</p>
<p>In this proposal metadata are stored in both XML docs and RDF data; this redundancy eases queries on metadata. Versioning has a correct granularity level, as it reaches the section level, that is, each section is versioned. The strongest advantage of this model comes from its adoption of the Linked Data recommendation: RDF and OWL standards are used, URIs are associated with each legislative item to identify it, and vocabularies, such as Dublin Core, FRBR or Cen Metalex, are reused, which favours semantic interoperability.</p>

<sec id="section22-0165551512473723">
<title>2.6.2. Metalex</title>
<p>The Metalex Document Server hosts versions of Dutch national statutes and regulations, both as CEN MetaLex and as Linked Data. CEN MetaLex is an XML format for representing, publishing and interchanging legal texts. The standard suggests a naming convention for URI-based identifiers for all structural elements of a legal document. Metadata follow the guidelines of the CEN Metalex standard. An XML schema specifies the MetaLex syntax and the content models. The Metalex XML syntax has syntactic elements (structure) and the meaning of elements. Each MetaLex XML element has a name, a content model and zero or more attributes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0165551512473723">Figure 7</xref> shows the legislative document structure in the Metalex Document Server system.</p>

<caption><p>The Metalex Document Server legislative document structure.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0165551512473723-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Metalex Document Server in doc.metalex.eu uses a mixed tree XML and graph data model represented by RDF. The norms are encoded like XML documents. Initially, these documents were stored in a file system, but now they are stored in an XML native database. The metadata are represented like triples and stored in the RDF repository 4store. The main entities identified in the model are: Legislative Document and Fragment (Parts, Article, Subparts), and CenMetalex metadata. The smallest versioned entity is the Article. The stored unit is the XML Legislative Document plus CenMetalex metadata stored like RDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165551512473723">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The RDF metadata contain: legacy, structural, reference, identity, event and process metadata. The main possible query operations, using a SPARQL end point, are: (a) document valid at a specific date; (b) historical evolution of a document; (c) full text search upon the legislative texts; (d) historical evolution of a fragment; (e) norms repealed by a norm; (f) amending acts on a rule; (g) validity interval of the document; (h) validity interval of a fragment; (i) the efficacy interval of a legislative document; and (k) in force date of a legislative item. The time metadata are: (b) publication time; (d) validity time; (e) interval of validity of a document; (f) interval of validity of a fragment; and (g) interval of efficacy of a document. To keep track of versions METALex provides a number of attributes for every structural XML element in the document that can be identified, selected and changed. This system, like legislation.gov.uk system, uses Linked Data technologies identifying each resource with URIs, a good solution for fragment versioning in open systems.</p>
<p>Positive aspects of Metalex are also related to the adoption of Linked Data recommendations: URIs are used to identify legislative items, and ontologies for sharing vocabularies, for example, the W3C time ontology. It also uses CenMetalex. However, if compared with the UK proposal, this last offers better queries and facilities for versioning document fragments.</p>

<p>There is a trend of using XML native database or XML-enabled RDBMS for legislative documents, and RDF stores for metadata. Some systems also use a document management system with a file system for the XML documents. Of course, the data model chosen influences the database system used. It seems that, in the near future, solutions combining tree-like data models with RDF metadata will be predominant. Consequently, it is expected that management systems able to manage successfully both types of data should be the preferred ones. However, until now, this being an area of active work at present, the systems present in the proposals studied are heterogeneous, or even developed ad-hoc.</p>

However, there are some differences in the types of fragments considered, which also makes a difference to the granularity achieved by each proposal. There are two main solutions: systems that reflect the finest granularity level present in the legal texts represented, the Paragraph; and systems whose granularity stops at the Article level (one level higher than the previous one). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165551512473723">Table 2</xref> shows the members of each group. Another significant difference is the unit versioned: some systems only consider document versions, while others also version fragments.

<title>3.3. Stored unit</title>
<p>This parameter takes into account the information unit stored. Here we find significant differences. The first relevant difference comes from the option chosen for versions: whether versions are stored or generated dynamically. Systems that generate versions dynamically use information about modifications or composite rules of versions, which are stored beside documents or fragments. The two systems from Spain, RDM and Cronolex, consolidate versions dynamically, for which they store the initial versions of legislative documents. On the other hand, the Tasmanian system, EnAct, stores fragments, which it composes following the composition rules stored in the system. In the rest of the systems, versions are stored. Nevertheless, some differences can be found in the way of keeping track of the relationships. It is worth remarking that the Linked Data-oriented models also store metadata, which are kept as RDF data. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165551512473723">Table 3</xref> these data are summarized. We expect that the use of RDF to store metadata, which would push semantic queries, will spread in the future.</p>

<p>All the analysed systems allow to query the legislative document valid at a specific date and to get a full-text search upon the legislative document. The historical evolution of a document is also covered by several systems. The historical evolution of a fragment is less supported. Information about amending and amended acts of a rule is not always considered. The queries related with validity and efficacy are less supported by the analysed systems. In general, we observe that the Linked Data oriented proposals support a wider set of queries using SPARQL.</p>

<title>4. Conclusions</title>
<p>Several issues emerge related to versioning, including accessing any version of a document, querying its history, versioning a fragment and so forth. The background of dealing with these problems is varied. The community working with legislative document versions has long studied issues such as access to any version, and proposed several data models. These issues have been taken into account in this survey, by means of the parameters defined in Section 2. This study does not consider other issues that could be of interest for other communities, for example, the information retrieval community, such as measuring the efficiency of queries or getting the consolidated version, or measuring the impact of versioning on information retrieval operations and indexing. This could be a different study, complementary to the one presented in this paper.</p>
<p>In this survey we have seen that in legislative systems granularity is an important issue when versioning. All the proposals try to achieve a high granularity level in representation and/or in versioning. While only some systems version fragments, all of them put care into storing the information that allows this.</p>
<p>The acceptance that the Linked Data principles have received in this community is also interesting. It seems clear to us that there is a strong tendency now towards adapting the existing systems to these principles, because publishing is among the main goals in a legislative information system. URIs and metadata are gaining a place in these proposals. In addition, we expect vocabularies and ontologies to increase their presence. However, we still miss some more standard vocabularies that could permit a real sharing of semantics, for example, for temporal metadata. Some systems, such as Norma in Rete or CEN Metalex, are already working in this direction, but they have not yet achieved complete and definitive proposals that have been generally adopted. We expect some efforts on this issue to appear in the near future.</p>
<p>We expect also proposals with improved support for temporal queries. As stated in the analysis in the previous section, RDF is a powerful tool for doing this, and legislative information systems are already working to optimize it. RDF stores and RDF query language, SPARQL, are now stable standards, ready to be used with confidence.</p>
<p>Some approaches compose versions automatically and infer the composition rules (structure) of versions from semantic information instead of storing versions. These solutions, which introduce dynamism and knowledge extraction in version management applications, are promising for digital legislation. They can help to solve automatically some issues that otherwise could not be treated in many of these systems, because a manual introduction of composition rules or versioning information is, in many cases, unaffordable.</p>
<p>Advances in versioning have been developed in Europe, the USA, Australia, Canada and Japan. In Latin America there is little evidence of the use of XML or RDF in legal management systems; most sites only have the version of the law in force, and they do not offer possibilities for querying the history of a norm or a fragment. We also expect a strong effort on this area in the future.</p>
