<abstract>
<p>The goal of the current study was to assess the efficacy and acceptability of a web-based tutorial (Child Health Matters, CHM) designed to improve school nurses’ communications with families about pediatric weight-related health issues. Using a randomized wait-list control design, a nationally representative sample of school nurses was assigned to immediate or delayed access conditions. Pre-, post-, and follow-up assessments of knowledge, barriers to providing obesity treatment, and intended practices were conducted. Results indicated that, relative to wait-list controls, immediate-access nurses demonstrated significant increases in knowledge and decreases in perceived barriers to discussing weight-related health, and significantly greater intentions to assess physical activity, and to recommend dietary changes and physical activity. Wait-list nurses demonstrated significant within-group improvements after completing CHM. Nurses reported a high degree of satisfaction with CHM. Results suggest that web-based tutorials can effect changes in nurses’ knowledge, perceived barriers, and intended practices with regard to weight-related health care.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past 20 years the United States has witnessed a substantial increase in the prevalence of obesity and overweight in children and youth, with estimates approaching 40% in some demographic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512446070">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512446070">Ogden, Lamb, Curtin, Carroll, &amp; Flegal, 2010</xref>). In response to the obesity epidemic, both the U.S. Surgeon General and the American Medical Association (AMA) have identified a need for training health care professionals in effective assessment, prevention, and treatment techniques for pediatric overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512446070">AMA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512446070">Ogden et al., 2010</xref>). These recommendations come in the context of a growing consensus that intervention and prevention measures that incorporate socioecological frameworks will be necessary to address and ultimately reverse the pediatric obesity epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512446070">AMA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512446070">Huang, Drenowski, Kumanyika, &amp; Glass, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512446070">Steele &amp; Van Allen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>School-based health services hold great potential to effect change in children’s health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512446070">Rattay, Fulton, &amp; Galuska, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512446070">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>). Public schools are closely linked with their communities, are accessible to all children regardless of socioeconomic status, and maintain relationships with children and families for long periods. Better integration of public schools into children’s health care can result in systems of care that will more successfully address health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512446070">Rogers, 2003</xref>). Within these systems of care, school nurses represent an important provider population because of their mandated role to monitor and promote children’s health in the school setting. Specifically, school nurses are optimally situated to (a) disseminate health-related knowledge and resources to students, families, and school personnel, (b) provide decisional support and support for self-management of health conditions, (c) provide targeted health-related counseling to students and families, and (d) impact public school policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512446070">Steele et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Health care providers, including school nurses, have reported a number of barriers to effectively address children’s weight-related health issues, including deficits in self-perceived competencies, perceived lack of support from school administration or personnel, time constraints, and perceived role constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512446070">Kubik, Story, &amp; Davey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512446070">Rattay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512446070">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with the literature, our own research has revealed time constraints, lack of support from school administration, lack of appropriate referral resources, and lack of mandates or “allies” to assist with weight-related counseling as barriers to communication with families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512446070">Steele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512446070">Wu &amp; Steele, 2011</xref>). Because the AMA recommendations for adequate treatment and prevention of pediatric obesity include efforts that incorporate socioecological frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512446070">AMA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512446070">CDC, 2003</xref>), it is necessary to address nurse-identified barriers to weight-related communication with families. Consistent with systems-based models of health care delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512446070">Steele &amp; Van Allen, 2011</xref>), we propose that school nurses are particularly well positioned to provide resources, self-management support, and decisional support to parents of children with obesity.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the current study was to assess the efficacy and acceptability of a web-based tutorial (Child Health Matters [CHM]; www.child-health-matters.org) designed to improve school nurses’ communications with families about pediatric weight-related health issues. Consistent with the identified barriers in the literature noted above and with recommendations for continuing medical education programs in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446070">Mazmanian, 2009</xref>), CHM was designed to impart specific knowledge about weight-related health issues and enhance specific communication strategies known to impact the adoption of health behaviors (i.e., Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques; Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002). Addressing these deficits was expected to enhance school nurses’ provision of services at all levels of prevention/intervention (i.e., universal, selective, indicated), including their ability to impact local school district policies surrounding weight-related health promotion. As described in more detail below, CHM conveys this information through didactic materials, video demonstrations, and accompanying links to selected external resources.</p>
<p>CHM, and correspondingly, our evaluation of the tutorial, was constructed around the Knowledge-Attitudes-Practice (K-A-P) process of Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512446070">Rogers, 2003</xref>). This theory argues that professionals are more likely to adopt an innovative approach in their practices when (a) their knowledge of the approach is sufficient, (b) their attitudes about the approach are favorable, and (c) when barriers to the approach are seen as manageable. Thus, CHM was intended to improve school nurses’ knowledge of intervention and assessment techniques for weight-related health, address nurse attitudes about obesity treatment, and serve as a resource that nurses can use to provide families with information about weight-related health. Following the K-A-P model, our evaluation of CHM centered on knowledge acquisition, changes in attitude (as indicated by nurse-perceived barriers), and intended practices related to evidence-based assessment and treatment of obesity. Using an experimental design with immediate “treatment” and wait-list control groups of nurses, we hypothesized that CHM would produce meaningful changes in school nurses’ knowledge of weight-related health issues, decreases in perceived barriers to communicating with families, and improved self-reported likelihood of adherence to recommended principles of evidence-based assessment and intervention for pediatric obesity. Further, and consistent with published recommendations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446070">Mazmanian, 2009</xref>), we examined nurses’ satisfaction with the online tutorial.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A national sample of school nurses was recruited via local and state nursing newsletters, e-mails to membership lists of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN), and via direct contact with school district nurse coordinators. Nurses in 17 states across the United States were contacted. E-mails and advertisements contained direct links to the CHM website; nurses contacted by phone subsequently received a link via e-mail to facilitate enrollment. All nurses employed in elementary, middle, or high schools (including substitute school nurses) were eligible to participate.</p>
<p>A total of 526 school nurses responded to the invitation to participate in the study by completing registration materials and were randomized to the immediate treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 263) or wait-list control (<italic>n</italic> = 263) condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840512446070">Figure 1</xref> indicates the number of nurses in each condition that completed CHM and pre- and postprogram measures. Only participants who completed the tutorial (i.e., all training sessions and assessments) were included in the present analyses. Participants who completed the full tutorial did not differ significantly from those who completed only part of the tutorial on measured demographic variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512446070">Table 1</xref> provides the demographic characteristics of nurses included in the current analyses. An exact participation rate is impossible to calculate because we cannot know the specific number of nurses who received information from health coordinators, newsletters, and/or colleagues.</p>

<title>Demographic information</title>
<p>Using the online CHM portal, nurses were asked to provide demographic characteristics about themselves as well as the schools that they served (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512446070">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840512446070">
<title>K-A-P variables</title>
<p>School nurse’s knowledge, attitudes, and intended practices were measured using self-report instruments delivered via the CHM website. <italic>Change in knowledge</italic> regarding obesity treatment and assessment was measured via questionnaires administered before and after each module of the tutorial. The pre- and postsession knowledge questions assessed whether nurses understood the key learning points contained within each section and were designed specifically for the content contained in CHM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840512446070">
<title>Attitudes toward obesity and barriers to communication</title>
<p>were assessed using the School Nurse Attitudes and Perceptions (SNAP) scale created during the initial piloting of CHM (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512446070">Wu &amp; Steele, 2011</xref>, for description of the measure development). This 45-item measure is comprised of three subscales, which assess barriers on various ecological levels: nurse-level barriers, job-level barriers, and higher, societal-level barriers. Internal consistencies (Cronbach’s α) for the SNAP subscales range from .82 to .97. Immediate treatment nurses completed the SNAP after randomization and after completion of the tutorial; Wait-list control nurses completed the SNAP after randomization, immediately prior to beginning the tutorial, and after completion of the tutorial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840512446070">
<title>Intended practices</title>
<p>were measured using a 13-item measure of school nurse practices developed for this evaluation and based on a prior measure used with pediatricians, nurse practitioners, and registered dietitians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512446070">Story et al., 2002</xref>). The instrument consists of items measuring nurses’ practices for assessing obesity in the school setting (4 items; α = .93), potential dietary recommendations for students (4 items; α = .87), and potential physical activity recommendations for students (5 items; α = .91). In addition, 10 items assessed nurses’ reported practices in the last 3 months (prior to intervention) and nurses’ intentions to carry out specific skills and behaviors related to CHM content postintervention (e.g., discussing families’ motivations to address students’ weight-related health). Immediate treatment nurses completed the intended practices scale after randomization and after completion of the tutorial; wait-list control nurses completed this instrument after randomization, immediately prior to beginning the tutorial, and after completion of the tutorial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059840512446070">
<title>School nurse satisfaction</title>
<p>School nurse satisfaction with the CHM tutorial was assessed via the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), which was modified to ask about perceptions of the CHM tutorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512446070">Attkisson &amp; Greenfield, 1999</xref>). The CSQ-8 has demonstrated good reliability (α = .83-.93) and validity in previous literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512446070">Larsen, Attkisson, Hargreaves, &amp; Nguyen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512446070">Nguyen, Attkison, &amp; Stegner, 1983</xref>). All nurses completed the CSQ-8 after completion of the tutorial.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840512446070">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Nurses completed registration for the website, provided informed consent for the use of their data, and completed the pretutorial assessment battery at Time 1. Nurses who were randomized to the immediate treatment condition received login information and were given access to the CHM website immediately after randomization. Nurses who were randomized to the wait-list control condition were given access to the website when immediate treatment nurses completed the program (Time 2). Specifically, one wait-list control nurse received access to the program each time one immediate treatment nurse completed the posttutorial assessment battery. Wait-list control nurses also provided postintervention data (Time 3) following completion of the program. CHM was approved in 2009 as a source for Continuing Education credits for nurses that completed the tutorial. Each school nurse who completed the program was awarded 4.8 hours of Continuing Nursing Education from the University of Kansas Medical Center Area Health Education Center East. Immediate treatment nurses completed the tutorial in 47.4 days on average (<italic>SD</italic> = 48.2); Wait-list control nurses completed the program in 30.2 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 33.9). All study procedures were approved by the sponsoring university’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
<sec id="section10-1059840512446070">
<title>CHM</title>
<p>CHM is a website designed to provide school nurses with nutrition, exercise, and energy-balance information, as well as communication tools to be used with children and their caregivers, school administrators, and policy makers in conversations about weight-related health promotion. CHM consists of 12 sequential modules that address the topics noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840512446070">Table 2</xref>. CHM conveys information through text, slides, video demonstrations, and accompanying links to reputable selected external resources (e.g., National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites). It is intended to enhance school nurses’ communication with children and families by promoting MI techniques. MI has demonstrated utility in a variety of applied settings and success in a number of clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512446070">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>). The program features didactic material (e.g., slides, resources, notes), and video clips of master’s level psychotherapists providing MI interventions to youth and families in the context of weight-related health issues.</p>

<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512446070">Table 1</xref>, participants were primarily female (98.8%), and most participants identified as European American (White 93.9%). Additional descriptive statistics for the study sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512446070">Table 1</xref>. Correlational analyses were also conducted with nurses who completed the tutorial to determine whether demographic variables were associated with primary study outcomes (e.g., knowledge, barriers, practices). No demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity) were significantly correlated with primary study variables. All subsequent analyses were conducted with nurses who completed the CHM tutorial and the pre-post assessments.</p>

<p>To assess the effect of treatment over control, immediate treatment nurses’ data were compared to wait-list control nurses using Time 1 and Time 2 data. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) examining immediate treatment and wait-list control nurses’ postintervention knowledge revealed a significant increase as a result of the intervention, <italic>F</italic>(1, 161) = 1,022.91, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .86. To determine the relative contribution of each session to the overall effect of the intervention, paired samples <italic>t </italic>tests were conducted for each of the 10 content sessions (i.e., sessions 1 and 12 did not deliver substantive content or include a test of knowledge).

<title>Exploratory Analyses Relating Changes in Barriers With Nurse Intended Practices</title>
<p>Because it may be important to understand the mechanisms underlying changes in intended practices resulting from interventions, we explored whether changes in perceived barriers to discussing weight-related health with students and their families predicted changes in nurses’ intended practices using linear regression analyses. Decreases in nurses’ perceived total barriers to addressing children’s weight-related health, <italic>F</italic>(1, 163) = 5.3, <italic>p</italic> = .02; β = −1.1, <italic>p</italic> = .02, and decreases in nurses’ perceived barriers related to skills for addressing student weight-related health, <italic>F</italic>(1, 163) = 9.9, <italic>p</italic> = .002; β = −1.3, <italic>p</italic> = .002, significantly predicted an increase in nurse intentions to ask about overweight youth’s engagement in physical activities (e.g., sports, sedentary behaviors).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current results indicate that an online continuing education program can improve school nurses’ knowledge about pediatric obesity assessment and treatment, decrease their perceived barriers to intervening with families, and increase their intentions to use evidence-based approaches to weight management (e.g., assessment, recommendations for treatment), and engage with students and families about weight-related health topics. Further, the content and format of the online program was acceptable to school nurses. Given the scope of the pediatric obesity epidemic, and the necessity of systems-level intervention and prevention efforts to address the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512446070">Gorin &amp; Crane, 2008</xref>), more effective methods of bringing school nurses’ considerable skills to bear are essential to ameliorating the problem. Past research has documented the vital role that systemic school-based interventions can have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512446070">Foster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512446070">French, Story, Fulkerson, &amp; Hannan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512446070">Neumark-Sztainer, French, Hannan, Story &amp; Fulkerson, 2005</xref>). Our results suggest that online education may represent an effective mechanism for enhancing school nurses’ roles in the prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity.</p>
<p>Consistent with the K-A-P process of Roger’s (2003) Diffusion of Innovations theory, CHM was designed to improve nurses’ knowledge of evidence-based practices in pediatric obesity assessment and management. In this, our results indicate that we were successful. Specifically, the results indicate that CHM was most successful in improving nurses’ knowledge of key information related to pediatric obesity (e.g., epidemiology and consequences of obesity) and evidence-based methods for addressing overweight (i.e., implementation of nutrition principles, physical activity recommendations). These gains in knowledge are noteworthy, given that school nurses have reported that they do not feel competent or prepared to address children’s weight-related health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512446070">Moyers, Bugle, &amp; Jackson, 2005</xref>). Moreover, CHM demonstrated success at improving nurses’ knowledge of MI principles applied to weight-related health. While prior interventions on improving health care professionals’ skills in addressing pediatric weight-related health (including MI skills) have focused on medical residents, pediatricians, and dietitians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512446070">Gonzalez &amp; Gilmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512446070">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>), the current investigation is the first to examine an intervention tailored to the unique training and needs of school nurses. Prior studies indicate that the majority of nurses surveyed (70–87%) reported that counseling students and their parents about weight loss is difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512446070">Moyers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512446070">Price, Desmond, Ruppert, &amp; Steltzer, 1987</xref>), further underscoring the importance of the present findings.</p>
<p>Beyond knowledge, our results also indicate significant changes in nurses’ perceptions of barriers following the intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document changes in nurses’ perceived barriers over time, resulting from an intervention on pediatric weight-related health and communicating with students and families about this topic. Of note is that nurses reported significantly lower barriers on all of the barriers’ subscales, even in areas beyond the primary focus of the intervention. For example, nurses reported significantly lower barriers on factors typically outside the immediate control of school nurses such as job-related barriers, cultural factors influencing weight and societal norms, and practices related to weight. Although the intervention program included some content related to larger systems-level issues (e.g., addressing families’ cultural values related to food and weight, joining with other professionals who are invested in addressing youth weight), it is notable that even with this limited content, nurses’ perceptions of job- and higher-level barriers were significantly lowered following the intervention.</p>
<p>Lowering nurses’ perceived barriers on multiple levels is important given prior results that nurses identify barriers on several socioecological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512446070">Moyers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512446070">Steele et al., 2011</xref>). In the current study, the largest effects were seen for knowledge and skills barriers as well as for higher level barriers such as family characteristics and societal-level phenomena (e.g., food portion sizes). As may be expected, there was a smaller effect for the decrease in nurses’ perceptions of job-related barriers (e.g., school nurse’s role in addressing obesity, perceived support, institutional characteristics). An intervention such as the one in the current study that focuses on school nurses would not be expected to immediately alter aspects of the school environment that make it difficult for nurses to address students’ weight (e.g., others’ support for addressing weight and school characteristics). Nevertheless, our findings suggest that when nurses are provided with knowledge and skills relevant to pediatric weight issues, their perceptions of barriers that prevent them from addressing weight in their students can be lowered in a wide range of areas and on multiple levels. However, our findings suggest that school nurses may benefit from additional support in their workplace for addressing obesity with students and families. For example, nurses may benefit from school-wide initiatives to address student’s weight-related health that involve multiple members of the staff and administration.</p>
<p>Our results also indicate that the intervention impacted nurses’ intended practices following participation in the online training. Specifically, nurses’ intentions to provide recommendations to families regarding diet and physical activity increased following participation in CHM. Moreover, nurses reported increased intentions to assess physical activity among the children they serve and to engage with students and their families about specific weight-related health issues (e.g., discussing families’ motivations to address their child’s weight). These findings are encouraging, considering the NASN recommendation that school nurses educate students and their families regarding nutrition and physical activity principles, identify overweight students, and implement school-based weight management services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512446070">National Association of School Nurses, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with recommendations about continuing medical education generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446070">Mazmanian, 2009</xref>), our results indicate that online education may be a cost-effective and acceptable way to enhance knowledge of pediatric obesity-specific information, as other programs have for other illnesses and conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512446070">Khatony, Nayery, Ahmadi, Haghani, &amp; Vehvilainen-Jolkunen, 2009</xref>; end-of-life issues; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512446070">Harrington Jacobs, Ferrell, Virani, &amp; Malloy, 2009</xref>). Historically, continuing education programs for school nurses have focused on disseminating information or skills that are then applied in broad universal interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512446070">National Association of School Nurses, n.d.</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512446070">Beidas and Kendall (2010)</xref> have reported that training interventions that do not address systemic–contextual factors are less likely to achieve provider behavior change. Moving forward, it may be necessary to develop CE programs that provide information in the context of ongoing resources and support for adoption of best practices.</p>
<p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, our study assessed nurses’ intended practices following completion of the tutorial but did not assess behavioral outcomes (e.g., occurrence of discussions with families about weight). Although the Diffusion of Innovations theory would suggest that the increase in knowledge and skills that nurses reported may improve their ability to implement better assessment and intervention methods for student’s weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512446070">Rogers, 2003</xref>), whether nurses’ actual practices and behaviors do, in fact, change, will need to be addressed in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446070">Mazmanian, 2009</xref>). However, previous studies of continuing education programs have demonstrated a significant association between provider intentions and empirically measured medical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512446070">Domino, Chopra, Seligman, Sullican, &amp; Quirk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512446070">Wakefield et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that nurses’ intentions are likely to translate into practice. Next, our study sample was comprised of school nurses who elected to participate in the training program, which may have led to selection bias. Specifically, nurses who were interested in pediatric weight control may have been more likely to participate. This limitation may influence the generalizability of our results. Similarly, we note relatively high rates of attrition from the study. Although reasons for attrition were not assessed, it is possible that nurses who were more committed to incorporating weight control intervention into their practice would be more likely to complete the full tutorial, producing a nonrepresentative final sample.</p>
<p>Strengths of the present study include the unique focus on training school nurses who have great potential to intervene to prevent and treat pediatric weight problems. Also, the study utilized technology to disseminate the intervention, a characteristic which has implications for intervening with underserved pediatric populations. Finally, this is the first intervention to our knowledge which provides training to school nurses on specific communication techniques (i.e., MI) to use when discussing weight-related health with students and their families.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Results from the present study demonstrate that a brief, online continuing education program using theoretically and empirically based content can increase school nurses’ knowledge, reduce perceived barriers, and engender increased intentions to intervene to promote weight-related health in schools. The results suggest that nurses find continuing education programs such as CHM to be valuable resources in their efforts to respond to the high rates of obesity currently observed in children and adolescents. Moreover, CHM fills an important professional requirement for school nurses (continuing education credits) and is, therefore, more likely to be used outside of a pure research context. Continued development and dissemination of the CHM program may be an effective measure to promote the adoption of best practices among school nursing professionals.</p>
<p>Programs such as CHM hold significant potential for improving the reach of multisystemic interventions for childhood obesity. If all health care providers (e.g., physicians, school nurses) employ best practice recommendations to address childhood obesity, children and families will receive naturally occurring multisystemic interventions for weight-related health. When providers deliver consistent weight-related health interventions, the message to the students, patients, and families becomes easy to deliver, clear, difficult to ignore, and ultimately inspires action.</p>
