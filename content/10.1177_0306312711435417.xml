<body>
<p>This is a book about infrastructure. Govind Gopakumar’s new book <italic>Transforming Urban Water Supplies in India</italic> is a welcome addition to the Routledge Contemporary South Asia Series. Gopakumar also is co-author of <italic>Water Resources</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312711435417">Raju et al., 2004</xref>). His new book is especially valuable for science and technology studies because of its empirical and analytical emphasis on what I will call here the ‘state–infrastructure’ relationship. In introducing the core topic of the book, infrastructure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312711435417">Gopakumar (2012</xref>: 1) invites nearly every discipline to the table, ranging from ‘engineers and technologists’, ‘historians, geographers, sociologists, and anthropologists’ to ‘urban technological historians’, ‘sociologists of utility networks’, urban geographers’, and ‘technology studies scholars’. And rightly so: infrastructure studies are complex and complicated precisely because they defy straightforward explanation in any particular disciplinary jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is often remote from our conscious view as citizens. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312711435417">Graham and Marvin’s (2001</xref>: 181) work, Gopakumar shows that, while infrastructures may be ‘banal constructions’ that we often take for granted, they also tell us a lot about the formation and consequence of their governance. With special emphasis on public and private partnerships to enhance or expand infrastructural development, Gopakumar draws our attention to transformations of social and material relations within the contemporary Indian nation-state and its subnational states. Overall, the book takes an historical-comparative approach, with the unit of analysis being the city. Gopakumar expertly selects three cities to compare, focusing on differing relationships between the subnational state, within which the city is embedded, and the broader Indian (federal) state. His comparisons especially attend to variations in how each city, responding to global and federal pressures, establishes public–private partnerships, thus forming urban water supply regimes. The book is delightfully dense. The author shows surprising restraint on the seemingly endless time and space that could be devoted to the study of water infrastructure in India’s long history. While the conscientious editing is appreciated, occasionally this reader would have been happy to read more, as in the case of the analysis of the literature invoked in the book, which could have been deeped.</p>
<p>The book’s case selection is smart. During the post-independence era, there has been a legacy of democratic social involvement in public matters in India. This legacy, however, is threatened by global opportunities for economic growth and supra-state pressures for change. Infrastructure, fittingly, is stuck in the middle, and India becomes an outstanding site for testing insights gathered by geographers and other scholars interested in the expansion of neoliberal forms of governance. The conceptual contribution of this book is to recognize that we can scrutinize the extent to which global regimes of neoliberal policy restructure infrastructure in highly localized episodes, episodes in which infrastructural development is depoliticized and the state’s responsibility to govern water supply is shared with non-governmental organizations and/or private market vendors (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312711435417">Gopakumar, 2012</xref>: 4, 35, 82). I was convinced, after reading the first few chapters, that India is a near perfect setting for studying how water infrastructure matters for states, both federal and sub-national. In a post-colonial period, deep democratic roots were fashioned from a doctrine of sub-national state autonomy and a federal polity; water, thus, became both a state and federal issue, as sub-national states were mainly left the task of organizing, implementing, and maintaining water supplies, water cleanliness, and so on, with modest federal oversight. India’s uniqueness and complexity notwithstanding, urban infrastructure reform in that nation also is beset by relatively low levels of urbanization, diffuse global pressures, and economic opportunities. Using a multi-method and multi-site approach, Gopakumar takes us to three metropolitan areas in three sub-national states: the city of Bengaluru in Karnataka, the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, and the city of Kochi in Kerala. Each city is carefully selected for the respective state’s differing response to reforms arising from the federal state.</p>
<p>India is a good case for state theory, and Gopakumar covers a lot of this territory in his review of the literature. Scholars in political science, sociology, and international relations have developed state theory to tackle ontological issues such as how to conceptualize the state, and empirical matters such as the role and relevance of states in global and domestic events. India is presented as both a strong and weak state; strong enough to maintain its borders and avoid decay, but weak enough that it failed to promote massive economic and social development. Even as India began fortifying its infrastructure, social interests co-opted state efforts to do so, thus, making the state increasingly ‘embedded’: too soft to enforce regulation, and overly accommodating to its many and diverse stakeholders. In this way, India was overloaded by engaging in too many endeavors and failing to delegate enough of its responsibilities to local, subnational states. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312711435417">Sinha (2005)</xref> argued, the developmental state not only suffers practically, but also conceptually, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312711435417">Gopakumar (2012</xref>:18) suggests that we must transcend ‘inherited scholarly barriers and mental containers that have prevented disaggregation of the state in critical analysis’. The problem he identifies, echoing Sinha, is that scholars studying state action overwhelmingly adopted a state-as-an-actor metaphor, as either a benevolent state aiding in the development of the country or a malevolent state preying on its people and resources. Gopakumar’s book is a reminder that states and their governance practices must be carefully conceptualized in infrastructure studies because of the long history of state entanglement in infrastructural development.</p>
<p>The empirical chapters strike a balance between historical description and comparative analysis. For example, in chapter 4, Gopakumar describes the historical and political contexts of transformation in water supply systems in the three cities he compares – Bengaluru, Kochi, and Chennai – while keeping a sharp eye fixed on infrastructure–state relationships. From these comparisons he concludes that ‘water supply regimes’ in these cities ‘vary considerably’ (p. 80). The differences are particularistic, owing to ‘a host of factors related to the particular histories of politics, institution, technology, and water resource extraction in these cities’ (p. 80). Bengaluru has a relatively provincial regime governing water supply, with relatively limited political and economic resources devoted to water supply. Chennai has a relatively autonomous regime, granting high significance to water resources, and Kochi is in between, granting water resources neither high nor low political significance. Gopakumar does not use the word ‘regime’ casually; he draws upon a particular definition for the term used in urban regime theory to describe the formation of informal coalitions called ‘regimes’, which are composed of governmental and non-governmental agents who together govern city spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312711435417">Stone, 1989</xref>). The point of emphasis in this line of research is building networks and establishing partnerships, which is why research on infrastructure tends to overlook the various types of infrastructure that different regimes produce in favor of documenting and comparing the network structure of the regimes themselves. Gopakumar begins to attend to this shortcoming in his book.</p>
<p>The second empirical chapter, chapter 5, is perhaps the most novel analysis of this topic. In that chapter, Gopakumar shows explicitly how forging partnerships transforms water supply infrastructure. His research considers an important initiative, mainly the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) ‘tenth target’, which sought ‘to cut in half by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to drinking water and basic sanitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306312711435417">UN Millennium Project, 2005</xref>). Gopakumar argues that the transformation in Indian cities toward public–private water partnerships ‘certainly emerged in response to MDG’s call for change’ although, on balance, he reminds us that India was rich with readymade fodder for such a change given ‘the country’s wider shift toward state withdrawal from social service provision and the greater decentralization pressures’ (p. 83).</p>
<p>The book is a great fit with the Routledge Contemporary South Asia Series. Compared with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312711435417">Gopakumar’s (2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312711435417">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312711435417">2011a</xref>) individual research articles on water infrastructure, <italic>Transforming Urban Water Supplies in India</italic> is a more cohesive statement on the topic and is replete with future directions for research. One of the most exciting things about this book is how it fits with research that is emerging on the state–infrastructure relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312711435417">Patrick Carroll’s (2012)</xref> recent work on water infrastructure in California pairs nicely with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312711435417">Gopakumar (2011b</xref>) recent and future research, in which he more explicitly conceptualizes states, stateness, and governmentality, unsurprisingly using some of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312711435417">Carroll’s (2006)</xref> previous research as a touch-point, as well as some of my own work that uses an actor-network model of states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312711435417">Passoth and Rowland, 2010</xref>). Science and technology studies promises to make contributions to state theory, with insights about the role of infrastructure in state formation and reformation, and state expansion and contraction. In closing, Gopakumar’s book is larger than it appears. Although the book is only 176 pages long, it makes large theoretical and empirical contributions and also should hold long-term value for those of us with an interest in state–infrastructure relations.</p>
