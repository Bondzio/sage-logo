<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies suggest that the incidence of respiratory changes in cardiac surgery postoperative patients ranges from 20% to 65%. These changes are caused by multiple factors related to cardiac surgery and general anaesthesia, including the following: sternotomy, tissue manipulation, mammary artery dissection, pleural opening, and insertion of chest drains and pain level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112443931">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112443931">2</xref></sup> In addition, the body’s physiological mechanisms may suffer complications from the surgical procedure. For example, one study found that both lung function and oxygenation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were compromised in 90% of the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112443931">3</xref></sup> These complications are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and with high postoperative financial costs. According to one source, the incidence of respiratory complications (such as pleural effusion, atelectasis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, diaphragmatic paralysis, and pneumonia) with coronary artery bypass graft surgery is now estimated at 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112443931">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The relationship between cardiac surgeries and pulmonary complications also can be explained by the fact that postoperative analgesia may improve morbidity and clinical outcomes. Because of diaphragmatic dysfunction and pain, thoracotomy induces a severe postoperative restrictive syndrome that involves ineffective cough, what leads to atelectasis and pneumonia. To avoid these complications, respiratory physiotherapy is recommended after and before cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112443931">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The presence of postoperative respiratory problems can be detected early from consistent clinical indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112443931">6</xref></sup> Some of these problems may be described as nursing diagnoses for which specific actions should be taken. Among the respiratory nursing diagnoses is ineffective airway clearance (IAC). This diagnosis is defined as the inability to remove secretions from or obstructions of the respiratory tract in order to maintain a cleared airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112443931">7</xref></sup> It is important to consider that some of the conditions that cause cough and excessive sputum, such as body position, immobility on the bed, use of sedatives, use of muscular blockers, pain, presence of tracheal tube, mechanical ventilation, pulmonary congestion, and accumulation of secretions on respiratory tract, are typical of the postoperative period of extensive surgeries, thus predisposing this population to this diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112443931">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112443931">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the establishment of nursing diagnoses is based on clinical evidence, and the use of effective clinical indicators is crucial. Thus, the importance assigned by a nurse to a particular indicator or set of indicators determines the accuracy of the diagnostic inference and influences the care plan. Accurate clinical indicators will validate a nursing diagnosis in the clinical context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112443931">9</xref></sup> Since diagnoses of human responses are the foundation of nursing care, a continuous development of critical thinking abilities in the diagnostic process is needed. A valid nursing diagnosis is essential to help people but the process of identifying the best or most accurate diagnosis is challenging because human beings are complex and unique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112443931">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>For many clinicians, accuracy should be the larger goal of the diagnostic process because diagnostics are probabilistic and clinically based, and there is always the risk of misdiagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112443931">11</xref></sup> Therefore, when researching a nursing diagnosis, the focus should be on the accuracy of clinical indicators. Based on these points, the purpose of this study was to analyse the accuracy of the clinical indicators of IAC in patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgeries and to compare the performances of these clinical indicators.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1474515112443931">
<title>Design and sample</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study was conducted in a hospital in northeastern Brazil specializing in cardiopulmonary surgeries. The required sample size was calculated based on a confidence level of 95%, sample error of 5%, and prevalence of an IAC diagnosis of 88%, according to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112443931">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112443931"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112443931">14</xref></sup> and revealed that 98 patients were required. Patients who met the following criteria were eligible to participate: (1) were at least 18 years old, (2) had been in the postoperative period less than 48 hours (the maximum period that a patient remains in the postoperative unit in the hospital where this study was developed), (3) had undergone cardiac surgery, and (4) had no obvious cognitive impairment that would preclude them from being interviewed by nurse researchers. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: (1) had undergone heart transplants or (2) had threatening comorbidities such as end-stage renal, liver, immunological, haematological, and oncological diseases. These exclusion criteria were selected because patients with these characteristics are more likely to be haemodynamically unstable. The sample was selected by convenience and the total of 98 patients required was achieved.</p>
<p>This investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board from the hospital where the study was developed. The patients provided written, informed consent before the collection of data (during the preoperative period) and were evaluated in the first 48 hours after surgery. Regarding medical information and patient identity, confidentiality was guaranteed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112443931">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>For data collection, a form composed of the defining characteristics and related factors of IAC according to NANDA-I taxonomy was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112443931">7</xref></sup> The related factors, ‘second-hand smoke’ and ‘smoke inhalation’, were not assessed, considering the non-smoking hospital environment in which the data collection was conducted.</p>
<p>Trained nurses collected clinical data from each subject based on direct assessment of the patients and review of their charts. All nurses underwent a training period during which the following issues were addressed: the nursing process, the nursing assistance of patients during the postoperative period of cardiac surgery, cardiac semiology, and the nursing diagnosis of IAC. Two evaluations were used to check for nurses’ knowledge (theoretical and practical). The results of the evaluations demonstrated adequacy levels greater than 90% for all nurses. To prevent the occurrence of bias, a standard operating procedure was developed from semiology textbooks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112443931">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112443931">16</xref></sup> In addition, operational definitions were developed for identifying each defining characteristic and related factor. A pre-test with 10 patients using the pre-established selection criteria was conducted, and it was determined that changes in the form were considered unnecessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112443931">
<title>Diagnostic inferences</title>
<p>The patients’ clinical information was analysed by three research expert nurses. The presence or absence of IAC was determined according to the majority agreement (two of the three) of the nurses’ judgments. Experts were selected using the following criteria: holds a master’s degree, has published articles about nursing diagnosis, and has written a master’s dissertation on nursing diagnosis. In addition, the availability of experts to participate in the study and their skill level for making accurate diagnostic inferences were considered.</p>
<p>Each expert examined the 98 cases individually to determine the presence or absence of IAC and its clinical indicators (defining characteristics and related factors). Then, the results of the three experts were verified, and the majority rule was utilized for identifying the presence or absence of the nursing diagnosis – that is, the diagnosis was considered present when it was identified by at least two experts. These results were compiled and analysed statistically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112443931">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using R software version 2.10.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112443931">17</xref></sup> Descriptive statistics including frequency distributions, means, standard deviations (SDs), and ranges were used to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients. The Shapiro–Wilk test was utilized to check the normality of the data. The analysis of the accuracy of the clinical indicators was based on measures of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive and negative), likelihood ratios (positive and negative), efficiency, diagnostic odds ratios, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the defining characteristics and related factors of IAC.</p>
<p>In accordance with Knottnerus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112443931">18</xref></sup> in this study, these measures are defined as follows. The sensitivity represents the probability of the presence of a defining characteristic in patients with the nursing diagnosis. The specificity represents the probability of the absence of a defining characteristic in patients without the nursing diagnosis. The predictive value of a defining characteristic, if positive, represents the probability of acquiring the nursing diagnosis in patients with this defining characteristic. If negative, this measure represents the probability of the absence of a nursing diagnosis in patients without this defining characteristic. The likelihood ratio represents the probability of the presence or absence of a defining characteristic in patients with a nursing diagnosis divided by the probability of this characteristic in patients without a nursing diagnosis. The diagnostic odds ratio represents the overall discrimination of a defining characteristic and is equivalent to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios. The efficiency represents a measure that expresses the capacity of the defining characteristic to correctly classify patients with and without the nursing diagnosis. The area under the ROC curve represents the relationship between sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) and is calculated as [(Se+Sp)/2]. The statistical significance of clinical indicators was verified by the 95% confidence interval for diagnostic odds ratio. In this case, an indicator is considered statistically significant at the 5% level when the confidence interval does not contain the value 1.</p>
<p>The four defining characteristics with the best prediction power were compared with respect to their properties of accuracy. A logistic regression model was adjusted to identify a set of indicators that better predict the occurrence of IAC. To adjust the model, the following statistics were calculated: the Wald test for each indicator individually, the Omnibus test for the complete model, and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test for a comparison of the observed frequencies in the sample and the frequencies provided for the adjusted model. The Nagelkerke coefficient was used to verify the capacity of the classification to correctly identify an individual with respect to the presence or absence of IAC.</p>

<title>Sample characteristics</title>
<p>The patients’ mean age was 56±13.4 years (range 20–88 years). Patients were predominately male (55.1%), married or cohabitating (70.4%), and 76.5% had completed 8 years of education. The clinical diagnoses identified in the sample were angina or coronary disease (37.8%), valvulopathies (36.7%), acute myocardial infarction (14.3%), and congestive heart failure (7.1%). Other types of cardiovascular problems were identified in 4.1% of the sample. Patients had undergone to the following surgeries: reconstructive surgeries – revascularization and valve repair (59.1%); substitutive surgeries – valve replacements and transplants (37.8%); and corrective surgeries – closure of the arteriosus ductus and septal defect (3.1%). From the total, 32.7% of participants were smokers. The vital signs and oxygen saturations assessed did not present central tendency values outside of normality parameters. An asymmetric distribution was identified (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the following variables: diastolic blood pressure (median 64 mmHg, <italic>p</italic>=0.002), temperature (median 36.5° C, <italic>p</italic>=0.003), and oxygen saturation (median 98%, <italic>p</italic>=0.022).</p>
<p>The clinical indicators of IAC with the highest prevalence were the following defining characteristics: excessive sputum (54.1%), adventitious breath sounds (36.7%), diminished breath sounds (34.7%), and dyspnoea (27.6%); and the following related factors: smoking (32.7%), retained secretions (15.3%), allergic airways (5.1%), infection (6.1%), excessive mucus (1%), and asthma (1%).

<p>In relation to accuracy measures, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112443931">Table 2</xref> demonstrates that only the defining characteristic adventitious breath sounds showed sensitivity values above 60%. Regarding the specificity, four defining characteristics and six related factors had specificity values above 90%. However, only the defining characteristic ineffective cough and the related factor retained secretions showed statistical significance when analysing the confidence interval for the diagnostic odds ratio (95% CI 6.85–211.15 and 11.42–1595.47, respectively). These two clinical indicators were also the only ones, among those that presented statistical significance, which showed positive predictive values above 70%. For the negative predictive value, the following four clinical indicators showed statistical significance at a level of 5% and values greater than 80%: dyspnoea, adventitious breath sounds, ineffective cough, and retained secretions. Although other indicators have shown high values for the accuracy measures, the confidence interval of the diagnostic odds ratio showed no statistical significance at the 5% level.</p>

<p>In summation, the defining characteristics dyspnoea, ineffective cough, and adventitious breath sounds and the related factor, retained secretions, were the most accurate clinical indicators. These indicators presented high specificity, high values for diagnostic odds ratio, high positive and negative likelihood ratios, and efficiency above 70%, which indicates that these indicators are effective predictors for the correct identification of IAC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112443931">Figure 1</xref> shows a performance comparison between the four indicators that showed the highest values for the area under the ROC curve. Based on the indicator dyspnoea, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112443931">Figure 1</xref> shows that the absence of adventitious respiratory sounds better predicts the absence of IAC. The clinical indicators retained secretions and ineffective cough best predict the presence of IAC when compared with dyspnoea.</p>

<p>According to the logistic regression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112443931">Table 3</xref>), a set of five indicators presented statistical significance for the prediction of IAC. Negative values of the regression coefficients (B) indicate that the presence of the indicator is related to a decreased probability of IAC. This happened for the indicators sputum, absent cough, and smoking. However, positive values of the regression coefficient indicate that the presence of the indicator leads to an increase in the probability of diagnosis. This was verified for the indicators dyspnoea and adventitious breath sounds. Thus, the probability of IAC was greater for individuals who presented with cough, dyspnoea, and adventitious breath sounds and without excessive sputum as well as for non-smokers. Omnibus and Hosmer–Lemeshow tests indicate a good fit for the model. The Nagelkerke’s <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> indicates that the model reduces the uncertainty about the presence of IAC by 63% if the indicators described above are taken into account when assessing a patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of a standardized language can contribute to more accurate nursing diagnoses as well as produce more efficient nursing interventions. According to Newman and Kohn,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112443931">19</xref></sup> diagnostic accuracy studies contribute to a specific type of evidence-based practice that aims to evaluate a clinical indicator (or diagnostic test) and use it to estimate the probability that a patient has a given nursing diagnosis. Furthermore, the contemporary role of coronary care nurses involves patient assessment and symptom management often using technology to achieve this goal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112443931">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, the prevalence of IAC was estimated in 29.6% and the most prevalent defining characteristics were adventitious breath sounds, diminished breath sounds, and sputum. Furthermore, the most prevalent related factors were smoking and retained secretions. Similarities can be found in another study performed with patients in postoperative period of revascularization in which five indicators were most prevalent: dyspnoea, tachypnoea, ineffective cough, smoking, and artificial airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112443931">14</xref></sup> Another study, performed with adult patients admitted in general hospital of São Paulo, Brazil found a higher prevalence of IAC (43%) in comparison with the current study. Similarly, the defining characteristics adventitious breath sounds, dyspnoea, and ineffective cough were predominant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112443931">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following seven clinical indicators presented statistical significance for the accurate identification of ineffective airway clearance: adventitious breath sounds, dyspnoea, sputum, absent or ineffective cough, retained secretions, and smoking. The diagnostic odds ratio was higher for ineffective cough and retained secretions. The likelihood ratios and the area under the ROC curve indicated that dyspnoea, adventitious breath sounds, ineffective cough, and retained secretions are good isolated predictors of IAC. Conversely, the retention or excessive production of secretions may aggravate airway obstruction when coughing is inefficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112443931">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the differences in statistics, the relationship between these indicators seems very strong. Other studies with similar samples also found the defining characteristic adventitious breath sounds as a critical indicator for respiratory diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112443931">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112443931">21</xref></sup> In this study, the presence of adventitious breath sounds showed a negative predictive value and high specificity, indicating that the absence of this indicator is strongly correlated to the absence of nursing diagnoses under study. The occurrence of adventitious breath sounds is related to bronchial or alveolar changes and are evidenced by crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. In the postoperative period, even after endotracheal tube removal, many patients remain on bed rest and are kept in the same position because of the presence of other devices (i.e. catheters, drains, and monitors); this immobility fosters the accumulation of pulmonary secretions and may then cause adventitious breath sounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112443931">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dyspnoea is considered to be a clinical indicator of the increased mechanical work of breathing, often produced by increased airway resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112443931">22</xref></sup> The results presented in this study indicate that dyspnoea is an indicator with high specificity (82.61), i.e. the absence of dyspnoea is related to the absence of IAC. Similar results were reported by another study with post revascularization patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112443931">14</xref></sup> which identified a significant relationship between dyspnoea and IAC. The high value of specificity of this indicator also shows that the absence of dyspnoea in the postoperative cardiac surgery patient may be related to a patent airway.</p>
<p>There is a strong relationship between cough, sputum, and the presence of retained secretions. Cough is a physiological mechanism that occurs due to the need to expel secretions or foreign bodies from the airways that can be voluntary or involuntary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112443931">13</xref></sup> The stimulation of the voluntary cough is a recommended intervention for patients recovering after surgery and is strongly related to a faster return to ventilatory status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112443931">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the clinical characteristics of postoperative patients, including immobility, effect of sedatives, and pain, may have led to the occurrence of an ineffective cough or even absence of a cough. One possible reason the ineffective cough and absent cough indicators presented high values of specificity may be related to the large number of smokers in the sample. In addition, another possible explanation is the phenomenon of pain; very frequently in the immediate postoperative period, pain significantly reduces a patient’s tolerance to exercise and can result in the reduction or avoidance of cough to expel secretions. With this, the accumulation of secretions occurs and may increase the risk of IAC.</p>
<p>Sputum is a physiological phenomenon that can occur in response to an increased blood volume in the interstitial and alveolar spaces of the lung, resulting in reactions in the airways and the production of secretions. If these secretions are retained or are excessive, cleaning the airways may become ineffective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112443931">14</xref></sup> A possible explanation for the high frequency of the clinical indicator sputum in this study is the damage of the cough reflex present in some patients. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the patients were under the influence of anaesthetics and narcotic drugs, which, when associated with pain in the postoperative period, impair lung function, facilitating the accumulation of secretions, reducing the cough reflex, and causing hypoventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112443931">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The high positive and negative predictive values show that the presence of retained secretions is a clinical indicator with powerful influence over the occurrence of IAC. The related factor retained secretions is associated with the breakdown of the physiological mechanism of airway clearance, due to specific postoperative conditions including immobility, effect of sedatives, pain, and pulmonary congestion. The patients were also undergoing anaesthesia and were taking analgesic medications – the pain of the postoperative period can lead to increased risk of less frequent, shallow breathing.</p>
<p>The pain is a factor that may influence the recovery of the patient undergoing a surgical procedure. The coughing requires vigorous contraction of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm in the presence of a surgical incision. While it is a painful procedure, the cough is essential to mobilize and eliminate the accumulated pulmonary secretions. Accordingly, secretions may accumulate and hypoventilation may occur,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112443931">23</xref></sup> which would explain the aforementioned clinical evidence of retained secretions.</p>
<p>Excessive or retained pulmonary secretions may cause several problems for the patient by increasing the labour of breathing and creating a susceptibility to infection. It is important to consider that, if these symptoms are associated with an ineffective cough, the patient may be experiencing complications. Retained secretions usually stimulate coughing; as a patient attempts to clear a secretion, the severe cough may contribute to fatigue, especially for those patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Furthermore, excess pulmonary secretions impair gas exchange, which can lead to hypoxemia, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112443931">24</xref></sup> It is important to highlight that some patients are at greater risk than others for problems with pulmonary secretions, but keeping the patient hydrated is a basic requirement for keeping airway secretions fluid and easier to clear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112443931">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Smoking is a related factor to IAC due to injury caused in the mechanism of airway clearance by the continued use of cigarettes. The harmful effects of smoking on this mechanism are: increased mucus volume, chemical and physical irritation of mucous membranes, destruction of the cilia that cover the lining of the bronchi, and accumulation of extraneous material in the airways. As for the relationship between IAC and smoking, it is important to consider that long-term smoking causes metaplasia in the respiratory tract and decreases the sensitivity of the individual to the build up of secretions, significantly reducing the effectiveness of airway clearance mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112443931">26</xref></sup> On the other hand, studies show that smoking can lead to vocal tract irritation, oedema in the vocal folds, hoarseness, coughing, increased secretions, and infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112443931">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, the ‘smoker’s cough’, usually triggered in the morning, does not necessarily result in airway clearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112443931">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112443931">28</xref></sup> Importantly, motivational interviewing has been described as effectiveness for smoking cessation in high-risk cardiovascular patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112443931">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The logistic regression results indicated that IAC is more likely to occur among non-smokers with dyspnoea, adventitious breath sounds, and ineffective or absent cough. The relation between non-smokers and IAC seems controversial, but can be explained because many patients have been smokers previously. However, the damage caused by cigarettes remains, which may explain the statistical relation found. The relation between adventitious breath sounds and ineffective or absent cough is plausible, since in these cases, the secretion exists, but is retained resulting in the presence of adventitious breath sounds.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that there are differences among the indicators of IAC as accuracy measures. Identifying patients with these indicators may be particularly important, as those patients may be most vulnerable to developing IAC. Finally, this study may be influenced by incorporation and diagnostic review bias. These biases are related to the incorporation of previous knowledge about clinical indicators into the evidence used to establish the definitive diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112443931">30</xref></sup> This type of bias is common in studies on accuracy. Thus, the measures presented in this research should be used with care.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that seven clinical indicators are related to an improved ability to correctly identify the presence of ineffective airway clearance among patients during the postoperative period of cardiac surgery. This diagnosis is more likely to occur among non-smokers with dyspnoea, adventitious breath sounds, and ineffective or absent cough who do not expel sputum. The other clinical indicators revealed no relevant measures in the identification of nursing diagnoses in patients during the postoperative period of cardiac surgery. Unfortunately, there are few studies examining the predictive power of clinical indicators on nursing diagnoses. This was one factor that made it difficult to compare these findings with those of other studies. This illustrates the significant gap in studies on nursing diagnoses.</p>
