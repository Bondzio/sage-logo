<abstract>
<p>This is a case that facilitates learning about IT-enabled change management. It tracks both the decision to convert to a $1.7 million banking enterprise system and its roll-out between 2002 and 2008. The project was met with resistance by the branches of this major nationwide bank to the point that in 2005 the project team was completely reorganized and a new Senior Vice President (SVP) position was created specifically for the project. The new system would lead to more centralization and integration with faster inter-branch processing as compared to the previous system which granted branches more autonomy in inter-bank transfers and employees only interacted with the system through data operators. Recognizing customers at the bank level and not just at branch level was an important objective. The complete project reorganization allows readers to understand the need to appreciate certain factors that may be deemed as trivial, especially where top-down IT enabled change is being implemented. At the end of the case, the project is still in progress with 818 branches (76 per cent) converted to the new system.</p>
