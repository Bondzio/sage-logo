<abstract>
<p>Two experiments examined whether framing effects, in terms of losses and gains, can be extended to student learning and grading preferences. In Experiment 1, participants rated psychology course syllabi to investigate preferences for differently framed grading systems: a loss versus gain grading system. The results showed a clear framing effect with more negative impressions of the loss grading system. Experiment 2 demonstrated that framing a grading system in terms of losses negatively influenced learning in actual psychology courses, as this group earned lower grades. This study has potential implications for decision-making theories in cognitive psychology as well as for teaching psychological courses.</p>

<p>The way a decision is framed or worded can dramatically influence decision making. If the same information is presented in two different but equivalent forms (e.g., stated negatively or positively), people’s preferences, choices, or behaviors can systemically change. Framing effects have been demonstrated in numerous areas, and generally, negative frames are judged as less favorable and have a greater impact on behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450429">Levin, Schneider, &amp; Gaeth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450429">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</xref>). Because framing effects have not been extensively examined for learning and education, the purpose of this study was to apply this decision-making concept to grading to determine whether the way in which a grading system is framed can influence students’ preferences about grading as well as their performance in psychology courses.</p>
<p>Evaluating student performance using grading is a common practice and using grades that reflect the quality of students’ work is a very important aspect of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450429">Green &amp; Emerson, 2007</xref>). Research has shown that student motivation and success are strengthened by the assignment of grades compared to the absence of grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450429">Malone, Nelson, &amp; Nelson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450429">McClure &amp; Spector, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, grading may have a significant influence on students’ learning, more than most actions of an instructor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450429">Green &amp; Emerson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628312450429">Henderson, Yerushalmi, Kuo, Heller, &amp; Heller, 2004</xref>). Despite the importance of grading, few studies have considered the effects of framing with regard to grading in education.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450429">Levin, Johnson, Russo, and Deldin (1985</xref>) examined framing effects by instructing people to rate student performance based on exam scores presented either positively (i.e., as the percentage correct) or negatively (i.e., as the percentage incorrect), and they found higher ratings of students’ performance when the exam scores were presented as the percentage correct than the percentage incorrect (i.e., the positive, gain-based, presentation of student grades led to more favorable impressions of performance). However, this study did not reveal the preferences of students, nor did it examine the potential impact it could have on the students’ performance.</p>
<p>In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450429">Smith and Smith (2009</xref>) investigated the influence of framing on students’ preferences for grading systems. They found that students had more positive impressions of a grading system that was based on a larger number of possible points than one based on fewer points (i.e., 600 vs. 100 possible points). Although both systems were fundamentally and mathematically equivalent (i.e., both dealt with the accumulation of points and percentage-wise, both systems led to the same grades), students claimed that they were different. Thus, this study showed that the way grading systems are framed, in terms of the number of possible points, can affect students’ impressions.</p>
<p>In the current study, the effects of framing on learning preferences and performance were explored. More specifically, this study focused on the framing of grades in terms of losses or gains and the impact of framing on students’ impressions and learning. For example, is it better to tell students that they earned 80 of the 100 points on an exam or that they lost 20 of the 100 points on an exam? In Experiment 1, students’ preferences for a loss versus gain grading system were directly examined using psychology course syllabi. In Experiment 2, this idea was explored further by investigating whether this framing would affect students’ performance in actual psychology courses.</p>
<sec id="section1-0098628312450429">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>The purpose of Experiment 1 was to investigate whether people had preferences for a loss or gain grading system used in psychology courses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450429">Smith and Smith (2009</xref>) speculated that a loss-based grading system can affect preferences but did not directly test this comparison. In Experiment 1, participants rated pairs of psychology syllabi that were identical except for the grading method used. Although mathematically equivalent, with a loss grading system, students start with the maximum number of points and can only lose points for incorrect answers; in contrast, with a gain grading system, students start with zero points and earn points for correct answers. Based on the effects of framing, specifically that earning points should be more appealing and losing points should not, it was hypothesized that people would prefer the courses using a gain grading system. Experiment 1 also took into account query theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450429">Johnson, Häubl, &amp; Keinan, 2007</xref>), which states that framing can influence the order in which people consider attributes. According to this explanation, reversing the query order can change the pattern of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450429">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). To control for query-order effects, the presentation order of the loss and gain conditions was counterbalanced.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Seventy-six undergraduates (57 women and 19 men, <italic>M</italic>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Two versions of the 24 fictional psychology course syllabi (two pages long and each for a different course) were created to be identical except for a change in either (a) the grading method used (critical trials) or (b) another aspect of the course, such as the required textbook/textbooks or course requirements (filler trials). For the critical trials, the syllabi differed as to whether the grading system was framed in terms of losses (i.e., starting with 100% and subtracting points) or gains (i.e., starting with 0% and accumulating points). All syllabi included a section that described the grading system. For example, a representative description for a loss grading system was “You will begin the semester with 1000 points (i.e., a 100%), and you will lose points for every wrong answer on quizzes and examinations.” The corresponding description for a gain grading system was “You will begin the semester with 0 points (i.e., a 0%), and you will gain points for every correct answer on quizzes and examinations.” All details about grading were framed in line with the grading system. The required textbook/textbooks and course requirement manipulations were used as filler trials to prevent students from knowing the purpose of the study. In total, participants made ratings for 8 different trials for syllabi with the grading system manipulation and 16 filler trials.</p>

<sec id="section5-0098628312450429">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants read and signed a consent form and were told the basic purpose and procedure of the experiment. Following this, participants were given syllabi in pairs and rated each syllabus using a 1–7 Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) for five statements: (1) “I would be very motivated as a student in this course” (i.e., one’s motivation to do well in the course), (2) “I would excel as a student in this course” (i.e., the likelihood of excelling in the course), (3) “This course seems like it would be easy” (i.e., the easiness or difficulty level of the course), (4) “This course seems like it would be very enjoyable” (i.e., how enjoyable the course would be), and (5) “I would really like to take this course as it is described” (i.e., preference for the course). The order of the syllabi pairs was randomized across participants, and the order of each syllabus within a pair was counterbalanced across participants.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>A one-way (grading condition) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for each statement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450429">Table 1</xref>). For the gain condition, participants felt they would be more motivated, <italic>F</italic>(1, 75) = 14.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<italic>

<sup>2</sup> = .115. Furthermore, participants wanted to take the courses using a gain grading system more than the identical courses using a loss grading system, <italic>F</italic>(1, 75) = 20.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<italic>
<sub>p</sub>
</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .215. This direct comparison of loss versus gain grading systems showed that framing the grading system in terms of losses can negatively influence perceptions of a course. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450429">Smith and Smith’s (2009)</xref> study, framing influenced student motivation; however, building upon their study, the findings also showed that framing impacted how well people thought they would do in the course and their preference/desire to take the course. This difference is likely due to a stronger contrast of grading systems (i.e., loss vs. gain grading systems) than in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450429">Smith and Smith’s (2009)</xref> study (i.e., grading systems only differing in the total points).</p>

<p>As stated earlier, one possible contributor to framing effects is based on query order. To examine whether query order had an effect, the framing effects for the motivation, excelling, easiness, enjoyable, and preference statements were examined for both presentation orders of the two experimental conditions. When analyzing the data with query order as an additional independent variable, the main effect of grading condition was still significant for all of the statements, but there was no main effect of query order for any of the statements, <italic>F</italic>(1, 75) = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> = .423, η<italic>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>While Experiment 1 demonstrated that the framing of grades can influence perceptions of a psychology course, it is possible that the framing effect is limited to preferences and does not influence learning. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to further explore this by examining whether the framing of grades would also affect performance in actual psychology courses. This was investigated by asking psychology instructors who were teaching two sections of Introductory Psychology (PSY 101) to frame one grading system in terms of losses and the other in terms of gains. First, it was possible that students in the loss grading condition would perform more poorly because negative frames have been shown to have a greater impact on behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450429">Levin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450429">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</xref>) and losing points could discourage students by decreasing their motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628312450429">Wang &amp; Yang, 2003</xref>). However, an alternative possibility would be that the loss grading group would perform better because students would be more motivated to avoid losing points. Finally, the third possibility would be the framing effect is limited to preferences and would not impact performance at all.</p>
<sec id="section8-0098628312450429" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0098628312450429">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Three instructors who were each teaching two different sections of Introductory Psychology (PSY 101) in the same semester were recruited. The participants were the 181 students enrolled in the six total sections taught by the three instructions (two sections per instructor).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0098628312450429" sec-type="materials">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>The instructors were asked to frame their grading system for one section from a loss perspective and for the other section from a gain perspective (the experimenter randomly assigned the grading conditions to the instructor’s sections). No specific materials were created by the experimenter for Experiment 2. Instead, the materials consisted of the classroom lectures, assignments, and exams normally used by each instructor when teaching that course. The instructors used the same course materials for both sections and were asked to teach the sections the same (i.e., same tests, assignments, lectures, class policies, etc.) except for the grading system. Furthermore, to avoid biasing the instructors toward a particular outcome, the instructors were never informed of any expectations with regard to the effects of framing the grades; the instructors were only told that it was unclear how/whether framing of the grading system would impact performance. Thus, while it was possible that instructors had their own opinions or biases about the outcome, the experimenter remained neutral to any possible outcomes when communicating with the instructors. Even if the instructors formed expectancies about the impact of grading, all instructors used objective grading for exams (i.e., multiple-choice exams scored using scantrons).</p>
<p>The instructors used syllabi that were identical except for the phrasing of the grading section. The instructors included the following phrase at the beginning of the grading section of their syllabus. For the gain section, “You will begin the semester with 0 points (0%) and you will be earning points throughout the semester on the exams and assignments listed below.” For the loss section, “You will begin the semester with XXX points (100%) and you will be losing points throughout the semester on the exams and assignments listed below” (the instructors replaced “XXX” with the total points in their class). All other statements in the syllabi related to grading were consistent with the framing of the grading system. The grading system was also reinforced through returned exams/assignments and posted grades. For the gain condition, a score of 80 of the 100 was calculated as 0 + 80 = 80 and framed as +80 points; for the loss condition, it was calculated as 100 − 20 = 80 and framed as −20 points. At the end of the semester, the instructors provided the grade data for their courses excluding identifying student information. The analyzed grade data were not adjusted or curved.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>A 2 (grading condition) × 3 (instructor) between-subjects ANOVA was conducted for the dependent variables of exam performance and overall course performance (i.e., final grade).

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Two experiments showed clear framing effects where a loss-framed grading system negatively influenced people’s perceptions of psychology courses and decreased performance in actual psychology courses. This study extends the literature on framing effects (based on loss–gain framing) to the framing of grades in education by demonstrating that loss–gain frames can have different influences on people’s perceptions and behaviors. The more favorable ratings for a gain grading system in Experiment 1 are consistent with the findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450429">Levin et al. (1985</xref>) showing that gain-framed information leads to better evaluations than loss-framed information. Additionally, the current study extends on their findings by showing that loss–gain framing can impact students’ preferences of a course. With a direct comparison of loss versus gain grading systems, the current study showed that, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450429">Smith and Smith’s (2009)</xref> study, a loss-framed grading system led to lower ratings in terms of potential motivation; however, building upon their study, the current study also showed that loss framing impacted ratings of the assumed difficulty of the course, how much they would enjoy the course, their desire to take the course, and their ability to earn a high grade. Additionally, the current study went beyond simple preferences and demonstrated that loss-framed grading can also influence students’ performance in actual psychology courses.</p>
<p>The results of the current study were consistent with theoretical explanations of framing effects. One explanation, loss aversion, states that people perceive losses as having a greater impact than equivalent gains which leads to more favorable evaluations of, and a preference for, gains compared to losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628312450429">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450429">Novemsky &amp; Kahneman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450429">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0098628312450429">1991</xref>). The findings in the current study are consistent with loss aversion because people clearly demonstrated a preference for gaining points (as opposed to losing points) and losing points caused students to perform worse in their course. A second explanation, an alternative explanation of the endowment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628312450429">Morewedge, Shu, Gilbery, &amp; Wilson, 2009</xref>), states that greater value is put on one’s own possessions than the possessions of others (i.e., the endowment effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628312450429">Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1990</xref>) because ownership causes people to associate their possessions with themselves. This could also account for the framing effects found here because for the loss-framed grading system, it is possible that students interpreted the situation to mean that they currently “own” enough points for a grade of an “A,” creating an association between the grade and the self. Consequently, when incorrect responses were made, students were not simply losing points, they were losing <italic>their</italic> points. Unfortunately, the design of the current study did not allow for a distinction to be made between loss aversion and ownership as explanations for the framing effects observed. Because of this, future studies should further explore framing effects and grading by considering ways to tease these ideas apart.</p>
<p>In addition to these explanations, it is possible that students’ familiarity with a particular grading system could explain the findings observed in the current study. While this is possible, interviews with a separate group of 10 undergraduate students were conducted to examine students’ familiarity with various grading systems. Students were asked about their familiarity/exposure to different grading systems, and while all of them had experienced courses that used strict gain grading systems, 80% of them had experienced courses that used either strict loss grading systems or a combination of gain and loss grading. Thus, a clear majority of this sample were familiar with both types of grading. In addition, all of these students reported a strong preference for a gain grading system, supporting the findings from Experiment 1. Finally, while it is possible that familiarity could affect preferences for a particular grading system, it seems unlikely that familiarity (or lack of) would lead to the performance differences seen in Experiment 2.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Findings and theories from the decision-making literature are not always applied to education, particularly when considering the best educational practices and factors that can influence students’ preferences and performance in the classroom. However, the results of the current study demonstrated that decision-making research is clearly applicable to educational practices in psychology. The framing effects investigated in this study were based on the teaching and learning of psychological concepts and theories. While it is possible that these framing effects are also true in other disciplines, some areas that use different teaching techniques, such as hands-on learning in laboratories (e.g., chemistry), or that focus on learning formulas and procedures (e.g., mathematics) may see different results. Further research should be done to explore this possibility.</p>
<p>By investigating and applying findings and theories from decision-making research to educational practices, it can help educators to understand how and why different educational practices are effective or not effective in the classroom. Specifically, the literature related to framing effects could be important for understanding how different educational practices (e.g., the framing of a grading system) can affect learning preferences and outcomes. In particular, the results of this study suggest that loss-framed grading can negatively influence students’ perceptions and performance. Based on these findings, it is recommended that psychology instructors avoid using a loss-framed grading system because students may view losses as disheartening, reducing their ability to perform well on both exams and in the course in general. Additionally, it is recommended that psychology instructors frame all syllabus information related to grading in terms of gains, and they should also avoid giving students feedback using loss-framed grades (e.g., writing the number of points lost/missed on exams or assignments). Instructors should focus on the positive (i.e., earning points) to improve students’ perceptions of the course and to increase student performance.</p>
