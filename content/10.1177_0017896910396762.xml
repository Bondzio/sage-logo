<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To assess the basic knowledge about HIV and AIDS among young South Africans in the Capricorn District of Limpopo Province, South Africa.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: A questionnaire-based cohort study, involving data collection from senior high school students.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Randomly selected high schools in the Capricorn District, Limpopo Province, South Africa.</p>
<p><bold>Method</bold>: Following university research and ethics approvals and permissions from government officials and school principals, consent forms were completed by systematically selected students and their parents or guardians.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. In 2008, national prevalence among antenatal attendees was estimated at 28 per cent and for the Limpopo Province it was 18.5 per cent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896910396762">1</xref></sup>. In the same report, 10.9 per cent prevalence among those 2 years and older and 8.7 per cent among youths (15–24 years) were estimated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896910396762">1</xref></sup>. Also, a prevalence of 10.6 per cent among adolescents in a peri-urban community population has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896910396762">2</xref></sup>. In Africa, HIV is spread primarily through unprotected sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896910396762">3</xref></sup>, and recognizing that prevention of new infections is an important step towards eradicating the disease, preventive measures such as distribution of free condoms have been in place in South Africa for many years. In addition, government and non-governmental organizations have engaged in high-level awareness campaigns. Furthermore, aspects of HIV/AIDS have been formally introduced into the primary and high school curricula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896910396762">4</xref></sup>. As part of the preventive strategies, there is a need to regularly assess the knowledge of the various segments of the society about the condition.</p>
<sec id="section2-0017896910396762">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most seriously affected region in the global AIDS pandemic, and is home to 22.4 million (67 per cent) of all people living with HIV and 72 per cent of AIDS-related deaths in 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896910396762">5</xref></sup>. The number of children living with HIV increased from 1.5 million in 2001 to 2.5 million in 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896910396762">6</xref></sup>. An estimated 5.7 million South Africans were living with HIV in 2007, although HIV data from antenatal clinics in the country have suggested the stabilization of the pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896910396762">5</xref></sup>. The prevalence was reported to decline among young men and women from 10.3 per cent in 2005 to 8.6 per cent in 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896910396762">7</xref></sup>; however, a prevalence of 32.8 per cent of infection was reported in 2007 among adults admitted to a surgical unit in South West Township (SOWETO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896910396762">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Young adults were specifically targeted for this study because they are a high-risk group and an important target group for prevention. In 2008, UNAIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896910396762">6</xref></sup> reported that young people accounted for 45 per cent of new HIV infections. For prevention and early diagnosis, it is essential for people living in the endemic areas of HIV/AIDS to have knowledge of the basic aspects of the condition. These include modes of transmission, symptoms, co-infections, where and who to consult for diagnosis, etc. The modes of transmission of the HI virus in many parts of the world include unprotected sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896910396762">3</xref></sup>, direct contact with infected blood, most often by drug injectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896910396762">9</xref></sup>, mother-to-child transmission either during pregnancy, birth or postnatally via breastfeeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896910396762">10</xref></sup> and via blood transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910396762">11</xref></sup>. Over 60 symptoms have been associated with HIV/AIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896910396762">12</xref></sup> and tuberculosis is a major co-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910396762">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In South Africa, discrimination experiences and internalized AIDS stigma are common, leading to post-traumatic disorder and depression among people living with HIV/AIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896910396762">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896910396762">15</xref></sup>. These are related to misconceptions about to the disease. There is, therefore, a need for every segment of the population to have knowledge of the realities of the disease in order to reduce the misconception and associated social attitudes. A continuous evaluation of knowledge of the basics of HIV and AIDS is considered necessary in order to establish the impact of the efforts being made by the government and non-governmental organizations in reducing the burden of the disease. The aim of the study, therefore, was to establish the basic knowledge of HIV/AIDS among young South Africans in the Capricorn District of the Limpopo Province.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section4-0017896910396762">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>A questionnaire containing fixed-choice and open ended questions was used to collect data on demographic of participants and basic information about HIV and AIDS. The latter included but was not limited to modes of transmission, symptoms, diagnosis and co-morbidities. Prior to distribution, the questionnaire was piloted on 20 students in a high school that was not included in the study and necessary revisions were made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0017896910396762">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>High schools in the Capricorn District, Limpopo Province were targeted for the study because that was the location of the researchers. According to the list obtained from the Department of Education, the district had 317 high schools at the time of the study. A systematic sampling procedure was used to select 18 (5.7 per cent) of these for the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0017896910396762">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The University of Limpopo research and ethics committee granted ethical approval. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the provincial department of education and the principals of the schools. Students were systematically selected for the study from the class registers of grades 10–12 and were given consent forms to be signed by them and their parents or guardians. Over a period of one month, copies of the questionnaires were distributed to selected students in their classrooms after school hours. The questions were read and clarified to the participants before completion, and the participants were assured of confidentiality and anonymity. The questionnaires were collected the same day after completion by each group of students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0017896910396762">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data for result presentation as range, means and standard deviations. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to model the scores on each of the dependent variables.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-0017896910396762">
<title>Demography</title>
<p>Two-thousand, six-hundred and fifty-nine (87 per cent) of the 3070 selected participants completed the questionnaire. Their ages ranged from 14 to 28 years, with a mean of 18 ± 2 and just over half (53 per cent) were females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0017896910396762">
<title>Basics</title>
<p>Many respondents (1692, 64 per cent) knew what the acronym HIV stands for and 66 per cent knew what AIDS stands for. Only 887 (34 per cent) knew the difference between HIV positive and HIV negative results. Many (86 per cent) agreed that it is important to know one’s HIV status; however, only 6 percent could explain why one should know his or her HIV status. Only two (0.1 per cent) of the participants, both in grade 12 could accurately define the term ‘window period’ in HIV testing. Over half (55 per cent) of the respondents knew that the first effect of HIV on the body is to suppress the immune system. Less than a quarter (25 per cent) agreed that immune suppression as a result of HIV infection can result in tuberculosis. Forty per cent agreed that HIV/AIDS can cause skin cancer and 40 per cent agreed that HIV/AIDS could cause pneumonia. Many (61 per cent) agreed that it may take many years before any sign of HIV/AIDS shows. About half (51 per cent) of the respondents agreed that a general medical practitioner can be consulted for HIV diagnosis, 93.4 per cent agreed that this can be done at hospitals. Many (66 per cent) indicated that the traditional healer could not be consulted for diagnosis.</p>
<p>Responses to the questions on modes of transmission are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896910396762">Table 1</xref> and responses to the questions on symptoms of HIV/AIDS are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896910396762">Table 2</xref>. Although females appeared to have more knowledge than males, the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Quantitative studies have their inherent limitations, which may manifest in this study. However, they are recognized to have a key role to play in the development of new knowledge, generating questions and hypotheses that could form basis for further research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896910396762">16</xref></sup>. This study is of significance in providing information that could be beneficial to the ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention and management programmes. Also, findings could form the basis for further research on the knowledge of HIV/AIDS among similar age groups, which is critical in the eradication of the deadly disease.</p>
<p>Generally, the ages of students from grade 10–12 should be 15–18 years; the exceptional ones who were 14 years old in this study probably started school earlier and those who were over 18 years probably started school late, repeated some classes or had taken some time off for reasons such as pregnancy and child delivery. For these various reasons, it is common to find students over 20 years of age in high schools in rural areas of the province.</p>
<p>The poorest performance (0.1 per cent) was in the definition of the term ‘window period’. This was lower than the 25 per cent previously reported in the province<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896910396762">17</xref></sup>. Although this term is not specifically indicated in the schools curricula, it is should have been taught as part of the diagnosis process. It is possible that this was not the case. That only 34 per cent could explain the difference between HIV positive and HIV negative results and only 6 per cent knew the reason why one should know his or her HIV status testifies to the poor knowledge among this population. Although the 66 per cent and 64 per cent recorded for AIDS and HIV acronyms, respectively, were higher than the 51 per cent and 20 per cent recorded in Delhi, India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896910396762">18</xref></sup>, and also the 61 per cent that a person can live for many years before showing any sign of developing physical changes attributable to HIV/AIDS are higher than the 34 per cent reported in Iran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896910396762">19</xref></sup>; these responses are still considered poor and disappointing because of the extensive awareness campaign in the country and the inclusion of HIV/AIDS in the schools curricula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896910396762">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The performance on the modes of transmission was the highest of all the areas assessed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896910396762">Table 1</xref>). The 63 per cent response that HIV could be transmitted from the mother to child during preg- nancy was higher than 6 per cent reported in KwaZulu-Natal Province<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896910396762">20</xref></sup>. Also, the 86 per cent for unprotected sex being a mode of transmission was greater than the 78 per cent reported in Ukraine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896910396762">21</xref></sup>. Also, the 64 per cent who agreed that sharing needles among drug users is a mode of HIV transmission, is greater than the 33 per cent reported by Magnani <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896910396762">20</xref></sup> and the 71 per cent response that a person can get HIV through blood transfusion was greater than the 23 per cent reported in Delhi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896910396762">18</xref></sup> for the same question. In spite of these, the knowledge of the participants is still reckoned to be poor considering the massive awareness campaign and other intervention programmes that have been going on in the country for several years. The responses on the symptoms of HIV/AIDS were also poor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896910396762">Table 2</xref>). Although the 60 per cent recorded for diarrhoea, was higher than the 41 per cent reported at Chitwan District, Nepal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896910396762">22</xref></sup>, a better performance was expected here in view of the very high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the country and the extensive educational efforts being made by various sectors.</p>
<p>Although the responses on the diagnosis of HIV ranged from 51 per cent for the general practitioner to 93 per cent for hospital, the knowledge level is still considered poor. One would expect all the participants to know that a general practitioner could be consulted for diagnosis and that HIV diagnosis could be done at hospitals. Many (66 per cent) of the respondents knew that one cannot check HIV status with traditional healers. This is of interest because the majority of those in the rural areas consult the traditional healers for most of their ailments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896910396762">23</xref></sup> and a significant percentage of the participants in this study were from high schools located in the rural areas.</p>
<p>This study reveals insufficient knowledge of the basics of HIV/AIDS among the participants. With the massive awareness campaign by the government and non-governmental organizations and the inclusion of information on HIV and AIDS in the schools curricula in South Africa, better knowledge was expected than exhibited by the respondents. Findings therefore, suggest that there is a need for more HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns in the Limpopo Province, South Africa.</p>
