<p>The present volume consists of discussions on the issue of canon in antiquity, presenting essays alongside short, lively responses. Due to spatial limitations, this review will group several chapters together into broadly corresponding categories.</p>
<p>In the first essay, McDonald defines various critical terms to be explored throughout the volume (e.g., canon). He argues that ‘considerable time elapsed before there was general agreement on the fringe areas of . . . biblical canon’ (p. 10). Similarly, Charlesworth suggests that the terminology ‘proto-canon’ be introduced into scholarly discourse on the issue of canon (p. 56). With respect to Qumran, Charlesworth demonstrates that the Qumranites copied and altered their texts so that the meaning revealed to them became obvious (p. 51). Elledge examines the genre of rewritten scripture and establishes five criteria (pp. 93–95) for adjudicating scriptural status among the genre at Qumran, concluding that ‘the Qumran community still regarded a number of rewritings as scripture’ (p. 95). Penner has written a fine essay on citation formulae as indices to canonicity (pp. 62–84). Many other essays, likewise, take up the issue of citations in relation to the issue of canon. Although the volume has been careful to avoid anachronistically using modern definitions of canon when reading ancient texts (pp. 16–20), it seems that the same is not true for citations. Citation is never clearly defined. There is no mention of recent discussions of citation practices in antiquity (e.g., see the work of C. Stanley or D.-A. Koch).</p>
<p>Several essays mention Jude’s citation of the pseudepigraphical 1 Enoch (pp. 15, 57, 62, 64, 75, 79, 85, 147). Thus, it was wise of the editors to include an entire essay devoted to this problem passage (pp. 113–20). In that essay, Hultin notes that Jude’s use of 1 Enoch was appealed to in support of Enochic literature and, conversely, as a reason to reject the Epistle of Jude from consideration within the Christian canon (pp. 113, 118). While Evan’s title ‘The Pseudepigrapha and the New Testament’ suggests that the essay will discuss (some) pseudepigraphical literature, this is simply not the case. In fact, Evans’ essay is mainly concerned to demonstrate that Israel’s scriptures provide a more fertile backdrop for the NT than various Greek (e.g., Homer) or Latin (e.g., Vergil) texts. Fair enough. However, one wonders why the author or the editors of this volume kept the essay under the present title.</p>
<p>Two essays are concerned with so-called apocryphal texts. Shoemaker laments that Christian apocryphal literature has essentially been defined as failed scriptures (p. 153–54) and shows that such a designation does not work for the Marian apocrypha (p. 159). Lee’s essay explores the remembrance, reinterpretation, and re-enactment of the transfiguration within the Acts of Peter, arguing that there is a ‘dynamic relationship between the scriptures and their interpreting community’ (p. 197).</p>
<p>Generally, the authors provide balanced and informed views that seek to respect the ancient interpretive context(s) where and when issues of a settled canon had not yet been firmly established. In that respect, this volume, particularly McDonald’s lead essay, deserve careful attention by those interested in the question of canon within Jewish and/or Christian studies.</p>

<body>
<p>Several of Don Cupitt’s recent books have had the character of a final statement or last testament, but have proved not to be so, for two reasons. First, his books represent staging posts in his own spiritual biography ; indeed one third of his references in <italic>The Fountain</italic> are to his own books. Second, he is more a philosopher than a theologian, who constantly needs to reconsider, restate, and revise his position on fundamental questions of human existence. Thus, another third of his references in <italic>The Fountain</italic> are to works of notable philosophers; and only one single reference is to a theologian.</p>
<p><italic>The Fountain</italic> is clearly and engagingly written in a manner which invites the reader to eavesdrop on an intimate personal exploration. Its fundamental thesis is that making sense of human experience has to face and accept transience and death head-on, in contrast to traditional Abrahamic religions which, he claims, promote unrealistic escape from these by offering certainties and life after death.</p>
<p>A Fountain is presented as the ideal symbol of transience; alternative or complementary to his symbolic use of the Sun, representing self-giving love and authentic positive ethical living. For Cupitt, human spiritual development is complete when an individual lives fully and generously in the present moment, which he identifies as energetic Spinozism or ‘solar’ ethics.</p>
<p>Much of this book consolidates or develops ideas and arguments from Cupitt’s previous books. Although he maintains his anti-realist stance in relation to God, he acknowledges the importance of the idea of God in leading human spiritual, linguistic, and cultural development. Although he rejects Christian doctrinal claims about the divinity of Jesus, he asserts the significance of Jesus as teacher and prophet of the Kingdom, which for him is ethical or ‘solar’ living in community. While recognising that language and reason define and constrain existence, Cupitt insists that these should not be split from emotions, which he claims are key to authentic living and acting.</p>
<p>Who will read this book? Certainly, those who belong to the Sea of Faith network and those who have read Cupitt’s other books. <italic>The Fountain</italic> is unlikely to appeal to committed Christians (like myself), critical academics, or convinced Atheists. Rather, it will speak to those who cannot subscribe to doctrinal and moral sources of dogmatic authority, and yet seek a credible but faithless spirituality which makes sense in a secular age. Nevertheless, sandwiched somewhere between Humanism and Buddhism, these people will doubtless find it difficult to turn theory into practice.</p>

<p>In only 95 pages of main text we have here a short but densely packed history and survey of overseas mission (chiefly Anglican), and some theological commentary on key issues of Anglican ecclesiology. Power is identified as a key recurring underlying issue. En route it includes reference to contemporary debates and divisions about sexuality and ordination. Post-colonialism, post-modern deconstruction of scripture, and globalisation form a general backdrop to the discussion.</p>
<p>It is a tall order to combine all this in such a short space. The double focus of mission and ecclesiology, inseparable as they might be, sets a broad agenda that is difficult to cover satisfactorily. It also raises complex theoretical issues about the relationship between the two. There is an attempt to deal with this through a clear commitment to David Bosch’s classic statement of <italic>Missio Dei</italic>, suitably nuanced in the light of recent criticisms. This provides some overall theological coherence and direction to the discussion. Even so, the tension between ‘a mission put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity’ (as Bosch himself puts it), and a commitment to ecclesiological significance, is not really resolved, certainly not in any new way. Similarly, while the issue of power is given some brief orientation in scriptural priorities and discourse analysis, there is no real theological development of the issue. Space does not permit.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the issues raised are well chosen, judicious, and well researched. There is a rich range of historical data, summaries of key church documents, theological comment. It is brought together in a mostly narrative discussion which will provide a useful resource for students of both mission and Anglican ecclesiology. Michael Doe guides the reader through this material with the authority of personal experience and commitment. His former role as General Secretary of the USPG is evident throughout, and clearly steers the material at some points - but this is openly acknowledged and adds authenticity rather than detracts from the discussion and overall argument. His willingness explicitly to locate specific contentious issues of current debate and disunity within this overall topography of mission and ecclesiology also adds sharpness and integrity to the discussion.</p>
<p>In the end, having considered the various histories and meanings of mission, inculturation, and translation, his preferred models for the church are hospitality, communion, and unity in diversity. These may not be original, but they are well worth restating. That the author does so with such a broad mixture of historical overview, theological referencing, biography, and even the occasional homiletic aside may frustrate some – but it will surely stimulate others.</p>

<p>The preface to this excellent book opens by noting that while there are a number of highly useful translations of apocryphal literature, original language versions of these texts are often difficult to track down. It is the purpose of this volume to assemble the original language texts of various apocryphal gospels extant in Greek, Latin, or Coptic. In thirty-seven sections, more than forty Gospel texts are presented, that survive either complete, in fragmentary form, or through citation in other works. The texts are arranged under four main headings: ‘Infancy Gospels’; ‘Ministry Gospels’; ‘Sayings Gospels and Agrapha’; and ‘Passion, Resurrection, and Post-Resurrection Gospels’. Ehrman and Pleše have sensibly not attempted to edit new critical editions of each text, to have done so would probably have meant they would both have gone to their graves with this being an unfinished work! Instead they have taken the best critical texts currently available, and then alongside these printed original language texts have undertaken the task of preparing fresh translations and introductions. The result is not only an eminently usable edition of the apocryphal gospels, but this is also an incredibly powerful research tool. It will be used in graduate classes, both for practising translation and discussing these fascinating texts, it will be consulted by scholars who wish to find highly reliable versions of non-canonical gospels, and it will be of value to the specialist in the area of apocryphal gospels as the most complete collection of apocryphal gospel texts.</p>
<p>As with all compendia of texts, some critical judgments concerning which texts to include had to be made. Ehrman and Pleše outline their choice in the following manner: ‘we wanted to include everything that a graduate student or scholar working on the apocryphal gospels would need or want access to, with one major proviso: since the Nag Hammadi Library is readily available we have not included the Coptic texts’ (p. viii). Yet there is a further proviso that states because of their importance the Gospels of Thomas and Mary are also included. However, the Coptic Gospel of the Saviour is not included because a critical edition is awaiting publication. Taking the first text in the collection, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, as an example of the presentation and handling of material, there is a five-page introduction with accompanying bibliography. This outlines the highly complex textual issues that surround the different forms of this text. Although noting the longer version that they publish is probably not the original form, the editors justify this decision on the basis that ‘a case can be made that a fuller version rather than some kind of posited “original” is of greater interest’ (p. 5). Yet readers are provided with helpful references to the more detailed discussions about the growth and evolution of this text. Also the editors discuss the possible purpose of this text, which to moderm sensibilities is a bizarre text with a capricious Jesus slaying various of his playmates who annoy him. Next follows the Greek text with brief text-critical notes, and a facing English translation with notes concerning possible biblical references or other significant features. This general format is adopted for the majority of texts throughout the volume.</p>
<p>This is a superb book, which in many ways does something that no other collection has attempted since Tischendorf’s <italic>Evangelica Apocrypha</italic> (1853). Given the volume of manuscript discoveries since that date, a collection such as this is long overdue and finally places in the hands of scholars and students alike an essential and vital reference tool. This is a necessary addition to the shelves of everybody interested in gospel traditions, and the developments in early Christianity.</p>

<p>Robert Fyall is Senior Tutor of the Scottish Cornhill Training Course for preachers. He acknowledges the ‘terrifying privilege’ of teaching God’s word, but succeeds well in providing models of exposition for the imaginatively paired and ‘rewarding but too often neglected’ books of Ezra and Haggai. As to be expected from the <italic>Bible Speaks Today</italic> series, a conservative evangelical approach is used throughout to bring relevant and contemporary insight and application from a careful reading of the text.</p>
<p>In a reader-friendly style and lightness of expository touch Fyall draws out the key themes from Ezra of God’s presence with his people and a focus on worship and scripture. He emphasises the purposes of God, the preservation of His people, and the promise of his guidance as the underlying message of the book. He compares the bleakness of the post-exilic world to which the Jewish people returned from exile, with the post-Christian West. Avoiding the perils of ‘legalism and laxity’, they, like us today, are encouraged to look beyond their immediate circumstances, and to shine in dark places, awaiting the dawning of a brighter light, the coming of the Messiah.</p>
<p>His approach to Haggai is equally judicious, avoiding the temptation to mine chapter 1 alone for a ‘sermon for the church fabric restoration fund’, and preferring to overview the context, commission and content of the prophetic word for its own time and today. Though often overshadowed by his contemporary Zechariah, Haggai brings a challenging call to see the progressive fulfilment of prophecy, blending rebuke and encouragement, vision and practical advice, and a call for courage and confidence in God.</p>
<p>The twelve expositions from Ezra and six from Haggai combine a thoughtful and encouraging series of reflections for Christians for whom ‘the temptation to give up or fall away is abundant’ and the ‘timely and timeless message’ of encouragement in difficult times resonates from return from exile until today.</p>
<p>How should we evaluate the book? Several volumes of the BST series have now emerged, with their blend of ‘careful exegesis and relevant exposition’. Some, like Christopher Wright’s <italic>Ezekiel</italic>, have used the commentary format to present new theological and missiological proposals. Fyall references Brueggemann’s work but does not engage further with his interpretive agenda. For this Messianic Jewish reader a wider missiological framework and a focus on the renewed interest in the Moses-like stature of Ezra within the Jewish tradition, as transmitter of the Oral Law, would have enhanced the reading. Nevertheless, Fyall has well achieved the series aims of providing a readable exposition of the texts relevant to contemporary life. He provides a helpful half-way point for those not able to spend sufficient time doing their own exegesis, interpretation and application of the texts, or wishing to find examples of good exposition they can commend to others. For readers of <italic>ET</italic>, here is a useful resource for the development of good preachers and good preaching, especially their own!</p>

<p>Frederick J. Gaiser, professor of Old Testament at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota brings exegetical rigor, pastoral questions, and cross-cultural perspectives to bear in <italic>Healing in the Bible: Theological Insight for Christian Ministry</italic>. Convening a cross-section of texts on healing, Gaiser develops a ‘conversational inquiry’ (p. 4) with nine OT texts, six NT texts and one Apocraphal text in utilizing a case-study approach whereby exegetical nuances and thematic considerations are interpolated. Through his experience of teaching in Zimbabwe, Gaiser provides a refreshing willingness to dialogue with non-western systems of healing and disease etiologies which challenge the Enlightenment worldview but remain ‘much closer to the world of the Bible than are the assumptions and perspectives of the modern West’ (p. 3). Raising questions of existential and practical value for individuals and local church communities, Gaiser explores a myriad of central issues such as the relationship between healing and prayer; the intersection between scientific medicine and God’s healing; the correlation between sin and sickness; the importance of the community in healing; healing in biblical theology; and healing under the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>While African stories and Lutheran theology enliven the book, Gaiser does not stray far from his bread and butter – biblical exegesis. The selection of Old Testament texts is adequately diverse with three Psalms (Ps. 6, 38, 77), five historical narratives (Exodus 15:22-27, Numbers 21:4-9, 2 Kings 20:1-11, 2 Kings 5:1-27, 1 Samuel 1:1-2:10) and one prophetic text (Isaiah 53:4-5) that each receives a chapter. The New Testament texts are skewed towards the Gospel narratives with five healing pericopes of Jesus (Mark 9:14-19; John 9:1-41; Mark 5:21-43; Luke 17:11-19; Mark 2:1-12) receiving attention alongside Acts 3. The book’s eighteen chapters make the omission of any substantial treatment of the epistles in the healing practices of the early church (e.g. James 5:13-18) or any relevant Pauline passage slightly surprising.</p>
<p>Gaiser emphasizes that God’s healing encompasses both science and miracles but also occurs through the apparently ‘common’ ministries of the church body – through Word and Sacrament. Biblical healing is experienced as <italic>shalom</italic> and occurs holistically within the covenant community (‘my healing is never mine alone’, p. 244). In highlighting the radical monotheism of ancient Israel and the centrality of Jesus in the New Testament, Gaiser lives comfortably with the paradox that both healing and sickness ultimately derive from God (‘demons are for casting out’, p. 148) although divine wrath, personal and communal sins, other powers, and living in a post-Genesis 3 world may all ‘contribute to illness’ (p. 242).</p>
<p>Although the strength of the book resides in Gaiser’s close reading of the selected pericopes and his theologically attentive exegesis, the overall decision to utilize a case-study of selected texts often makes the book read less as an organic whole and more like a series of unrelated exegetical texts under the general heading of healing. Moreover, while the subtitle promises <italic>theological insight for Christian ministry</italic>, scant attention is paid to the local church (though see p. 114-116) and profound ministerial questions are sometimes lost in the exegetical forest of chiastic structures and literary <italic>inclusios</italic>. Nevertheless, Gaiser’s theological reflections stemming from careful exegesis are often profound and genuinely insightful.</p>

<p>Martha Himmelfarb’s <italic>The Apocalypse</italic> is a new addition to the Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion Series. This title, though, masks both the breadth and depth of this valuable book. First, the book is not solely focused upon the Apocalypse, i.e., the Book of Revelation, but covers apocalyptic literature more broadly. Second, despite its being ‘brief,’ it still manages to discuss a significant range chronologically, though, it is shifted slightly toward the ancient period—of its eight chapters, five cover antiquity while the remaining three cover late antiquity, Byzantine and the Modern Era.</p>
<p>The first chapter, ‘Revelation in the Age of the Torah,’ lays out the necessary historical context for understanding the beginnings of apocalyptic literature. The second chapter focuses upon one of the most ancient examples of the genre, The Book of Watchers. Himmelfarb notes the long-lasting influence of the Watchers traditions saying, ‘The story of the descent of the watchers goes on to play a significant role in a wide range of literature in antiquity,’ adding, ‘…ascent becomes a central mode of receiving revelation in Jewish and Christian literature into the Middle Ages’ (p. 30).</p>
<p>The Book of Daniel is the topic of the third chapter. Being the only apocalypse in the Hebrew Bible, it plays a central role in the development of the genre, especially in afterlife traditions. The next two chapters are thematic rather than textual. Chapter four examines the ‘heavenly messiah,’ while chapter five covers, ‘The Heavenly Temple, the Fate of Souls after Death, and Cosmology.’ These two chapters examine a huge range of apocalyptic texts, 4 Ezra, the Book of Revelation, 2 Baruch to name just a few.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter moves the discussion forward chronologically into late antiquity by focusing on Hekhalot literature and later Christian apocalypses such as the Apocalypse of Peter. The seventh chapter moves to the Byzantine period with a focus on the theme of eschatology. As in the previous chapter, both Jewish (e.g., Sefer Zerubbabel) and Christian (e.g., The Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius) writings are discussed.</p>
<p>The final chapter brings us to the modern era and examines how modern religious movements have continued to use apocalypses and apocalyptic thought. Some of the movements discussed include the Branch Davidians, Seventh-Day Adventists, and Habad Hasidism. The appropriation of apocalyptic ideas by some modern movements has led to disastrous results. So, Himmelfarb ends with a cautionary note that derives directly from the wisdom of the apocalypses, ‘…the arrival of the eschaton is the task of God, not of human beings, even human beings who have become the equals of the angels’ (p. 160).</p>
<p>In sum, this book covers a significant amount of history with an emphasis in antiquity. It examines both Jewish and Christian material. In keeping with its series, this book is accessible to the non-specialist, providing an understanding of the apocalyptic genre. And, despite its lack of notes and bibliography, there are insightful comments throughout such that the book is a valuable reference and potentially a textbook for specialists and teachers.</p>

<article-title>Book Review: Athanasius … Again?: Peter J. Leithart, <italic>Athanasius</italic> (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker, 2011. $27.99/£16.99. pp. 224. ISBN: 978-0-8010-3942-3)</article-title>

<p>Athanasius seems to be <italic>en vogue</italic>. This year saw the publication of three major works on the famous bishop of Alexandria: the German ‘Athanasius-Handbuch’ by Peter Gemeinhardt, David M. Gwynn’s ‘Athanasius: Bishop, Theologian, Ascetic, Father’, and a monograph by Peter J. Leithart simply entitled ‘Athanasius’. While each work has its own merit, Leithart’s book certainly sticks out. At the very least, it is the only book on Athanasius known to me in which theologians like Karl Barth and Karl Rahner feature just as prominently as Constantine.</p>
<p>Leithart’s work forms the first title of the newly established ‘Foundations of Theological Exegesis and Christian Spirituality’ series, which aims at recovering patristic exegesis and interpretation for contemporary theology and spirituality. What may seem a rather classical objective at first, proves to be a groundbreaking project. ‘Doctrine, after all, is the outcome of biblical interpretation.’ When I read this line in the book’s preface, I could almost hear the great Adolf von Harnack turn in his grave. No doubt about it: modern church historians tend to see dogma detached from Scripture. Accordingly, they consider Athanasius as a representative of so-called hellenized faith and above all as a political figure in the fourth-century battle for orthodoxy. Malicious tongues would even describe the Church Father as a ruthless bully furthering his own ambition. Not that his exegesis of Scripture would never come into focus, but if so, the attempt usually is to assign to it its due place in the history of doctrine.</p>
<p>Rather than analyzing Athanasius’ scriptural exegesis in the context of his own time, Leithart tries to demonstrate its value for <italic>contemporary</italic> theology. Whether or not one finds this attempt convincing in the end is, as always, up to the reader. In any case, it remains a truly pioneering act, which once more raises the crucial question whether patristic theology has a value beyond mere historiography.</p>

<p>The commentary series, BECNT and NICNT, in many ways have quite similar aims. Both approach scripture as the Word of God; both are rooted in evangelical protestant traditions; both seek to provide a degree of scholarly depth for a wide audience, including pastors, students and scholars. BECNT privileges pastors among its target audience slightly more than does NICNT. However, McCartney’s and McKnight’s commentaries are apparently independent of each other: McCartney is not listed in McKnight’s bibliography or index. The two commentaries also prove sufficiently different to reward comparison.</p>
<p>For McCartney, it is of central importance to respond to Luther’s notorious disgust at James, which he called an ‘epistle of straw’, since he found in it too much on works, too little on faith, and nothing quite as Pauline as he was by persuasion. McCartney points out that most Reformers, indeed ‘most of the church throughout its history’, have not followed Luther in this. He states as the thesis of his own commentary that ‘James should be seen as a book about true faith as opposed to a false one’ (p. 2). McKnight too aims to demonstrate that ‘the more uncomfortable Christians are with James in a Luther-like way, the less they really understand Paul’ (p. 3). His primary concern, however, lies in interpreting James ‘in the light of James’ (p. 1), and he deflects attention from Pauline theology by depicting James as ‘a “wiki” version’ of Jesus’ story and sayings (pp. 8, 27). With this analogy he seeks to capture the character of James’ discourse, which alludes to or emulates rather than cites Jesus, and which is to be seen as a personal voice in conversation with many others.</p>
<p>Both commentaries have substantial introductions. McCartney’s has sections on the ‘Character’ of the epistle (pp. 3-8); ‘Authorship and Date’ (pp. 8-32); ‘Original Recipients and Occasion’ (pp. 32-38); ‘Text’ (p. 39); ‘Genre and Purpose’ (pp. 39-44); ‘Old Testament Connections’ (pp. 44-45); ‘Relation to Extrabiblical Jewish Wisdom Literature’ (pp. 45-48); ‘James as the Wisdom of Jesus’ (pp. 49-52); ‘James and 1 Peter’ (pp. 52-53); ‘Was James a Reaction to Paul (or Later Paulinism)?’ (pp. 53-56); ‘Controlling Theme: Genuine Faith’ (pp. 56-57); ‘Structure’ (pp. 58-67); ‘Theology’ (pp. 67-76). McKnight’s divisions are rather fewer: after a general introduction (pp. 1-4), he treats ‘James as Story’ (pp. 4-13); then discusses authorship (pp. 13-38); themes (pp. 39-47), and structure (pp. 47-55). Corresponding to his more extensive subdivision, McCartney’s approach is systematic and comprehensive, while McKnight attempts to engage his audience through a more colloquial style in creative, narrative interaction with a range of debates. McCartney is a more traditional historical critic; McKnight’s interest in ‘the Bible as Story’ adds a relatively fresh dimension to commentary on James, but one which would be more helpful if the approach itself were discussed and defended (cf. p. 2). R. W. Wall is cited as the chief predecessor here. The commentaries are organised according to slightly different analyses of the structure of James, and McCartney devotes more space to arguing for his analysis of the structure; McKnight tends rather to reticence on this issue, underscoring that ‘we would be wise not to rest too much interpretive weight on any structural proposal’ (p. 49). By contrast with the introductory material, in the exegetical sections, it is McKnight who tends to provide the fuller discussion, while McCartney continues to supply concise, learned, measured comment.</p>
<p>The appearance of these two commentaries within two years of each other is a mark of the growing interest in James in the last few decades. In 2006-2008 alone at least four new commentaries on this epistle were published. With McCartney and McKnight, the discussion is further broadened.</p>

<p>Karl Barth’s theology has long suffered from criticisms of otherworldliness, a lack of concreteness, and the subordination of ethics and ethical questions to issues of doctrine. Such criticisms are not entirely unfair. It was Barth who once described sin as ethics and original sin as having a Ph.D. in ethics. Yet while Barth could be highly critical of any form of untheological ethics or an ethics that made its conclusions apart from the grace of God and the command of God revealed in Jesus Christ, ethics has always been central to Barth’s dogmatic work. This volume of essays edited by Daniel Migliore reveals in Barth a theologian for whom dogmatics and ethics were one inseparable enterprise. From beginning to end, Barth’s theology includes an active obedient and free human response grounded in the free grace of God in Jesus Christ, and this ethical response is a necessary ingredient of the Christian life. The essays, most of which were originally presented as lectures at the Third Annual Karl Barth Conference (2008) at Princeton Theological Seminary, all attempt to address central ethical issues in Barth’s <italic>Dogmatics</italic>. Most of the essays do so, in Migliore’s words, more by their theological and moral reflection on Barth’s theological ethics rather than moving directly toward concrete decisions and courses of action (p. 25). That said, more than half of the essays concern a specific ethical problem, just war, economic issues, crime and punishment, or democratic principles, and engage Barth’s ethical deliberations from multiple perspectives. The other half of the essays seek to give a broader orientation and critique of Barth’s own theological ethics.</p>
<p>After the introductory essay by Migliore, the book is organized by an essay on a particular topic followed by a related response. Nigel Biggar revisits his earlier work on Barth’s ethics and believes Barth should have developed a deeper moral Christology in which Christ’s ethical significance cannot be reduced to his suffering or his non-violent endurance. Eric Gregory, in addition to responding to Biggar’s appreciative critique, offers his own engagement with Protestant Thomism and Barth’s ethics. This pattern of presentation and response continues throughout, and concludes with an essay by Paul Nimmo on the theological ontology of Barth’s ethics and a related essay by Jesse Couenhoven on the relationships between divine freedom and human freedom in Barth’s theology and ethics. These particular issues are of interest as they represent a new and recent direction in the field of Barth studies. Such an assessment could also apply to the whole collection of the essays. Far from being a timeless system, Karl Barth’s theology and theological ethics are as relevant today as ever and this collection of essays offers more than enough fruitful insight to support such a claim. While all of these essays demonstrate the inseparable relationship between theology and ethics in Barth’s dogmatics, the role of the Christian community is largely assumed or marginalized in the essays’ attempt to move directly from theology to ethics. That quibble aside, this collection of essays, held together splendidly by Migliore’s opening essay, offers a bold, fresh, and innovative engagement with Karl Barth’s theological ethics.</p>

<p>David Neil Mosser, the editor and complier of this book, describes it in his introduction as a means of repairing the ‘homiletical isolation’ experienced by many preachers who do not have the opportunity or the time to meet with others to discuss their sermons or plan a pattern of preaching for their congregations. The main body of the book consists of sections for each Sunday of the church’s year, with a sermon of about a thousand words based on one of the readings from the <italic>Revised Common Lectionary</italic>, notes on the other two readings, and suggested sermon-series, each covering from two to four Sundays, on a variety of subjects. This last covers such topics as Advent and Christmas, the Trinity, Baptism, Communion and Defining Relationships, as well as on biblical themes such as Proverbs, Romans and Great Prayers of the Bible. In addition aids to worship are added, such as calls to worship, offertory prayers and benedictions. The contributors are mostly from the American United Methodist Church but include others from Baptist, United Church of Christ and Presbyterian churches. The book is accompanied by a CD, which, in addition to the text of the printed book, contains a series of other prayers, a number of classical and contemporary affirmations of faith, a classic sermon (George Whitfield’s ‘On Method of Grace’), an annotated bibliography and the scriptural texts from the <italic>Revised Common Lectionary</italic> in the New Revised Standard version.</p>
<p>Within the covers of this book and the CD which comes with it, there is a huge range of material, designed to help the preacher in preparing sermons. The vital questions about such a work, however, is ‘Does it help?’ As a preacher, I approached this book with a certain degree of scepticism. The congregation in which I serve is liberal, modernist-catholic Scottish Episcopalian and its style of worship and of the sermons preached is different from those represented here. I found, however, that I was quite wrong. In preparing for a number of services in the Sundays after Pentecost, I read over the material provided and, although not tempted to reproduce the sermons provided (and plagiarism is a practice which is not recommended by the editor), I did indeed find that seeing how others in traditions quite different from mine had handled the same texts was stimulating to a degree I had not expected. There were some difficulties: in particular, the contributions did not provide assistance with the whole of the readings from the <italic>Revised Common Lectionary</italic>, since they related only to the ‘continuous’ series of Old Testament lessons with nothing on those in the ‘thematic’ series (which, as it happens, is the series we are using this year); and I would have liked something on the psalms set each Sunday. The range and scope of what is included, however, provides something for everyone, and this preacher at least, felt befriended.</p>

<p>More than twenty-five years ago, Hughes Oliphant Old set out to provide a history of preaching in the life of the church from the first century to the present. Volume 7, <italic>Our Own Time</italic> is the seventh and final instalment in this series, covering the breadth of preaching in the past century. Professor Old gives attention to modern day preaching and preachers, spanning all ecclesial bodies from one end of the globe to the other. In the preface to the book, Old mentions the challenges of writing a history of preaching in his own time, and while his treatment of certain individuals may be a bit uneven in places, he is to be commended for seeing this magisterial project through to the end. He is also to be commended for trying to give equal voice to the history of preaching and worship in Africa, Asia, and South America, even where resources are scant.</p>
<p>Beyond these general commendations, the strengths of this book are the breadth and global reach of Old’s research. Reading this collection gives one a sense of the great preachers and Christian leaders of the twentieth century in every corner of the globe. For many, the book serves as a good introduction to preachers and churches in Latin America, Asia, and Africa largely unknown to Western Christians. Old is a master at describing the centrality of preaching and articulating the claims of the gospel in each cultural context and in each particular religious tradition. From New York City to Appalachia, from Los Angeles to Nairobi, from Seoul to San Salvador, though style, language, and cultural context are radically different, Old’s presentation brings continuity and catholicity to the proclamation of the gospel in our time.</p>
<p>Old’s work is not beyond some criticisms. Not all subjects are treated equally. For some, no sermons are available, only a general history. For others, Old’s own ideological preferences insert themselves too deeply into his description and cloud his engagement with the subjects and their sermons. Old’s selection process is difficult to determine, a self-evident problem in a volume this expansive, especially one dealing with contemporary figures. Old acknowledges this challenge but one can surely still quibble with him about who is left out. There is no mention of Rick Warren or Bill Hybels or the phenomenon of Joel Osteen, though that may have more to do with the fact that they are more recent arrivals to the mega-church scene than those Old depicts. Desmond Tutu, however, would surely have a place in 20<sup>th</sup> century preaching, especially as demonstration of faithful resistance to the powers and principalities. And preaching is not everything. Perhaps one of the most influential living preachers in America is Eugene Peterson. Peterson has been able to wield influence across the ecclesial spectrum not through his sermons, but through his larger theological writings. How does one account for that in the preaching life of the church in our time? In spite of these reservations, this volume is an unparalleled and rich resource for our own time, and it is the foundational reference for future surveys of preaching and worship.</p>

<p>Did Jesus see himself as the temple? Many scholars would be skeptical of this possibility and few have pursued such a paradigm for understanding Jesus. Despite the lack of previous proponents, Perrin does not shy away from advancing the claim that Jesus considered himself and his movement to be the embodiment of the divine eschatological temple.</p>
<p>After a substantial introduction, the book is organized into five chapters. The first chapter reviews the evidence for two counter-temple movements that predated or were contemporaneous with the life of Jesus: the Qumran group and the <italic>Psalms of Solomon</italic> sect. For both communities, the roles which had belonged to the Jerusalem temple were no longer valid because of the pervasive corruption among its priesthood. Perrin then contends that John the Baptist likewise sought to establish a counter-temple movement. His group rejected the legitimacy of the Jerusalem priesthood, believed the temple system to be defiled, and consequently viewed its estrangement from the temple as a sign of Israel’s tribulation.</p>
<p>The second chapter looks at the early Church as a counter-temple movement. Perrin first reviews the <italic>Didache</italic> and <italic>Barnabas</italic> before discussing many relevant NT passages. Where the early Christians differed from their pre-Christian predecessors was in the conviction that the messiah had already come. Christians thus believed that a redemptive-historical shift was already in effect.</p>
<p>Jesus’ action in the temple is examined in the third chapter. Scholars have tended to see this event as either carrying eschatological significance or being directed solely against the priestly organization. Perrin wishes to avoid this dichotomy, opting to see both components as part of Jesus’ motivation. Jesus was addressing two fundamental questions with the temple action: ‘Who legitimately speaks for the temple?’ and ‘What does it mean to be the temple?’ (p. 112). Much of his opposition to the priestly leadership was based on their perpetuation of economic injustice, especially against Israel’s poor.</p>
<p>Chapter four explores the precise nature of Jesus’ concern for the poor. The stories of the rich man who asks Jesus about eternal life and the anointing at Bethany provide the framework (Mark 10:17-22; 14:3-7). They indicate that Jesus and his followers adopted a lifestyle of poverty and ministry to the poor. This was grounded in ‘Jesus’ conviction that God was about to do something to remediate Israel’s systemic failure’ (p. 145). The final chapter examines how Jesus’ healings, exorcisms, and table fellowship practices might illuminate an understanding of Jesus as temple. Perrin suggests that these were “public signs that he had reconstituted time, space, and a people around himself, the new convergence of heaven and earth, the new temple” (p. 179).</p>
<p>There is much to ponder in this study. Perrin has offered a novel proposal and, to his credit, he invites others to pursue these ideas further to determine their merit. The provocative and challenging nature of this book, combined with its carefully crafted arguments, demands that others give it due consideration.</p>

<p>Over the last two decades or so, the old myth that Karl Barth’s radically Christological vision for theology overwhelms or even occludes the possibility of human agency and therefore neglects any meaningful basis for theological ethics has been thoroughly dispelled. Having established that ethics is always present in Barth’s theological actualism (hence, dogmatics <italic>is</italic> ethics), the opportunity has now opened to shift attention away from defending Barth as a moral thinker and towards the task of setting him to work more precisely as a theological ethicist who can contribute to wider discussions on ethics and morality: in other words, it is now a case of doing <italic>ethics with Barth</italic>.</p>
<p>Two key issues distinguish this book by Matthew Rose, Arthur J. Ennis Fellow in the Humanities at Villanova University, from the ever-growing mass of Barth-related literature. First, Rose breaks convention by concentrating on the neglected territory of the final part of the third volume of the <italic>Church Dogmatics</italic>, the ethics of the doctrine of creation. This provides Rose with a different version of Barth’s ethics in which Barth seems to evince a form of eudaimonism, and thus reveals a surprisingly positive vision of creation and created nature. And secondly, Rose considers Barth’s ethics of creation from a Roman Catholic perspective on morality. <italic>Ethics with Barth</italic> is thus something of a ‘Balthasarian’ reading of Barth’s theology, but provides the careful attention to ethics that was missing from Balthasar’s work on Barth.</p>
<p>Rose’s argument unfolds neatly and persuasively. After the introductory chapter, the book falls into two parts. Part One provides a close reading of Barth’s views on God, creation and anthropology, and how each relates to ethics. Part Two turns more directly to ethical matters and seeks to describe and parse the liturgical character of human existence; amongst others, Rose considers the divine command, Barth’s account of the good life, and his treatment of sin and evil. Finally, the Epilogue (where Rose is most constructive) tests the critical relation between Barth’s theological ethics and the moral philosophical tradition.</p>
<p>Perhaps more could have been said, however, on the relation between Barth’s understanding of ethics and the specifically Roman Catholic practices and habits of moral formation. And having examined evil as Nothingness and Barth’s three-fold treatment of sin as pride, sloth and falsehood (the latter of which Rose renders as ‘stupidity’, which really fails to capture the deceit implied by the German <italic>Lüge</italic>), it would have been fascinating to then introduce Barth’s heavily politicized account of the lordless powers to complete this ethical reading of evil. Despite these minor issues, <italic>Ethics with Barth</italic> is still a constructive engagement with Barth’s theological ethics, and nevertheless betrays a rich and sensitive level of insight into not only the third volume of the <italic>Dogmatics</italic> and Barth’s principal advocates and critics but also much of the classical Western tradition on metaphysics and morals.</p>

<p>A vexing issue that has caused much scholarly debate is the textual history of The Community Rule (Serekh ha-Yah.ad or S). Alison Schofield offers a new, broader model for reading S that accounts for the diverse history behind the text. A summary of her proposal consists of reading the ‘S versions as sharing a common core of material but reconstructs them as primarily diverging traditions without the unwarranted assumption that a limited group of scribes at Qumran developed all the S traditions’ (p. 7). In order to prove this hypothetical construction, she divides her method into five chapters.</p>
<p>The first chapter gives an overview of some of the problems arising out of the use of the terms ‘sect’ or ‘sectarian.’ Schofield favours the term Yah.ad or ‘movement’ over the loaded term ‘sect,’ which, in her view, is anachronistic and burdened with Christian connotations (p. 31). Schofield approaches the issue of who may have belonged to the Yah.ad by applying the model of social anthropologist Robert Redfield concerning ‘great and little traditions’; a concept which attempts to explain community formation within complex societies. Using this matrix, Schofield concludes that the Yah.ad could not be limited to the Qumran community, but rather was a religious group that ‘radiated out from codifying centers of the hierarchical, ‘reflective’ few to the periphery’ (p. 67), which she calls a ‘redial-dialogic model.’</p>
<p>Schofield turns next to textual transmission and to the dating of the S scrolls. She is sceptical of the recent attempts to relate the scrolls chronologically. By following the palaeographic dates of the copies, she does not assume that the short manuscripts were abridged from 1QS for personal use, but does allow that 1QS may have been the official Qumran copy, ‘which would explain why it alone of the S versions was wrapped in linen and stored with care in a jar in Cave l’ (p. 130). She concludes that S was composed by the Jerusalem elite, who sent it to the outlying areas; a view which supports her redial-dialogic model.</p>
<p>In chapter three Schofield attempts to test her hypothesis against terminology and rhetoric outside of S. She argues that the self-identifying terms used in the S tradition cannot be identified exclusively with the group who resided at Qumran. As support for her view, she states that the term ‘the Many’ describes ‘the gathering of all fully-fellowshipped members for judicial purposes’ (p. 146) and cannot be limited to those who lived at Qumran. She concludes that the scrolls’ use of identification terminology and the application of the penal code reflect a situation in which closely related communities had contact with each other but belonged to different locales.</p>
<p>Chapter four introduces other historical sources that are relevant to her study of the Qumran community. Schofield understands these classical texts as painting a general picture that ‘fits the theory that the Yah.ad was a broad and diverse group, which shared textual and legal traditions’ (p. 218). The final chapter covers archaeological evidence which, according to Schofield, indicates that Qumran was not as isolated from outside trends and trades as some scholars have previously contended. She concludes that the Qumran inhabitants maintained close ties to Jericho, Ein Feshkha, Jerusalem and other communities, thus opening the possibility that these places may have been inhabited by members of the Yah.ad.</p>
<p>The Qumran texts are frequently messy and inconclusive, and Schofield does not attempt to make sense of all the information, but rather looks for data to support her hypothesis. In my view, Schofield’s work is carefully argued. Her proposed theory for how the S material reflected a ‘radial-dialogic’ model is attractive. This paradigm offers a broader perspective for reading S and an interesting way of thinking about community formation presented in the Qumran scrolls. There are a few areas worth mentioning. I agree with John Collins (West Coast Working Group 2011 Meeting) that chapter 1 could have been strengthened by a close reading of 1QSa concerning the council of the community. Also, after reading the book, I felt that the issue of what purpose(s) S may have served in the community as it was read and reread was not considered adequately in this volume. In sum, this book represents advancement to the understanding of The Community Rule and will be consulted by many who are interested in Qumran studies.</p>
