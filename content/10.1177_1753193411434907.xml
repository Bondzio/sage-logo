<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Compression of the superficial branch of the radial nerve (SBRN) as it passes from beneath the musculo-tendinous junction of the brachioradialis (BR) and the tendon of extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) was described by Wartenberg in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411434907">1932</xref>, after whom the syndrome is named. The anatomy of the SBRN has been extensively described along with its more common variants.</p>
<p>We report the case of a 28-year-old female with signs and symptoms consistent with a SBRN compression, who underwent operative decompression. Intra-operatively it was noted that the main part of the SBRN travelled in its usual place deep to the BR before emerging from under the tendon 6 cm above the radial styloid. At this level there was a condensation of the deep fascia passing in a transverse direction between the ECRL and BR. Another, smaller, nerve was noted to emerge 3 cm proximal to this point from between two leaves of the tendon of the BR. This smaller nerve joined the SBRN where it emerged between the BR and ECRL and ran distally with it. Proximal dissection of this smaller nerve revealed that it passed through the BR tendon and pursued an entirely intra-muscular course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411434907">Figures 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411434907">2</xref>). Its source was not determined as it lay proximal to the surgical field.</p>

A radiograph, three months after injury, showed DIP joint subluxation caused by an avulsion fracture of the base of the distal phalanx. (b) This demonstrates the DIP joint traction started one week before fixation. (c) A K-wire passed to the palmar side was used for reduction, and a hook plate fixed the fragment. The percutaneous K-wire, placed for the DIP joint traction, was maintained during surgery. (d) The K-wire was removed five weeks after surgery. (e) A radiograph, about one year after the surgery, showed that the congruency of the DIP joint was satisfactory.</p></caption>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411434907">Robson et al. (2008)</xref> found that the SBRN emerged from beneath the BR 8.3 cm (±1.1) above the radial styloid. In the 25 cadaver limbs they studied they found one anomalous anatomical variant where the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm innervated the radial dorsum of the thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411434907">Robson et al., 2008</xref>). In a similar cadaveric study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411434907">Ikiz and Ucerler (2004)</xref> found that the SBRN emerged from beneath the BR on average 9.3 cm proximal to the radial styloid.</p>
<p>In 1994 Turkof described an anatomical variation, in which the SBRN emerges from under the fascia between two slips of a split BR tendon. This variation was found in five of 150 dissected arms (3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411434907">Turkof et al., 1994</xref>). This study was followed up with a retrospective clinical review where this variation in the BR tendon was noted in seven of 143 patients (5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411434907">Turkof et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>While variation in the branching pattern of the SBRN following its emergence from beneath the BR is common, the site of emergence is reasonably consistent at 8–9 cm proximal to the radial styloid. In this case the nerve emerged more distally at 6 cm proximal to the styloid. Also, we have not previously seen a description of this anomalous intra-muscular branch joining the SBRN.</p>
