<abstract>
<p>Developing and implementing the modified ketogenic diet (MKD), an alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet (KD), proved to be a clinical and family-centered care success for the outpatient and ultimately the inpatient program at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. Initially introduced as an option in the outpatient program, the need for the MKD treatment was soon identified in the inpatient setting as well. To ensure consistent and appropriate care for the children receiving the MKD, an inpatient clinical pathway was developed and adopted as standard of care. This included the development of a standard MKD menu for the hospital. Use of the name <italic>modified ketogenic diet</italic> versus <italic>modified Atkins diet</italic><sup><italic>®</italic></sup> was adopted to differentiate it from the KD and avoid possible confusion regarding the diet for weight management. An observational study of Connecticut Children’s MKD outcomes demonstrates effectiveness similar to the KD diet. Out of 36 patients completing the MKD, 56% experienced ≤50% to 100% seizure reduction. Of this 56%, 17% were seizure free, and 39% had ³50% to 90% seizure reduction. Connecticut Children’s outcomes support the MKD as a viable nutrition option for pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. Two case studies are presented to provide support and additional treatment modalities for use in clinical practice for registered dietitians initiating the MKD.</p>

<p>Connecticut Children’s Medical Center is the only free-standing academic children’s hospital in the state of Connecticut. It opened in 1996 and is accredited by the Joint Commission. Connecticut Children’s is a 187-bed facility with approximately 6800 admissions reported in 2010. The hospital is nationally ranked in 3 specialties areas, and there are currently more than 200 clinical trials in progress. Connecticut Children’s is a premier provider for state-of-the-art care for children from birth to 18 years and includes 4 satellite specialty care centers and 12 community practice locations.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“The majority of people with epilepsy effectively control their seizures with medications, yet approximately 20% to 30% remain refractory to antiepileptic drugs.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The neurology department care team consists of 6 pediatric neurologists, 4 neurology nurse specialists, and an EEG center. The ketogenic diet (KD) center works collaboratively with the neurology care team and the clinical nutrition department. There is 1 designated part-time (8 hours per week) registered dietitian (RD) for the KD center.</p>
<p>Two medical nutrition therapies, the classic KD and the modified KD (MKD) are offered at Connecticut Children’s for treating children with drug-resistant epilepsy. The low-glycemic-index diet developed by a keto team at Mass General Hospital for Children, is also shown to be effective, but it is not a treatment option offered by the team at this time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412451319">1</xref></sup> The classic evidence-based KD has been offered as a treatment intervention at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412451319">2</xref></sup> To date, 150 patients have opted to initiate the KD as a treatment option. The second treatment option, the MKD, was adapted from the modified Atkins diet<sup>®</sup> (MAD) developed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412451319">3</xref></sup> and implemented at Connecticut Children’s in 2007.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1920s, epilepsy treatment consisted of starvation/fasting and a limited arsenal of medications to successfully control seizures. The KD, developed in the 1920 to 1930s, focused on high-fat, low-carbohydrate meals to shift metabolism to fat for the treatment of seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412451319">4</xref></sup> Although effective, the KD was abandoned with the discovery of newer antiepileptic drugs. The majority of people with epilepsy effectively control their seizures with medications, yet approximately 20% to 30% remain refractory to antiepileptic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412451319">5</xref></sup> For those with refractory epilepsy, who have failed to achieve seizure control with numerous medication trials, the KD is a viable therapy for seizure control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412451319">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mayo Clinic physician researcher, Wilder, provided his starved epileptic patients with a diet of excess fat and low carbohydrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412451319">4</xref></sup> He discovered ketones in their blood and urine and the term <italic>ketogenic diet</italic> was coined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412451319">4</xref></sup> His study on a few patients in 1921 was the first recognized use of the KD as a treatment for epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412451319">4</xref></sup> Another central contributor to KD research was Peterman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412451319">6</xref></sup> who first described the classic KD. The research diet defined a ratio of macronutrients for children of 1 g of protein per kilogram of body weight and 10 to 15 g of carbohydrate per day, with the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman’s research with this macronutrient distribution proved to be an excellent intervention. Of 37 children who were prescribed this diet, 95% had improved seizure control, and 60% became seizure free.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412451319">6</xref></sup> Additional positive effects from the diet included improved alertness, behavior, and sleep. Negative side effects were documented to include vomiting and nausea caused by excess ketosis. The diet continued to be widely used and studied until the introduction of phenytoin (Dilantin<sup>®</sup>) and the focus of research shifted to developing new drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412451319">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 1960s brought the discovery that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produced more ketones per unit of energy than dietary ketones from long-chain triglycerides. MCTs are also more readily absorbed and transported directly to the liver. The classic KD with severe carbohydrate restrictions made it difficult to produce palatable meals for children. Huttenlocher, in 1971, modified the classic KD with 60% of fat from a MCT oil, more protein, and up to 3 times as much carbohydrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412451319">8</xref></sup> Meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. Seizure control was similar to the classical KD. The only significant side effect was gastrointestinal symptoms. Many hospitals, including Connecticut Children’s, used the MCT diet or a combination of the two.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412451319">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1970s, sodium valproate (Depakote<sup>®</sup>) was developed along with other medications. Neurologists had effective treatments for a broad range of seizure types and syndromes. The use of the KD and MCT oil diet was limited to refractory cases and declined further in popularity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412451319">7</xref></sup> After more than 20 years as a last line of treatment, the diet experienced a resurgence of interest when Jim Abraham’s son was treated successfully with the KD at Johns Hopkins hospital. Familiar with the media as a Hollywood producer, Jim Abrahams created the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research. Out of his interest and support, the movie <italic>First Do no Harm</italic> starring Meryl Streep was filmed and released. It brought the topic to the media forefront. The Charlie Foundation launched a media surge to educate the public on the potentials of the diet, and the flood gates were opened for parents to try this forgotten treatment for epilepsy. A multicenter prospective study was published in 1998, and an explosion of scientific interest in the diet followed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412451319">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first randomized KD control study was published in 2008 and enrolled 145 children, half selected randomly to start the KD and the other half to start after a 3-month delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412451319">10</xref></sup> The children who received the delayed treatment acted as a control group for 3 months because epilepsy is a medical condition where patients may get better or worse regardless of treatment. In the diet group, 38% had at least 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, 7% had at least a 90% reduction, and 1 child became seizure free.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412451319">10</xref></sup> Only 6% of the control group experienced a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Research since that time has consistently supported the KD as an effective treatment for epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412451319">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412451319">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412451319">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although KD efficacy is well documented, the barriers include the following: limited access to expert centers with long wait times for education, hospital admission required for diet initiation with a fast period, strict provision of food volumes/choices, growth issues, side effects/complications, compliance, disruption of family meal dynamics, specialized equipment, and cost. These barriers limited access to the KD treatment for many patients. Preliminary research published in 2003 by Dr Kossoff at Johns Hopkins supported the use of the MAD as an effective alternative to the KD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412451319">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412451319">12</xref></sup> Funding supplied by the Dr Robert C. Atkins Foundation allowed for further research to validate this treatment; 1 study by Kossoff using the MAD in 9 children showed a modest response of 36% with a &gt;50% seizure reduction, and 21% remained seizure free.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451319">13</xref></sup> In the subsequent 8 years, the MAD has continued to be studied and results consistently show that efficacy of the MAD compared with the KD is quite similar for the treatment of epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412451319">14</xref></sup> In addition to similar efficacy results, the MAD has many additional benefits that make it more appealing for families to consider as a treatment option versus the strict KD, which most families would never attempt.</p>
<p>Further benefits for choosing the MAD over the KD include the following: outpatient initiation versus hospital admission, more variety and flexibility of meals, gram scale not required, less dietitian support needed, bigger portions, and more normal family mealtimes than the KD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451319">13</xref></sup> The Connecticut Children’s Ketogenic Center sought to develop a program using the MAD, allowing access to the diet as a treatment option for more families. Connecticut Children’s actively adopted and modified the MAD program in the summer of 2007.</p>
<p>The MAD mimics the KD in diet composition without calorie, protein, or fluid restriction and has a lower overall ketogenic ratio (1:1 vs 3:1 or 4:1 on the KD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451319">13</xref></sup> At Connecticut Children’s Ketogenic Center, the MAD carbohydrate prescription is initially limited to 10 g/d in children and 15 to 20 g/d in adolescents. For children, new research indicates that the diet prescription can be increased to 20 g of carbohydrates per day after a month, based on the effect on seizure control and tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412451319">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The MAD, as it is known today, originated from the traditional Atkins<sup>®</sup> diet, a weight reduction plan that is very low in carbohydrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412451319">3</xref></sup> The MAD also incorporates the higher fat content of the KD without significant restrictions. To represent the Connecticut Children’s program version, the Ketogenic Center has further refined the MAD by changing the name to <italic>modified ketogenic diet</italic>. The rationale for the name selection was to avoid the Atkins<sup>®</sup> diet association with weight loss, which is not the goal of MKD therapy.</p>
<p>The MKD can be effectively and safely initiated as an outpatient treatment therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451319">13</xref></sup> Once medical nutritional therapy is recommended by a neurologist or requested by the family, the nurse and the dietitian meet with the family for an initial assessment. They review the strengths and weaknesses of both the KD and the MKD and determine the most appropriate option for the patient and family dynamics. Current literature has supported certain disease states that can be treated more effectively with the KD versus the MKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412451319">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412451319">3</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>If the KD treatment is appropriate, the patient is scheduled for a 3-day admission. Staffing allows for 1 KD inpatient admission per month. If the MKD is more appropriate, the parent is scheduled for the MKD education session. Held on a monthly basis, this 2-hour MKD education session accommodates up to 3 patients and their families. This procedure allows multiple patients to start the diet within a month, giving access to the limited dietitian support. Offering the MKD has eliminated the need for a waiting list for patients requesting nutrition therapy as a treatment option. Connecticut Children’s can initiate 3 patients on the MKD versus 1 on the KD per month. Furthermore, it provides a built-in support system among families attending the MKD session together—an added benefit for the families and the KD center staff.</p>
<p>Once the MKD is selected for therapy, an MKD checklist must be completed before the diet can be implemented. The MKD checklist includes the following: blood work (prediet); obtaining prescribed vitamins, minerals, supplements, and Ketostixs<sup>®</sup>; current EEG (within past year); 3-month commitment to program; and transition to zero/lowest carbohydrate-containing medications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1941406412451319">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1941406412451319-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>During the MKD education session, families are taught label reading, carbohydrate counting, and low-carbohydrate recipes; shown meal samples; given information about Web sites for low-carbohydrate products and online support groups; and provided with free foods and guidelines for illness, hypoglycemia, and dehydration. Individual time is spent with each family reviewing menu selections; ideas to incorporate fat into the meals; ideas to prevent constipation, along with other supportive suggestions; and advice for living on a low-carbohydrate diet. Particular attention is given to teaching about balancing the allotted grams of carbohydrates, along with adequate fat grams at each meal and snack. Low-carbohydrate vegetable consumption is encouraged to provide additional nutrients and fiber to aid in the prevention of constipation. Additional education is provided for specific family concerns.</p>
<p>Although the MKD had been offered as an outpatient therapy for 3 years, the diet had not been available as an inpatient treatment option. An inpatient with intractable seizures was prescribed the MKD by the patient’s neurologist as the last available therapy option. No protocol existed to implement the MKD for inpatients at Connecticut Children’s. A challenge ensued for the dietitians, nutrition staff, foodservice company, and multidisciplinary staff with implementing the diet. Out of this experience, the need to develop a MKD pathway for inpatient therapy was identified.</p>
<p>The first major task was the development of a MKD inpatient menu. This was a multidisciplinary project between the foodservice company, diet technicians, ketogenic RD, and floor dietitians. The finalized menu was trialed and approved by a modified ketogenic family advisory committee, consisting of 3 families that each had children on the diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1941406412451319">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1941406412451319" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>Modified Keto Menu.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1941406412451319-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The second undertaking was to develop a multidisciplinary clinical treatment pathway for the MKD inpatient initiation. The KD team proceeded to develop the MKD pathway using their established KD inpatient pathway as a framework. Once completed, the Clinical Council, consisting of a multidisciplinary, hospital representative group, reviewed and approved the inpatient MKD treatment pathway. Educational in-services were provided to key stake holders in direct patient care and foodservice providers. The inpatient MKD pathway provides daily standard of care for treatments, IVs, medications, nursing care, nutrition, activity, child and family support, patient and family teaching, and discharge planning. The MKD pathway has 2 outcome measures: (1) Does the patient tolerate the MKD by day 3? and (2) Are the educational goals met by day 3? Variances to these 2 outcome measures are recorded and tracked for improvement of care. The MKD pathway is revised and officially updated every 2 years. The MKD pathway has allowed consistent clinical care across multidisciplinary teams and improved the quality of care provided to our MKD patients. The pathway has also prepared Connecticut Children’s for any emergent MKD patients that may require this treatment option if medications have been exhausted and seizures are intractable.</p>
<p>Along with establishing the pathway, the ketogenic team has implemented the KD and MKD alert system in our ordering and admission process. When a KD or MKD patient is admitted or in the emergency room, the system prompts a page to the inpatient RDs, neurology RNs, and pharmacy to alert them of their admission. This alert system has significantly decreased medical errors in ordering diets and medications. Appropriate menus, foods, medications, and IVs can be ordered safely and effectively as a result of training staff on the pathway and the alert system. A Chex<sup>®</sup> teaching module was also developed to educate RNs, pharmacy staff, RDs, and DTRs annually on the KD and MKD.</p>
<p>After hospital discharge, the patient transitions to the outpatient MKD protocol that consists of the following schedule for RD visits: initial follow-up at 1 month and every 3 months thereafter for the first year. The standard follow-up for the second year is every 6 months. Interim communication between the family and neurologist, RN, and RD occurs via phone conversations or e-mail. The scope of care at the clinic visits include the following: anthropometric data, a standardized ketogenic laboratory panel, urine ketones, bowel regime, fluid intake, physical assessment, medications, and seizure frequency. Nutrition intake information is evaluated, including the following: total grams of carbohydrates, spacing of meals and carbohydrates, and specific foods and percentage of total fat intake. Additionally, the RD performs a complete nutrition analysis and discusses any nutrient concerns and diet barriers encountered.</p>
<p>Seizure medications are not weaned for the first month unless issues such as lethargy, unexplained physical bruising, or elevated liver labs dictate immediate wean. If seizures have improved, the neurologists will start a scheduled medication wean for the patient. Within the first month, partial or complete seizure control is typically observed, although an extended period of time may be required for the full efficacy of the diet to be revealed.</p>
<p>If the MKD is successful with partial or complete seizure control, the patients are kept on the diet for 1 to 2 years. A repeat EEG is obtained at 1 year and subsequently as medically needed. A weaning protocol for the MKD is not well defined in the literature but is developed on an individual basis per diet effiacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412451319">16</xref></sup> Typically, at Connecticut Children’s, the diet weaning procedure begins with an additional 5 g of carbohydrates per day each week and continues to be liberalized until carbohydrate content is unrestricted and seizure control is maintained. Once ketones are negative, a regular balanced diet is encouraged over a few months before the introduction of sweets.</p>
<p>Since implementing the MKD at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, 36 patients have been placed on it. The first MKD patient was a teenager who became seizure and medication free within 3 months of starting the diet and continues to experience a seizure-free life as this article is written. After initiating the MKD program, the keto team reviewed the results of the patients placed on the MKD. Connecticut Children’s MKD outcomes have been consistent with the published studies from Johns Hopkins Hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451319">13</xref></sup> In all, 56% of patients (n = 20) experienced ≥50% to 100% reduction in seizure frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1941406412451319">Figure 4</xref>). Of this 56%, 17% (n = 6) became seizure free and 39% (n = 14) had ≥50% to 90% seizure reduction. Unfortunately, 17% (n = 6) saw no improvement, although some of these patients did not stay on the diet for the full 3 months. Another 27% (n = 10) had less than 50% seizure reduction.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1941406412451319" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1941406412451319-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A transition from the MKD to the KD occurred for 13% (n = 5). All the patients who transitioned from the MKD to the KD experienced &gt;50% decrease in seizures and were in search of enhanced seizure control from the stricter KD. There are no formal studies on the progression of the MKD to the KD, but it can be quite effective as our team has seen. Of the 5 patients transitioned to the KD diet, 3 were on tube feedings and preferred the MKD initially to avoid hospitalization required for initiating the KD diet. Of these patients, 2 experienced improved seizure control by switching to the KD diet. One became seizure free and has been weaned off 2 medications; he is currently being weaned off his last medication. The other patient improved his seizure control by another 50% but did not gain complete seizure control by diet alone.</p>
<p>At the Connecticut Children’s Ketogenic Center, patients continue the MKD if seizures are controlled and compliance is not a problem. A few parents have actually followed the diet along with their child for weight loss, seizure control, and other health benefits. Although not recommended unless followed by a physician, parents following a low-carbohydrate diet may actually improve MKD compliance for their child.</p>
<p>The medical community once considered the low-carbohydrate, Atkins<sup>®</sup> diet for weight loss as a fad diet with possible negative health outcomes, such as heart disease. As evidence of MAD becomes more established, this could cause health professionals to revise their original view because the MAD is an evidence-based medical treatment option in preventing seizures in children and, more recently, in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412451319">12</xref></sup> One recent study indicates that the MAD produces modest efficacy with adult use, similar to that of adjunctive anticonvulsants for controlling seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412451319">12</xref></sup> A more recent study with adults demonstrated a modest efficacy but with an added benefit of weight loss for some patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412451319">17</xref></sup> Additional adult studies are being conducted to improve the availability of this diet therapy to more adults and their neurologists.</p>
<p>Currently, at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, the MKD is quickly becoming a treatment of first choice over the KD. The majority of patients and families are opting for the positive diet benefits and enhanced quality of life that the MKD offers compared with the rigid classic KD. The ketogenic team anticipates continued growth of our outpatient MKD therapy and readiness for any emergent MKD patients who may require this therapy as an inpatient. The KD diet will still be offered for patients, but we foresee that it will be less likely to be selected by patients and their families. More research is needed to compare the KD with the MKD with regard to overall efficacy and to further evaluate if the MKD can be used effectively as a first-line nutritional therapy before the KD for new-onset seizures. Connecticut Children’s outcomes support the MKD as a viable nutrition therapy option for pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy.</p>

<title>Case 1: Importance of Fat</title>
<p>SC is a 7-year-old girl with a history of 2½ years of intractable epilepsy, including 1 convulsive seizure. She had tried multiple medications with incomplete control of her seizures. Her parents had requested information on the MKD because the seizures were occurring 10 to 20 times per day, and she was experiencing poor sleep, teeth grinding, stomach issues, and developmental difficulties at school.</p>
<p>Because the family’s native culture was Indian, their cooking practices involved all fresh produce with almost no processed foods. Therefore, implementing the diet would be relatively simple. Her family attended the initial meeting and all prediet lab work, EEG and supplements were obtained. SC was started on 20 g of total carbohydrates per day. Although the MAD research indicates that starting with 10 g of carbohydrates per day is more effective at the initiation of the diet, our center has found compliance and hypoglycemia issues to be overwhelming for families at that level and have agreed on 10 to 20 g/d, depending on the individual situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412451319">15</xref></sup> They were educated on the MKD and started the diet on her February vacation to allow time for adjustment to the new routines. They kept daily records of ketones, seizures, bowel movements, and fluid intake. At the start of the MKD, her medications included Depakote<sup>®</sup> and Zarontin<sup>®</sup>, along with a sugar-free Scooby Doo<sup>®</sup> complete vitamin, Nature Made Calcium 600 mg with vitamin D, Hood<sup>®</sup> Calorie Countdown milk (8 oz = 3 g of carbohydrate and 300 mg calcium), and Dannon<sup>®</sup> Lite’n Fit Carb Control yogurt.</p>
<p>By the end of the first month on the diet, her seizure frequency decreased from 10 to 20 times per day to 0 to 10 per day. Her neurologist started to slowly wean her first medication and her growth and nutritional labs were monitored and remained appropriate. Her daily urinary ketones registered large, and her β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level was 2.0 (best outcome range 4-6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412451319">18</xref></sup> The RD completed a diet analysis and found her fat intake to be about 45% of her diet. The RD encouraged the parents to increase fat—specifically, 1 tablespoon of butter, oil, or mayonnaise per meal.</p>
<p>One month later, SC became seizure free and continued to wean off her medications. The family reported giving her 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil with sea salt at every meal as a medication, rather than incorporating the fat into the meals. Her diet history now revealed her fat percentage to be at 70% of her total calories, and her BHB level had increased to 4.28. In ketogenic studies, a goal of 4 to 6 for a BHB level correlated with improved seizure control, although not necessarily in all children, as we have seen at Connecticut Children’s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412451319">18</xref></sup> Within 3 months of starting the MKD, SC became seizure free, and by 5 months, she had been weaned off all seizure medication.</p>
<p>After 1 year on the diet, SC’s EEG was significantly improved. She continued on the MKD without experiencing any medical complications or incidence and attained the goal of remaining seizure and medication free at 1 year. After 16 months on the diet, a slow wean was initiated by the weekly addition of 5 g of carbohydrates per day. Once her ketones were negative, her fat intake was reduced, and she resumed a healthy balanced diet. SC remains seizure and medication free approximately 3 years after instituting the MKD.</p>

<title>Case 2: Benefit of MKD Transition to KD</title>
<p>CB is a typical 3-year-old boy with an unremarkable medical and developmental history. He was diagnosed with primary generalized epilepsy, amid a history of convulsive and atonic seizures. He had allergies to eggs, all nuts, and milk. He experienced 30 to 50 seizures per day, despite a range of antiepileptic medications. His parents abandoned all medications because of multiple side effects that they perceived were delaying his cognitive development. His parents had initiated craniosacral therapy and were desperate for some alternative therapy to control his seizures, when his neurologist recommended the newly developed MKD.</p>
<p>His parents were educated on the MKD 1 month before initiating the diet and successfully added milk to his daily intake prior to starting the diet. He was started on half of a sugar-free Scooby Doo<sup>®</sup> complete vitamin, calcium 600 mg with vitamin D, and 20 g of carbohydrates per day. One month after initiating the MKD, CB’s seizures decreased by 60% to about 10 to 15 seizures per day. Over the next several months, fine-tuning of the diet occurred through increased fat intake, reducing hidden carbohydrate sources and the total amount of carbohydrates to 10 g/d, eliminating artificial sweeteners and processed foods, and manipulation of the timing of meals and snack. The diet modifications produced some seizure-free days, but seizures continued to occur between 0 and 12 times per day. His BHB remained between 2 and 3, and all other labs were acceptable.</p>
<p>Because the parents were extremely motivated to achieve 100% seizure control and CB was tolerating the MKD medically, after being on the MKD for 5 months, our ketogenic team recommended a transition to the KD. CB was initiated on the KD at a 4:1 ratio. The parents were given meal plans, taught how to use a gram scale, and were educated on the KD. Follow-up proceeded using the KD outpatient monitoring guidelines.</p>
<p>Over the next year, diet efficacy continued to improve as the ratio of the diet was adjusted on the KD. The only modifications to the diet were a decrease in ratio from 4:1 to 3.5:1 and, eventually, a 3:1 ratio because of consistent issues of hypoglycemia, BHB of 7.44, and a high uric acid level. After decreasing to the 3:1 ratio, he became less irritable, happy, and made tremendous developmental gains, particularly in his communication skills. Despite the reduction in seizures after transiting to the KD, he did not achieve 100% seizure control, and the parents agreed to start a small amount of Depakote<sup>®</sup>. He became seizure free a month later with the KD and a small dose of Depakote<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p>CB continued the KD therapy along with Depakote for another year, remaining seizure free, and his cognitive abilities and overall development continued to improve. Although research implicates that a normal EEG is not required to discontinue the diet, after a year of being seizure free, CB’s repeat EEG was normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412451319">7</xref></sup> After being on the MKD and KD therapy for 36 months combined, the diet had taken a toll on their family life. CB had started kindergarten and was angry he could not eat what his friends were eating, and they strongly pushed to wean off the diet. A slow decrease in ratio continued over the next 6 months to a regular diet. CB has continued to remain seizure free on a regular diet with a small dose of medication. He continues on a complete vitamin and a calcium supplement with vitamin D added because of diet deficiencies per analysis. Future research on the transition from the MKD to the KD, along with the comparison of the MKD with the KD for efficacy is warranted.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the MKD is comparable with the KD as regards seizure control and should be encouraged as an alternative to the conventional KD for patients and their families. The MKD may improve compliance and rate higher in family satisfaction because of the ease of implementation, volume of foods, and overall similar appearance to a regular meal for patients. More research is needed to help determine the optimal fat provision for each meal, weaning protocols for diet therapy, and if artificial sweeteners and the type of carbohydrates consumed can interfere with seizure control on the MKD. Additional research may help further define the appropriate prescription of the MKD versus the KD for best outcomes in individuals.</p>
