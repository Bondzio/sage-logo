<p>There is no debate on how vocational education and training increase knowledge and develop skills. Both equip human beings to enhance productivity and optimize their performance in all walks of life. With new dimensions in organizational functioning vocational training has become an essentiality in developed as well as developing countries for self and wage/salary employment. It is more important for skilling women to work in informal sector. The last decades have seen mushroom growth in vocational skill development policies and programmes for all trainees and trainers, resulting in a massive growth in the training literature. Though the traditional thinking of training being highly conceptual/theoretical, away from ground realities and practice, is fading day by day, but the matter of concern is that training is becoming a commercial or profit-making activity. Further, role of private participation is reducing government dominance for providing training due to multiple limitations of the later. However, still majority of vocational programmes are far away from marketable skill development. Despite lot of efforts there is lack of coordination and integration.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this juncture, this book on skilling women is an important contribution. Besides conceptual knowledge, the book is based on vast and deep research insights into various key aspects of training process, psychology of participants and group dynamics. Besides the rationale of training for achieving individual and collective goals, it provides material for making training more field oriented through the increasing use of exercises, case studies, role plays and assignments on the job training. It rightly underlines the collaborative approach between the training agencies and the operating organizations as well as developing a cadre of competent professional trainers. The book, for enhancing people’s faith in training, describes the process mechanism in detail how and what should be done by the training agency, the sponsoring organization and the overall controlling body before starting, during and after training phases.</p>
<sec id="section1-0972262912460161">
<title>Organization of the Book</title>
<p>The book consists of 11 chapters grouped under two parts along with eight case studies and three appendices. Conceptual and Methodological Aspects are described in Part I, under (<italic>a</italic>) Introduction and (<italic>b</italic>) The Study and its Domain. In Part II, there are nine chapters covering Ground Level Experiences in Skilling Women; there are nine chapters, namely, Targeting Women for Training, Empowerment of Women for Work in Informal Sector, Deciding on Skills to be Imparted to Women for Work in the Informal Sector, Women Centred Training Strategies for Work in Informal Sector, Post-Training Help to Women, Some Basic Issues in Skilling of Women, A Model of Skilling Women for Work in the Informal Sector, A Model of Public Private Partnership in Skilling Women for Work in the Informal Sector and Skill Development of Women for Work in Informal Sector—Summary and Recommendations. The case studies pertain to eight states, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Appendices cover conceptual Note on Empowerment, State of Art in Skilling Women in India and Governance of Skill Development Initiative.</p>
<p>I agree that women in India are in poverty trap. Their innovative skills and creativity are unnoticed and unrecognized particularly in informal sector. In this regard this book provides a step-by-step practical approach to planning, organization and delivery of a marketable skill development programme. It rightly emphasizes on equipping trainers with useful tools and techniques. It is good that important points have been suitably elaborated followed by examples and guidelines. Though at first look it seems that there is nothing new in the book but it is systematic and detailed presentation based on field realities.</p>
<p>The attributes of adult learners and how the trainers should identify and analyze them are described nicely. The authors say rightly that in the competitive world only proficient, informed and skilled can survive. Training provides a feeling of empowerment and enhances confidence level which is so essential for day-to-day decision making through the content intensity. Pace of learning vary from time to time and thus learning is never complete. How to develop an integrated approach for learning through training in the light of support factors and environmental constraints is highlighted clearly. How to keep balance and optimize results has been described in detail. What are the necessary steps and their sequence for preparing a training programme and key tasks are elaborated fully. Importance and relevance of different training methods are evaluated closely.</p>
<p>The language and style are reader friendly for both the potential and existing trainers. The tables, charts, diagrams and figures enhance the quality of presentation and assist the readers in grasping as well as assimilating the knowledge and skill inputs with greater ease. It is a useful book for looking into the present scenario of vocational training and improving it to match the job market in informal sector.</p>
