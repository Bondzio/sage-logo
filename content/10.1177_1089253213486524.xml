<abstract>
<p>Acute silicoproteinosis is a rare disease that occurs following a heavy inhalational exposure to silica dusts. Clinically, it resembles pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP); silica exposure is thought to be a cause of secondary PAP. We describe a patient with biopsy-confirmed acute silicoproteinosis whose course was complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Without clinical improvement despite antibiotic and steroid treatment, the patient was scheduled for whole-lung lavage under general anesthesia. Anesthetic challenges included double-lumen tube placement and single-lung ventilation in a hypoxic patient, facilitating lung lavage, and protecting the contralateral lung from catastrophic spillage.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 32-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic alcoholism and 24 pack-year history of tobacco use presented to the emergency department with a 9-month history of shortness of breath, cough, and fevers. The patient had worked as a licensed concrete contractor for the past 15 years and rarely used respiratory protective equipment. He described a productive morning cough that he attributed to his job. He had recently been exposed to a heavy burden of pulverized concrete while working in a basement without adequate ventilation. He noted a significant increase in cough and shortness of breath. Chest roentography demonstrated diffuse bilateral multilobar opacification, with upper-lobe predominance. The patient was admitted with suspicion of pneumonia with secondary hypoxia. Initial treatment with antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful, and the intermittent fevers persisted. PPD (tuberculin) testing was negative. Differential diagnosis included pneumoconiosis with acute silicosis, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), infection, or sarcoidosis. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed normal airways and bronchi without erythema or secretions. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and 15 cc of opaque fluid was obtained. Diagnostic workup included blood cultures, sputum culture, influenza A and B viral testing, respiratory syncytial virus culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing, and periodic acid Schiff staining for protein. Transbronchial biopsies were taken. Infectious workup, including blood, sputum, and BAL cultures, were negative. Pathology from transbronchial biopsy demonstrated focal organizing pneumonia, focal alveolar proteinosis, and a granulomatous alveolar response containing intracellular birefringent crystals consistent with silica dust particles and associated interstitial fibrosis. A diagnosis of acute silicoproteinosis was confirmed based on pathology and his occupational exposure. Additional outpatient workup included CT chest imaging that showed a mildly enlarged right and left pulmonary artery, focal areas of ground glass opacities, and reticulation consistent with crazy paving. Pulmonary function testing revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 4.28 L, 81% predicted; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 3.56 L, 83%predicted; and DLCO (carbon monoxide diffusing capacity), 56% of predicted. He was treated with 120 mg IV methylprednisone for 3 days following diagnosis, with moderate clinical improvement of symptoms. Following this, he was discharged on a slow taper of prednisone and supplemental oxygen (3-6 L/min).</p>
<p>Then, 8 months after the initial presentation, the patient again presented to our hospital with symptoms of cough, fever, tachycardia, and severe dyspnea and an increased oxygen requirement of 15 L/min via a nonrebreather mask to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90%. Pulmonary examination revealed diffuse rhonchi and rales. He was admitted to the intensive care unit with hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pneumonia. Admission arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.38, PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 42 mm Hg, and a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 65 mm Hg on a 6-L/min nonrebreather. A transthoracic echocardiograph performed on admission showed normal cardiac function, normal valves, and no evidence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Diagnostic workup included blood and sputum culture for bacterial and viral etiologies and viral polymerase chain reaction testing. Over the following three days, treatment in the intensive care unit involved fluid resuscitation, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and high-dose corticosteroids. Diagnostic flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was done under elective intubation on ICU day 4 at the bedside in the ICU for bronchial alveolar lavage sampling. The elective intubation served two diagnostic purposes: to obtain respiratory sputum cultures to evaluate for potential bacteria not covered by the current regimen and to evaluate the extent of protein by bronchial lavage. A bronchoscopic airway survey revealed mildly erythematous segmental bronchi and sparse pitting but was otherwise normal. BAL returned “soapy-appearing” fluid with active sediment consistent with an exacerbation of silicoproteinosis. The patient remained intubated postprocedure for ongoing significant O<sub>2</sub> requirements. Consultation for whole-lung lavage was made with the thoracic surgery team. The patient was given an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 4 classification and taken to the operating room to undergo right-sided single-lung lavage on ICU day 5. Standard ASA monitoring systems were applied. The patient required significant ventilator support and FiO<sub>2</sub> 100% with PEEP 10 to maintain marginal oxygenation. He arrived at the operating room already intubated and sedated. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane, fentanyl, and a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker. Additional monitoring with an arterial line and transesophageal echocardiography were planned for any evidence of hemodynamic instability however, because the patient was otherwise healthy, and PaO<sub>2</sub> correlated closely with SpO<sub>2</sub> without significant CO<sub>2</sub> retention on preoperative blood gases, an arterial line was not placed for the procedure.</p>
<p>A 39-French, double-lumen left-sided endobronchial tube was placed over a tube exchanger and secured in place at 29 cm at the teeth. Correct placement was ensured using fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and the cuffs were inflated. Lung isolation was confirmed, and left-sided one-lung ventilation was started. Right-sided whole-lung lavage was performed by alternating infusion of 1.5 L NS followed by gravity removal via steep Trendelenburg positioning. Fluid drainage was aided by right and left lateral roll as well as mechanical chest percussion. During one-lung ventilation, the patient was maintained on pressure control, with peak inspiratory pressures &lt;40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, PEEP 8 to 10, RR ~18, and TV ~400 mL. Following several serial lavages, the procedure was complete. A total of 20 L of warm, normal saline was used for lung lavage in 1.5-L increments, with returned volumes recorded. The only significant intraoperative complication was hypothermia regardless of the use of warmed irrigation fluid, forced air warmers, and warmed operating room. Noninvasive blood pressures were at times challenging to obtain secondary to vibrations emitted from the chest percussion device; however, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. The double-lumen tube (DLT) was removed under direct visualization, and a 9.0-mm endotracheal tube (ETT) was easily placed. The patient was returned to the ICU in stable condition. His condition continued to improve, FiO<sub>2</sub> was steadily weaned, and he and was extubated on postoperative day 3. He returned to the operating room on postoperative day 4 for planned left-sided whole-lung lavage, which again yielded voluminous amounts of cloudy fluid following 30 L of irrigation. He was extubated in the operating room and transported to the postanesthesia care unit. The patient was ready for discharge 3 days later, with his oxygen requirement returning to his baseline of 4 L/min, and radiographic infiltrates were improved. An extensive workup for infectious disease remained negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213486524">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213486524"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253213486524"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253213486524">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Background: PAP and Silicosis</title>
<p>PAP, first described in 1958, is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1 per 100 000, in which amorphous lipoproteinaceous material resembling pulmonary surfactant accumulates in the alveolar space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213486524">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213486524">2</xref></sup> Symptoms include progressive dyspnea, cough, and occasionally, fever or chest pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213486524">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213486524">4</xref></sup> In cases of alveolar proteinosis, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity is severely reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213486524">5</xref></sup> Periodic acid Schiff staining of BAL fluid exhibits a matrix of granular material as well as eosinophils and elevated levels of surfactant protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213486524">6</xref></sup> Abnormal alveolar macrophage structure and function is also pathologically evident.</p>
<p>Pulmonary silicosis is a similarly presenting disease characterized by fibrotic and inflammatory changes in pulmonary tissue in the setting of respirable silica dust exposure. Crystalline silica is taken up by pulmonary macrophages resulting in lysosomal damage and activation of inflammatory mediators. Disease severity is closely associated with cumulative inhaled silica exposure and may be significantly reduced by appropriate respiratory precautions. A range of disorders have been associated with pulmonary silicosis, including pulmonary infections, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253213486524">7</xref></sup> Some reports show improvement in acute silicosis exacerbations with high-dose corticosteroids; however, they have not been shown to alter chronic course and may increase susceptibility to infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253213486524">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213486524">8</xref></sup> Altered macrophage function may contribute to proteinaceous material accumulation and silicoproteinosis, which closely resembles PAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213486524">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radiographic studies are often worse than the symptomatology and physical findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213486524">10</xref></sup> Chest radiograph findings are predominantly symmetric; however, asymmetric or patchy infiltrates are not uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253213486524">11</xref></sup> High-resolution CT scans reveal diffuse or patchy ground glass opacities, often with thickening of interlobular septa. This pattern of septal thickening surrounded by ground glass opacities makes up the nonspecific but characteristic “crazy paving pattern.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213486524">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213486524">12</xref></sup> Souza et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213486524">13</xref></sup> report distinct imaging differences between PAP and pulmonary silicoproteinosis. Silicoproteinosis demonstrated bilateral-dependent consolidation with calcification and was not associated with “crazy paving.”</p>
<p>Multiple forms of alveolar proteinosis have been described based on the mechanism of reduced alveolar clearance. The disease is most commonly caused by defects in granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cellular signaling. GM-CSF regulates surfactant catabolism, immune function, and final alveolar macrophage differentiation. Autoimmune PAP is defined by autoantibodies directed against the GM-CSF molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213486524">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213486524">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213486524">14</xref></sup> The antibody has been definitively demonstrated in patients with alveolar proteinosis and a latex-bead agglutination test has been developed, with 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity for diagnosing acquired disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253213486524">15</xref></sup> Hereditary PAP involves a genetic mutation in the GM-CSF receptor. Disrupted GM-CSF signaling results in reduced clearance of pulmonary surfactant and decreased immune function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213486524">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondary PAP involves development of alveolar proteinosis in the presence of conditions known to be associated with the disease. A specific etiology of secondary PAP is unknown but involves decreased function or number of alveolar macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213486524">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213486524">14</xref></sup> A wide range of systemic and primarily pulmonary diseases have been implicated in the development of secondary PAP, including hematological disorders, immunological and infectious diseases, and, of specific importance in our patient, inhalation of toxic substances, including silica and concrete dust.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213486524">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213486524">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253213486524">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253213486524">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Treatment options for this disease are limited; however, whole-lung lavage has become the standard of care for PAP and an option for silicoproteinosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213486524">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213486524">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213486524">18</xref></sup> Our patient was also treated with high-dose corticosteroids because there have been reports that this may yield a response in acute exacerbations of silicosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213486524">8</xref></sup> A few, very small clinical trials have tested supplementary GM-CSF and have shown mixed but encouraging responses for autoimmune PAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253213486524">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>One-Lung Ventilation and Placement of Double-Lumen Bronchial Tube</title>
<p>One-lung ventilation is a commonly used approach in many thoracic procedures, including thoracoscopy and lung biopsy and resection. The primary indication for one-lung ventilation is facilitation of surgical exposure and technique. Less-common indications include lung isolation to prevent spillage from a diseased lung (infection, bleeding, etc) to a relatively healthy lung or to allow for selective ventilation techniques for each lung. Many techniques are available to provide lung isolation and one-lung ventilation, such as double-lumen ETTs, bronchial blockers, and selective bronchial intubation.</p>
<p>Whole-lung lavage presents unique considerations for ETT selection and placement. Because of the nature of whole-lung lavage, lung isolation techniques such as bronchial blockers or selective mainstem intubation will not work. A double-lumen ETT is required because the patient is oxygenated and ventilated via one lumen while the second lumen provides access for large-volume lavage. Correct placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube is of critical importance and should be confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Physical lung isolation should also be confirmed to prevent leakage of lavage fluid into the ventilated lung. Indicators for inadequate lung isolation include sustained CO<sub>2</sub> return, continuous spirometry, or “bubbling” underneath a fluid column from the nonventilated lung. During the procedure, malpositioning of the ETT may be indicated by poor lung compliance and low exhaled tidal volumes or by flooding of the nonoperative lung following initiation of lavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213486524">18</xref></sup> Either right- or left-sided DLTs may be used; however, the left-sided one may be preferred to reduce possibility of occlusion of the right upper lobe. Among anesthesia providers not especially trained in thoracic anesthesia, left-sided DLTs have been shown to be more facile to place correctly; however, other goal-oriented measures of success, such as hypoxia and high airway pressures, were not necessarily correlated with sidedness of the tube.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253213486524">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1089253213486524">
<title>One-Lung Ventilation of a Hypoxic Patient</title>
<p>Pulmonary function testing in patients such as ours demonstrates a restrictive pattern of decreased compliance, with concomitant decreases in FEV1 and FVC, but a normal FEV1/FVC ratio. DLCO is frequently reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213486524">3</xref></sup> Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale) is seen with severe disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253213486524">21</xref></sup> Intraoperative management of patients with interstitial lung disease includes consideration for predisposition for rapid development of hypoxemia given reduced functional reserve capacity (especially with one-lung ventilation), minimizing barotrauma, and minimizing cardiopulmonary complications associated with worsening of pulmonary hypertension. Minimum measures in place to mitigate barotrauma should include pressure-controlled ventilation, minimizing peak-inspired pressures, and addition of PEEP. Small tidal volumes (4-5 mL/kg) are frequently used with PEEP to minimize atelectasis and atelectrauma. Adequate PEEP is likely dependent on pulmonary compliance and must be individualized. Hypoxemia and hypercapnia are 2 of many inciting conditions that may acutely worsen pulmonary vascular pressures and potentially contribute to acute right heart failure. Unintubated patients should be thoroughly preoxygenated/denitrogenated with 100% O<sub>2</sub>, and the plan for anesthetic induction should account for rapid exhaustion of oxygen stores. Patients are often initially maintained on 100% FiO<sub>2</sub> and may be titrated down as tolerated while maintaining oxygenation. Ventilation strategy should aim for normocapnia, avoiding hypercapnia-associated increases in pulmonary vascular resistance while also maintaining hypoxic vasoconstriction, which may be blunted by severe hypocapnia.</p>
<p>Patient positioning may also contribute to V-Q mismatch or changes in pulmonary compliance. Performance of whole-lung lavage with patients positioned supine may avoid complications related to one-lung ventilation in the lateral decubitus position. Other sources, however, describe positioning in the lateral decubitus position with the ventilated lung in the dependent position. This causes the ventilated lung to receive the larger percentage of cardiac output; however, it also subjects this lung to compression from the mediastinum, diaphragm, and, during lavage, the additional weight of the lavage fluid. During the filling phase, the lavage fluid also compresses the pulmonary vasculature in the operative lung, which may shunt blood toward the ventilated lung. This may improve oxygenation by improving V-Q mismatch; however, it may also increase pulmonary vascular resistance and contribute to heart failure in compromised patients. During the drainage phase, this process is then reversed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253213486524">22</xref></sup> Supine positioning likely improves compliance by eliminating lung compression caused by the mediastinum and irrigation fluid; however, this may not provide gravity-related benefits to ventilation-perfusion matching. Frequent changes from the Trendelenburg to the reverse Trendelenburg position will also alter pulmonary compliance and may contribute to hemodynamic instability during an otherwise minimally stimulating therapeutic procedure. The anesthesiologist must understand these physiological challenges and be ready to adapt ventilation strategies based on individual patient responses during the various lavage maneuvers.</p>
<p>Even with optimization of ventilation strategies and V-Q matching, some patients may experience severe hypoxia or hemodynamic compromise during one-lung ventilation. Many strategies have been described to facilitate completion of the procedure, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, full cardiopulmonary bypass, inhaled nitric oxide, or use of a pulmonary artery catheter balloon to selectively occlude blood flow to the lavage lung.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253213486524">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253213486524">24</xref></sup> These modalities can improve oxygenation, though risks must be recognized. Bypass techniques require large cannula venous access and some degree of anticoagulation. A recognized serious complication of a pulmonary artery balloon is arterial endothelial damage or rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213486524">25</xref></sup> Our plan in the case of refractory hypoxemia was to place a temporary AvalonELITE bicaval, dual-lumen, single-site (right internal jugular) catheter attached to a pump and a membrane oxygenator for temporary venovenous bypass.</p>

<title>Whole-Lung Lavage</title>
<p>Whole-lung lavage using a double-lumen ETT was developed by Dr Jose Ramirez-Rivera in the 1960s, shortly after Dr Rosen’s description of PAP in 1958. Vincente described a technique resembling whole-lung lavage in 1928, involving an orotracheal catheter placed into the dependent lung with the patient breathing spontaneously in the lateral decubitus position. A slow instillation of isotonic saline was used and allowed to drain spontaneously. This technique was used initially as treatment for a variety of conditions, including bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, and lung abscess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213486524">18</xref></sup> Dr Ramirez-Rivera’s technique of whole-lung lavage followed initial attempts at treatment involving blind subsegmental lobar intubation via a transtracheal catheter under local anesthesia, with instillation of small volumes of irrigation, which was then expectorated by the patient over the following 60 to 75 minutes. In 1963, Dr Ramirez-Rivera described whole-lung lavage using a double-lumen ETT, initially under local anesthesia and finally under general anesthesia in 1964.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213486524">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213486524">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current practice for whole-lung lavage requires a nonstandard, relatively complex circuit setup to allow for concomitant lung ventilation and lavage. As noted above, a DLT is placed, and lung isolation is confirmed. Other descriptions of whole-lung lavage note positioning in the lateral decubitus position as discussed in the previous section.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213486524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213486524">18</xref></sup> The circle system anesthesia circuit is connected to one limb of the DLT for ventilation. If lungs are affected differently based on radiographic evidence, the less-affected lung is usually ventilated first, allowing for lavage of the worse lung. The lavage system is connected directly to the nonventilated limb of the DLT with a short segment of suction tubing and straight connector. This is connected to a Y-shaped adaptor with limbs connected to warm normal saline and a suction canister. A clamp is used to direct fluid appropriately toward the lung or suction canister (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253213486524">Figure 5</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213486524">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>The procedure consists of alternating gravity-driven instillation of normal saline via the lavage limb of the DLT with the patient in the reverse Trendelenburg position and fluid drainage via the steep Trendelenburg position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253213486524">Figure 6</xref>). Irrigation volumes are carefully recorded, and returned volume should be no more than approximately 10% less than the instilled volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213486524">18</xref></sup> Evidence of fluid in the ventilated lumen should trigger an immediate halt in the procedure and reassessment for lung isolation. Chest physiotherapy or percussion is performed with each irrigation to enhance lavage. Initial returned volumes are generally opaque in appearance, and lavage cycles are repeated until effluent volumes become relatively clear. Active sediment will settle to the bottom over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213486524">4</xref></sup> The entire procedure may last multiple hours because many rounds of lavage are generally necessary before clearing of returned volumes. During the prolonged anesthetic, the providers must be ready to manage many potential complications. In addition to challenges with DLT placement and lung isolation, the large irrigation volumes may result in significant fluid and temperature shifts. Only normothermic, normal saline should be used for irrigation to minimize absorptive pulmonary edema. Significant discrepancy between instilled and returned volumes should warn the providers of potential systemic absorption, which may result in volume overload. Also, total irrigation volumes that may easily exceed 15 to 20 L, directly interacting with the large vascular surface area of alveoli may quickly result in significant heat losses. As such, multiple measures should be in place to manage heat loss, including close temperature monitoring, forced air warmers, and elevated operating room temperature. Large volumes of IV fluid should not be necessary but what is used should be warmed as well.</p>

<p>In addition to standard ASA monitors, provision should be made for placement of an arterial line or transesophageal echo probe. Although not used in this case of an otherwise healthy, hemodynamically stable patient, an arterial line provides continuous monitoring of potential hemodynamic instability in the face of significant fluid shifts and position changes. Arterial blood gases can also be frequently monitored to evaluate hypoxemia and improvement postprocedure. In patients with multiple comorbidities, a transesophageal echocardiogram will also provide real-time, direct data regarding volume status, cardiac function, and compensation to changing pulmonary vascular resistance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Taking a severely hypoxic patient in respiratory failure to the operating room and eliminating half of their pulmonary function by initiating one-lung ventilation does not sound like a clinical scenario destined for success. We have demonstrated that this can be done safely with appropriate knowledge of the procedure and awareness of complications and anesthetic management challenges. We have presented a positive outcome of whole-lung lavage used as therapy for acute exacerbation of pulmonary silicoproteinosis. Following bilateral whole-lung lavage, our patient clinically improved and was able to be discharged at his baseline shortly thereafter. He has also had a stable posthospitalization course, without further admissions during the one-year follow up. It will be interesting to follow the evolution of his disease. Prerequisites for the anesthetic management of patients with severe pulmonary airspace disease such as silicoproteinosis or PAP include a thorough knowledge of the technique and physiology of one-lung ventilation and recognition of the procedurally related complications resulting either from the lavage fluid directly or from cardiopulmonary alterations associated with one-lung ventilation.</p>
