<p>In the present work, compressive strength of ash-based geopolymers with different mixtures of % rice husk ash, fly ash, nano alumina and nano silica has been predicted by fuzzy logic. The alkali activating was done by a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solution. It was found that oven curing temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration together with SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles has the main effects on compressive strength of the specimens. The fuzzy logic model was constructed by 12 input parameters including the water curing time, the rice husk ash content, the fly ash content, the water glass content, sodium hydroxide content, the water content, the aggregate content, SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles content, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles content, oven curing temperature, oven curing time and test trial number. The value for the output layer was the compressive strength. According to the input parameters in fuzzy model, the input data were trained, validated and tested. The results indicate that fuzzy model is a powerful tool for predicting the effect of nanoparticles on compressive strength of the geopolymers in the considered range.</p>

<p>Geopolymers, also called polysialates, are amorphous to semi-crystalline three-dimensional aluminosilicate polymers considered as the analogues of certain zeolites. Thus, geopolymers consist of a polymeric silicon–oxygen–aluminum framework with alternating silicon and aluminum tetrahedral joined together in three directions by sharing all the oxygen atoms. The fact that aluminum is four coordinated with respect to oxygen creates a negative charge imbalance, and, therefore, the presence of cations is essential to maintain electric neutrality in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789512442519">Alvarez-Ayuso et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, fuzzy logic (FL) has been utilized to predict the effect of nanoparticles on compressive behavior of ash-based geopolymers. Over the last two decades, a different modeling method based on FL has become popular and has been used by many researchers for a variety of engineering applications. Fuzzy control theory can be applied on linear and nonlinear systems. It does not need to handle the tedious mathematical models of controlled body. It needs only to set a simple controlling method based on engineering experience. Therefore, it is particularly useful in complicated structural control system. The compressive strength of geopolymers can be calculated using the models built with FL. It is convenient and easy to use these models for numerical experiments to review the effects of each variable on the compressive strength values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789512442519">Akkurt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789512442519">Baykasoglu et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>FL has lately been used widely to model some of the human interesting activities in many areas of science and engineering. Especially, many of the studies were made for the prediction compressive strength of concrete specimens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056789512442519">Demir (2005)</xref> devised an FL algorithm for predicting elastic modulus of normal and high strength concrete from F<sub>c</sub> of concrete. The results of the proposed procedure obtained from FL model were compared with the code relationships of different countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789512442519">Fa-Liang (1997)</xref> built an FL to predict cement strength by feeding the model with the 3-day strength data to predict the 28-day strength. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789512442519">Akkurt et al. (2004)</xref> constituted an FL model to predict F<sub>c</sub> for cement mortar and predicted 28-day F<sub>c</sub> of cement mortar values using this model.</p>
<p>The authors’ literature surveys show that there are no studies on predicting geopolymers properties by FL or related computer-aided programs except those done in our previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789512442519">Bohlooli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056789512442519">Nazari et al., 2011, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789512442519">Nazari and Riahi, 2012</xref>). In these works, several properties of geopolymer specimens made by different mixtures of rice husk-bark ash (RHBA) and fly ash (FA) in fine and coarse forms have been considered. It was shown that the geopolymers properties could be investigated by computer-aided programs. Therefore, in this study, because of the established power of FL to predict geopolymer properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789512442519">Bohlooli et al., 2012</xref>), it has been utilized to predict the compressive strength of geopolymeric specimens.</p>
<p>The utilized ashes mixture in this study is a combination of FA and rice husk ash (RHA). FA is recently used as a source material to produce geopolymer because of its suitable chemical composition along with favorable size and shape. In order to achieve a suitable chemical composition to produce geopolymers, the preferred method is to blend FA with another high silica source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056789512442519">Wongpa et al., 2010</xref>). RHA is a by-product from the burning of rice husk. The husk of the rice is removed in the farming process before it is sold and consumed. RHA cannot be used alone to produce geopolymers because of its unsuitable SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio. Hence, it should be used by another alumina-rich source like pozzolanic FAs. One of the additive materials to concrete specimens to acquire higher strengths is nanoparticle such as SiO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056789512442519">Nazari and Riahi, 2010</xref>) and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056789512442519">Nazari and Riahi, 2011</xref>) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can act as heterogeneous nuclei for cement pastes, further accelerating cement hydration because of their high reactivity, as nano-reinforcement, and as nano-filler, densifying the microstructure, thereby, leading to a reduced porosity. The most significant issue for all nanoparticles is that of effective dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056789512442519">Nazari and Riahi, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789512442519">2011</xref>). As authors’ literature survey, there are no works on utilizing nanoparticles in geopolymers to evaluate their mechanical properties. In the present work, the effects of nanoparticles addition to geopolymers paste have been considered.</p>
<p>The main factors affecting the compressive strength of ash-based geopolymers include the particle size of the utilized ash, curing temperature, curing time, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration, etc. In the previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056789512442519">Nazari et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056789512442519">2012</xref>), investigations on the effects of ash particle size on compressive strength of geopolymers showed that the finer the particle size the higher the compressive strength. The authority of fine ashes to produce high-strength geopolymers has been established in several works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056789512442519">Najafi Kani and Allahverdi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056789512442519">O’Connor and MacKenzie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789512442519">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The effects of other main factors on compressive strength of geopolymers have not been completely approved.</p>
<p>Because of the variety of main factors dealing with geopolymer properties, there are no works incorporating all factors effects on compressive strength of these materials. To overcome this discrepancy, a suitable experiment design can help to investigate the effects of more parameters simultaneously by the minimum experiments. Taguchi experiment design has been conducted to evaluate the effects of oven curing time and temperature, nano silica content and NaOH concentration on compressive strength of fine ash-based geopolymers. Finally, 132 data were gathered and trained, validated and tested by FL to predict the effects of different factors on compressive strength of geopolymers.</p>

<p>The used cementitious materials in this work were FA and RHA. Their chemical composition has been illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056789512442519">Table 1</xref>, which was determined by a Philips PW 1480 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) apparatus.

The as-received ashes were sieved and the particles passing the finesses of 33 µm were grinded using Los Angeles mill for 180 min, which yielded different samples for FA and RHA. The average particle size obtained for FA was 4 µm with the BET specific surface of 35.4 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The average particle size obtained for RHA was 6 µm with the BET specific surface of 29.8 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The mixture of two produced samples was used in the experiment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1056789512442519">Figure 2</xref> shows the particle size distribution of the two produced samples which was determined by Blain method.

<p>River sand with the average particle size of 1 mm and the density of 3.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> was used as received to determine the optimum content of aggregate in geopolymers. This fineness was used to ensure that large sand particles do not affect the properties of geopolymers randomly. In the other words, a suitable distribution of uniform particles was required to avoid discrepancy between the obtained results.</p>
<p>Totally, three series of specimens were made to evaluate the compressive strength of geopolymers. G series geopolymers were produced by FA and RHA. N series specimens were prepared by replacing 3 wt% of the mixed ash in G series specimens by a mixture of SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles which were prepared from Nano Pars Lima Co. The average particle size of both SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles was approximately 80 nm.

<p>Four main considered factors for Taguchi experiment design of N series specimens were nano silica weight percent, oven curing temperature, oven curing time and NaOH concentration each one at three levels. The three levels of each factor have been also illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1056789512442519">Table 4</xref>; and the suggested design by Taguchi method for four factors at three levels is L9 array in accordance to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789512442519">Table 5</xref>.</p>
<p>To prepare the specimens, NaOH was diluted by tap water to have concentrations of 5, 8 and 12 M. The solution was left under ambient conditions until the excess heat had completely dissipated to avoid accelerating the setting of the geopolymeric specimens. The sodium silicate (Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>) solution without preparation was mixed with the NaOH solution. The ratio of the Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> solution to NaOH solution was 2.5 by weight for all mixtures because this ratio demonstrated the best properties for FA-based geopolymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789512442519">Pacheco-Togal et al.</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789512442519">2007</xref>). For all samples, the mass ratio of alkali activator to FA-RHA mixture was 0.4. To ensure the complete dispersion of nanoparticles in the paste, they were mixed by alkali activator solution and then the mixture was added to the base ash. The mixture proportioning of all produced samples have been illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1056789512442519">Table 3</xref>. Pastes were mixed by shaking for 5–10 min to give complete homogenisation. The mixtures were cast in 50 mm edge polypropylene cubic molds. The mixing was done in an air-conditioned room at approximately 25°C. The molds were half-filled, vibrated for 45 s, filled to the top, again vibrated for 45 s and sealed with the lid. The mixtures were then precured for 24 h at room temperature because this precuring time has been found to be beneficial to strength development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789512442519">Bakharev, 2005</xref>). Precuring time before application of heat induces significant dissolution of silica and alumina from FA and formation of a continuous matrix phase, increasing, therefore, the homogeneity of the geopolymeric materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789512442519">Bakharev, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789512442519">Chindaprasirt et al., 2007</xref>). After the precuring process, the samples and molds were placed in a water bath to prevent moisture loss and the carbonation of the surface. The curing regimes (water and oven curing) for each series of specimens were in accordance to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789512442519">Table 5</xref>. For the specimens cured in elevated temperature (70 and 90°C), the time of oven-curing were also considered in water curing regime.</p>
<p>The compressive strength results of the produced specimens were measured on the cubic samples using a YAW-300 automatic pressure testing machine. The tests were carried out three times on each series and the average strength values were reported.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789512442519">Table 6</xref> shows the compressive strength of S series specimens for determining the optimum aggregate content. It is obvious that S3 and S6 specimens have the highest strength between S1-S3 and S4-S6 series, respectively. These two series of mixtures have not any aggregate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789512442519">Figure 5(a)</xref> shows SEM micrograph of a specimen with aggregates and without nanoparticles while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789512442519">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows that of a specimen with aggregates and nanoparticles. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789512442519">Figure 5(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789512442519">b</xref>) it is evident that the interface between aggregate and paste is weak and hence by applying the compressive force, instead of generating the crack in aggregates, the weak interface will be cracked and the promotion of cracks is more straightforward than that in the specimens without aggregates. Several investigations have been conducted on the concrete specimens and it has been reported that when the interface between aggregates and the paste is weak, the strength will be decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789512442519">Jiang, 1999</xref>). Although no systematic investigations has been done on compressive strength of geopolymers under compression, because of the probabilistic similarities between concrete and geopolymers specimens under compressive loads, one may conclude that like concrete, the weak interface in geopolymers also results in decreasing the strength. Therefore, for G and N series specimens, Taguchi experiment design was performed on the specimens without nanoparticles.

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1056789512442519">Table 7</xref>, the highest increase in G series specimens is related to the specimens cured in 25°C (G1-G3 specimens). This shows that completion of geopolymerisation at 70 and 90°C at 2 days of water curing is more than that of 25°C. The highest increase in strength at 25°C (G1-G3 specimens), 70°C (G4-G7 specimens) and 90°C (G7-G9 specimens) is related to G3 (with NaOH concentration of 12 M), G6 (with NaOH concentration of 8 M) and G8 (with NaOH concentration of 12 M), respectively. On the other hand, the lowest increase in strength at 25°C (G1-G3 specimens), 70°C (G4-G7 specimens) and 90°C (G7-G9 specimens) is related to G1 (with NaOH concentration of 5 M), G4 (with NaOH concentration of 12 M) and G9 (with NaOH concentration of 5 M), respectively. As seen, the highest increase at 90°C has been achieved at NaOH concentration of 12 M while at this concentration, the lowest increase at 70°C has been acquired. These results may indicate that NaOH concentration has not evident effect on increasing the compressive strength as important as oven curing temperature. Same situation is observed for oven curing time. The highest increase in strength at 25°C (G1-G3 specimens), 70°C (G4-G7 specimens) and 90°C (G7-G9 specimens) is related to G3 (with 8 h oven curing), G6 (with 2 h oven curing) and G8 (with 2 h oven curing), respectively. On the other hand, the lowest increase in strength at 25°C (G1-G3 specimens), 70°C (G4-G7 specimens) and 90°C (G7-G9 specimens) is related to G1 (with 2 h oven curing), G4 (with 4 h oven curing) and G9 (with 4 h oven curing), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056789512442519">Riahi et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1056789512442519">Table 7</xref> shows, the highest increase for N series specimens is related to the specimens cured at 25°C (N1-N3 specimens). This shows that completion of geopolymerisation at 70 and 90°C at 2 days of water curing is more than that of 25°C. The highest increase in strength at 25°C (N1-N3 specimens), 70°C (N4-N7 specimens) and 90°C (N7-N9 specimens) is related to N3, N6 and N8 specimens, respectively, all with NaOH concentration of 12 M. On the other hand, the lowest increase in strength at 25°C (N1-N3 specimens), 70°C (N4-N7 specimens) and 90°C (N7-N9 specimens) is related to N1 (with NaOH concentration of 5 M), N5 (with NaOH concentration of 8 M) and N7 (with NaOH concentration of 8 M) specimens, respectively. As seen, the highest increase at each curing temperature has been achieved at NaOH concentration of 12 M while the lowest increase at 5 and 8 M. These results may indicate that NaOH concentration has not evident effect on increasing the compressive strength as important as oven curing temperature. Same situation is observed about oven curing time. As indicated, the highest strength in each group was related to N3, N6 and N8 specimens with 8, 2 and 2 h oven curing while the lowest strength obtained for N1, N5 and N7 specimens 2, 8 and 8 h oven curing.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1056789512442519"><title>Architecture of FL</title>
<p>Fuzzy set theory was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789512442519">Lotfi Zadeh in 1965</xref> to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty that is often present in realworld applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056789512442519">Ramezanianpour et al., 2004</xref>). In 1974, Mamdani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789512442519">Lotfi Zadeh, 1965</xref>), by applying Zadeh’s theories of linguistic approach and fuzzy inference, successfully used the ‘IF-THEN’ rule on the automatic operating control of steam generator. It does not need to handle the tedious mathematical models of controlled body. It needs only to set a simple controlling method based on engineering experience. Therefore, it is particularly useful in complicated structural control system. Since it does not involve complicated mathematical calculations and time of system delay is reduced in process of operations, lowering its impact on the controlling effects can be expected. Furthermore, since the fuzzy control method is easy to comprehend and to amend, it can be adjusted according to the actual situation. Its effectiveness is therefore confirmed. Now, fuzzy control has become most successful in application of fuzzy theory.</p>
<p>In this part of the study, the developed FL-based model was applied to predict the geopolymers’ compressive strength data obtained from experiments. The fuzzy rules were written for this purpose. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789512442519">Figure 7</xref> that we devised the FL-based algorithm model by using the FL toolbox in MATLAB.
<fig id="fig7-1056789512442519" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The structure of the constructed fuzzy model in MATLAB toolbox.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789512442519-fig7a.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789512442519-fig7b.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789512442519-fig7c.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789512442519-fig7d.tif"/></fig>

<p>The FL model had 12 input parameters and 1 output parameter. The parameters included the water curing time (CT), the RHA content (R), the FA content (F), the water glass content (WG), NaOH content (N), the water content (W), the aggregate content (A), SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles content (NS), Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles content (NA), oven curing temperature (T), oven curing time (t) and test trial number (NT). The value for output layer was compressive strength (F<sub>S</sub>). Membership functions for input and output parameters used for fuzzy modeling are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789512442519">Figure 7</xref>. The choice of the membership functions is based on the experiences gained, and their base values are selected so that they are concentrated on more sensitive regions. From the experiments, totally 132 data were achieved and used as target. The range of input values has been given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1056789512442519">Table 10</xref>. From the total 132 data, 92 data were randomly selected for training set, 20 for validation set and the other 20 data were used for testing set. The fuzzy rules were written for predicting the Charpy impact energy. These rules are obtained as in the following:

<p>The assignment of initial related parameters may also influence the performance of the FL to a great extent. However, there is no well-defined rule or procedure to have an optimal architecture and parameter settings where the trial and error method still remains valid. This process is very time consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789512442519">Cevik and Guzelbey, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789512442519">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789512442519">Guzelbey et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789512442519">2006b</xref>). In this study, the MATLAB FL toolbox is used for FL applications. To overcome optimization difficulty, a program has been developed in MATLAB which handles the trial and error process automatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789512442519">Cevik and Guzelbey, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789512442519">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789512442519">Guzelbey et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789512442519">2006b</xref>). The program tries various numbers of parameters for the algorithm when the highest root mean squared error (RMSE) of the testing set as the training of the testing set is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789512442519">Cevik and Guzelbey, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789512442519">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789512442519">Guzelbey et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789512442519">2006b</xref>).</p>

<p>The performance of the FL model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789512442519">Figure 8</xref>. The best value of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is 0.9778 for training set and its minimum value is 0.9340 for validating set in the FL model. All of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values show that the proposed FL model is suitable and can predict the effect of nanoparticles on compressive strength values very close to the experimental values.</p>

<list-item><p>The obtained results showed that one can produce high-strength geopolymers with RHA and FA together with nanoparticles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The optimum curing temperature in both 2 and 7 days water curing regime was 90°C. The best compressive strengths in this temperature were 31.0 ± 1.4 and 38.5 ± 1.9 for 2 and 7 days of water curing, respectively, for the specimens containing 3 wt% of SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The optimum NaOH concentration of 8 M has been shown to have the most effect on compressive strength of geopolymers in these conditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>FL can be an alternative approach for the evaluation of the effect of nanoparticles on compressive strength values of ash-based geopolymer specimens.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of FL model showed that it is capable to predict suitable results for compressive strength values of geopolymer specimens in the studied range.</p></list-item>
