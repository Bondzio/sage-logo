<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>As part of the medical profession, psychiatrists have much power in determining treatment and outcomes for patients. Unfortunately, this also means psychiatry has also been involved with the darker aspects of humanity, such as during the Nazi regime, and the abuse of patients’ human rights. Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neuropsychiatric illness from which observation and little knowledge reported by the medical profession spanned decades of incorrect and sensationalised documentation, that was also influenced by the values of the time. Such was the atmosphere of society during this period that the ideas and notions regarding HD disseminated by the respected medical profession were believed and accepted as fact by the general population and other professions, who would have been ignorant of any other contrary information. We need to be aware of social and cultural values as these can influence our understanding of diagnoses and treatments of our patients.</p>

<body>
<p>Huntington’s disease is a profoundly debilitating neurodegenerative genetic disease which causes uncontrollable movements, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment. Its prevalence varies widely from country to country, but is estimated to be between four and 10 people per 100,000. It is autosomal dominant with full penetrance, which means that offspring have a 50% risk of inheritance if they have an affected parent. It is caused by a single defective gene on chromosome 4 that was discovered in 1983<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212459587">1</xref></sup> and is due to an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat, which leads to neuronal death in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212459587">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Huntington’s disease (or Huntington’s chorea, as it was previously called) was concisely and succinctly described by George Huntington. As a boy travelling with his grandfather and father on their rounds, he observed ‘two women, mother and daughter…twisting, bowing, grimacing’. He presented this to the medical world in a lecture in Ohio in February 1872.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459587">3</xref></sup> This had been described previously in a paper published by a Norwegian, Johan Christian Lund, in 1860, when Huntington was only nine years old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212459587">2</xref></sup> Before this, chorea had been described by Thilenius (1816), Waters (1847), Gorman (1848) and Lyon (1863).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212459587">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Huntington had the opportunity to study an extended family on Long Island who displayed these jerking movements and psychiatric symptoms. His father had also observed these phenomena, as had his grandfather, who first identified the disease in 1797.</p>
<p>Considerable investigation into the genealogy of this disorder determined that the Long Island cases were the offspring of a man named William Mulford, who had been born in the Massachusetts, Connecticut area. According to some authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212459587">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212459587"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212459587">8</xref></sup> it was thought that the 1000 cases of Huntington’s disease (HD) from the New England area during this time could be traced back to four family groups who immigrated there in the 17th century, mainly from the east coast of England.</p>
<p>The Mulford ancestry could be traced back to three young men from Bures in Suffolk, England (less than 50 miles from Huntington’s ancestral home) who, with their wives, in 1630, boarded a ship, the John Winthrop, and migrated to the United States. They settled in New England. There were two brothers, Nicholas and William Knapp, and a relative, Jeffrey Ferris. Through historical records of ‘meanness of character’ (Hans and Gilmore, p. 12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212459587">9</xref></sup> and ‘reprehensible behaviour’ (Critchley, p. 725)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459587">10</xref></sup> of these men and their male progeny, and conflictive, argumentative behaviour in women, it was concluded by many authors that this was evidence of symptoms and signs of HD. The men committed felonies and other crimes, and were in and out of jail. The women suffered a worse fate; a number of them were accused, trialled, executed and even burnt at the stake, accused of witchcraft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459587">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212459587">11</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212459587">
<title>Witchcraft</title>
<p>The history of witches and their persecution dates back to ancient times. Two books in the Old Testament, <italic>Exodus</italic> and <italic>Leviticus</italic>, contained passages which assume the existence of witches and suggest that they should be killed. In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII further increased the profile of witches. He commissioned a book, <italic>Malleus Malificarum</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212459587">12</xref></sup> whose purpose was to argue that witchcraft existed, discredit those who were sceptical, to claim that women more than men were witches, and to educate on the methods to find and convict them. In the 1500s, massive executions of witches around Europe resulted. During the years of 1500 to 1660, over 50,000 suspected witches were executed. Over 80% of these were women. The Witchcraft Act of 1735 heralded the end of witchcraft as a legal offence in Britain.</p>
<p>In the mid 1600s, in New England, the United States, witchcraft was still considered a crime and people, under the influence of Puritan beliefs (as in England), were on guard for witchcraft. Prior to 1662, a single witness was all it took to support a witchcraft conviction. The famous Reverend Cotton Mathers claimed that witches had made fun of Christ’s agonies on the cross, and women with spasmodic jerking backwards and forwards of the head, puckering of the lips and gesticulations were afflicted thus as a result of God’s cursing their ancestors for their blasphemy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459587">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Family history</title>
<p>It has been documented that Nicholas Knapp’s wife, Elinor, was executed near Stamford, Connecticut in 1653, accused of witchcraft. According to Vessie, after her body was cut down, it was examined for evidence of witchcraft. Apparently, this evidence was the existence of nipples, ‘conclusive proof of having being visited by the sucking devil’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref> p.561</sup> Mary Staples was one of the women who had examined Elinor’s body. She stated ‘here are no more teats than I myself have, or any other woman’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212459587">14</xref> p.74</sup> It is unclear the exact relationship between Mary and Elinor, but it is possible that they could have been sisters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mary Staples herself was accused of witchcraft in September 1692, as was her daughter Mary Harvey and granddaughter Hannah Harvey (children were accused because of the supposed hereditary nature of witchcraft). A maid, Catherine Branch was afflicted by strange visions, fits and wails of pains. She accused a number of local women of inflicting these upon her. In the subsequent trial, a witness reported that Mary Staples had performed ‘strange gymnastics’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref> p.562</sup> These three women were acquitted, as the evidence provided by Catherine was suspicious.</p>
<p>The other accused women who were found guilty were Elizabeth Clawson and Mercy Disborough. Elizabeth Clawson was also acquitted, but with much difficulty because she had antagonised women during ‘flares of nasty temper, denunciations of hatred and scandalising allusions’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref> p.562</sup> Mercy was also a feisty character and had threatened men and children. It was thought that she could kill cattle and cause illness in people. She was also subsequently reprieved. Mercy was reported to be Nicholas and Elinor’s granddaughter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup> Nicholas and Elinor had a daughter who married a son of Jeffrey Ferris (allegedly related to Nicholas), who had many children who had HD, including Mercy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the women in this family thought to have HD were described to have physical manifestations apparently consistent with witchcraft, as well have difficult argumentative behaviour, the men thought to have HD were described to be belligerent and aggressive. Nicholas Knapp was fined for selling water, supposedly as a cure for scurvy, whilst on the John Winthrop, and after he settled in Connecticut, it was reported that he also had a number of other similar misdemeanours.</p>
<p>William Knapp had a history of swindling, public profanity and alcoholism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref></sup> His sons were also ‘notorious principals’ (Vessie, p. 556).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref></sup> His third son, James, married Elizabeth Warne. They had a daughter, also named Elizabeth. This Elizabeth became known as the notorious ‘Groton witch’. In 1671, when she was 16 years old, she was afflicted with strange fits and violent body movements. She was accused of being a witch and stated that the Devil had possessed her.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212459587">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup> When James died, Elizabeth senior remarried, to a John Buttery, and returned to England. Buttery later accused his wife of witchcraft after a child developed unusual convulsions following an argument in the home. Elizabeth was jailed and observed for evidence of witchcraft, and is thought to have confessed and was punished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through a second marriage, William had a daughter, Sarah, who married William Mulford, and they moved to East Hampton, Long Island, and their descendants were supposedly the historic Long Island group of people with HD, whom Huntington observed and described.</p>
<p>The third man, Jeffrey Ferris, who came to the United States was thought to be distantly related to William and Nicholas Knapp. He had fallen in love with a daughter of a family which had carried HD and immigrated, as his family were adamantly against their marriage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459587">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref></sup> Jeffrey was a harsh, unsympathetic man, who ordered tough verdicts on people who had committed petty crimes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459587">7</xref></sup> His eldest son was sentenced to death, accused of bestiality. Another son moved away from Connecticut and had many children who had HD. His only daughter married a stepbrother, also having children who with HD.</p>
<p>There are two seemingly separate issues here: first, it appears that the women accused as witches had unusual, twitching grimacing movements, which may have been symptoms consistent with HD, which at the time were thought to be evidence of witchcraft and possession by the Devil. What were the signs and symptoms of HD that could be mistaken for witchcraft? It was thought that witches were of the female gender. Possession by the Devil caused these abnormal writhing, unpredictable movements and convulsions; scratch marks were caused by the Devil, and the unpredictable screaming and shouting was the cursing of enemies. Some of these women, Mary, Elizabeth and Mercy, were forthright in their opinions and thought to be of an argumentative nature, which certainly was frowned upon by society during those Puritanical times. Women were seen as the lesser sex, and were judged if not behaving as they should. When something went wrong for a person, they might accuse a woman of witchcraft and thereby as the source of the problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>A <italic>Lancet</italic> article<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212459587">15</xref></sup> states that Huntington’s chorea was the most likely disease to procure a victim for sorcery. This article explains that the ‘strange, purposeless movements’ (Lancet, p. 869)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212459587">15</xref></sup> and ‘malicious’ behaviour were signs and symptoms indicative of a woman who was ‘inevitably’ the next suspect of a witch hunt. This article cited Vessie’s paper, agreeing that the ‘diabolical nature’ of the disease made it ‘not difficult to concede something devilish’ in this condition.</p>
<p>Second, from the often cited and documented family history described above, it may indeed appear that these three men and their descendants directly brought the HD gene to the United States. The males in the family were described as antisocial, criminal-type lowlifes, and the women were argumentative, and condemned as witches. The assertion was so strong and helped feed the growing discrimination and fear towards HD which was occurring in the early 1900s.</p>

<title>Stigma and discrimination</title>
<p>Charles Davenport was an American scientist who, with Elizabeth Muncey, was involved in the initial extensive genetic study of HD, published in 1916. They highlighted the unique and significant family history of HD in New England. Davenport asserted that if immigration laws had been tightened and if routine inquiries and screening about the causes of deaths of ancestors of any prospective migrants had been made, HD in the United States might have been averted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212459587">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212459587">16</xref></sup> He ‘regretted there had been no embargo on entry, or even such prophylactic measures such as compulsory sterilisation’ (Critchley, p. 726).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459587">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The same <italic>Lancet</italic> article suggests that HD was carried to the United States by these three men, of ‘undesirable’ characteristics, and the United Kingdom should ‘congratulate ourselves on their loss’ (Lancet, p. 870).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212459587">15</xref></sup> Maltsberger writes that the arrival of these men in the United States was the start of an ‘American tragedy’ (Maltsberger, p. 3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup> These opinions, expressed by the medical profession, are probably reflective of the widespread community fears, stigma and discrimination.</p>
<p>As recently as 1984, MacDonald Critchley, a very eminent and influential English neurologist, wrote in <italic>Psychological Medicine</italic> that people who had HD had reprehensible behaviour, including ‘intermarriage, illegitimacy and incest’ (p. 725). He cited the high costs of each person with HD and lamented that HD was not a mandatory notifiable disease as it was a disease liable to increase.</p>
<p>Such was the influence of Vessie and Davenport’s opinions that several papers subsequently published concur with the views held at the time. The people described in these papers are reported as having antisocial, undesirable behaviour, not contributing positively to the community and, worse, it is suggested that they are blatantly intermarrying and procreating, thus perpetuating this terrible genetic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212459587">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212459587">18</xref></sup> Because the symptoms do not manifest until later in life, it was suggested that particular measures, such as sterilisation, should take place. In Davidson’s <italic>The Principle and Practice of Medicine</italic>, the undergraduate text familiar to the current second author (EC), Marshall and Simpson wrote that as HD ‘does not usually manifest itself until after the reproductive period, hence eugenic measures are not possible’ (Marshall and Simpson, p. 1066).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212459587">19</xref></sup> One paper even goes so far as to predict that ‘choreics reproduce as rapidly as the rest of the population, it should not take long for this malignant and dominant gene to replace its normal allele’ (Maltsberger, p. 13).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref></sup> There was even an article published, which was significantly flawed, stating that people with HD have many more children than people without the gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459587">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212459587">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Davenport may have alluded to recommendations of sterilisation, history itself revealed the more ominous proceedings undertaken during World War II by Nazi Germany to rid society of people with genetic disorders, mental handicap and psychiatric illness, including those with HD, along with racial minority groups. It is not known how many people with HD were sterilised or killed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212459587">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212459587">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wexler in her 2010 <italic>Lancet</italic> paper laments that it is ironic and tragic that Vessie’s 1932 views in his article gained so much influence, even as recently as the stigmatising opinions of Critchley in the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459587">10</xref></sup> Today, HD is now one of the most important genetic diseases in science and medicine, due to the isolation of the gene, and serves as a valuable model for other neurodegenerative disorders. Like many other neurological diseases with manifest neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as Alzheimer’s and all other dementias, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, an element of stigma remains, though certainly not to the extent that existed in the past.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Psychiatry is a specialty that can be subjected to the throes and swings of societal and cultural norms. People with divergent behavioural patterns, or those who did not necessarily conform, have been labelled as psychiatrically unwell, and subsequently experienced discrimination by the community. It was not so long ago that homosexuality was thought to be a mental disorder, and was only removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1983. The DSM-V plans to include updated diagnoses, demonstrating that psychiatry in the modern world is just as likely to be influenced by current societal norms and the prevalent psychiatric ideology of our time.</p>
<p>The history of HD demonstrates the influences of thinking of the times, first the targeting of women who ‘behaved badly’ and the branding of them as witches in the 17th century, and then the discrimination towards those with strange and unknown diseases, such as HD, and the pressure to ‘liberate society’ of this ‘problem’.</p>
<p>As psychiatrists within the medical profession, we need to have an ongoing awareness of the subtle effect of negative and stigmatising community beliefs, as well as the impact of personal and political ideology. The effect of a sensational and ignorant media can also have great influence on the community and on ourselves.</p>
<p>There have been advances in reducing the stigma and resultant discrimination in people with psychiatric illness, as driven by the World Psychiatric Association. We have a unique and potentially powerful role in influencing change and advocating for these people. However, we also need to be aware of the ongoing community and societal beliefs that have great influence on the way mentally ill people are perceived, and work towards creating a more humane and accepting community, not falling in with stigmatising societal and individual beliefs. The history of HD serves to remind us that the medical profession can be just as guilty of advancing stigma and discrimination as the society in which it dwells.</p>
