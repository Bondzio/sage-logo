<abstract>
<p>Aluminum-based composites containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes are produced by a powder metallurgy route involving a ball-milling technique. Effects of processing parameters on the dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and resulting properties are investigated. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes, initially located on the powder surface with maintaining their connectivity, become dispersed individually and embedded progressively in the aluminum powder during a milling process. The composite with individually dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes shows a good strength but poor electrical and thermal conductivities. On the other hand, the composite with a network structure of MWCNTs reveals much enhanced electrical conductivity of 3.316 × 10<sup>7</sup> Sm<sup>−1</sup> and thermal conductivity of 172 W/m K.</p>

where <italic>L</italic> is the Lorenz number (2.45 × 10<sup>−8</sup> <italic>W</italic><italic>Ω/K</italic><sup>2</sup>) and <italic>T</italic> is the absolute temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312456891">1</xref></sup> Due to this electronic component, the thermal conductivity parallels the electrical conductivity and both of them are strongly affected by activities of free electrons in metals. Hence, a dramatic enhancement of both of thermal and electrical conductivities can be achieved by adding high conducting materials into metals and also by making a well-connected path for free electrons.</p>
<p>One of the most promising candidates as conducting agents in the metal matrix composites is carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The axial thermal conductivity of multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) is about 3000 W/m K at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312456891">2</xref></sup> and the electrical resistivity of an individual MWCNT is in the order of 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>−4</sup> Ω cm at 300 K.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312456891">3</xref></sup> Therefore, many researchers have long endeavored to enhance thermal and electrical conductivities of materials, mostly tried in the polymer matrix, by incorporating CNTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312456891">4</xref></sup> For metal matrix composites, however, reinforcing effects of CNTs on mechanical performance have actively been investigated<sup>5,6</sup> whereas their effects on thermal and/or electrical properties have been only several investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312456891">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shao et al. has reported that W-Cu matrix composites containing 0.4 wt% Cu-coated MWCNTs, which were fabricated by ball-milling followed by hot-press sintering, exhibit 27.8% enhanced thermal conductivity compared to the starting material even though CNTs are found to be agglomerated after ball-milling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312456891">8</xref></sup> Similar idea has been employed to develop Cu/MWCNTs composites. However, the thermal conductivity of the copper matrix composite has been reported to be reduced ∼63% when Ni-coated single-walled CNTs are added. Recently, Chu et al<italic>.</italic> have also reported copper matrix composites fabricated by spark plasma sintering of ball-milled Cu–CNT powder show lower thermal conductivities than starting monolithic material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312456891">9</xref></sup> This implies that a couple of imperfections of the composite, possibly originating from improper processing routes, may offset the superior properties of CNTs.</p>
<p>Especially, a couple of obstacles such as an unexpected formation of carbides and/or a high porosity resident in the final composite have been reported to be overcome to achieve desired thermal and electrical conductivities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312456891">10</xref></sup> The Al/CNT composite fabricated by hot-pressing subsequent to hand grinding exhibits a lower electrical conductivity than monolithic aluminum because the agglomerated CNTs are mostly turned into aluminum carbides during a hot consolidation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312456891">11</xref></sup> In addition, CNTs may impede the consolidation behavior of metal powders, introducing lots of pores in the composite. These pores significantly decrease thermal and electrical conductivities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312456891">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has significantly considered that transporting carriers can be scattered at the interface if the bonding between CNTs and the matrix is not well developed.<sup>13–15</sup></p>
<p>In the present study, the aluminum-based composites containing MWCNTs are fabricated using a ball-milling technique followed by a hot-working process. To control the microstructure of the composite in terms of the distribution of MWCNTs (e.g., agglomerated, networked or isolated form), a couple of fabrication routes are employed. Vickers’ hardness, electrical and thermal conductivities of the composites are investigated for the composites, which were fabricated via different processes and supposed to have different microstructures.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998312456891" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Al/MWCNT composites were fabricated by hot-working of ball-milled powder. A planetary mill was utilized to disperse MWCNTs (∼20 nm in diameter and ∼5 µm in length, supplied from Applied Carbon Nano Co., LTD.) in aluminum powder (99.5% in purity and ∼150 µm in average diameter). A stainless steel vial was filled with a mixture of aluminum powder (46 g) and MWCNTs (4 g) together with stainless steel balls (∼5 mm in diameter, 750 g) as milling media and all samples of composite containing 4 wt% MWCNTs. Milling was performed with a rotation speed of 100 r/min with various milling time up to 6 h (i.e., 1 h, 2 h, and 6 h). Milling was paused for 45 minutes after every 30 minutes to excessive cold welding of powder to a jar and balls, and any milling control agent was not used in the present study. Morphologies in ball-milled powder varied according to milling time were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1</xref>. It will be discussed later.

<p>We designed four processing routes as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312456891">Table 1</xref>. Case A, where MWCNTs were intended to be uniformly dispersed and isolated one by one, was fabricated by planetary milling of aluminum powder and MWCNTs at 100 r/min for 6 h. The ball-milled powder was put in a copper tube (outer diameter: 45 mm, length: 150 mm, and thickness: 1.2 mm), degassed for 3 h at room temperature, and sealed. The sample was heated to a predetermined temperature of 480℃ with a heating rate of 15℃/min and then hot-rolled with an every 12% reduction; the final thickness of the composite sheet was ∼1.5 mm. After rolling, the copper tube was mechanically peeled off. Case B, where MWCNTs were intended to be dispersed only on the powder surface to form a MWCNT network, was fabricated by planetary milling of aluminum powder and MWCNTs at 100 r/min for 2 h. MWCNTs on the powder surface significantly impede the consolidation of aluminum powder. Hence, the ball-milled powder was mixed with pure aluminum powder and then further milled at 100 r/min for 1 h, in order to make the composite powder wrapped with monolithic aluminum. The ball-milled powder and the pure aluminum powder are in the ratio of 1:1. The composite powder that was wrapped with monolithic aluminum was readily consolidated using a hot-rolling process at 480℃. Case C, where MWCNTs were also intended to be dispersed only on the powder surface to form an MWCNT network, was fabricated by planetary milling of aluminum powder and MWCNTs at 100 r/min for 2 h. The ball-milled powder and the pure aluminum powder are in the ratio of 1:1. Different from Case B, the ball-milled powder was just blended with pure aluminum powder without milling, and then the mixture was consolidated using a compaction followed by a hot-extrusion process. The mixture was first compacted under a 1.5 GPa of pressure at 450℃ for 2 h in a stainless steel die with 28 mm in diameter. Prior to the compaction, the mixture was covered by back of aluminum foil which was spread by boron nitride (BN) in order to separate the specimen from the die easily. The compact was then extruded with an extrusion ratio 15:1 at 480℃. Case D was fabricated by hot-rolling the monolithic aluminum powder, which was milled at 100 r/min for 6 h, for comparison.

<p>The microstructure of the consolidated composite specimens was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2000). Vickers’ hardness of the hot-rolled sheets was measured for the specimens with an indenter load of 300 gf. The thermal conductivity was measured by a laser flash technique according to the KS L 1604 standard with a disc type sample (diameter: 30 mm and thickness: 1.2 mm). The electrical resistivity (ρ) of the specimens was measured using a four-point probe equipment (CMT-SR2000N, Changmin Tech. Co, Korea) and applied to take it into account for calculating electrical conductivity with a sheet type sample (area: 20 × 20 mm<sup>2</sup> and thickness: 1.2 mm) as;

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1</xref> shows morphologies of the ball-milled mixture of aluminum and MWCNTs varied according to milling time. SEM images of powders ball-milled for 1, 2 and 6 h are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1(a)–(c)</xref>, respectively, and also a schematic depiction for each powder morphology is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1</xref>. At the early stage of milling (after 1 h of milling, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1(a)</xref>), MWCNTs seem to be agglomerated sporadically on the surface of the powder as marked by arrows. Some of MWCNTs are clustered incoherently in place. After 2 h of milling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1(b)</xref>), MWCNTs, marked by arrows, seem to be partially embedded and well dispersed on the surface of aluminum powder. After 6 h of milling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1(c)</xref>), MWCNTs are barely observed on the powder surface. MWCNTs are supposed to be mostly embedded within the aluminum powder or destroyed into amorphous carbon particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312456891">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As previously described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312456891">Table 1</xref>, three different types of composites with various microstructures and one set of monolithic aluminum are produced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(a)–(d)</xref> show SEM images of the powders of Cases A to D, respectively; Case A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(a)</xref>) was planetary milled at 100 r/min for 6 h; Case B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(b)</xref>) was planetary milled at 100 r/min for 2 h, subsequently mixed with pure aluminum, and then further milled at 100 r/min for 1 h; Case C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(c)</xref>) was also planetary milled at 100 r/min for 2 h, and mixed with pure aluminum without milling; Case D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(d)</xref>) is monolithic aluminum for comparison. For Case A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(a)</xref>), MWCNTs are not observed on the powder surface. This observation is comparable with SEM image of the powder ball-milled at 100 r/min for 6 h as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1(c)</xref>. Interestingly, Case B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(b)</xref>) also shows just few MWCNTs on the powder surface, while the powder ball-milled at 100 r/min for 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312456891">Figure 1(b)</xref>) shows a number of MWCNTs being dispersed on the powder surface. It demonstrates that the composite powder, which has a number of MWCNTs on its surface, was successfully wrapped with monolithic aluminum as expected after additional planetary milling with aluminum powder at 100 r/min for 1 h. The magnified images of Case C are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312456891">Figure 3(a)</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312456891">Figure 3(a)</xref>, some powder shows little MWCNTs on the powder surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312456891">Figure 3(b)</xref>) whereas some powder shows a number of MWCNTs on the powder surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312456891">Figure 3(c)</xref>). MWCNTs might be partially embedded in the aluminum powder during milling at 100 r/min for 2 h as marked by a dot circle, and hence they might not move freely to the fresh import monolithic aluminum powder during blending. If MWCNTs were not fixed on the powder, MWCNTs would spread over all of the powder during blending. The monolithic powder with clean surface may act as a binder to help consolidation among powder during a hot-working process. Interestingly, powder covered with CNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(c)</xref>) becomes flakes while powder with clean surface – i.e., CNTs are embedded inside powder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(a)</xref>), aluminum layer is covered to entire powder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(b)</xref>), or aluminum powder does not have CNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(d)</xref>) – is spherical. During milling, the powder finally becomes spherical as fracturing and cold welding of powder are balanced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312456891">16</xref></sup> When the surface of aluminum powder is covered with CNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(c)</xref>), CNTs will impede the cold welding and accelerate fracturing, providing spherical-shaped powder. When the surface of aluminum powder is clean, however, the milling kinetics might be changed; cold welding and severe shearing are dominant rather than fracturing and it may make powder flake shaped. These observations are comparable with other report where powder in the early stage of milling shows a flaky shape while it eventually becomes spherical shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312456891">17</xref></sup>

It is assured from the image that MWCNTs are not fully destroyed and just embedded in the aluminum powder although little MWCNTs are observed on the powder surface in the SEM observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312456891">Figure 2(a)</xref>). However, MWCNTs seem to be a bit damaged during a milling process. For Case C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312456891">Figure 4(b)</xref>), most MWCNTs are chopped into shorten ones; the average length of MWCNTs decreases 5 µm to 100 nm. However, they form a network structure with a good connectivity. Furthermore, MWCNTs are not turned into carbides for both cases.

However, Case C shows a disappointing value of hardness, even below the hardness of monolithic aluminum due to the ball-milled powder and the pure aluminum powder are in the ratio of 1:1. Simply blended with pure aluminum powder, Case C presents a sharp contrast to Case A. On the other hand, the strength of composites fabricated using a powder metallurgy can be enhanced through both grain refinement and load-bearing by reinforcement because the grain size of the composite is also significantly reduced during milling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312456891">15</xref></sup> The grain size of Case C (which was ball-milled for 2 h) may be much larger than those of Case A and monolithic aluminum (which were ball-milled for 6 h). Larger grain size would be another reason for the relatively low hardness of Case C as compared to Case A and monolithic aluminum. Although the direct comparison of their hardness is impossible due to different grain size, Case A has five times higher value of hardness than Case C. It demonstrates that individually dispersed MWCNTs are much more effective for strengthening the composite than the networked MWCNTs.

All ratio values of the Al/MWCNT composites are normalized by those for monolithic aluminum (Case D). Thermal conductivities of Cases A and B are much below than those of monolithic aluminum while they show slightly enhanced electrical conductivities. In thermal properties, the direct conducting by connection among the additives is much more important and hence Cases A and B show disappointing thermal conductivities. However, it is noticeable that electrical conductivity of the composite increases as compared to the monolithic aluminum even if CNTs are disconnected (Case A). Indeed, conducting additives of CNTs help out to improve the electrical conductivity whether or not the additives are connected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312456891">18</xref></sup> Also, connection of additives rarely contributes to the electrical conductivity, although interconnecting filler network leads to a decrease in the electrical resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312456891">19</xref></sup> Case C shows significant enhanced electrical and thermal conductivities as compared to the monolithic aluminum; the electrical conductivity increases by three times. The networked MWCNTs are found to be effective for enhancing electrical and thermal conductivities in spite of the disappointing strengthening effect. It arises because the networked MWCNTs could perform as a channel for the phonon or electron transport. Interconnections of MWCNTs formed are able to build a network structure and extensive tube–tube overlap of individual tubes, which are desirable features for effective heat transport from one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312456891">20</xref></sup>

<p>According to the number of models of thermal conductivity of Al-CNT composites, considering morphology and aspect ratio of MWCNTs, Xue’s equation was chosen to calculate this study. Xue et al. have shown conventional model of thermal conductivity of composites which interprets dependence of MWCNT length, diameter, concentration, and interface thermal resistance of the effective thermal and electrical conductivity of composites in Xue’s equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312456891">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312456891">14</xref></sup> The conductivity for the composite with 8 vol.% MWCNTs (20 nm in diameter and 10 µm in length) was calculated to be 217.43 W/m K using the Xue’s equation, which is two times higher than the measured value for Case B (103 W/m K) and also a bit higher than the measured value for Case C (172 W/m K). These differences might arise from damages of MWCNTs during a ball milling process; a severe mechanical impact during a milling process might cause a breakage of MWCNTs into shorter fragments followed by a decrease in thermal conductivity of MWCNT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312456891">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312456891">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, defects or oxides generated during a hot working process might act as scattering source of the electrical and thermal conductivities.</p>

<p>In this study, mechanical, electrical, thermal properties of Al/MWCNT composites, which are fabricated using a powder metallurgy involving a ball-milling technique, are investigated. The microstructure of the composites is controlled by varying the milling condition. MWCNTs are embedded in the aluminum powder and then dispersed one by one when sufficiently milled (milled at 100 r/min for 6 h). The composite containing the isolated MWCNTs shows a good strength but poor electrical and thermal conductivities. On the other hand, the composite with the networked MWCNTs, which is milled at 100 r/min for 2 h and then consolidated with monolithic aluminum powder as binder, shows much enhanced electrical and thermal conductivities as compared to monolithic aluminum and the composite with the isolated MWCNTs. The linked MWCNTs act as a channel for conducting of electrons or phonons. Hence, both the isolated MWCNTs and the networked MWCNTs might be good alternatives depending on the application purpose.</p>
