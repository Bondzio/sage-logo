<abstract>
<p>Our objective was to determine the role of asymmetry and the nature of microembolization on postoperative cognitive decline in patients who had undergone heart valve surgery. Continuous transcranial Doppler ultrasound was intraoperatively used for both middle cerebral arteries in 13 right-handed heart valve surgery patients to detect microembolization. The Trail Making Test A and B, Memory with 10/30 s interference, the Digit Span Test and Phonemic Fluency were performed preoperatively, at discharge and three months after surgery. Our data suggest that early and late postoperative psychomotor and executive functions may be sensitive to microemboli in the left, but not in the right middle cerebral artery. Moreover, solid and gaseous microemboli are both similarly associated with early postoperative cognitive decline while, surprisingly, late postoperative cognitive decline is more likely to be associated with gaseous than solid microemboli.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adverse neurological outcome and postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) are complications which occur frequently after cardiac surgery, with an incidence of approximately 4% and 50%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437776">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112437776">2</xref></sup>. They are due to multifactorial reasons, such as brain embolisms, hypoperfusion or neuroinflammatory processes, which are mostly related to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technique, but, also, to a minor extent, to off-pump coronary artery revascularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112437776">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437776">4</xref></sup>. There is growing evidence showing that intraoperative microemboli, which can be detected using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), are associated with cognitive decline after cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437776">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112437776">7</xref></sup>. A few studies have also investigated the potential role of asymmetric intraoperative microembolization on cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112437776">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437776">11</xref></sup>. Jacobs and colleagues found that POCD in both nonverbal and verbal tasks was associated with microembolization in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) in patients whose right hemisphere was dominant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112437776">9</xref></sup>. An association between POCD (especially in verbal memory tasks i.e. the Digit Span Test forward [DST]) and microembolization in the left MCA was also observed in patients with left hemisphere predominance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112437776">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112437776">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437776">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Memory, psychomotor and executive functions seem to be affected more than other cognitive domains by intraoperative microemboli during both coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437776">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112437776">8</xref></sup> and heart valve surgery (HVS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112437776">7</xref></sup>. Although a few studies did not find an association between a high intensity of microembolic signals (HITS) and POCD in HVS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112437776">12</xref></sup>, it is widely acknowledged that HVS represents a major risk factor for intraoperative microembolization in comparison with CABG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112437776">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112437776">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, Abu-Omar and colleagues demonstrated the presence of a 2100% increase in microemboli in HVS patients compared to off-pump CABG patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112437776">16</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the differential impact of asymmetric microembolization on POCD was examined only in CABG patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112437776">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112437776">10</xref></sup> or, at best, in both CABG and open heart surgery patients without differentiating between aortic and valve surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437776">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recently, TCD technology has allowed the discrimination of solid from gaseous intraoperative microemboli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112437776">17</xref></sup>. It has been hypothesised that POCD may be more likely to be associated with solid than gaseous microembolization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112437776">16</xref></sup>. However, the literature is still lacking with regard to the potentially different roles played by both solid and gaseous intraoperative microemboli in early and late cognitive decline after cardiac surgery, especially HVS.</p>
<p>Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to investigate the differential impact of asymmetry (i.e. left or right MCA) and the nature (i.e. solid or gaseous) of intraoperative microembolization on memory, psychomotor and executive functions in patients who underwent HVS. In particular, our analyses explored whether microembolization in the left or right MCA had a differential impact on early (i.e. at discharge) or late (i.e. at a three-month follow-up) POCD. Whether solid or gaseous microemboli have a differential impact on early or late POCD was also considered.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Following the local ethics committee’s approval, 13 right-handed patients were asked to give their written informed consent and were enrolled in the study. All of the patients underwent a neuropsychological evaluation preoperatively, before discharge and three months after HVS. Nine patients underwent an aortic valve replacement because of aortic valve stenosis, while the other four underwent a mitral valve replacement due to mitral valve insufficiency. The patients were predominantly male (N = 11, 84.6 %), with a mean age of 63.2 years (SD = ±11.1) and a mean level of education of 10.5 years (SD = ±5.2). The mean percentage of left ventricular ejection fraction was 64.5 % (SD = ±11). The risk of mortality associated with cardiac surgery was calculated using the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112437776">18</xref></sup>. The mean logistic EuroSCORE rating was 4.1% (SD = ± 4.7 %), which represents a moderate risk for mortality in cardiac surgery (i.e., EuroSCORE ranges from 3% to 5%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112437776">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Anaesthesia, surgical management and TCD monitoring</title>
<p>The patients were premedicated in the ward with an intramuscular injection of fentanil 100 μg and midazolam 5 mg. The anaesthesia induction was established with fentanil 5 μg/Kg, midazolam 0.2 mg/Kg, propofol 1 mg/Kg, and cisatracurium 0.1 mg/Kg before tracheal intubation was performed. The maintenance of anaesthesia was performed with propofol 4 mg/Kg/min and remifentanil 0.2-0.4 μg/Kg/min, in order to maintain a bispectral index value lower than 40. All of the patients were anaesthetised by the same physician. Bilateral MCA blood flow velocity was monitored and any emboli were detected and differentiated with a multifrequency (2.5-2 Mhz) TCD (Doppler box-DWL/Compumedics). The double ultrasound emission allowed the detection of solid microemboli because they reflect more high frequency ultrasound than the gaseous microemboli which, in turn, reflect more low frequency ultrasound.</p>
<p>They all had the same protocol of cardioplegia, a mild hypothermic CPB, and a rewarming rate of less than two degrees between arterial and venous blood. All patients had a routine de-airing, trough left ventricular and epiaortic venting under transoesophageal echocardiography view; moreover, they all had an extra tie placed around the atrium and venous cannulae to reduce gas entrapment in the extracorporeal circulation. An intravenous bolus of sodium thiopental (3 mg/kg mean dose), sufficient to obtain an isoelectric EEG trace on the Bispectral Index (BIS) wave monitoring before declamping the aorta, was administered to reduce the embolic burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112437776">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112437776">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The CPB lasted for an average of 106.1 min (SD = ±30.1 min), while the average duration of the aortic cross-clamping procedure was 78.5 min (SD = ±28.5 min). The mean durations of postoperative mechanical ventilation and the patients’ stay in intensive care were 7.5 h (SD = ±5.5 h) and 28.08 h (SD = ±15.2 h), respectively. The average length of the patients’ postsurgical stay in the ward was 101.6 h (SD = ±33.9 h).</p>

<title>Neuropsychological evaluation</title>
<p>As recommended by the Consensus on Neurobehavioral Assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112437776">21</xref></sup>, the neuropsychological evaluation included tests aimed at assessing cognitive performances such as memory, psychomotor and executive functions.</p>
<p>The neuropsychological battery included:</p>
<list id="list1-0267659112437776" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>a) the Trail Making Test, parts A and B (TMT A and B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659112437776">22</xref></sup>. These tests require subjects to connect numbered circles by drawing lines with a pencil (part A). Part B requires subjects to connect alternatively numbered and alphabetically labelled circles. These tasks investigate executive functions such as attention, psychomotor speed and cognitive switching skills. Lower scores expressed as time (s) indicate better performances.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>b) Memory with interferences of 10 or 30 s is used as a dual task test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112437776">23</xref></sup>. Subjects are required to remember a sequence of three consonants while they are counting in twos for either 10 or 30 s. These tests evaluate the subject’s working memory skills during an interference task. Scores range from 0 to 9. Lower scores indicate worse performances.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>c) The DST forward is a short-term memory task which consists of a growing series of numbers that the examiner reads aloud<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659112437776">24</xref></sup>. Subjects are required to remember and to repeat them orally. Scores range from 2 to 8 and lower scores indicate a reduced short-term memory span.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>d) Phonemic verbal fluency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659112437776">25</xref></sup>. Subjects are required to name words beginning with a given consonant (e.g. C, P or S). This test investigates lexical access and search processes. Scores are given as the number of words provided. Lower scores indicate worse performances.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267659112437776">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The total number of microemboli which occurred in the left or right MCA was calculated. The total number of solid or gaseous microemboli, regardless of their localisation, and neuropsychological scores were also calculated for each patient. Paired t-test analyses were conducted for the total number of microemboli in the left and right MCAs. The difference between solid and gaseous microemboli was analysed as well. Unpaired t-test analyses were also performed in order to investigate whether the patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement were homogenous for the total number of left or right MCA microembolization as well as for the total number of solid or gaseous microemboli.</p>
<p>Statistical correlations were calculated between the number of microemboli which occurred during intraoperative HVS in the left or right MCAs and early and late postoperative changes in cognitive performance on each of the neuropsychological tests. Statistical correlations were also studied between the number of solid or gaseous microemboli and early and late postoperative changes in cognitive performance on each of the neuropsychological tests. All statistical correlations were conducted using non-parametric Spearman’s correlation coefficients. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered as being statistically significant. STATISTICA 6.1 software was used for each statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>No patients had major neurological postoperative events such as stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), coma, seizures or delirium. No patients had intraoperative warnings related to cerebral hypotension or hypoperfusion. Low doses of dopamine and/or dobutamine were used to facilitate weaning from extracorporeal circulation.</p>
<p>No significant difference was found between the total number of microemboli in the left and right MCAs (t(9) = -1.30, p = 0.23). The number of gaseous microemboli was significantly larger than the number of solid ones (t(10) = -3.75, p = 0.003). Moreover, no significant differences were found between patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement in the total number of microemboli in the left (t(10) = 1.08, p = 0.31) and right MCA (t(9) = -0.80, p = 0.44) as well as in the total number of solid (t(11) = 1.37, p = 0.20) and gaseous microemboli (t(11) = -0.57, p = 0.58).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adverse neurological outcomes and POCD are common complications after cardiac surgery. While Type I adverse cerebral outcomes, such as focal neurological lesions, strokes or TIA, mainly occur due to macroemboli production (62%) or hypoperfusion (10%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267659112437776">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267659112437776">27</xref></sup>, Type II adverse cerebral outcome, such as generalised cognitive decline, has been observed following intraoperative cerebral microembolization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437776">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437776">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112437776">6</xref></sup>. Specifically, Pugsley and colleagues showed that, when the number of microemboli was higher than 1,000, 43% of patients had POCD at their cognitive evaluations at eight weeks compared with 8.6% of patients with fewer than 200 microemboli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437776">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The present study is a report on the relationship between the number of intraoperative microemboli detected by TCD on the left or right with changes in early and late postoperative neuropsychological scores assessing memory, psychomotor and executive functions. Given that the total number of microemboli did not show a significant difference between the left and right MCAs, the findings obtained in the present study have several implications. Our data are in line with previous studies which have shown a relationship between intraoperative microembolization in the left MCA and early POCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112437776">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112437776">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437776">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our findings showed that early POCD in psychomotor and executive functions, as measured by well-validated instruments such as TMT A and TMT B, was associated with microembolization in the left, not in the right, hemisphere. An association between late POCD in psychomotor functioning and verbal memory and microembolization in the left, but not the right, hemisphere was also observed. Hence, it was shown that microembolization in the left MCA which occurs during HVS may involve not only a POCD in verbal memory, but also in psychomotor and executive functions at both the time of discharge and after three months. Indeed, it is known that the parietal and temporal regions of the brain in the left hemisphere are dominant in terms of both psychomotor skills and verbal memory performances as assessed by TMT A/B and DST, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267659112437776">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267659112437776">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our results may extend the previous data by showing that TMT A and TMT B have a high level of sensitivity to microembolization in the left MCA during HVS as well as DST forward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437776">11</xref></sup>. On the other hand, memory tests with 10 and 30 seconds of interference and phonemic fluency tests did not show an adequate level of sensitivity to intraoperative brain damage in the left or the right MCA. It, also, may be suggested that complex tasks evaluating higher cerebral processes (i.e. psychomotor and executive functions), such as TMT A and TMT B, may be more sensitive to brain damage due to intraoperative microemboli when compared to simple tasks, namely, memory with 10 and 30 s of interference or phonemic fluency.</p>
<p>The differential impact of the nature of intraoperative microembolization was investigated as well. In agreement with previous studies, the majority of intraoperative microemboli which occurred during HVS was gaseous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112437776">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112437776">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267659112437776">30</xref></sup>. However, both solid and gaseous microemboli which were detected in the left or right MCA were similarly related with early POCD. This finding suggests that lateralised early cognitive decline was partially independent of the nature of microembolization.</p>
<p>In contrast, cognitive decline after three months in psychomotor functioning and verbal memory in HVS patients was more likely to be associated with gaseous than solid microembolization. It may be suggested that gas microbubbles can induce brain ischemia due to both an occlusive mechanism, exactly what a solid particulate does, and a humoral immune reaction; furthermore, this inflammatory response can lead to local injuries and increase the chance of ischemic results which, in turn, can affect both early and late postoperative cognitive performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267659112437776">31</xref></sup>. Thus, our data also may extend the findings in the existing literature by showing that intraoperative solid microemboli were potentially no more damaging than gaseous ones in terms of early POCD; furthermore, our findings suggest that POCD detected after three month is more likely to be associated with gaseous than solid microembolization. However, research should provide further evidence for the differentiation of gaseous from the particulate emboli with TCD.</p>
<p>An alternative, speculative explanation for the current findings may lie in the relationship between preoperative biomedical risk factors and cognitive deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267659112437776">32</xref></sup>. Specifically, left ventricular dysfunction and/or hypertension have been frequently linked to cognitive deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267659112437776">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267659112437776">34</xref></sup>. However, given that the mean left ventricular dysfunction was in the normal range (i.e., 64.5%) and the mean EuroSCORE was moderate (4.1%), it seems unlikely that the preoperative biomedical risk factors were implicated in POCD.</p>
<p>There are some limitations which must be recognised when interpreting our data. First, this study should be considered as preliminary, given the relatively small sample size. However, the aforementioned correlations are consistent with the previous literature, indicating the impact of the total number of microemboli detected by TCD on cognitive functions. Second, the current study did not employ a composite method for the cognitive outcome, such as the 20% - 20% or SD method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267659112437776">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267659112437776">37</xref></sup>. However, both those methods suffer from an extremely high false-positive rate and “floor effect”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267659112437776">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267659112437776">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, the incidence analysis involves an arbitrary convention to define POCD (i.e., 20% - 20% or SD method). To overcome these limitations, future studies should include a non-surgical control group to use measures such as the reliable change index (RCI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267659112437776">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267659112437776">39</xref></sup>. RCI has recently demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity in defining POCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267659112437776">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267659112437776">37</xref></sup>. RCI seems to have the advantage of incorporating estimates of the practice effects as well. Third, further studies should also include specific and well-validated visuospatial tasks, predominantly involving the right hemisphere, such as the Corsi block task, in order to investigate the potential relationship with intraoperative microembolization detected in the right MCA. Finally, although the single-center approach offered the advantage of a uniform intraoperative management, the present study may have referral bias and may not be representative of standard worldwide procedures. Clearly, future research is warranted to replicate and extend the present findings using a multi-center approach.</p>
<p>As a major strength, we investigated the relationship between the impact of asymmetric intraoperative microembolization and early or three-month POCD in a group with homogenous demographic, clinical and intraoperative characteristics. Indeed, no difference between patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve surgery occurred in both the total number of left or right MCA microembolizations. The present study not only suggests the evidence that intraoperative microemboli are strongly related with early postoperative cognitive dysfunction, but, also, may extend the previous literature, indicating that microembolization in the left, not in the right, MCA is associated with late postoperative cognitive impairment in psychomotor functioning and verbal memory. It was also suggested that intraoperative microembolization induces specific POCD in accordance with the brain region in which they are formed, namely, the left temporal and parietal regions of the brain.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Intraoperative microemboli represent one of the most relevant causes of POCD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, especially when the CPB technique is used. Although future research is warranted to replicate and extend the current findings, our study suggests a potential relationship between the asymmetry and/or the nature of intraoperative microembolization and early and late POCD.</p>
<p>Our data sustain the role of intraoperative cerebral monitoring through TCD in detecting microemboli and in implementing various prevention strategies which, in turn, might reduce or potentially avoid POCD in cardiac surgery patients.</p>
