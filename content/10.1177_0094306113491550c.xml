<p>Santa Muerte or Saint Death, a female depiction of the Grim Reaper, lies at the heart of a growing religious cult in Mexico. In <italic>Devoted to Death</italic>, Andrew Chesnut offers a comprehensive view of the cult to Saint Death, also known as the White Sister or the White Girl. Chesnut narrates the emergence of Saint Death as a new significant patroness of Mexicans whose images currently outsell those of the Virgin of Guadalupe and Saint Judas, two traditional Mexican patrons. This is potentially problematic given the cult’s conflict with the Catholic Church and the Mexican government due to her supposed link to the criminal underworld, evidenced by altars found in apprehended kidnappers’ and drug dealers’ homes dedicated to Saint Death.</p>
<p><italic>Devoted to Death</italic> unpacks the meaning and origin of Saint Death’s following. Perhaps because of the diversity of her followers, which includes migrants, jilted lovers, criminals, and even prison guards, Saint Death embodies many types of favors or miracles that attract people to her. Her powers range from offering financial prosperity to dealing with unfaithful partners, providing safety during drug deals, restoring health, and even assuring special advocacy in legal problems. These favors are sought through candles of various colors or if many are required at once, through a seven-colored candle. Accordingly, each chapter of the book focuses on one of the seven colors associated with Saint Death’s cult and its specific type of favor, while also describing her followers and their adoration practices.</p>
<p>Saint Death’s supporters follow her across borders, thus becoming the new patroness of Mexican and Central American immigrants to the United States. Paraphernalia of the White Sister can be found in large traditionally immigrant cities, as well as in smaller towns. Consequently, anthropologists, sociologists of religion, criminologists, and immigration scholars would all benefit from reading <italic>Devoted to Death</italic> to get a full understanding of the breadth of Santa Muerte’s cult.</p>
