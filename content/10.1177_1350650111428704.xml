<abstract>
<p>NiCr–Ag composite solid lubricant coating was deposited on stainless steel by atmospheric plasma spray. The microhardness, phase composition and microstructure of as-sprayed coating were characterized. Meanwhile, the friction and wear behaviour of as-sprayed coating sliding against ceramic (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) ball in air, argon and oxygen were evaluated using a ball-on-disc friction and wear test rig. It was found that when sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in oxygen, the composite coating underwent severe oxidative wear and splat delamination, showing the highest friction coefficient and wear rate. When sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in argon, the composite coating had the lowest friction coefficient and wear rate; and in this case, no crack and splat delamination could be observed on the worn surface because of the elimination of oxidation of the coating and enrichment of solid lubricant silver on sliding surface in inert atmosphere. In addition, the friction coefficients of the as-sprayed coating in all three atmospheres decreased with the increase of sliding speed or load.</p>

<p>Solid lubricant coatings are primarily adopted to reduce the friction and wear of various frictional pairs under extreme conditions of load, speed and reversed thermal cycling environments, where conventional lubricants usually cannot provide favourable performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111428704">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111428704">2</xref></sup> Various methods such as powder metallurgy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650111428704">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111428704">4</xref></sup> laser cladding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111428704">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111428704">6</xref></sup> and thermal spray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111428704">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650111428704">8</xref></sup> can be utilized to prepare self-lubricating coatings. Thanks to the extremely wide variety of materials that can be used to produce coatings and the ability to apply coatings to substrates without significant heat input, thermal spray process is of particular significance in coating technology. Besides, thermal spray method can be used to recoat worn or damaged coatings without changing substrate properties and dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111428704">9</xref></sup> This is why thermal spray technology is so popular in preparing self-lubricating coatings.</p>
<p>In terms of the application of various self-lubricating coatings, Ni-based solid lubricant is of particular interest in sealed systems, gas turbine parts and nuclear systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650111428704">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650111428704">11</xref></sup> due to its excellent self-lubricating properties over a wide range of temperature. It has been well recognized that silver (Ag) has a larger diffusion coefficient and low shearing stress, which makes it an extremely attractive lubricant for many mechanical components such as bearings, seals and fasteners, due to its good lubricity over a wide range of temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650111428704">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650111428704">13</xref></sup> Therefore, Ni-based self-lubricating composites doped with Ag possess excellent lubricity due to the combination of the advantages of the two components. Driven by this prospect, NASA has successfully developed a series of Ag-doped Ni-based self-lubricating coatings with a working temperature from room temperature to 800°C by plasma spray, where Ag acts as a thermochemically stable solid lubricant at relatively lower temperature from room temperature to approximately 450°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650111428704">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650111428704">15</xref></sup> Tyagi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650111428704">16</xref></sup> investigated the friction and wear behaviour of Ni-based composites containing a combination of solid lubricants Ag and h-BN, and they found that the introduction of the combinatory solid lubricants reduced the friction coefficient from 0.36 to 0.21. Nevertheless, few studies are reported about the friction and wear behaviour of Ag-containing Ni-based composites in different atmospheres. The friction and wear behaviour of tribo-pairs under the participation of atmosphere are quite distinct from those of air condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650111428704">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111428704">18</xref></sup> Shafiei and Alpas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111428704">19</xref></sup> investigated the friction and wear mechanisms of nanocrystalline Ni in ambient and argon (Ar) atmospheres, and found that nanocrystalline Ni showed higher wear rate and friction coefficient in Ar. DellaCorte and Sliney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650111428704">20</xref></sup> studied the effects of atmosphere on the tribological properties of a plasma-sprayed chromium carbide-based self-lubricating coating, and discovered that specimens tested in hydrogen, a reducing environment, exhibited the best tribological properties.</p>
<p>Bearing that perspective in mind and noticing that more and more tribo-pairs need to work under extreme atmospheres in industry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650111428704">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650111428704">22</xref></sup> we focus on the comparison of the friction and wear behaviour as well as wear mechanism of Ni-based self-lubricating coating in air, Ar and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in this research. Thus, NiCr–Ag composite coating was prepared by atmospheric plasma spray. The friction and wear behaviours of as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating in air, Ar and O<sub>2</sub> were comparatively evaluated, and the wear mechanisms of the coating in different environments discussed.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1350650111428704"><title>Preparation of NiCr–Ag composite coating</title>
<p>Commercially obtained feedstock powders of NiCr (Ni-20Cr) and Ag were provided by Beijing Research Institute of Mining &amp; Metallurgy (Beijing, China). Before spraying was done, they were blended at a mass fraction of 90:10. Both NiCr and Ag particles are spherical, and they have sizes of ranges 50∼100 and 80∼120 µm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650111428704">Figure 1</xref>(a) and (b)).

<p>Stainless steel (1Cr18Ni9Ti) discs (24 mm in diameter, 7.75 mm in thickness) with composition oFe-0.1C-1.0Si-2.0Mn-18Cr-9Ni (wt%) were used as the substrates. Prior to plasma spraying, the substrates were sand blasted with corundum grits. An APS2000 atmospheric plasma spray system equipped with a PQ-1S plasma gun (Institute of Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology, Beijing, China) was used to deposit NiCr–Ag composite coating on the sand-blasted substrate under spraying parameters (Ar flow rate 40 L/min, voltage 550 V, current 60 A, powder feed rate 45 g/min and spraying distance 100 mm).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1350650111428704"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>The morphologies of the feedstock powders and as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating were observed using a JSM-5600LV scanning electron microscope (JEOL Corporation, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and a backscattered electron (BSE) detector. The phase compositions of the feedstocks and composite coatings were characterized by a Philips X’Pert MPD X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Netherlands; Cu-Kα radiation) over an angular range from 30° to 90°. The microhardness of the composite coating was evaluated by MH-5VM microhardness tester at a load of 200 g for a duration of 10 s. The porosity of the coating was measured by OLYCIAm3 image analysis software. The worn surfaces of the tribo-pairs and wear debris were analysed using the SEM and a Micro XAM three-dimensional (3D) non-contact surface mapping profiler (ADE Corporation, Massachusetts, USA). The elemental composition of the wear debris was determined using the EDS.</p>
<p>A ball-on-disc tribometer (CSM, Tribo-S-D-0000) equipped with an environment chamber where the gaseous environment could be controlled was adopted to evaluate the friction and wear behaviour of the NiCr–Ag composite coating sliding against commercially obtained Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> balls (Ø6 mm, 1700HV<sub>2N</sub>) in air, Ar and O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres. Before the test, the plasma-sprayed coating was mechanically grounded with 1200 grit emery paper and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for 5 min. The relative humidity of air was kept in the range 20–30%. The purity of Ar and O<sub>2</sub> gases used was better than 99.99% and their relative humidity less than 10%. The sliding wear tests were conducted at room temperature at three different loads 2, 5 and 8 N with a constant speed of 20 cm/s corresponding to contact pressures of 509.1, 690.9 and 808.1 MPa, respectively, and three different sliding speeds 10, 20 and 30 cm/s with a constant load of 5 N. The ambient temperature was 20°C and the sliding distance 360 m. Three replicated tests were conducted for each wear test condition and the averaged value was given. The friction coefficient curves were automatically recorded with a computer, and the wear rate was calculated as <italic>W</italic> = <italic>V</italic>/<italic>SF</italic>, where <italic>V</italic> is the wear volume loss in mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650111428704">3</xref></sup>, <italic>S</italic> the total sliding distance in m and <italic>F</italic> the applied load in N.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111428704">Figure 2</xref> presents the XRD patterns of NiCr–Ag feedstock and as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating. It can be identified from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111428704">Figure 2</xref> that plasma-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating consists of NiCr and Ag phases. No other new phases are detected in as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating, which indicates that the feedstock powders are deposited on the substrate without experiencing any obvious oxidation or decomposition. Besides, the XRD peaks of NiCr–Ag composite coating are broadened, which is highly dependent on the thermal spray process. Namely, when the feedstock powder was melted by the heat source and ejected onto the cooler substrate during thermal spray process, the rapid cooling of the molten particles results in non-equilibrium and metastable phases in the coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350650111428704">25</xref></sup>

It can be seen that as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating has a compact structure and contains a small amount of unmelted particles. EDS analysis shows that the bright areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111428704">Figure 3</xref>(b) are Ag, the grey areas NiCr and the black areas pores. In the meantime, NiCr phase is tightly bonded with Ag phase in the composite coating, and no evident cracks exist at the interface of the two phases.

<sec id="sec7-1350650111428704"><title>Friction and wear behaviour</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111428704">Figure 4</xref> shows typical friction coefficient curves of NiCr–Ag composite coating sliding against its Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> counterpart as functions of sliding distance in air, Ar and O<sub>2</sub> at an applied load of 5 N and a speed of 20 cm/s. It can be seen that NiCr–Ag coating sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in O<sub>2</sub> has the highest average friction coefficient of about 0.9; and it has the lowest friction coefficient when sliding against the same ceramic counterpart in Ar. Besides, the friction coefficient in O<sub>2</sub> tends to obviously increase from 0.6 to 1.0 within the early stage of sliding (up to 40 m), and the average friction coefficient in air lies in between (about 0.5) and also shows a large fluctuation. Two competing factors may be responsible for the larger fluctuation of friction coefficient in air. On one hand, the wear debris produced during friction test may get locked between the sliding surfaces and promote three-body wear. On the other hand, the debris can be compacted to form a protective layer to reduce friction and wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650111428704">16</xref></sup> Moreover, it seems that the friction coefficients in both air and Ar tend to slowly increase with extending sliding distance. In particular, no evident wear debris was produced when the composite coating slid against the ceramic ball in Ar, whereas a large amount of black wear debris was found when it slid against the same counterpart in air and O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres, corresponding well to relevant changing tendency of the friction coefficient.

It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111428704">Figure 5</xref> that coefficients decrease with increased loads in all three atmospheres.

The wear rates in Ar are significantly smaller than those in air and O<sub>2</sub> at all test conditions. It can be found from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111428704">Figure 7</xref> that the wear rates are increased with increase in applied loads. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111428704">Figure 8</xref>, we can also find that with the increase of sliding speed, the wear rates show an initial decrease, and then increase beyond a speed of 20 cm/s. Compared to 10 and 30 cm/s, the values of wear rate in all three atmospheres are smallest at 20 cm/s. It can be inferred that the formation of compacted transfer layer is a more prominent factor in reducing the wear rate of the coating at 20 cm/s.

<p>The effects of load and speed on the friction and wear properties of NiCr–Ag composite coating can be further confirmed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111428704">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650111428704">10</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111428704">Figure 9</xref> exhibits the SEM morphologies of the worn surfaces of composite coating in three atmospheres at varied loads and a constant speed of 20 cm/s. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111428704">Figure 9</xref>, it is seen that the worn surface in all three atmospheres is smoother at 8 N than that at 2 N. This may be so because as load increases, the frictional heat is effective in forming compacted wear debris and larger coverage of transfer layer. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650111428704">Figure 10</xref>, it can also be observed that the worn surfaces in three atmospheres become smoother as the sliding speed increases from 10 to 30 cm/s. More frictional heat is produced at higher sliding speed, which is helpful in forming a compacted transfer layer. The wear rate of the NiCr–Ag coating has been generally observed to increase with the increasing load. This phenomenon can be explained by the coating suffering higher Hertz load and repeated shear stress with increased load, which leads to higher wear rate, though high load can help in forming compacted wear debris.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1350650111428704">Figure 11</xref> shows the micrographs of the worn surfaces of NiCr–Ag composite coating tested in air, Ar and O<sub>2</sub> at 5 N and 20 cm/s. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111428704">Figure 5</xref>(a), the worn surface of NiCr–Ag composite coating sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in air is dominated by parallel scratches, which are attributed to abrasive wear by the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> counterpart with a much higher hardness than the as-sprayed composite coating; some pits are found on the worn surface due to splat delamination of the thermally sprayed composite coating with weak intersplat cohesion. Besides, a smooth glaze layer is observed in the worn surface of the composite coating in air, which is attributed to the compaction of wear debris. The worn surface of the composite coating sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in O<sub>2</sub> is dominated by pits and scratches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1350650111428704">Figure 11</xref>(c)), which is closely related to the accelerated oxidation of the coating at elevated temperatures in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>. The oxidized products are liable to form wear debris under sustained shear force during sliding. The wear debris composed of oxidized products of the friction pair is finally compacted and deposited on wear track, leading to severe three-body abrasive wear and hence significantly increased friction coefficient and wear rate. Contrary to the above, no cavities are visible on the wear track of the NiCr–Ag composite coating sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in Ar, and only a few shallow grooves emerge thereon. This may be dependent on two factors. On the one hand, as-sprayed coating has no chance to be oxidized when it slides against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in inert Ar, thus greatly reducing the possibility of splat delamination. On the other hand, in the absence of splat delamination, Ag with excellent lubricity in as-sprayed composite coating can enrich on the sliding surface to form a lubricating film and result in reduced friction coefficient and wear rate, which is supported by the elemental composition of the wear tracks of the as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in different atmospheres (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350650111428704">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, the worn surface of the composite coating in Ar consists of the largest amount of Ag and the smallest amount of Si.

It can be seen that the wear scar in O<sub>2</sub> is the widest and deepest, that in air lies in between, and the one in Ar is the narrowest and shallowest, corresponding well to relevant SEM images of worn surfaces and wear rate of the composite coating in different atmospheres. Besides, two peaks appear on the edges of the wear scar of the as-sprayed composite coating in Ar, corresponding to its plastic deformation under Hertz load.

It is seen that the worn surfaces of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> balls in air and O<sub>2</sub> show grooves and adhesion pits, whereas the worn ceramic ball surface in Ar is relatively smooth and shows only hint sign of scratching and adhesion. This indicates that the counterpart ceramic balls suffer more severe wear in air and O<sub>2</sub> than in Ar. When friction and wear tests were conducted in air and O<sub>2</sub>, flake-like wear debris were generated and compacted on sliding surface under repeated shear and compressive stresses, forming detached wear debris consisting of hard particles that originated from the coating and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ball and resulting in severe three-body abrasive wear. When friction and wear tests were conducted in inert Ar, however, oxidative wear was eliminated and splat detachment of the coating considerably prevented. As a result, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ball experienced no three-body abrasive wear and hence the scratching and adhesion on its worn surface were greatly weakened. Besides, solid lubricant Ag with poor wettability to Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ball in Ar might also contribute to the significantly retarded adhesion on the worn surface of the ceramic ball, due to lack of transfer film thereon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350650111428704">26</xref></sup>

When sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in Ar, as-sprayed NiCr–Ag composite coating was dominated by plastic deformation and free of splat delamination. As a result, no evident wear debris was found at the end of the friction and wear test in Ar. Lamella-like wear debris were collected at the end of the friction and wear tests in both air and O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres. However, the size of the wear debris in O<sub>2</sub> is about four times that in air, corresponding to more serious splat delamination of the as-sprayed coating in O<sub>2</sub>. The elemental compositions of the wear debris in air and O<sub>2</sub>, analysed by EDS, are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350650111428704">Table 3</xref>. It can be seen that the wear debris in O<sub>2</sub> consists of a larger amount of Si and Ag. This indicates that the counterpart Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ball suffers more severe abrasion and damage in O<sub>2</sub>, since Si element in the wear debris is originated from the ceramic ball. Besides, a larger amount of Ag in the wear debris in O<sub>2</sub> corresponds to severe detachment and loss of solid lubricant Ag in the composite coating, conforming to poorer wear resistance of the coating in O<sub>2</sub>.

<sec id="sec8-1350650111428704" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Self-lubricating NiCr–Ag composite coating was produced on stainless steel by atmospheric plasma spray. NiCr–Ag coating in Ar shows the lowest friction coefficient and wear rate compared with that in air and O<sub>2</sub>, which is attributed to the enrichment of Ag on the sliding surface and the alleviation of splat flaking. When sliding against Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in O<sub>2</sub>, NiCr–Ag coating has the highest friction coefficient and wear rate, which is attributed to the accelerated oxidation of the coating. The friction coefficients in all atmospheres decrease with increasing speed and load due to the presence of smooth transfer layer at high speed and load. We may come to the conclusion that atmospheric plasma-sprayed NiCr–Ag self-lubricating composite coating exhibits poor lubricating property in oxidizing atmosphere and shows excellent lubrication function in O<sub>2</sub>-free atmosphere.</p></sec>
