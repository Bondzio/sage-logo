<abstract>
<p>This paper considers two models of idiocy: one based around quantitative deviation from the norm and the other on qualitative variation. In doing so, the paper shows three things. First, it shows that apparently contradictory strategies coexist within the same discourses. Second, both cases produce the idiot as Other. Third, that the production and reproduction of Otherness creates difficulties in policing the conceptual boundary between the normal and the abnormal. The maintenance of boundaries does not adhere to either the essential nature of intellectual disability or logical coherence. Instead it is something that has to be perpetually accomplished. This has important consequences for the linkage between psychological models of intellectual disability and social inclusion. The paper concludes that no discourse on intellectual disability can eliminate Otherness.</p>

<body>
<p>Questions about the nature of intellectual disability and its putative quantitative or qualitative difference from the norm have been a prominent feature of debates about the subject for well over a century. This has generally taken the form of whether intellectual disability has an essential nature, and the logical and empirical validity of its recognition and classification. At times it has paralleled and masked a tension and struggle between medical and non-medical psychological approaches to the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354310378375">Rose, 1989</xref>), with medical models being assumed to emphasize difference and psychological ones, commonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310378375">Gelb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354310378375">Simpson, 2001</xref>). Even within psychology, however, conflict has existed between those who regard the psychology of intellectual disability as differing only in degree from the norm, and those who regard it as following a different developmental trajectory—the “developmental-difference” debate of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354310378375">Zigler and Balla’s (1982)</xref> text. In addition, the development of progressive services has frequently been linked to emphasizing the capacity for development of intellectually disabled individuals and the continuity between those of normal and retarded levels of intelligence (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310378375">O’Brien, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354310378375">Ryan &amp; Thomas, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354310378375">Wolfensberger, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310378375">Jackson (1996)</xref> also suggests that the absence of an absolute division between the idiot and the non-idiot child was not only a hallmark of the pedagogical institutions that arose in the 19th century, but was in fact a precondition of their very existence. It was this belief, he argues, that allowed the reformists to conceive of the idiot child as educable, as capable of learning, at least partially, the skills necessary for self-sustaining adult life. Such a perspective was reflected in the United Kingdom in the 1898 <italic>Report of the Developmental Committee on Defective and Epileptic Children</italic>, which stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>it is only difference of degree which distinguishes the feeble-minded children . . . on the one side from the backward children . . . and, on the other side, from the children who are too deficient to receive proper benefit from any teaching which the School Authorities can give. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310378375">Jackson, 1996</xref>, p. 164)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This approach accords with a view of idiocy as a mental <italic>deficiency</italic>, in other words, a quantitative difference from the norm. Jackson argues that with the rise of eugenics a new model came to replace this one, which regarded idiots as pathological and different in kind to the normal population. Thus, he argues, there was a sharp conceptual shift at the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>These approaches are predicated on an implicit assumption that, by strength of conceptual logic, models based on quantitative variance reduce or eliminate the Otherness of intellectual disability. However, analysis of conceptual models from the 19th century shows that there was coexistence of clear pathological variance and quantitative variation within the same model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310378375">Carlson, 2005</xref>)—in the UK “mental deficiency” is used interchangeably with “mental defect” though the latter implies qualitative difference—something wrong, as opposed to something lacking. The profound shift in medicine, beginning around the end of the 18th century, and linked most closely with French physician, François-Joseph-Victor Broussais, was predicated on the belief that the pathological state was only quantitatively, and not qualitatively, different from normal functioning. According to the dominant model of clinical medicine in the 19th century, although disease was based on tissular lesion, it caused normal physiological functions to alter only by either amplification or diminution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310378375">Canguilhem, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310378375">Porter, 1997</xref>). By exploring exemplars of the two broad conceptual strands, this paper will show that the radical alterity of intellectual disability occurs in both and, in consequence, question whether any discourse on intellectual disability can successfully dismantle the Otherness that it actively constructs. It raises two issues for analysis. The first is to explore how Otherness is accomplished as a discursive fact, rather than a logical necessity. The second is to show that the central problem for conceptual models of idiocy was boundary maintenance.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354310378375">
<title>Idiocy as Other</title>
<p>The Otherness of idiocy was accomplished in many ways. John Langdon Down, for instance, produced a racial typology of idiotic types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310378375">Down, 1866</xref>); later it would take shape in eugenics: feeblemindedness as the vector of disease, the source of crime, and social problems of all description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354310378375">Trent, 1994</xref>). These discourses featured the standard characteristics of overtly negative Othering: stigmatization and stereotyping; associations with danger and impurity; animality, physical deformity, and degeneracy; they were heavily gendered and racialized, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310378375">Sibley, 1995</xref>). However, clear examples of both conceptual approaches can be found in discourses centering on the “care,” “treatment,” and “education” of idiots, rather than the protection of society from their menace even in the 19th century, for example the work of Edouard Seguin and William Ireland. As we shall see below, the source of the Othering of idiocy lay in the need for successful identification of idiots as a broad group, though less so for the specific <italic>types</italic> that would also be identified.</p>
<p>That said, a number of these characteristics do feature in the work of both Seguin and Ireland. Connections with race and animality surface in Seguin’s adherence to recapitulation theory of foetal development, whilst Ireland adopts certain of the labels, if not the theory, of racial typology. Gender figures principally in the form of the mother of the idiot—the mother whose poverty, idle luxury, intemperance, or constitutional weakening led to idiocy in their offspring.</p>
<p>The focus of this paper, however, is on the question of boundary maintenance in the distinguishing of “idiotic” from “normal” children. Specifically, how were boundaries achieved and sustained in the two models of idiocy when idiocy invariably involved some notion of quantitative variation in mental functioning, or the even more contingent variability of associated social functioning. The problem confronting the specialist on idiocy was the difficulty of distinguishing between the normal and the pathological at the lower end of normality and the upper end of idiocy. These difficulties, compounded by the absence of the conceptual framework and technologies of intelligence testing, involve the unavoidable presence of “liminal zones or spaces of ambiguity and discontinuity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310378375">Sibley, 1995</xref>, p. 33). The Othering of idiocy required the elimination of the ambiguous zone in which the discourse on idiocy presented its weakest point.</p>
<p>For Gelb, discourses on mental retardation exhibit a “typological fallacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310378375">1997</xref>, p. 452)—the (erroneous) assumption that there are discrete types of humans whose essential characteristics can be studied and which subordinate individual variation. However, it is not clear what foundation such an approach would leave for itself to distinguish between “genuine” types of things, and “false” or “constructed” ones. Categorization is intrinsically discursive and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310378375">Gieryn (1999)</xref> convincingly demonstrates, disciplinary boundaries are not essential, they are accomplishments that must be continuously made and remade. Furthermore, there is a further implication that typing is something that is done <italic>to</italic> human subjects. Though not within the ambit of this paper, this approach ignores the ways in which subjects become constituted through such knowledge practices, as are possibilities of being and becoming.</p>
<p>In these terms, idiocy can be seen as the suppressed other term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310378375">Derrida, 2002</xref>), silent in any discussion of the “normal” child. For instance, it is only when confronting intellectual disability that we must refer to “mainstream schools,” otherwise, they are merely “schools.” However, idiocy itself has a suppressed other, the “merely backward” or “dull” child, who may be confused with idiocy. The backward must be marginalized and excised from the discourse on idiocy wherever possible precisely because of the threat it poses for the difference between the idiot and normal child. The backward child, however, poses a constant threat of irruption into the system, leaving the question of idiocy ultimately irresolvable. As Shildrick observes in relation to biomedicine, “what is at stake in traditional health-care practices is that the material boundaries of the body should be secure and that otherness be excluded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310378375">1997</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>Such exclusion, however, can never be fully accomplished; what Shildrick calls this “leaky logos” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310378375">1997</xref>, p. 107) prevents complete conceptual closure. As Spivak notes, a suppressed category must occupy the silent space between the dominant and the subordinate, for instance between the British colonial elite and the subaltern classes in India there existed an ambiguous indigenous elite class. This class formed a blurred, indeterminate, and shifting boundary between the elite and the subaltern masses; sometimes part of the dominant group, sometimes part of the dominated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310378375">Spivak, 2003</xref>). In our case the boundary is between the normal and the pathological and in the remainder of the paper the matter of boundary maintenance in relation to intellectual disability will be explored. Two models of idiocy from the 19th century shall be considered, and the question of how they accomplish and sustain difference will be examined, as well as the points at which they both separate and connect.</p>

<sec id="section2-0959354310378375">
<title>The two-dimensional matrix</title>
<p>Seguin and most of his contemporaries divided and distributed the diagnostic criteria for idiocy on axes that were implicitly quantitative, even though not measured <italic>per se</italic>: intellect, willpower, physiological functioning, and such like. Idiots were deemed to be at a lower point in each of these areas than their normal peers (precisely how being dependent on both individual physician and idiot). Such indicators “logically” seem to imply continua from the most to the least able, or from the normal to the pathological. Thus the separation between the idiot and the non-idiot appears, therefore, to become somewhat arbitrary. How then is the separation achieved and sustained in practice?</p>
<p>In distinguishing the idiot from the merely “backward” child, the <italic>enfant arrière</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310378375">Seguin (1866)</xref> suggests that it is a differential rate of progress which constitutes the categories; the idiot makes little or no developmental progress, compared to the ordinary child, whilst the backward child develops in degrees intermediate to the two groups. However, even for the proponents of institutional reform, such a unifying conception, were it to be the exclusive strategy, would also have cut against both the administrative imperative of determining categories (and assigning people to those categories) and the medical imperative of isolating the pathological entity and individual for treatment and study. Taking a similar approach to Seguin, Duncan and Millard, for example, in spite of their eight levels of classification according to levels of functioning, itself deemed a variable, assert that, “The distinction between the perfect and the imperfect mind is . . . clear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310378375">1866</xref>, p. 3). For Seguin also, despite their nearness in many respects, the idiot differs from the backward child qualitatively on the basis of “arrest” rather than “retardation” of development. Even the statement that, “This child may be, and is in fact, actually educated with the confirmed idiot; and there is no inconvenience, but advantage, in their being treated alike” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310378375">Seguin, 1866</xref>, p. 67) implies that clear distinctions can be made, at least theoretically. It is thus clear that within the framework of the continua there is also in operation a more sharply divisive technology based on pathological concepts.</p>
<p>As noted above, dominant models of disease in the 19th century held pathological and normal phenomena to be essentially the same, that is to say pathology constituted abnormal functions by hyper- or hypo-activity, but never new functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310378375">Canguilhem, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310378375">Tansey, 1993</xref>). The question arises as to when a quantitative variation becomes pathological. Generally speaking, the answer would be, when it is associated with actual tissular lesion and when the variation in normal physiological functioning impaired physical and social functioning. However, in the field of idiocy such clear distinctions are more difficult. Here intermediary categories, such as “imbecile” and “simpleton,” “dull” and “backward” play clear discursive functions by constituting a “grey” area between the normal and the pathological. They are an ambiguous zone mopping up the bottom end of the normal intellect and the borderline pathological and thus minimize the problem of defining idiocy sharply from the norm. So, instead of forming a linear continuum, the classification of idiocy forms a two-dimensional matrix, with dimensions of diagnosis forming one axis and quantitative variation in functional capacity running down the other. In this matrix pathology is determined as a threshold in quantitative variation, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959354310378375">Figure 1</xref> illustrates.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is only within the specific discussions on classification that idiots are compared with simpletons, or even imbeciles. Instead by concentrating on idiots in comparison with normal children their “Otherness” is constructed and maintained as self-evident, as the comment by Duncan and Millard made clear. One could also argue that there is a prevailing tendency to see backwardness as a lesser but still pathological condition. Certainly the identification of children deemed incapable of benefiting from normal schooling because of “mental defect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310378375">Binet &amp; Simon, 1914</xref>) and the “discovery of the moron” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310378375">Gelb, 1987</xref>) by Goddard considerably expanded the pathological category of feeble-mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310378375">Goddard, 1976</xref>), creating the now recognizable threshold of mild mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354310378375">World Health Organization, 1992</xref>). This expansion squeezed the intermediate sub-pathological category, now “borderline retardation,” into a narrower band of intelligence or social competence, though the function remained much the same. We can see this conceptual function played by intermediate categories if we consider the two highest categories of idiocy in Howe’s three-part classification, originally published in 1848:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Fools</bold> are a higher class of idiots, in whom the brain and nervous system are so far developed as to give partial command of the voluntary muscles; who have consequently considerable power of locomotion and animal action; partial development of the affective and intellectual faculties, but only the faintest glimmer of reason, and very imperfect speech.</p>
<p><bold>Simpletons</bold> are the highest class of idiots, in whom the harmony between the nervous and muscular system is nearly perfect; who consequently have normal powers of locomotion and animal action; considerable activity of the perceptive and affective faculties; and reason enough for their simple individual guidance, <italic>but not enough for their social relations</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310378375">Howe, 1848/1972</xref>, p. 7; emphasis altered)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What distinguishes the simpleton from the normal person is not physical or mental pathology, which are “nearly perfect”; rather, it is the deficit in social competence. It is only when the stage of “fool” is reached that nervous and muscular pathology become evident. “Simpleton” constitutes a zone of ambiguity, emphasizing the difference between the pathological idiot and the normal child. Similarly, Spitzka’s medical textbook on insanity recognizes three grades of arrested development, idiocy, imbecility, and feeble-mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310378375">Spitzka, 1883</xref>), but his nosography of insanity includes only the first two. Spitzka also asserts,<disp-quote>
<p>There is a complete series of transitions, beginning at the lower end with the non-viable anencephalous monster and passing up through the brain-monstrosity, the microcephalous, the idiot, the imbecile, and the feeble-minded, to the normal person. This transition is at once structural and physiological. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310378375">Spitzka, 1883</xref>, p. 275)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Spitzka does not even restrict himself to the quantitative measures of intellect in order to talk of a continuum. Consistent with the physiological tradition in medicine, Spitzka sees no absolute dividing lines between the idiot and the normal person even in relation to the anatomical dimension of idiocy. And yet, as is clear from his nosography, this does not prevent him from constructing the pathological genus of idiocy and imbecility. Therefore, the arbitrary logic of the divisions that operated did not prevent either a binary approach to classification, or the development of a pathological conception of idiocy. What is particularly interesting is the way in which the conceptual basis of the continuum and that of binary classification were held in tension, circulating as a dual strategy in a single program.</p>

<sec id="section3-0959354310378375">
<title>Towards a three-dimensional matrix</title>
<p>The measurement of putative functional sequelae has been a consistent thread in the modern discourse on intellectual disability. After the early work of Seguin and Howe, it found even greater systematization with IQ testing technologies and the expansion of the category of feeble-mindedness and in eugenics. However, prior to these developments another stream emerged in which the Otherness of idiocy was even more sharply defined than with the two-dimensional matrix. It was at this point that the classification of idiocy began to operate along lines other than simple qualitative measures of intelligence, and replaced or supplemented these with the identification and description of idiot <italic>types</italic>. Down had attempted a racial classification of idiots according to physiognomic characteristics, though it was not to prove of lasting significance, despite leaving an almost indelible residue in terminology. The more significant development was the classification of idiocy by pathological <italic>type</italic>. Ireland’s text <italic>On Idiocy and Imbecility</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310378375">1877</xref>) was prototypical of this approach and influenced early developments among the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310378375">Kanner, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p>With Ireland, we move to a three-dimensional classification, which introduces various pathological types of idiocy along a third axis, namely genetous, microcephalic, eclampsic, epileptic, hydrocephalic, paralytic, cretinoid, traumatic, inflammatory, and idiocy by deprivation. As with the two-dimensional matrix, a pathological division is still implicit on the quantitative measures of symptoms. However, the additional dimension of the matrix constitutes an etiological classification of pathological types that is qualitative rather than quantitative. The etiological dimension implies tissular lesion, even though the largest category is the “genetous” type—those for whom the nature or location of the lesion have not <italic>yet</italic> been identified. However, the assessment of the idiocy or imbecility is <italic>de facto</italic> a prerequisite of more accurate pathological diagnosis. All of the points that might be assigned in Ireland’s schema are, by definition, pathological. This matrix, therefore, does not hold the “normal” at all. Nor does it accommodate any obviously ambiguous zones. It merely establishes the dispersion of idiot types.</p>
<p>Ireland explicitly rejects purely quantitative approaches based on “simply a deficiency of the psyche” in favor of those that concentrate upon the nutritional infirmity of the brain and nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310378375">1877</xref>, p. 39). Seguin also began from a similar definition of idiocy as “<italic>a specific infirmity . . . produced by deficiency of nutrition in utero and neo-nati</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310378375">1866</xref>, p. 39), but he then went on to evolve and work within a framework which emphasized the plasticity and continuity of physiological functioning. Ireland, by contrast, maintained the pathological definition as central and attempted to advance a more orthodox medical approach by developing a nosography of pathological species. The second model is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959354310378375">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0959354310378375-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The two main axes of the matrix correspond to what Ireland referred to as the “pathological” (the types) and the “psychic,” corresponding loosely to intelligence, represented on the vertical scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310378375">Ireland, 1877</xref>, p. 38). Used in their undifferentiated form, the terms “idiocy” and “imbecility” constitute the psychic manifestations of the various pathological species; a categorization Ireland refers to as “insanity.” Though Ireland generally focuses on intellect in relation to the various possible quantitative measures, the others given here are neither untypical nor unfamiliar; the pathological types are those that he identifies, and the three grades given on the vertical axis relate to Ireland’s scale as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>I. Those who can receive sensory impressions . . . who have sensations which they do not reduce to perceptions. They possess only . . . passive intellect . . .</p>
<p>II. Those who have also the power to compare, reason upon, and draw general conclusions from the [sensory impressions] and who have the active intellect . . .</p>
<p>III. In the third grade they can form abstract ideas. This class includes all higher degrees of idiocy, and would probably require further subdivision. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310378375">Ireland, 1877</xref>, p. 263)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The vertical scales of Ireland’s matrix could, of course, be extended to include individuals of normal reasoning powers, but who fitted one of the pathological types. However, since the matrix is itself based on the classification of idiocy, in practice no-one inserted into it would be likely to achieve normality on any of the scales, and even if they did, they would still be pathological by virtue of their epilepsy, microcephaly, or other condition, and even a “genetous” idiot (where no specific etiology was diagnosed) would not be assigned to any position unless they had already been assessed as below the thresholds of quantitative measurement and therefore being diagnosed as idiotic.</p>
<p>Therefore, “idiocy” can refer either to a grade on the quantitative measures (idiot–imbecile–feeble-minded) <italic>or</italic> simply to the sum of the three dimentional matrix. Hence, it is possible to talk about microcephaly as a species of idiocy even though some microcephalics may potentially be imbecile or backward. This in itself marks the second matrix as similar to the two-dimensional one of Ireland’s predecessors, but with the exception that it does not assign any position or direct connection to the non-idiotic. Ireland’s classification clearly comes into play only after the initial diagnosis of idiocy. Unlike the classifications of Howe and Seguin, it does not directly contribute to the initial assessment of an idiotic condition, though each of the types will have its own diagnostic tests, symptoms, characteristics, and so on. It should also be noted that even within the two-dimensional matrix, the measures described do not correspond to the actual practices of assigning diagnoses. First of all, idiots were still being initially identified prior to any “testing” and also the kinds of techniques employed by physicians prior to institutional admittance did not lend to accurate differential placing on diagnostic scales, hence the relatively crude and broadly conceived classifications typically employed. They formed conceptual functions rather than practical ones insofar as their role in determining the shape and formation of the developing scientific discourse on idiocy was of far greater significance than their practical application, at least at that point.</p>
<p>This then raises a question: if the classification does not serve immediate diagnostic purposes, what purposes does it serve? It is certainly clear from the practice in Ireland’s own institution, the Scottish National Institution of Imbecile Children, of dividing the patients for treatment purposes according to grade of educability, that it is not the differentiation of treatment that is being aimed at. Treatment is not being determined by type, and nor do the pathological types imply any grading on the vertical axis. Some conditions may have specific treatments that are deemed necessary, medications for epilepsy, for instance. However, these are not the primary determinants of treatment, nor are they the principal reason for the classificatory system.</p>
<p>By arranging the discourse of idiocy in this way, idiocy and imbecility become more precisely “effects” and, if not exactly “symptoms” of disorder, at least secondary elements, rather than being constitutive of the pathology themselves. In other words, idiocy primarily became significant insofar as it <italic>pointed</italic> to organic disorder, rather than having significance in itself as a psychic deficit. Ireland thus undoes one of Seguin’s principal maneuvers by directing attention back onto the pathological anatomy of idiocy. However, the move is far from complete. Ireland, still considered the deficiency of intellect and not the organic impairment of the senses as <italic>de facto</italic> the constituting factor in idiocy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310378375">Ireland, 1877</xref>, p. 254). For instance, it was intellectual deficit that, by definition, marked epileptic idiocy off from epilepsy simple. The “want of intellect” thus comes existentially first in the diagnosis, but conceptually second. The physician uses the assessment of intellectual power in order to more accurately diagnose the extent and nature of the underlying pathology. This ordering is evident in the following passage:<disp-quote>
<p>No amount of skill in the diagnosis of the pathological conditions can dispense with the careful analysis of the existing mental powers. On the other hand, by ascertaining the amount of intelligence, we can form some notion as to the amount of nervous or cerebral lesion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310378375">Ireland, 1877</xref>, p. 261)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The initial assessment and diagnosis were done on the basis of establishing the strength of the mental faculties. However, any deficiencies found were taken as signs of the actual pathology, which is the nervous or cerebral lesion. In an obvious sense, this much could be attributed to Seguin also. The crucial difference was that Seguin offered no basis for differentiating between lesions that gave rise to different types of physiological, anatomical, or psychological impairment. In Ireland, this differentiation is fundamental. What Seguin differentiated and laid out were the differences of type and degree of physiological deficit. In anatomical terms these did not refer to the lesions, and thus the real pathology, but to the signs and effects of pathology. Ireland’s model thus signified a re-situation of the discourse on idiocy away from the physiological model towards pathological anatomy.</p>

<title>Reproducing the Other</title>
<p>The analysis of the two conceptual strands leads to a number of conclusions. First, the Otherness of intellectual disability is sustained in both, even if accomplished and managed in different ways. Second, the two cannot even be considered as logically exclusive since they exist within the same systems, even where one becomes suppressed in favor of the other. Third, the constitution and maintenance of boundaries do not function by virtue of either essence or logic.</p>
<p>In his discussion of the <italic>enfant arrière</italic> Seguin wrestled with a potentially troublesome boundary zone, in which the demand and desire for clear categorization was hampered by the lingering sense of its impossibility. Concepts that led to the exponential growth of the pathological category in the early part of the 20th century were hemmed back by the subsequent trend towards interpreting juvenile delinquency in terms of failed socialization. These gradually replaced the eugenic explanation in terms of feeblemindedness in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354310378375">Rubington &amp; Weinberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354310378375">Thomson, 1996</xref>), and challenged the upper-end of the category of moron.</p>
<p>For Ireland, the category of genetous idiocy was the mechanism for containing and suppressing the ambiguous. It allowed him to place in suspension the majority of cases of idiocy, for whom no pathological cause could be established, a conceptual holding tank whilst they awaited etiological clarification. Ireland even included the “Kalmuc” or “Mongolian” type in the genetous category because, even though it appeared to be the most common form of idiocy, he was not in a position to identify its etiology having rejected Down’s explanation of racial atavism. The deferral of closure in the nosographic system is framed in terms of the ongoing investigations of medical investigation that time and effort will eventually complete.</p>
<p>These observations lead to a different set of positions in relation to current debates on the classification and definition of mental retardation. In particular, we should not express surprise at the persistence of “error” and responding with the doomed attempt to replace it with critiques that also lapse into foundationalism. For example,<disp-quote>
<p>Because Down’s classification depended upon 19th century degeneracy theory . . . it should have <italic>logically</italic> [emphasis added] disappeared when Mendelian genetics was accepted at the beginning of the 20th century. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310378375">Gelb, 1997</xref>, p. 452)</p>
<p>[Goddard’s IQ] insights did not keep him . . . from promoting an essentialist, typological definition of <italic>mental retardation</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310378375">Gelb, 1997</xref>, p. 452)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All of which has some serious implications for current developments in the field of intellectual disability, particularly the drive for social inclusion. The trend towards multi-factorial definitions of mental retardation as a mutable condition since 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310378375">Gelb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354310378375">Simpson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354310378375">Stevens, 1964</xref>), for instance, is highly unlikely to diminish the Otherness of mental retardation. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310378375">1992</xref> manual of the AAMR (American Association on Mental Retardation) on classification identified two main implications for researchers. First, the identification and assessment of research participants will need to be more precise, extensive, and rigorous, covering a wide range of factors associated with the definition. Second, a shift in focus onto the individual’s environment and supports as independent variables, with social functioning and quality of life as dependent. Even Howe, in 1848, recognized that a person might be regarded as idiotic in one environment—the urbane sophisticated society of the cities—but not in another—such as rural communities, where the ability to read and write, for instance, was less significant for social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310378375">Howe, 1848/1972</xref>). This insight did not and could not lead to any reduction in “Othering.” Indeed, it was directly connected to a period in which the conceptual technology was being enhanced. The redefinition of 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310378375">Heber, 1959</xref>) implied a promise of blurred divisions, continua, changes in levels of social competence, and so forth, but it was accompanied by a significant rise in the amount of research into retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354310378375">“Recommendations on Mental Retardation,” 1967</xref>), most markedly with the founding of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency in 1964 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310378375">Clarke, 1991</xref>). The IASSMD attempted, amongst other things, to promote international epidemiological studies, standardize terminology and classification, and disseminate scientific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354310378375">Parmenter, 2004</xref>). As “it” became more mutable and its thresholds more arbitrary, the more it was studied.</p>
<p>The current American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disability (AAIDD) position promises more of the same. The less clear-cut mental retardation becomes, the more important it seems to be to be increasingly rigorous in our research on it and to do it on a larger scale. This is a combination of circumstances that seems inconducive to any reduction in putative difference between those who <italic>have</italic> an intellectual disability and those who do not. Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354310378375">Waldschmidt (2005)</xref> observes, the failure of strategies of inclusion to maintain sufficient strength of bonding from the normative center to the boundary are likely to result in the redrawing of rigid and narrow borders. Hence policies of inclusion rarely permit genuine boundary transgression.</p>
<p>The question to which this paper leads is, Can psychology produce a liberating discourse on intellectual disability? Spivak’s conclusion to the question “Can the subaltern speak?” was “No,”: “ . . . the intellectual is complicit in the persistent constitution of Other as the Self’s shadow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310378375">Spivak, 2003</xref>, p. 320).</p>
<p>In later clarifications of this stark and frequently unwelcome judgment, Spivak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310378375">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310378375">1996b</xref>) points to the fact that the voice of the subaltern is invariably filtered or channeled, however sympathetically, through modes of speaking that already exist and that are implicated in the very production of their Otherness to begin with. In the case of intellectual disability, the apparent ineluctability of the question posed is itself the product of a discourse that simultaneously holds out the promise of an answer and withholds its possibility. Insofar as a liberating discourse can be equated with one that eliminates Otherness, or at least the subalternity of difference, neither of the models considered in this paper suggests that either mutability or the arbitrary logic of quantitative variation have an effect. Alterity does not, however, signify that intellectual disability does, after all, have a biological or psychic essence. The inability to grasp its target in a consistent manner and the extreme variability in the classified group implies otherwise. Most importantly, the unmanageability of the boundary zone and the frequent ambiguity of subjects made to occupy it point both to the absence of an essence as well as to the need that the discourse itself generates for Otherness. A discourse on intellectual disability cannot undo itself. It does not colonize the Other, it brings it into being. With whatever transformations, a discourse on intellectual disability is constrained to reproduce intellectual disability. In the case of both conceptual models considered here, there is no <italic>a priori</italic> material or conceptual entity around which discourse develops. Instead, they both produce alterity in the way in which they manage conceptual boundaries, separating that which <italic>is</italic> intellectual disability from that which is not.</p>
<p>Comparison with disability studies is apposite here. As with race or gender, the key emphasis here has not been to eliminate alterity <italic>per se</italic> but to take control of the discourse that constitutes that difference and subvert existing relations of power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310378375">Mercer (2002)</xref> identifies four key features of an “emancipatory” approach to disability research: adherence to a social model of disability; the abandonment of researcher neutrality; inversion of power in the traditional researcher-subject dyad, and methodological pluralism. What emerges from this paradigm, and particularly its close association with the development of the disability movement itself, is not the repudiation of difference but the fundamental reconceptualization of the nature of that difference. Indeed, there is a lingering material essentialism around the question of “impairment” (as opposed to the oppressive social reaction to impairment, which is what constitutes “disability”). However, in the case of intellectual disability, the situation is more complex. History would suggest that its existence and development as a social category is even more of a contingent artifact than gender, race, or disability generally. It exhibits far greater conceptual mutability; variability in scope of targeting, and inconsistency, both across time and at any given point, than other discourses of human alterity. Beyond the struggle against oppression itself, there is no obvious basis for a reformed positive social identity in the way there has been for women, members of oppressed ethnic groups, or people with alternative sexual orientations. An emancipatory discourse of intellectual disability could only derive from a political pragmatism that recognized that the absence of any discourse whatsoever would mean that many people enmeshed in it presently would be worse off and less able to contend with the demands of the circumstances in which they found themselves. Such a discourse, however, must inevitably reconstitute the Other and accept (or even embrace) the inevitability of boundary ambiguity. It might, though, still succeed in minimizing the social significance of that difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310378375">Goodey, 1996</xref>). If that is neither possible nor desirable, then the only other strategy is the undermining of the very possibility of speaking about intellectual disability.</p>
<p>The paper leads to two main conclusions. The first is to emphasize the importance of facilitating the voices of people with intellectual disabilities themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310378375">Kitzinger &amp; Wilkinson (1996)</xref> respond to the charge that any attempt to speak in a liberating way about the Other merely reproduces the Otherness in a new guise by arguing that the invalidation of any talk of anything, or anyone other than ourselves would itself lead to exclusion and the denial of experiences. Intellectual disability also raises a number of complications that are not present in relation to ethnicity or gender, for instance, most notably that the majority of people so defined would rather escape such a social status than redefine it (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310378375">Edgerton’s classic study, 1967</xref>). However, the self-advocacy movement has emerged as a very powerful voice for people with intellectual disabilities in North America, the UK, Australasia, and elsewhere, exerting much greater influence on the discourses framing the lives of those who are prepared to accept, at least in some form, an identity as someone with an intellectual disability, or whatever other term may be adopted in their context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310378375">Goodley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310378375">Hayden, Lakin, Braddock, &amp; Smith, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The second area for consideration is the role of the academic (and professional) in challenging Otherness and creating more ethical and reciprocal relationships with people with intellectual disabilities. It is important to bear in mind here that to talk of the Other is not to talk of <italic>subjects</italic>, but is instead to talk about <italic>subjectivities</italic> and <italic>subjectification</italic>. With this in mind, far from closing down concepts and categories, they should be kept fluid, multiple, and constantly subject to critical analysis. Tackling the effects and functions of the intellectual in the process of subjectification head-on, Spivak suggests an approach in which the confrontation with the “heterogeneous Other” does not lead to a “speaking-on-behalf-of,” but to a deconstructive knowledge of ourselves; an “unlearning of one’s privilege . . . [and] . . . the beginning of an ethical relationship to the Other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310378375">Landry &amp; MacLean, 1996</xref>, p. 5). An ethical relationship with people with intellectual disabilities might, therefore, begin with a new question: how does the existence of such a concept shape the social situation of those of us who are Other than it?</p>
