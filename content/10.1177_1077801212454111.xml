<p>A good deal of attention has recently been focused on the processing of sexual assault cases by criminal justice authorities. National reports of thousands of untested “rape kits” led to calls for greater scrutiny of criminal justice decision making in these cases. In the article that opens this issue of <italic>Violence Against Women</italic>, Megan Alderden and Sarah Ullman analyze factors predicting sexual assault case outcomes at various points in the decision-making process from police report through prosecution. Overall, Alderden and Ullman found that case attrition remains incredibly high; fewer than 10% of the cases in their study resulted in charges being filed against an alleged perpetrator. Although criminal justice authorities, including police and prosecutors, claim that case processing decisions are influenced by numerous legal factors, Alderden and Ullman report that extralegal factors continue to be important predictors of sexual assault case outcomes. Their research demonstrates that considerably more work needs to be done to improve case outcomes for sexual assault victims.</p>
<p>Jamie Gradus and her colleagues emphasize the serious impact of sexual victimization on female victims. They examine whether sexual victimization increases the risk of suicide among women who have been victimized. Using longitudinal data from a Danish registry and a case-control comparison method, they found that sexual victimization increased the rate of suicide among women fourteenfold. Given their conservative definition of sexual victimization and the fact that they included only completed suicides, it is likely that this figure is an underestimate of the increase in risk of self-harm among sexually victimized women, a point that underlines the need for better criminal justice responses to sexual assault cases.</p>
<p>Dominique Roe-Sepowitz’s research looks at the relationship between childhood emotional abuse and age of entry into prostitution among a sample of adult women in a residential program for exiting prostitution. Roe-Sepowitz reports that childhood emotional abuse predicts younger age of prostitution entry for the women in this program, but she also identifies how emotional abuse is an important pathway into sexual exploitation for girls since it motivates them to run away from abusive households and, once on their own, to engage in “survival sex.” Roe-Sepowitz discusses the implications of her findings for social policy and the development of prevention programs.</p>
<p>In their article analyzing legislation to protect women from various forms of gender-based violence in postapartheid South Africa, Ramadimetja Mogale, Kathy Kovacs Burns, and Solina Richter show the disparity between the written law and the law “in action.” The postapartheid government of South Africa was applauded by women’s rights groups and others for passing laws to protect all South African women, regardless of race or class, from both intimate partner violence and sexual victimization. Yet, as they document, violence against women remains widespread throughout the country and most perpetrators continue to be left unaccountable. Their analysis highlights weaknesses in the laws themselves, but more so in the implementation of the laws, and they offer a number of recommendations for policy and practice changes that they believe will increase the laws’ ability to produce the intended effects.</p>
<p>The last two articles in this issue focus specifically on intimate partner violence (IPV). Danielle Davidov, Susan Jack, Stephanie Frost, and Jeffrey Coben look at how mandatory reporting of IPV and children’s exposure to IPV may impact a home visitation program in which nurses provide assistance to high-risk mothers. Their analysis of interview data from community stakeholders, clients, and home visiting nurses shows that mandatory reporting is a major concern for the mothers and often inhibits them from disclosing abuse and, therefore, getting much-needed help. But stakeholders, clients, and nurses also discussed ways to allay mothers’ concerns and foster trust between mothers and nurses so that the program can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Yvonne Amanor-Boadu and her colleagues compared the stay-leave decisions of immigrant and nonimmigrant IPV victims. They discovered a number of similarities in the factors affecting both groups’ decision-making processes, but they also identify important differences. Immigrant women, for instance, perceived more risks and barriers—some legal and some cultural—to leaving an abusive partner than nonimmigrant women did, and the authors note that these findings point to the usefulness of a holistic approach to risk assessment with women who have been victimized by IPV. Their findings reinforce those of other researchers who have argued for policies and services that not only address IPV victims’ broad array of needs and concerns but also tailor responses to diverse group and individual circumstances.</p>
