<p>Since the Russian Revolution Western commentators, trapped in their own definition of what is a woman’s role in society, have grappled with the conundrum of what were the implications of Communism for women. The responses, usually based on scant research, offered an image of women trapped in men’s work or, alternatively, of women denied the right to fulfil their maternal role. As Communism was imposed on East European states after the Second World War, this ignorance of how Communist policies affected women continued. Only recently has a better-informed debate become possible.</p>
<p>Małgorzata Fidelis addresses not merely the issue of what the post-war Polish regime demanded from women, but, critically, she situates her analysis in the debate on modernity and the Communist economic model. Thus the strength of this extremely well researched book is that the author does not engage with the debate on whether Communism robbed women of their natural role in society, whatever that was. Instead she asks what the Communist regime sought to achieve. Initially the aim was clearly to modernize society. For women that meant freedom from paternalism, the church and narrowly defined social norms. In most cases inevitably these aims were part of the ambitious Communist programme of industrialization and urbanization.</p>
<p>Fidelis focuses on the crucial years of the early Stalinist period, for it was then that industrial progress was closely linked to the ultimate objective of achieving a form of social progress that would allow women to become economically active. The little-known fact that women were recruited into coal mining offers an excellent example of how bold the Communists had been initially, and, indeed, how much women appreciated being able to work as miners. Another example is that of women textile workers, in particular in the Zambrów textile factories. In both cases mechanization played an important role in the decision to employ women. For women this was an opportunity to work in highly mechanized production, which offered professional progress and education.</p>
<p>Fidelis considers these issues from a number of angles: from that of the regime’s economic and social objectives through to a discussion of what the women themselves felt about the new opportunites, finally to the responses of their fellow men. She shows how little the regime had to offer in terms of new social models for men. Thus while women were initially encouraged to participate in the new dawn, not much was asked of men, in particular in their relations with the women with whom they worked. Fidelis suggests that it was not pure misogyny, though there was plenty of that, which finally led the Polish Communist regime to restrict employment opportunities for women. While the debate on women’s employment was framed in terms of returning women to their natural role of procreators, in reality this was a lame response to the skilled male workers’ opposition to the employment of women in industry. With the expiry of the Six Year Plan and the ensuing political changes, the regime reduced its previous commitment to social transformation. Interestingly, 1956, when the workers challenged the Communist regime and criticized it for its bad treatment of workers, marks the watershed and in effect the end of progressive thinking on the subject of women’s employment. The result was a new emphasis on women’s natural place in society, in which procreation became a priority.</p>
<p>Fidelis has conducted a lucid and clear debate. Her research is meticulous and her arguments are stated with clarity. This is a monograph which will make a major contribution to a number of debates on the subject of Communism, namely on social transformation, relations with the labour force, and, finally, women’s role in the great upheavals of the post-war period.</p>
