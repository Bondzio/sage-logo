<sec id="sec1-0022185611433009"><title><bold>Glenda Strachan, Erica French and John Burgess (eds) <italic>Managing Diversity in Australia: Theory and Practice</italic>.</bold> New South Wales: McGraw-Hill Australia, 2010. xxi + 282 pp., $94.95 (pbk).</title>
<p><italic>Managing Diversity in Australia</italic> is a comprehensive book about the concepts and practice of Managing Diversity (MD), equal opportunity and anti-discrimination in Australia. The editing authors describe it as ‘not a how-to book’ – rather, the focus is the theory, context and drivers behind the rise of MD programmes in Australia over the last two decades.</p>
<p>As a ‘scholarly introduction to the field’, the book will be particularly valuable for university students in building their understanding of the historical development of MD and the broad dimensions of diversity programmes in organizations. It is also useful for practitioners insofar as it captures the range of approaches to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and MD and highlights the power relations within organizational cultures that sustain the advantages of the dominant majority group. The book provides background on legislation and the philosophical underpinnings of legislative approaches to diversity in Australia, contrasting these with non-legislated approaches to diversity by Australian organizations, including ‘Managing Diversity’, ‘Productive Diversity’ and ‘Valuing Diversity’.</p>
<p>Early chapters have a strong focus on programmes for women, noting that diversity has frequently been seen as synonymous with women’s issues. The chapter on approaches to equity and diversity reinforces the scholarly tone of the book – which is understandable, as nearly all of the contributors are from university backgrounds. This chapter explains the perceived tensions between institutional methods such as EEO and non-institutional, managerial-driven diversity strategies, contending that the ‘agenda for change may well be too important an issue to be left solely in the realm of managerial prerogative’ (p. 54). Our experience suggests that it is not ‘either/or’: most organizations accept the importance and coexistence of both legislative and managerial approaches to cultural change.</p>
<p>The reach of this book is outstanding. Well-researched chapters cover work–family policies, trade unions and social justice, indigenous Australians, cultural diversity, disability, sexual and gender identity, and age. There are also strong case studies and audits of equal opportunity programmes that highlight limitations and strengths of different approaches. The ANZ Bank's disability programme and the National Australia Bank's reconciliation action plan are among some of the corporate studies. A detailed case study of cultural diversity in the railway industry eloquently highlights the complexity of bonding networks and norms.</p>
<p>Importantly, the book reinforces the fact that Australian organizations are neither gender-neutral nor culture-neutral. The chapter on ‘Ethnicity, power and culture at work’, discussing how ‘whiteness’ is reaffirmed through bias in recruiting practices, is particularly insightful. Another chapter comparing two companies in manufacturing also demonstrates the powerful impact of implicit cultural coding about ‘good’ jobs and ‘bad’ jobs for women.</p>
<p>Published in 2010, the book unfortunately misses some of the significant activity in the diversity field over the past 18 months. Future editions will doubtlessly reference Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) requirements for Australian-listed companies to report on gender diversity activities, and the increasing focus on addressing unconscious bias among leaders. In an excellent chapter on ‘Sexual and gender identity at work’, the authors usefully move the discussion closer to leadership and bias: ‘We suggest that good diversity management … demands proactive and visible leadership from well-informed, reflective leaders’ (p. 223).</p>
<p>The book would also benefit from more explicit discussion on inclusive cultures. Most progressive diversity programmes today are described as being about ‘Diversity and Inclusion’ (D&amp;I), rather than simply ‘Managing Diversity’. A helpful addition to the book would be a chapter on white male culture and masculinities, looking at approaches to including white men as active participants and allies in D&amp;I programmes. While the Australian workplace culture is rightly described as being predominantly white, male, heterosexual and non-disabled, and diversity is largely seen as being about ‘other people’ – people who do not fit this cultural mainstream – a concern is that the book reinforces this approach by identifying this dominant culture primarily as part of the problem, not an element of diversity to be included in a systemic solution, thus falling into the same trap.</p>
<p>A structural stereotype perpetuated by the book is the statement in the concluding chapter that ‘MD programs clearly fall within the ambit of HRM divisions’ (p. 271). This ignores the fact that corporate diversity programmes can be independent of HRM, with diversity seen as a separate strategic business issue. Given the lack of strategic HRM in many Australian organizations, the difficulties many HR divisions face in being seen as genuine business partners and the fact the some HR areas themselves demonstrate limited understanding of good D&amp;I practice, there is a strong practical case to be made for positioning diversity as a separate strategic priority to accelerate the rate of change.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Managing Diversity in Australia</italic> provides a very thorough understanding of the complexities and challenges of managing diverse workforces and creating more inclusive work cultures in Australia. The impact of this book will be particularly strengthened if student coursework is complemented by experiential insights into inclusion and exclusion.</p>
