<p>Huhtamo and Parikka’s edited collection on media archaeology forcefully introduces this relatively hidden yet emergent dimension of contemporary media research to a new readership. The hidden nature of these practices is partly for linguistic reasons, especially since many of the key thinkers in media archaeology were working in European, mainly German contexts, and at the time of writing not all of their key works are readily available in English. However, translation issues go well beyond the linguistic since media archaeology, as they present it, is necessarily a ‘travelling discipline’ to use Mieke Bal’s phrase cited in the introduction (p. 3); a reading of both contemporary media and media history against the grain, with multiple sources and diverse methods that nevertheless share a common rejection of dominant teleological accounts of media and technological history.</p>
<p>The valuable introduction to the volume sets out to chart an ‘archaeology of media archaeology’ (pp. 1–21), which in true media archaeological spirit means addressing work in multiple disciplines, eras and locations. Media archaeology is by no means limited to those works that explicitly invoke it, and many of its precursors, such as the work of Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Aby Warburg, Erwin Panofsky, Ernst Curtius and Marshall McLuhan, have more usually been inscribed in a range of other disciplinary and trans-disciplinary formations. Many practitioners of media archaeology would not use the term to label their theoretical enterprise even, as it turns out, its two most prominent figures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468714">Friedrich Kittler (e.g. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912468714">2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912468714">Siegfried Zielinski (e.g. 2006)</xref>. While the editors do an admirable job of tracing out the various historical conjunctions of the terms ‘media’ and ‘archaeology’, the real origins of the field come from thinkers outside media research (especially Benjamin and Foucault), being re-read by media archaeologists who critically deploy their methods (this is in addition to the unsurprising influence of McLuhan whose seminal analyses of both the ‘Gutenberg Galaxy’ and electronic media have clear media archaeological implications). This raises a key problem for the definition of media archaeology as a field: what is it that differentiates it from new historicism, the cultural/materialist history of technology, or science and technology studies (STS) approaches? These questions will underlie the following account of the key sections of the book but provisionally it can be admitted that these distinctions are far from conclusive in every chapter.</p>
<p>It may be surprising that for a field explicitly based on the materiality of media technologies, the first section concerns the seemingly immaterial field of what can be termed imaginary media, even if such a term is only fully applicable to Eric Kluitenberg’s contribution. Erkki Huhtamo opens the section with an exposition of the concept of <italic>topos</italic>, a commonplace or ‘stereotypical formula’ subject to multiple repetitions across different media contexts (p. 28). For Huhtamo, the study of <italic>topoi</italic>, including the forms of media archaeology this can give rise to, is not a mere scholarly pastime, but can constitute a vital tool for cultural critique, in that it troubles triumphalist accounts of media innovation by insisting on the repetitive networks of commonplaces – one of several media archaeological ways of both being able to see the old in the new, as well as the new in the old. Kluitenberg’s chapter focuses more explicitly on imaginary media which has for him the double meanings of both impossible, never realised media inventions and the phantasmatic imaginaries surrounding both real and imaginary media. As such, the field of imaginary media point to a penumbra surrounding actual media development which troubles its progressivist teleologies. This chapter is interesting since it directly raises the doubts I referred to earlier about the media archaeological project, and specifically to what extent it conforms to archaeology in the form defined in Foucault’s project; extending some critical remarks by Timothy Druckrey, Kluitenberg shows the clear differences between Foucault’s aims to delineate the abstract rules of specific discursive regimes and the work of Zielinski with its interest in specific practice of invention considered as ‘attractive foci’ (p. 52). For Kluitenberg, Zielinski’s approach would have more in common with what Foucault referred to as ‘genealogy’ than with archaeology, perhaps accounting for Zielinski’s preference of the terms ‘anarchaeology’ and ‘variantology’ to account for his own project. While not strictly adhering to Foucauldian archaeology, the archaeology of imaginary media nevertheless leads, as in Huhtamo’s use of <italic>topoi</italic>, to a critical engagement with the technological present that is certainly Foucauldian in spirit if not to the letter.</p>
<p>The remaining two chapters in this section are considerably less formulated in media archaeological terms and indeed make less clear distinctions between archaeological and cultural historical approaches. They are also both informed by psychoanalysis, albeit in quite different ways, as well as constituting oblique approaches to imaginary media. Jeffrey Sconce revisits Victor Tausk’s early 20th-century account of the schizophrenic ‘influencing machine’ in an account that runs from the well-known imaginary machinery invented by Daniel Paul Schreber, to contemporary crimes based on taking <italic>The Matrix</italic> (1999) for reality. The conclusion that Sconce draws is that the differences between earlier delusional ‘influencing machines’ and contemporary ones are that, whereas they both reconfigure their surrounding mediascapes, there is now a tendency for psychotic subjects to perceive themselves as sources for media transmissions and content. Fascinating as this is, it is hard to see how it does anything other than perform a form of cultural history that conforms to quite standard historical methods and teleologies of media development. Elsaesser’s chapter is somewhat different to this as it sets out to reconfigure Freud as media theorist, shifting attention away from the visualist take-up of his theories of voyeurism in film studies and towards some of his more suggestive writings such as ‘Note on the Mystic Writing Pad’ (p. 97). Deconstructive as this project might be, it in the sense is the mirror of the previous chapter in its demonstration of the ways that Freud based his theories of the unconscious on the dynamics of media systems. As its turn to Derrida would indicate, it seems more a deconstruction of the relations between Freud and media, than an articulation of media archaeology.</p>
<p>The second section contains a number of chapters with more empirical tendencies. In general, they are less concerned with media archaeology as a field and more with specific sites of analysis ranging from the Japanese ‘Baby Talkie’, to contemporary computer games. As in Elsaesser’s chapter, rather than an archaeological project there is a deconstructive one – whether it is the case of destabilising Western teleological narratives about media and modernity (Kusahara), or progressivist accounts of ever more sophisticated videogame interfaces via a reconsideration of play (Pias). Again, fascinating histories are uncovered such as that of a little-known device like the Baby Talkie, or the game-like behaviours of networked computers (and earlier technologies) via the ‘ping’ mechanism, and the transmedia tactilities of both optical toys and contemporary touch screens (Strauven). Nevertheless, there are questions as to whether this unearthing of forgotten inventions, and buried relations are truly archaeological in any strict sense but rather forms of cultural history of media and technology provoked by the advent of digital technologies. Certainly these chapters share a critical deconstruction of linear media historical narratives, and insist on the heuristic potentials of neglected media devices and practices, but it is debatable whether this in itself is enough to constitute a media archaeological project that is sufficiently systematic to warrant the term, rather than being simply particular or impressionistic.</p>
<p>The final section contains some key chapters, not least of which is the polemical one by Wolfgang Ernst, a media archaeologist of equal significance in Germany to Kittler or Zielinski, yet only just beginning to have his work translated into English. His chapter, ‘Media Archaeography: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media’ (pp. 239–255), makes a now familiar media archaeological argument against approaching media as cultural texts, in favour of materialist approaches to specific technologies. As such, this is a ‘meta’ media archaeological chapter, making claims about what media archaeology can and should contribute to the study of culture: ‘Media archaeology adds to the study of culture in an apparently paradoxical way by directing attention (perception, analysis) to noncultural elements of the technological regime’ (p. 244). The methodical attention given to forms of non-human machinic inscription are, for Ernst, crucial to the media archaeological project and would no doubt lead to a questioning as to how media archaeological some of the other chapters in this collection are, and more precisely, whether they live up to the maxim that ‘the media-archaeological gaze … is immanent to the machine’ (p. 251).</p>
<p>Another key approach, evident in the chapters of DeMarinis and Parikka, is to consider media archaeology in proximity to noise, as being interested in those phenomena that interfere with the (impossible) clear transmission of a message. While DeMarinis focuses on the artistic appropriation of media history, Parikka, referring to both Shannon and Weaver’s communication theory and German media archaeology, examines the problematics of noise in relation to a technology not usually considered in these terms, namely telegraphy. While neither of these chapters have the strident polemical tone of Ernst’s, they both approach media as material practices and as ones prone to all kinds of slippages and interferences, whether deliberate or accidental. The sense emerging from these chapters is that noise is an essential part of the media archaeological project, or even another rubric for mapping its obsessive interests in the strange materialities of media.</p>
<p>The final chapters in the volume take the mapping of media archaeology into the domain of software studies ranging from Christopher Strachey’s ‘love letter generator’, to the invention of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Casey Alt’s chapter on OOP is interesting precisely because it problematizes teleological narratives of computing history by positioning a strong break between the pre-OOP computer as a number-crunching calculating machine and the post-OOP sense of computers becoming a medium in the full sense, arguing that there was a mutual effect between software development, cybernetics and systems theory. Given the recent appropriation of ‘object-orientation’ by the school of thought otherwise known as speculative materialism, it is telling that Alt finds Deleuzian concepts such as the ‘abstract machine’ (p. 298) most useful for accounting for what is distinctive about OOP. In contrast, Noah Wardrip-Fruin’s chapter is a rather ‘classical’ piece of media archaeology, excavating the context and material existence of a celebrated yet rarely examined piece of software, Strachey’s love letter generator. For Wardrip-Fruin this is not a mere curiosity on the fringes of technological development but a combinatory machinery that should be seen as ‘the first experiment in digital literature’ (p. 316).</p>
<p>Vivian Sobchak’s afterword to the volume takes a somewhat oblique approach to its contents, following Hayden White, as a form of meta-history. More specifically, Sobchak claims that the media archaeological project should be seen as meta-history in a decidedly romantic mode, owing to its almost fetishistic interest in the ‘presence’ (p. 328) of otherwise neglected objects, machines and technological processes, and its insistence on an approach to the things themselves rather than their cultural representations. Furthermore, she also (still using Hayden White’s categories), argues that media archaeology is also <italic>formist</italic> in its focus on the unique characteristics of diverse objects and has both anarchic and liberal ideological tendencies. While such a characterization is inevitably reductive, her conclusion seems an apt summation of the highly varied yet consistent media archaeological explorations that make up this volume:
<disp-quote>
<p>Media archaeology—ideologically, and in terms of its liberal alliances and differences from the disciplined disciplines of history, film and media studies, and cultural studies—retains its anarchic status as undisciplined [and] poses a major challenge to these disciplines’ epistemic norms and established values. (p. 330)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Readers seeking a more positive account of what media archaeology is, rather than its differences from surrounding fields, would be well advised to seek out Jussi Parikka’s more recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468714">2012</xref>) publication; nevertheless, the volume reviewed here gives the widest and fullest available answer to this question, even if it is an answer necessarily characterized by both method and error, rigour and exploration, signal and noise.</p>
