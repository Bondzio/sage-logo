<p>James, a third-grade elementary teacher, believes that his student Carlos is doing exceptionally well on some projects and might be a gifted learner. He decides to administer two intelligence standardized tests: Screening Assessment for Gifted Elementary and Middle School Students (SAGES-2) and Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. James believes that his student will excel and, thus, will enjoy more challenging schoolwork. But James already knows that Carlos is an English Language Learner (ELL) and is worried that the English language hurdle might foil the results of these tests and is wondering what changes might be done to the tests so that Carlos’s true ability is highlighted and not masked by the English language.</p>
<p>Nothing is certain. This statement holds true for almost everything in life and is certainly not exempted when it comes to education and the field of standardized testing. The age-old question of whether these tests yield true and consistent results is one that will probably never be answered. Administrators and teachers use procedures, methods, and strategies to limit and diminish the biases and uncontrollable factors that affect tests and ultimately the students’ scores. This column will explain the testing requirements and the differences between modification and accommodation. Some scenarios and examples of both accommodation and modification will be provided to explain categories.</p>

<p>“Examiners should take into consideration the appropriate changes to be done, keeping in mind the professional responsibility and standardization of the test.”</p>

<title>Importance of Standardization</title>
<p>Authors of standardized tests place emphasis on the development of a tool that is highly valid and produces reliable results. With specific goals in mind, the test developer carefully chooses the test items and creates a reliable standardized scoring interpretation. The authors include, within the user’s manual, specific guidelines for administering and scoring the tests, considerations when using the assessment, and the assessment’s purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217513485584">Smolin &amp; Clayton, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217513485584">Millman and Greene (1993)</xref> explain that standardization sets up a consistent and unvarying method for using the assessment. Standardization attempts to make the observation, materials, administration, and the scoring as uniform as possible. “The goal of this uniformity is to make the assessment’s results as objective as possible so that they can be considered valid and meaningful when used to compare the assessed qualities of students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217513485584">Zucker, 2004</xref>, p. 2). For this reason, administration of the test is as equally important as developing the test.</p>
<p>The <italic>Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513485584">2002</xref>) is a set of testing standards jointly developed by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). These standards highlight the significance of adhering to the standardized procedures but acknowledge that changes in the administration process is necessary in particular situations: “Test users should follow carefully the standardized procedures for administration and scoring specified by the test developer, unless the situation or a test taker’s disability dictates that an exception should be made” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513485584">AERA, APA, NCME, 2002</xref>, p. 63). In addition, the Pearson assessment report states, “It is important to note that in certain cases changes to administration of a standardized assessment may be appropriate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217513485584">Zucker, 2004</xref>, p. 4). The main concern is associated with how altering the administration guidelines might affect the reliability and validity of test.</p>

<sec id="section2-1076217513485584">
<title>Modification and Accommodation</title>
<p>There are two types of changes in the assessment: assessment accommodation and assessment modification. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217513485584">Hollenbeck (2002)</xref>, test alteration moves along a continuum between accommodation and modification, depending on the degree of presence or absence of the following attributes:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217513485584" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Unchanged constructs. Measurement of the construct should not be changed by the test alteration. When there is no alteration in the construct measure, then it is considered to be an accommodation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individual need. Changes in the test should be completed to meet the student’s needs. A change that is necessary and eliminates irrelevant factors is an accommodation as long as the content of the test is not altered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Differential effects. Changes in the test should affect a student’s performance compared with the peer group performance. For the alteration to be considered an accommodation, it should not be useful for all individuals but rather focus on the targeted student.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sameness of inference. Alteration in tests should yield scores that could be compared with the standard administration scores. Accommodation does not alter the score of the test, and hence, the student’s results can still be compared with the standard scores.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513485584">Phillips (1993)</xref> explains how changes in the test that do not lead to any amendments within the test measure or the comparability of score is an accommodation. Accommodation includes changes in format, response, setting, timing, scheduling, or setting. In addition, Phillips clarifies that when modifications are done, a student’s score should not be compared with the standard score but rather be reported separately where assessment modification was made. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217513485584">Lee, Reynolds, and Willson (2003)</xref> state, “As an accommodation moves closer to being a modification, the validity of inference and decisions based on test scored becomes more suspect” (p. 59).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217513485584">
<title>Requirements</title>
<p>Individuals administering a standardized test should maintain professional responsibilities, as well as the qualifications for administering the assessment. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217513485584">Nitko (2004)</xref>, a lengthy list of principles of appropriate conduct of administration as professional responsibilities includes (a) maintaining and improving competence in educational assessment and (b) performing all responsibilities with honesty, integrity, due care, and fairness. The NCME offers codes and standards for administration, specifically emphasizing the responsibility to understand the procedure for administering the test, following the prescribed procedures and preventing any changes that might affect the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217513485584">NCME, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>To be a qualified examiner, it is crucial to develop an understanding of the assessment well in advance of the testing period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217513485584">Millman &amp; Greene, 1993</xref>). Once the test administrator has become familiar with the test and agrees to follow professional responsibilities, then “judgments of the suitability of adjustments should be tempered by the consideration that departures from the standard procedures may jeopardize the validity of the test score interpretations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513485584">AERA et al., 2002</xref>, p. 64). In addition, “any test modifications adopted should be appropriate for the individual test taker, while maintaining all feasible standardized features” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513485584">AERA et al., 2002</xref>, p. 106).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217513485584">
<title>Scenarios</title>
<p>Many of the standardized tests require that students should be administered in “an environment that is free from distractions, well ventilated, well lighted, quiet and comfortable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217513485584">Johnsen &amp; Corn, 2001</xref>, p. 20). Examiners should take into consideration the appropriate changes to be done, keeping in mind the professional responsibility and standardization of the test.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenarios that might occur and classify them as an accommodation or a modification:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217513485584" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The school provides a small room to test several students where the seating arrangements were not ideal and/or comfortable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A particular test takes place adjacent to a construction zone with loud noises.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The students are given unlimited time to finish the activity on a test.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The environment is not free from distraction due to group administration. Some students use habits (humming, stomping of the feet, etc.) to help them cope with stress and focus. These habits may distract other students around them. The examiner instructs the whole group: “We do not want to make noises, your friends are working.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The school district asks an examiner to administer a test to a Moroccan student who is weak in English. The examiner decides to translate the instructions to Arabic and French (due to a concern about the minute differences in the Arabic dialect). The instructions are written using specific vocabulary chosen by the authors. The examiner’s concern is that the author’s choice of words might be lost in translation, yet the student is still being compared with those who were being administered in English. During the administration phase, the examiner reads instructions in the three languages.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While the examiner was administering a test to the group, the examiner noticed a student who kept erasing her answers and repeating the test over and over. The examiner asked her whether she was having any problems and she openly admits that she has been diagnosed with dyslexia and was having trouble keeping track of the lines on the answer sheet. At that point, the examiner decides to address her issue by writing her answers on the answer sheet. She would relay her answers to the examiner who would write them down on the answer sheet.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217513485584">
<title>Are the Scenarios Modification or Accommodation?</title>
<p>The above scenarios may be categorized as assessment accommodation or modification by evaluating the presence of Hollenbeck’s attributes: unchanged constructs, individual need, differential effects, and sameness of inference.</p>
<sec id="section6-1076217513485584">
<title>Assessment Modifications</title>
<p>Scenario 3 is considered to be an assessment modification. When the examiner decided to give unlimited time to meet the individual needs, she changed the construct and the criteria of inference. By giving unlimited time, the test no longer tested the ability and performance of the individual within a certain time frame but rather the examinee’s ability and performance in general. Unlimited time has changed the construct and the ability to compare the results with the standard administration scores.</p>
<p>Scenario 5 might be considered a modification because the examiner read the instructions in English, as well as two other languages. Translation of instruction might hinder or give away information that the author of the test did not include. In such cases, the sameness of inference is absent, and hence, the scores cannot be compared with the standard administration scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1076217513485584">
<title>Assessment Accommodations</title>
<p>Scenarios 1, 2, and 4 are related to the environment and making it comfortable and free from distractions. Although the environment in which the student took the test is not the same as the standardized one, no changes have been made in the test’s content or construct. For this reason, these scenarios describe accommodations.</p>
<p>Scenario 5 included changes in the language of instruction. The examiner read the instructions in English and then read the instruction in the student’s main language. Having read the instruction in English, the examiner made sure that the construct has not been changed, as well as sameness of inference. There has been differential effect as well as meeting individual needs. For this reason, the changes made are considered accommodations.</p>
<p>Scenario 6 is an accommodation where changes have been made to meet individual needs. These changes have unchanged constructs, no differential effects, and sameness of inference.</p>
<p>With the aforementioned strategies and guidelines laid out, examiners need to remember that administration of the test is as equally important as developing the test. Cautious changes should be done so that the results of the assessments are adequate. The test author had a specific purpose for the assessment and included them within the user’s manual specific guideline. Administrators need to decide, if necessary, to make the appropriate accommodations. Modifications should only be done in specific cases, because it will alter the results, and in such cases, results should be reported separately. We must remember that administers and teachers who supply the tests are as important as the ones receiving them.</p>
