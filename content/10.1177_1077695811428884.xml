<abstract>
<p>This study examines education and work experience in newsrooms as predictors of ethical perceptions among communication undergraduates at a large Singaporean university (<italic>N</italic> = 826). Results indicate that education is associated with ethical ideologies, perceived importance of journalism ethics codes, justifiability of using contentious news gathering methods, and concern towards journalistic plagiarism and fabrication. However, in this context, education is not a significant predictor of agreement with ethical principles or support for sanctions against journalistic plagiarism and fabrication. Ethical ideologies (idealism and relativism) are associated with ethical principles and the degree to which using contentious news gathering methods is justifiable. Work experience in newsrooms is associated with perceived justifiability of using contentious news-gathering methods but not with ethical ideologies. The pattern of results was not entirely as predicted and may be a function of the way journalism is practiced and perceived in Singapore.</p>

<p>Journalists frequently must grapple with moral dilemmas at work. Often, it is difficult for journalists to perform their roles without compromising integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695811428884">1</xref></sup> As a significant proportion of students from media and communication programs are likely to become journalists in the future, media scholars have also emphasized the importance of providing media ethics training at the undergraduate level so that students are equipped with an understanding of the moral dilemmas that journalists face.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695811428884">2</xref></sup> Increasingly, scholars are also beginning to examine how communication undergraduates’ attitudes towards ethical issues change with education and work experiences such as internship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695811428884">3</xref></sup> However, there has been little research in Asian countries examining the ethical perceptions of communication undergraduates and how they change over time.</p>
<p>This study represents an effort to help fill this gap and constitutes part of an ongoing, longitudinal survey designed to track developments in communication undergraduates’ ethical perceptions in Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695811428884">4</xref></sup> Using established survey items, this study examines differences in ethical ideologies among undergraduates and how these relate to views of controversial methods of gathering information and level of agreement with the four ethical principles from the U.S.-based Society of Professional Journalists’ (SPJ) Code of Ethics: seek truth and report it, minimize harm, act independently, and be accountable. It also examines differences in concerns over plagiarism and fabrication among first- and final-year students as well as among those with and without newsroom work experience.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695811428884">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The common view among developmental psychologists is that ethical reasoning becomes increasingly complex with age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695811428884">5</xref></sup> In recent years, media scholars have expressed interest in examining the impact of journalism education on students’ ethical reasoning over time. Findings from comparative studies in Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States strongly suggest that age and education are factors that concurrently shape the way journalism students view ethical issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695811428884">6</xref></sup> To better understand the extent to which this pattern of influence applies in non-Western contexts, this study assesses a wide range of ethical views among students at Nanyang Technological University’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication &amp; Information, the only program in Singapore that offers an undergraduate specialization in journalism.</p>
<p>Singapore presents a complex context for studying journalism ethics. Some have described the Singapore press as adopting a “development model” in which independence is sacrificed because the press takes a role as partner to government in reaching national development goals, and government leaders have specifically rejected the characterization of the Singapore press as the “Fourth Estate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695811428884">7</xref></sup> Nonetheless, journalism education and journalism workplaces in Singapore share many professional standards and characteristics as their Western counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695811428884">8</xref></sup> At the school where this research was conducted, the diverse international faculty was trained in the West and the curriculum is in most ways similar to those of Western communication schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695811428884">9</xref></sup> For example, media law and ethics constitutes a core course required for all students. Furthermore, school faculty members have rejected claims of a specifically “Asian” model of journalism and instead endorsed global standards and practices, asserting that there is “no demand—even from Asian media organizations—for such journalists” following an Asian model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695811428884">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-1077695811428884">
<title>Ethics principles in journalism</title>
<p>According to the SPJ, four core ethical principles are critical to news reporting: to seek truth and report it, to minimize harm, to act independently, and to be accountable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695811428884">11</xref></sup> Though these principles were developed by a North American organization of journalists and reflect priorities that may not be universal, to a certain extent they do represent values held by journalists in Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695811428884">12</xref></sup> A long term goal of this research project is to compare the extent to which students and media professionals in different press systems embrace them. This first stage of the research, reported here and conducted with student participants in Singapore, lays the groundwork for future comparative research that will allow us to examine the extent to which other students and professionals endorse principles like those of the SPJ.</p>
<p>Scholars contend that age<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695811428884">13</xref></sup> and education<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695811428884">14</xref></sup> are correlated with heightened awareness of ethical principles. Older students expressed greater confidence in their abilities to apply ethical principles appropriately to challenging workplace scenarios.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695811428884">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, age was associated with greater approval of professional ethical principles amongst public relations practitioners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695811428884">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the university where this study was administered, it is compulsory for students to take media ethics classes in their final year. Given that the final-year students have had greater exposure to potential ethical dilemmas faced by journalists and are obviously older than their freshmen counterparts, it is plausible that final-year students and first-year students will differ in their views regarding ethical principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695811428884">17</xref></sup> Hence, this study examines if there are any differences in students’ level of agreement with the four ethical principles of the SPJ code. We hypothesize that</p>
<list id="list1-1077695811428884" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: First-year journalism students in Singapore will express less agreement with journalists’ ethical principles of (1) truth telling, (2) minimizing harm, (3) independence, and (4) accountability than final-year students.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section3-1077695811428884">
<title>Ethical ideologies</title>
<p>One broad, widely used way to characterize approaches to ethics is on the dimensions of idealism and relativism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695811428884">18</xref></sup> Idealists believe that “correct” actions lead to beneficial results, whereas relativists tend to take situational factors (i.e., the context) into consideration when making judgments and they generally reject the notion of universal moral rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695811428884">19</xref></sup> Although other ways of categorizing moral philosophies exist, such as deontological, utilitarian, and virtue-based approaches, these broad distinctions between idealism and relativism are one way that is used particularly by social scientists to describe how individuals approach ethical questions.</p>
<p>According to Kolhberg,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695811428884">20</xref></sup> older people are likely to be less idealistic than younger people. As such, it is possible that first-year students will be more idealistic than final-year students. Also, scholars have said that media ethics classes play a prominent role in molding students into socially responsible individuals who use ethical ideologies to make sound judgments on controversial issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695811428884">21</xref></sup> As final-year students have been exposed to ethical issues in media ethics classes, we expect them to be more nuanced in their ethical reasoning and be more relativistic than first-year students. Hence, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p>
<list id="list2-1077695811428884" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: First-year Singapore journalism students will be more idealistic than final-year students.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic>: Final-year Singapore journalism students will be more relativistic than first-year students.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Previous studies conducted in marketing and business contexts have shown that ethical ideologies are one of the strongest predictors of moral judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695811428884">22</xref></sup> Also, communication students high in idealism concur more with ethical principles than those high in relativism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695811428884">23</xref></sup> As idealists tend to be more absolute in their moral reasoning than relativists,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695811428884">24</xref></sup> this study hypothesizes that those who exhibit high levels of idealism will tend to concur more with ethical principles than those with high levels of relativism:</p>
<list id="list3-1077695811428884" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Singapore journalism students with high levels of idealism will express greater agreement with the ethical principles of truth telling (3a), minimizing harm (3b), independence (3c), and accountability (3d) than those with high levels of relativism.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section4-1077695811428884">
<title>Journalism ethics codes</title>
<p>Journalism ethics codes consist of guiding principles on appropriate journalistic conduct and usually vary from one country to another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695811428884">25</xref></sup> However, scholars and media practitioners hold mixed views about journalism ethics codes. Some contend that journalism ethics codes serve as a nonlegislative means of ensuring that the press maintains accountability towards a country’s citizens,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695811428884">26</xref></sup> although others have argued that ethics codes do little to instill ethical values in journalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695811428884">27</xref></sup> Despite the critiques, ethics codes remain an important part of the character of professional organizations.</p>
<p>As it is likely for final-year communication students to show greater complexity in their ethical reasoning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695811428884">28</xref></sup> and to have internalized ethical principles after four years of education,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695811428884">29</xref></sup> it is plausible for them to rely more on their own discretion than formal ethics codes when making news judgments<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695811428884">30</xref></sup> and, as such, deem journalism ethics codes to be less important than first-year students. With that, we hypothesize that</p>
<list id="list4-1077695811428884" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: First-year Singapore journalism students will perceive journalism ethics codes to be more important than final-year students.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077695811428884">
<title>Work experience in newsrooms</title>
<p>A student’s ethical perceptions of newsroom practices can be shaped through work experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695811428884">31</xref></sup> Students who had worked with news companies expressed greater concern towards unethical journalistic practices and were more likely to support punitive measures for journalistic plagiarism and fabrication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695811428884">32</xref></sup> As students working in the newsroom often gain firsthand experience of the ethical dilemmas that journalists grapple with, they are likely to develop a more accurate overview of journalistic practices and become more pragmatic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695811428884">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we chose to focus on newsroom work experience, as it is a more salient predictor of journalism ethics than other types of media-related occupations. During semester breaks, students can choose to work part-time at news companies. Furthermore, under the university’s compulsory professional attachment program, all third-year undergraduates from this school are given the opportunity to choose whether to intern at news companies. Given that work experience in newsrooms can potentially influence ethical ideologies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695811428884">34</xref></sup> we postulate that</p>
<list id="list5-1077695811428884" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Singapore journalism students with work experience in newsrooms will be less idealistic than those without work experience.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section6-1077695811428884">
<title>Contentious methods of getting information</title>
<p>Oftentimes, journalists have to decide whether to resort to controversial methods to obtain information from their sources. Some examples of controversial methods of obtaining information include using classified documents without official permission, reneging on promises to protect source confidentiality, and using hidden microphones or cameras.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695811428884">35</xref></sup> While some would argue that the ends can justify the means when obtaining information, different methods engender varying levels of approbation.</p>
<p>As many studies have shown that age is negatively associated with approval towards using contentious methods of achieving goals,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695811428884">36</xref></sup> it is plausible that first-year students will express greater disapproval towards contentious methods of gathering information. Recent research has also shown that newsroom work experience was a significant predictor of perceived justifiability of using contentious news gathering methods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695811428884">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, students who showed strong support for ethical principles and exhibited high levels of idealism were more likely to frown upon contentious methods of news gathering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695811428884">38</xref></sup> With this, we propose the following four hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list6-1077695811428884" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: First-year Singapore journalism students will be less likely than final-year students to say that contentious newsgathering methods are justifiable.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section7-1077695811428884">
<title>Plagiarism and fabrication</title>
<p>In the field of journalism, plagiarism and fabrication are considered serious offenses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695811428884">39</xref></sup> In recent years, prominent journalists have been severely castigated for passing off other people’s work as their own and making up facts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077695811428884">40</xref></sup> However, few studies have examined students’ perceptions of plagiarism and fabrication. It is important to gauge students’ level of concern towards journalistic plagiarism and fabrication and their perceptions of penalties that should be imposed on people who commit such offenses, as these two infractions are much more strongly associated with the journalistic profession than other media-related careers that they might choose to embark on after graduation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077695811428884">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>As final-year students have arguably become well acquainted with ethical issues through media ethics classes and internships with media companies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077695811428884">42</xref></sup> it is likely for them to take a more serious view of journalistic misconduct than first-year students. Indeed, students became increasingly concerned with plagiarism and fabrication during their years in college.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077695811428884">43</xref></sup> One 1990 study showed that communication students in the United States viewed journalistic plagiarism as the most severe breach of ethical conduct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077695811428884">44</xref></sup> Also, studies have shown that final-year students are more likely than freshmen to approve of tougher sanctions for journalistic plagiarizing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077695811428884">45</xref></sup> Hence, we hypothesize that</p>

<title>Sampling and participants</title>
<p>Utilizing a combination of purposive and convenience sampling, three batches of first- and final-year students were surveyed for this study. A total of 458 first-year and 368 final-year undergraduates (<italic>N</italic> = 826) from a communication school at a major university in Singapore participated in the survey over the course of nearly four years (2007–2010). Participants were awarded with the following incentives: extra credit for the course they were taking for first-year students and a movie pass or a shopping voucher for final-year students.</p>
<p>Responses from three first-year students and two final-year students were removed because of logical inconsistencies (e.g., responded with all “agree” in one survey section even though there were a number of reversed items) or missing responses on more than eight questions (i.e., more than 10 percent of the total questions), leaving a total of 821 respondents (<italic>n</italic>
<sub>first year</sub> = 455 and <italic>n</italic>
<sub>final year</sub> = 366) for data analysis. Similar to the demographics proportion of the school, the majority of the participants were female (74.2 percent) and Chinese (88.9 percent). The mean age of respondents was 19.6 years for first-year students and 23.1 years for final-year students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077695811428884">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In gathering data, respondents completed the paper-and-pen survey questionnaire. As an effort to offset question-order bias, the survey questionnaire had four versions in which both the order of sections and questions within each section were randomized using a random generator tool. However, the introduction and demographic profile sections were kept as the first and the last sections, respectively, for all four questionnaire versions.</p>
<p>Data from first-year students were collected in August 2007, August 2008, and September 2009; while the surveys for final-year students were administered in April 2008, April 2009, and April 2010. As August marks the start of the first-year students’ first semester, they had not taken any media ethics class or gone for a six-month compulsory internship when the surveys were carried out. In contrast, April is near the end of the final-year students’ last semester; and therefore, at the time of the surveys, they had undergone both the compulsory media ethics class and internship. All students signed a consent form, which was presented to them at the beginning of the survey administration, to indicate their agreement to participate in the survey.</p>

<sec id="section11-1077695811428884">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Both well-established and newly developed measures were used for this study. We conducted pretests and a pilot study to refine the initial drafts of the survey instrument. The items making up the composite measures are shown in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1077695811428884">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>The four aspects of journalism ethics principles—truth telling, minimizing harm, independence, and accountability—were measured using a combination of well-established and newly created measures. Seven items for truth telling and four items for minimizing harm were adapted from a blogging ethics study,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077695811428884">46</xref></sup> while four items for independence and four accountability items were newly developed for this study based on the SPJ code of ethics. The respondents’ levels of agreement for each statement were assessed using a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The measures attained a reliable Cronbach’s alpha of .73 for truth telling, .77 for minimizing harm, and .72 for accountability. A moderate level of alpha of .59 for independence was achieved after one item was dropped from the scale.</p>
<p>Two items were constructed to assess the levels of importance respondents attached to code of ethics. Respondents indicated the extent of their agreement on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The statements were found to be highly correlated to each other, <italic>r</italic>(282) = .747, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Forsyth’s Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077695811428884">47</xref></sup> which has been widely used in ethics research, including in Asia,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077695811428884">48</xref></sup> was used to measure ethical ideologies. Of the original measures of ten items each for idealism and relativism, we selected only four items for each of the ethical ideologies. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent of their agreement on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The idealism scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of .65, while the Cronbach’s alpha for the relativism scale was .76.</p>
<p>Ten items to measure contentious methods of getting information practiced by journalists were modified from Ball, Hanna, and Sanders’s study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077695811428884">49</xref></sup> To generate data with greater variance, respondents were asked to indicate their responses on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>often justifiable</italic> to 4 = <italic>never justifiable</italic> instead of the original dichotomous response (<italic>justifiable</italic> to <italic>not justifiable</italic>). Three items were excluded from analysis, and one item was rephrased to better fit the context of the study. The seven items attained a good level of reliability with alpha of .70.</p>
<p>Two sets of seven items were used to measure the level of concerns over plagiarism and fabrication conducted by journalists and how a news organization should handle such cases. Four items from each set were newly created, while three items were modified from Conway and Groshek’s methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077695811428884">50</xref></sup> Respondents indicated the extent of their concerns with journalists’ plagiarism and fabrication on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>not concerned at all</italic> to 2 = <italic>very concerned</italic>; and their opinions on the level of sanctions for plagiarism and fabrication that should be given by a news organization was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>do nothing</italic> to 5 = <italic>fire the journalist</italic>. The reliabilities of these scales were .81 for concerns on journalistic plagiarism (three items), .72 for concerns on journalistic fabrication (four items), .73 for how a news organization should handle plagiarism cases (three items), and .82 for how a news organization should handle fabrications cases (four items).</p>
<p>A standard set of demographic variables relating to gender, age, household income, and housing type was asked. In addition, we asked the respondents questions pertaining to their media consumption habits, whether they had working experience in newsroom, whether they personally knew any journalists, and whether they wanted to pursue a journalism career.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Nearly two-third of the respondents (63.2 percent) personally knew someone who worked as a journalist either now or in the past. Just one-fourth of them had any newsroom working experience (24.4 percent), and only 13.3 percent were certain that they wanted to pursue a career in journalism. Final-year students were more likely to know anyone who was a journalist or an ex-journalist (83.3 percent) and had an experience working in newsrooms (39.2 percent) as compared to first-year students (47.1 and 12.5 percent, respectively). While there was almost no difference in the percentage of students who were certain that they wanted to pursue a journalism career between first-year (13.9 percent) and final-year students (12.6 percent), first-year students were more likely to indicate a possibility to pursue a journalism career (67.4 percent) as compared to final-year cohorts (49.6 percent).</p>
<p>Around half of respondents read a newspaper one to four days a week (50.6 percent), with <italic>The Straits Times</italic> read most often (69.8 percent). Slightly more than half of them watched news on TV one to four days a week (54.3 percent), in which local (Singapore) news was watched more often (72.1 percent) than international broadcast news (17.5 percent). News sites on the Internet were visited daily by only 15.5 percent of respondents, while 21.0 percent hardly ever or never did so. While the amount of time spent on watching news on TV and visiting news sites in the Internet was similar between first- and final-year students, first-year students (56.6 percent) were more likely to spend more time reading newspapers as compared to the final-year students (43.0 percent).</p>

<title>Ethical ideologies</title>
<p>Hypotheses 2a and 2b proposed that first-year students would be more idealistic than final-year students, and final-year students would be more relativistic than first-year students. An independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test showed an insignificant result for idealism. There was a significant difference for relativism, <italic>t</italic>(754.7) = 2.542, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; however, the direction was in the opposite direction of the prediction. First-year students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.23, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07) were more likely to be relativistic than final-year students (<italic>M</italic> = 5.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15). Thus, both hypotheses 2a and 2b were not supported.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 3 proposed that students with high levels of idealism would express greater agreement with the four ethical principles than those with high levels of relativism. To classify respondents who were high in idealism and relativism, we divided the idealism and relativism variables into two categories based on median split. Respondents who scored high in idealism and low in relativism were classified into the “high levels of idealism,” category while those who scored high in relativism and low in idealism were classified into “high levels of relativism” category. The results revealed statistically significant differences for truth telling, <italic>t</italic>(296) = −2.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; independence, <italic>t</italic>(296) = −2.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; and minimizing harm, <italic>t</italic>(304.7) = −6.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Specifically, those with high idealism were more likely than those with high relativism to express a higher level of agreement with the truth telling (<italic>M</italic> = 5.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.70 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 5.02, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.77, respectively), independence (<italic>M</italic> = 5.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.04 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 4.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08), and minimizing harm principles (<italic>M</italic> = 5.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 5.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.01, respectively). The result for accountability principle, however, was not significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077695811428884">Table 2</xref> for summary). Hence, hypotheses 3a, 3b, and 3c were supported, while hypothesis 3d was not.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Again, this study found that Singaporean first-year journalism students were more likely than final-year students to perceive that journalism ethics codes were important and were less likely to agree that contentious methods of news gathering were justifiable. Final-year students were less relativistic than first-year students and expressed more concern for journalistic plagiarism and fabrication than first-year students. However, there was no difference in the level of agreement with ethical principles and support for sanctions against journalistic plagiarism and fabrication between first- and final-year students. Also, students with high levels of relativism generally expressed less agreement with ethical principles and were more likely to say that contentious methods of news gathering were justifiable than students with high levels of idealism. Furthermore, those who agreed more with ethical principles were less likely to support contentious methods of gathering news information. Students who had worked in newsrooms were more likely to agree that contentious methods of news gathering were justifiable than those with no such experience. By contrast, ethical ideologies of respondents were not significantly different between those with and without newsroom work experience.</p>
<p>Contrary to what was hypothesized, first- and final-year students did not differ in their levels of agreement with journalistic principles. This suggests that year of study is not a strong standalone predictor of students’ agreement with journalistic principles. Although one should be careful when interpreting null findings, the lack of differences could be attributed to the fact that some of these ethical principles are widely held, transcending cultural and racial differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077695811428884">52</xref></sup> Among journalistic principles investigated, researchers have suggested that truth,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077695811428884">53</xref></sup> avoiding harm,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077695811428884">54</xref></sup> and accountability<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077695811428884">55</xref></sup> are universal. It is possible that these values may not be unique to the practice of journalism. This may be especially true when the values are expressed in the abstract. That is, when addressed in very broad and general terms as they were in the survey, truth, minimizing harm, and accountability are likely to be universally accepted principles. If this is the case, media ethics education is unlikely to significantly influence adherence to these broadly stated ethical principles. However, education may make a difference in terms of how the principles apply in specific situations. For example, final-year students were more likely than first-year students to agree that contentious newsgathering methods were justifiable.</p>
<p>Again, final-year students were less relativistic than first-year students. These findings are consistent with research that has shown that older people tend to exhibit lower levels of relativism than younger people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077695811428884">56</xref></sup> While the absolute age difference in our samples is not large, it can be argued that four years spent in university constitute a period of significant personal growth and maturation (at least for most people). Although older people tend to exhibit greater sophistication in terms of moral reasoning,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077695811428884">57</xref></sup> Gergen<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077695811428884">58</xref></sup> suggests that as people’s responsibilities and duties increase with age, they are more likely to hold themselves to stricter codes of moral conduct and make deliberate choices to abide by ethical values. While this may explain a reduction in relativism across some parts of the life span it is unclear whether it applies to the age groups studied in this research.</p>
<p>Contrary to findings from previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077695811428884">59</xref></sup> again, the results of this study showed that first- and final-year students do not differ in terms of their level of idealism. Though people with high levels of idealism have sometimes been regarded as being rather naïve,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077695811428884">60</xref></sup> Shkedi and Laron<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077695811428884">61</xref></sup> contend that idealism ought to be perceived as a positive quality and further lament that the shift from idealism to a more pragmatic worldview represents a compromise of one’s moral standards. Hence, this apparent lack of difference between first- and final-year students’ levels of idealism need not necessarily be construed negatively.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, students who were highly idealistic tended to agree more with ethical principles than those who were highly relativistic. These findings are largely consistent with the results from previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077695811428884">62</xref></sup> Indeed, it is more likely for people with high levels of idealism to believe in moral absolutes and express agreement with ethical principles than those with high levels of relativism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077695811428884">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Again, consistent with what was hypothesized, results showed that first-year students perceived journalism ethics codes to be more important than final-year students. It is possible that final-year students have a better understanding of ethical issues than first-year students and hence feel less of a need to rely on ethics codes.</p>
<p>Again, there was no significant association between work experience and ethical ideologies. Although this finding runs counter to results obtained from earlier studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077695811428884">64</xref></sup> it is plausible that the amount of time these students’ spent working in newsrooms was insufficient to bring about any change in ethical ideologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1077695811428884">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, students who had experience working in newsrooms were more likely to support contentious methods of gathering news information. This is consistent with findings from Reinardy and Moore’s study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1077695811428884">66</xref></sup> and implies that students exhibit greater tolerance towards using controversial newsgathering methods after being exposed to the realities of the newsroom environment. Also, again, students who expressed greater agreement with the journalistic principle of minimizing harm were less likely to agree that contentious newsgathering methods were justifiable. The other ethical principles had no significant influence on attitudes toward using contentious newsgathering methods. This pattern of results is likely due to the nature of the measures used in this study and by Reinardy and Moore;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1077695811428884">67</xref></sup> that is, the measures of contentious news gathering involve situations pitting the greater public good against the welfare of an individual or organization. As such, concern over the potential harm being done affects how one views these methods.</p>
<p>Again, ethical ideologies were significantly associated with students’ attitudes towards contentious methods of news gathering; students who were highly idealistic were less likely to say that contentious news-gathering methods were justifiable. This finding is in line with previous studies that indicate controversial business practices have lower levels of approval among those with high levels of idealism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1077695811428884">68</xref></sup> Central to journalism ethics is the debate over competing values, benefits, and harm, and when the ends can justify the means, if ever.</p>
<p>Consistent with the results from previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1077695811428884">69</xref></sup> final-year students were more likely to express greater concern for journalistic plagiarism and fabrication than first-year students. However, first- and final-year students did not differ in their level of support for penalties against plagiarism and fabrication. It is possible that undergraduate education and work experience are effective in raising students’ level of concern towards these types of transgressions but do not necessarily translate into support for harsher penalties on journalists who plagiarize and fabricate information.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>This survey was administered only to undergraduates in Singapore. To have a more complete overview of perceptions on journalism ethics, future research should attempt to make comparisons between other Asian and Western samples and determine if there are differences in undergraduates’ and journalists’ ethical views.</p>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, the failure to find differences in support for the ethical principles may be due to near universal support for such principles. However, to test the possibility that the responses are not an artifact of social desirability, future research in this area can incorporate the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1077695811428884">70</xref></sup> Some measures could also be refined. For example, this study’s measure of work experience simply asked respondents if they had worked in newsrooms before. It is possible for people to work in newsrooms but perform tasks such as pagination or layout design that are unrelated to news writing and information gathering. Furthermore, this study did not account for other factors that could potentially influence ethical perceptions such as religiosity and value predispositions. Future studies should consider incorporating such variables so that a more comprehensive understanding of the factors predicting ethical perceptions can be reached. Finally, this study’s literature review was necessarily based almost entirely on studies of journalists and journalism students in countries other than Singapore, and results of the same ethics study may differ from one country to the next because ethics are driven by cultural values and, in turn, cultures differ; such cultural differences are not necessarily mitigated, let alone eliminated, through Singaporean journalism students being taught by Western-trained journalism professors following the kind of journalism curriculum often taught in English-speaking, Western countries.</p>
<p>Thus, more research needs to be done to obtain a better understanding of the factors that shape the development of journalism ethics, but this study’s findings have nonetheless shed light on Asian students’ ethical perceptions. Broadly speaking, this study’s findings indicate that first- and final-year students differ in terms of ethical ideologies and ethical reasoning. Future research may help determine the role of maturation, education, and work experience in the development of journalistic ethics. While this current study revealed some differences among undergraduates in a communication school in Singapore, a nation often described as a place where East meets West, it suggests directions for future comparative studies in other contexts as well.</p>

<p>The scales for journalistic plagiarism and fabrication are ordinal. However, we treated them as interval in order to run an independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Separately, we ran a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test and found that the results were similar to the independent <italic>t</italic>-test. The only difference was the result for “how a news organization should handle plagiarism,” in which a significant difference (<italic>Z</italic> = −1.897, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) was found in the nonparametric test but not in the parametric test.</p>
