<abstract>
<p>Strategies for monitoring patients recovering after congenital heart surgery have evolved considerably as technology continues to progress. Monitoring techniques traditionally centered around the comprehensive physical examination have been replaced by a number of revolutionary technologies developed to objectively evaluate various components of the cardiovascular system. Despite scant evidence that these methodologies actually improve outcomes, some have been embraced by clinicians. We developed an Internet survey designed to describe current practices of clinicians who care for patients after congenital heart surgery. There were 162 respondents to our survey with the majority from the United States. The views of cardiologists, intensivists, those dual trained in both cardiology and critical care medicine, and surgeons are all robustly represented in the results. Serial lactate monitoring was the strategy that was utilized most often by respondents (94%), followed by multisite near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS, 67%). There were 78% who utilized the combination of serial lactate and NIRS monitoring. Serial lactate monitoring was the technique that was thought to best represent cardiovascular well-being after heart surgery (40%). The results of this survey suggest that despite the paucity of evidence that clinical outcomes of patients recovering after congenital heart surgery are improved by any of these monitoring techniques, there is almost universal acceptance to monitor patients with serial lactate monitoring, NIRS monitoring, or a combination of these techniques.</p>

<p>Hemodynamic monitoring of patients after congenital heart surgery has evolved dramatically over the last few decades. Traditionally, postoperative assessment has included a comprehensive physical examination, quantifying urine output, measuring invasive or noninvasive blood pressure, reviewing the electrocardiogram, heart rate, monitoring intracardiac filling pressures via lines placed directly in the left, right or common atrium by the cardiac surgeons, central venous pressure (CVP), and continuous pulse oximetry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111433472">1</xref></sup> Invasive monitoring tools were developed to measure indices of oxygen delivery, such as cardiac output and systemic venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111433472">2</xref></sup> Noninvasive devices have recently been developed in an attempt to eliminate the need to place invasive intracardiac catheters. Near-infrared spectrometry monitoring may be used to approximate SvO<sub>2</sub>, and in some centers has replaced SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring as the technique of choice to assess the vital relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111433472">3</xref></sup> As technology evolved, the ability to monitor changes in blood lactate, an end product of anaerobic metabolism resulting from severe aberrations in the relationship of oxygen delivery to oxygen consumption, became more convenient. Lactate measurement has become part of the routine, comprehensive arterial blood gas analysis. Most recently, blood lactate measurement became available as a bedside point-of-care test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111433472">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111433472">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The role of each of these technologies, as stand alone tests or in combination with others, in the evaluation and management of patients recovering after congenital heart surgery is currently being defined. In a recent scientific statement from the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society, the evidence supporting various technologies were evaluated and presented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111433472">6</xref></sup> We surveyed a group of clinicians who care for critically ill patients with congenital heart disease, in attempt to evaluate the current trends in the postoperative management of patients after congenital heart surgery in the United States and around the world.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A Web-based Internet survey developed using commercially available software (SurveyMonkey) was distributed in April 21, 2011, via e-mail to recent contributors to the congenital heart literature, who were identified through an Internet literature search. The survey was also forwarded to members of the following groups and listservs: Pediheart (pediheart.org), PICUList (pedsccm.org/piculist.php), Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society (pcics.org), and Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Practitioners Group on Facebook (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</ext-link>) in an attempt to capture data from as many national and international medical or surgical practitioners of congenital heart postoperative care as possible. Those contacted by email were asked to forward the survey to those whom they thought might be appropriate to participate. Results were tabulated May 21, 2011, although the survey remains open. The distributed survey is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111433472">Table 1</xref>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 162 clinicians completed the survey. Of these 145 were physicians and 15 were nurses. About 85% of those responding to this survey were working in the United States. Respondents represented at least 54 individual cardiac centers (the open-end survey question asking for program affiliation did not require an answer). All regions of the United States were represented, with the fewest number of responses coming from those who reported they were from the Northwest United States. There were responses from clinicians working in 6 continents and 23 countries.</p>
<p>The majority of responses were from those working in free-standing children’s hospitals (61%) and university hospitals (60%). The majority of the postoperative care was reported to be delivered in a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111433472">Figure 1</xref>
). Those working in programs that performed over 300 open heart surgeries a year made up almost half of the responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111433472">Figure 2</xref>
). Nearly half of those responding stated they were trained in critical care or the combination of critical care and cardiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150135111433472">Figure 3</xref>
). Just fewer than 20% were surgeons. A third of those responding to this survey reported they were members of the pediatric cardiac intensive care society.</p>

<p>Over 90% of those responding to our survey stated that they used serial lactate monitoring for patients recovering after congenital heart surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150135111433472">Table 2</xref>
). Almost 90% stated they used some type of NIRS monitoring. Lactate monitoring performed only when clinically indicated was a preferred strategy for monitoring patients that few clinicians reported to use. Serial lactate monitoring was the considered the single best indicator of cardiovascular well-being after congenital heart surgery, followed by multisite NIRS and continuous SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring. The majority of lactate measurements (68%) were performed in the ICU as opposed to a remote laboratory located outside of the ICU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2150135111433472">Figure 4</xref>
). Measurement of blood lactate levels in the ICU was accomplished with either a blood gas machine located in the ICU or a point-of-care testing device. The least frequently utilized techniques for assessing cardiovascular well-being included single-site NIRS, noninvasive SvO<sub>2,</sub> continuous SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring, and monitoring of cardiac output (measured either invasively or noninvasively).</p>

<p>Most clinicians reported using multiple techniques to monitor patients after congenital heart surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2150135111433472">Figure 5</xref>
). Clinicians most commonly reported using three modes of monitoring for their patients. The most common combination of monitoring techniques used was the combination of NIRS (single- or multisite monitoring) and serial lactate monitoring. Only eight clinicians (5%) responded they used a single technique to monitor their patients (six used lactate monitoring, one each used single-site NIRS and noninvasive SvO<sub>2</sub>). A majority of those responding reported they continue to use volume of urine output as indicator of well-being (77%) even though 63% used Lasix to enhance urine output on the first night after surgery. There were nine individuals who commented that the physical or clinical examination was an important tool for assessing patients after heart surgery.</p>

<p>There were 62 individuals (38% of respondents) who answered question 18, name of the institution at which you practice. Fifty-four cardiac programs were identified, 40 in the United States and 14 international programs. One program had four persons respond to the survey (Primary Children’s Center, Utah) and five programs had two persons respond. Regarding question 1, “After high-risk complex congenital heart surgery the techniques we use routinely to assess cardiovascular well-being,” the data of the responses from the 54 individual centers identified in this study is represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150135111433472">Table 3</xref>
. It is clear that the responses from individual centers mirrored the responses from the individuals who completed this survey but did not identify the surgical center they were associated with. Previous personal experience with online surveys relating to the practice of congenital cardiology and surgery has suggested a more robust response rate if the option to not identify an individual’s center was given. In fact, the majority of those who responded to this survey elected not to name their center.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tibby originally described the concept of monitoring cardiovascular or metabolic well-being in critically ill children in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111433472">7</xref></sup> Cardiovascular well-being is the end result of numerous physiologic processes that occur in the critically ill. Simply stated, cardiovascular well-being may be considered having the optimal relationship between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand. Most techniques developed for evaluating cardiovascular well-being are aimed at measuring global indices of these various physiologic processes. Methods used to evaluate these global indices may include careful evaluation of the physical manifestations of low-cardiac output syndrome such as cool extremities, poor capillary refill, and diminished urine output. Objective criteria can be obtained by measuring metabolic parameters such as arterial blood gas analysis and blood lactate. Newer means available for assessing cardiovascular well-being have been aimed at measuring various components of those physiologic processes associated with oxygen delivery such as cardiac output, NIRS, or SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring.</p>
<p>The physical examination has been the cornerstone of the evaluation of the critically ill patient. However, limitations of the physical examination in assessing cardiovascular well-being in critically ill children are well documented. Cardiac output has been shown to correlate poorly with palpable pulse amplitude, tactile or measured extremity temperature, and capillary refill times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111433472">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111433472"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111433472">10</xref></sup> All techniques available for assessing cardiovascular well-being in patients should be considered in the context of the risk–benefit equation associated with the use of each. Low-tech noninvasive modalities, such as reliance of the physical examination or quantity of urine output, have little inherent risk unto themselves. However, the accuracy of these techniques to assess the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients may be questionable, and although there is little risk associated with performing these measurements, the benefits of using more invasive techniques may ultimately create a safer environment for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111433472">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The results of our study suggest that there is a general agreement regarding the management of children after congenital heart surgery. Most clinicians surveyed utilized a combination of multisite NIRS monitoring along with serial blood lactate measurements. This consistency of monitoring strategies was noted despite the variation in care models clinicians reported delivering postoperative care in or whether the clinician was trained in pediatric critical care medicine, pediatric cardiology, dual trained in both, or trained in surgery.</p>
<p>Continuous measurement of SvO<sub>2</sub> was considered a superior indicator of cardiovascular well-being in our survey than intermittent SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring (17.1% vs 6.7%). Despite this fact over twice the respondents to this survey (55.4%) reported to routinely monitor intermittent SvO<sub>2</sub> than those who reported they routinely use continuous SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring (22.3%). This apparent paradox might be explained by need to place more expensive and larger invasive catheters to measure continuous SvO<sub>2</sub> than to occasionally draw a blood sample from a routinely placed intracardiac line for intermittent SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring. Measurement of mixed venous or systemic oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) in the critically ill originally required the placement of a fiberoptic catheter in the pulmonary artery. Measurement of SvO<sub>2</sub> provides an estimate of the oxygen supply as it relates to the current oxygen demands of the body. While many physicians still believe that this data is valuable in assessing the well-being of critically ill adult patients, the benefits of SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is questionable at best and its use in the management of critically ill patients has diminished markedly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111433472">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111433472"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111433472"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111433472">15</xref></sup> The role of true mixed venous oxygen saturation (MvO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring in the management of critically ill children recovering after congenital heart surgery can be questioned. Accurate or true MvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring requires measurement of an admixture of all systemic venous blood, which occurs only in the pulmonary artery. For patients with complex congenital heart disease, placement of pulmonary artery catheters is either impractical (usually because of size constraints) or not helpful (because of mixing of arterial and venous blood flow before it enters the pulmonary artery). Complications resulting from the placement of pulmonary artery catheters in both adults and children are well described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111433472">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111433472">17</xref></sup> Fiber optic catheters capable of continuously measuring central venous oxygen saturation are available but their correlation with SvO<sub>2</sub> and their ability to alter outcomes favorably in the critically ill is still debated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111433472">18</xref></sup> Clinicians responding to our survey used SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring infrequently. Monitoring of SvO<sub>2</sub> (often incorrectly termed MvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring) showed promise in the management of babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome but still required an invasive catheter placed in the superior vena cava.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111433472">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111433472">20</xref></sup> Monitoring SvO<sub>2</sub> can help predict which patients are at highest risk of dying in the ICU after congenital heart surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111433472">21</xref></sup> Recently, a new method of noninvasive SvO<sub>2</sub> monitoring has recently been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135111433472">22</xref></sup> Utilizing visible light technology, these devices have been developed to detect tissue ischemia in the critically ill. Although it appears promising, it remains to be seen what place this technology will play in the management of children after cardiac surgery in the future.</p>
<p>Near-infrared spectroscopy provides a noninvasive estimate of tissue oxygenation. Although NIRS reportedly measures regional oxygen saturation, it has replaced the use of MvO<sub>2</sub> in the postoperative management of patients with congenital heart disease in many centers, and it has been suggested it might be a useful indicator of SvO<sub>2</sub> trends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111433472">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135111433472">23</xref></sup> Near-infrared spectroscopy has been shown to be useful in evaluating cerebral and splanchnic tissue oxygenation after congenital heart surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150135111433472">24</xref></sup> In our survey, the majority of clinicians responding used some type of NIRS monitoring. Of these, most preferred multisite NIRS to single site.</p>
<p>Blood lactate monitoring was the most frequent technique used to monitor children after cardiac surgery. This was true for clinicians in the United States and for those who identified themselves as being international. Of those who stated they measured lactate, most measured lactate serially, as opposed to when thought to be clinically indicated. Serial blood lactate monitoring has been shown to predict early outcomes in children undergoing complex congenital heart repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150135111433472">25</xref></sup> The ability to measure lactate quickly and at the bedside with a point-of-care device has been associated with a marked improvement in outcomes for children undergoing congenital heart surgery, with the greatest improvements noted in those at highest risk of dying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111433472">4</xref></sup> In our survey, most lactate analysis was being completed at the point of care, either with a point-of-care testing device at the bedside, or an arterial blood gas machine in the ICU. Reliance on general hospital laboratories or even STAT laboratories appears to for the most part be replaced in most centers with point-of-care testing, at least for critical and time sensitive tests such as blood lactate monitoring.</p>
<p>Cardiac output monitoring has been considered the gold standard for assessing hemodynamics in critically ill adults for decades. Interestingly, it was one of the least favored techniques for assessing cardiovascular well-being in our survey. There may be a number of reasons why this may be so. An important consideration in congenital heart surgery is the size of the patient. In this era, the majority of congenital heart surgery is performed on patients under a year of age. Invasive techniques for monitoring cardiac output have been associated with their own inherent risks, which may outweigh their benefits for many. Complications associated with the use of Swan-Ganz catheters are well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150135111433472">26</xref></sup> Newer devices for measuring cardiac output may require arterial access with a prohibitively large vascular sheath for small children. Cardiovascular well-being might be considered to summation of events associated with the relationship of oxygen delivery to oxygen consumption. Cardiac output represents less than half of that equation. A “normal” cardiac output in the face of increased metabolic demands may be inadequate to meet the needs of the cardiovascular system. Li et al demonstrated that in some patients, oxygen consumption might be markedly elevated in the immediate postoperative period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150135111433472">27</xref></sup> In congenital heart surgery, even the definition of cardiac output can become confusing in a patient with single ventricle physiology and an aortopulmonary shunt. Is the cardiac output describing the total output of the single ventricle itself (output ultimately to both the pulmonary and systemic vascular beds), or does it describe the systemic cardiac output? It can also be debated which of these outputs would be most important to measure.</p>
<sec id="section4-2150135111433472">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations based on its design. Although a significant number of surgical centers were identified, over half of the clinicians responding to this survey did not identify their center, so it is not clear exactly what percentage of centers are actually represented in this study. It is also unclear whether any centers are overrepresented in this study. It is possible that selection bias may exist, since the selection process was unable to target clinicians from all centers that perform congenital heart surgery. We relied heavily on those persons motivated to join professional societies or contribute to the current medical literature. Responses to this survey could not be independently validated. The data presented do however express the opinions of a large cohort of individual clinicians who state they are intimately involved in the care of the postoperative patient.</p>
<p>The data presented may somewhat be skewed by multiple responses from single large centers. We hope that <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150135111433472">Table 3</xref> addressed that problem adequately. Taking a single best response from each identified center, it is clear that this data is very consistent with the data collected from the respondents who did not identify their center.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The holy grail of cardiovascular monitoring continues to elude us. Inherent problems are associated with all methods of evaluating cardiovascular well-being after congenital heart surgery. Serial lactate monitoring is the most commonly used method to monitor cardiovascular well-being in patients after congenital heart surgery in the United States and worldwide. The vast majority of clinicians rely on a number of modalities when assessing their patients in the postoperative period, with the combination of NIRS monitoring combined with serial lactate monitoring being the most common combination of techniques offered to the child recovering after heart surgery. It is not clear whether any single modality of cardiovascular monitoring will lead to superior outcomes nor is it clear whether clinicians’ individual biases direct management in the postoperative period as opposed to evidence-based practice. It is also unclear whether utilizing multiple modalities to monitor patients is superior to using a single technology or what combination of monitoring techniques will lead to the best outcomes. Further investigation of the clinical utility of all of these practices is warranted.</p>
