<p>In <italic>Selling the Amish</italic>, Susan L. Trollinger presents a thorough cultural analysis of the tourism surrounding “Amish Country” in the United States, addressing issues far beyond the economic relationship between tourists and tourist sites. Trollinger incorporates information from 15 years of research, including original fieldwork among her sources. She frames the Amish as a subculture choosing its way of life to best serve its religious beliefs, with guidelines promoting ways of voluntary simplicity, and the tourists as “middle Americans” seeking contact with the Amish way of life and its benefits. However, the Amish are less directly involved in tourism scenes than might be expected—they serve as more of an image or ideal in these contexts, yet their presence plays a vital role.</p>
<p>Trollinger focuses on three carefully-selected tourist destinations in Ohio’s Amish Country: Walnut Creek, Berlin, and Sugarcreek. These sites have important differences in the focus of their tourist attractions, and illustrate themes underlying Amish country tourism as a whole. Walnut Creek features gift shops, a chocolate shop, an inn, and the famous Der Dutchman Restaurant. She discusses how the Victorian architecture is seemingly inconsistent with the Amish theme, explaining it as part of a process giving tourists a sense of hope for being able to create a simpler world in which time is more plentiful and ambiguity about gender roles is resolved, modeled after that of the Amish. Berlin features vendors of antiques and other goods as well as the Farmstead Restaurant, with an American frontier theme displaying American heritage as peaceful and resulting from the agency of inventive pioneers. This site serves to inspire tourists to reconsider their relationship with technology, and to reflect on the sense of autonomy from the technologies accepted by the Amish (similar to many of those of the frontier period). Sugarcreek, also called “The Little Switzerland of Ohio,” hosts the Ohio Swiss Festival annually (which started in 1953 as a way to increase demand from the local Swiss cheese factories), and features some Swiss-style architecture. Trollinger frames the Swiss festival as a performance of ethnicity, reminiscent of the identification becoming lost over time. The Amish have a strong sense of ethnic identity and performance—it is a constant process, while the Swiss festival only takes place once every year. The Amish population does not seem to be diminishing, either.</p>
<p>Trollinger reminds us of the disconnect between Amish reality and the tourist sites and their cultural importance. The tourism indeed seems to thrive on the meaning generated and how important it is to visitors (p. xix). Her Amish informants described crossing paths with tourists not as chances to put on a show for them, but “opportunities to make visible another way of being in the world, a way that is peaceful and fulfilling” (p. 149). Overall, the book is very readable, and should be engaging for those interested in the Amish subculture and the tourism surrounding it. The chapter notes provided before the index were very thorough and informative, but would receive more attention if they were formatted as footnotes or pages at the end of each chapter. This book also may be appropriate for coursework focusing on tourism or cultural studies more generally.</p>
