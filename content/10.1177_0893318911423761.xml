<p>The increasing marketization of the nonprofit sector has been the subject of considerable debate among both scholars and practitioners. The growing use of business discourse and practice responds to the necessity of providing sustainable solutions to social causes within a market economy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423761">Herzlinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318911423761">Van Til, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318911423761">Weisbord, 1998</xref>). At the same time, this trend represents the encroachment of a corporate ideology that may threaten the nonprofit sector’s unique role in society (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423761">Brainard &amp; Siplon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423761">Bush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911423761">Eikenberry &amp; Kluver, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>While this debate is often oriented toward some form of resolution, I argue it is more productive to understand marketization in the nonprofit sector through a lens of tension and contradiction, which recognizes and celebrates the dilemmatic nature of organizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318911423761">Trethewey &amp; Ashcraft, 2004</xref>). A tension-centered perspective reveals the contradictory nature of nonprofit organizing and recognizes that all organizational communication practices must simultaneously and continuously manage the pull between the financial imperatives of the market and the need to address privately unprofitable, but publicly beneficial, social missions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318911423761">Weisbord, 1998</xref>). This <italic>organizing tension</italic> is central to nonprofit work and cannot be escaped without compromising the fundamental purpose of the nonprofit sector. In this essay, I develop this claim, illustrating how nonprofit marketization and the contradictory position of the nonprofit sector in society highlight this ontological feature of nonprofit organizing.</p>
<sec id="section1-0893318911423761">
<title>Marketization of the Nonprofit Sector</title>
<p>Marketization describes the unquestioning and widespread adoption of market discourse and practice in nonbusiness organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911423761">Nikel &amp; Eikenberry, 2009</xref>). In the nonprofit sector, business-like assumptions, practices, and discourses are becoming the primary logic of popular organizational narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911423761">Dempsey &amp; Sanders, 2010</xref>) and organizational decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318911423761">Oakes, Townley, &amp; Cooper, 1998</xref>). Many scholars have noted the ways in which consumerism, self-interest, profit-motive, and commercialism are dominating the ways in which society conceptualizes how nonprofit organizations should improve the common good and build civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423761">Brainard &amp; Siplon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911423761">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>). As a result, responses to social problems are becoming primarily focused on individualized and market-based solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911423761">Dempsey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The central concern about marketization in the nonprofit sector is “the potential deterioration of the distinctive contributions that nonprofit organizations make to creating and maintaining a strong civil society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911423761">Eikenberry &amp; Kluver, 2004</xref>, p. 138). As nonprofit organizations operate within a market economy, values such as commitment beyond self, individual worth and dignity, responsibility, tolerance, freedom, and responsibilities of citizens that underlie nonprofit work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318911423761">O’Connell, 1988</xref>) can be overshadowed by economic and competition-centered values that seek to secure competitive advantage in the pursuit of producing individual-level goods and services for those who can afford them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423761">Brainard &amp; Siplon, 2004</xref>). As a result, nonprofit organizing practices become understood through and legitimized by the discourse and logic of business, relegating the unique characteristics of the nonprofit sector to a secondary or even inexpressible role.</p>
<p>Although critiques of nonprofit marketization pointedly expose the significant problems of employing market logic in nonprofit organizing, they do not propose a rejection of the market itself. Rather, such critiques warn that marketization is closing off the voluntary spirit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423761">Brainard &amp; Siplon, 2004</xref>), democratic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911423761">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>), and altruistic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423761">Bush, 1992</xref>) of the nonprofit sector that enable it to perform its unique role in society. These concerns, I suggest, say as much about the ontology of contemporary nonprofit organizations as they do about the adoption of specific organizational structures, practices, and logics. Marketization reveals the simultaneous pull between the financial imperatives of operating within a market economy and pursuing a social mission. The existence of this tension arises from the contradictory nature of the nonprofit sector itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0893318911423761">
<title>The Nonprofit Sector as a Contradictory Space</title>
<p>Theoretical explanations of the nature and purpose of the nonprofit sector highlight its contradictory nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423761">Frumkin (2002)</xref> argued that the nonprofit sector is a “mass of contradictions” because it is “the contested arena between the state and the market where public and private concerns meet and where individual and social efforts are united” (p. 1). As a result, nonprofit organizations not only operate in ways similar to the market because they are private and independent but also operate in ways similar to the state because they must contribute to the common good. Occupying this “third” space in society creates tensions and contradictions in everyday functioning that nonprofit organizations cannot ignore and that at times may even threaten their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318911423761">Van Til, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423761">Brainard and Siplon (2004)</xref> explained, “Professional nonprofit organizations must constantly struggle with the extent to which they are to emphasize their role as efficient and competitive economic actors or their role as institutions important to democracy” (p. 436).</p>
<p>As a result, the tension between the financial imperatives of the market and the need to fulfill a social mission is an inherent characteristic of nonprofit organizing. Of course, in a sector so broad and diverse that it is more often defined by what it is not, rather than what it is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318911423761">O’Neill, 2002</xref>), every nonprofit organization will not experience this tension the same way. Nevertheless, nonprofit organizations cannot function outside of the realities of the market economies in which they pursue their work. Therefore, by independently and privately operating within a market economy to develop civil society and pursue the common good, nonprofit organizations must organize their work around these competing and seemingly contradictory concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0893318911423761">
<title>Theorizing an Organizing Tension</title>
<p>I argue that organizational communication research should theorize the tension between the financial imperatives of the market and the pursuit of a social mission as an ontological feature of nonprofit organizations. By doing so, scholars can more successfully understand the organizing practices of nonprofit work and make better sense of nonprofit marketization. This theoretical move is made easier by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318911423761">Trethewey and Ashcraft (2004)</xref>, who have developed a framework for understanding the “dilemmatic character of organizing” (p. 81) as a normal outcome of organizational communication. Arguing that tension and contradiction are inherent in organizational life, this perspective does not seek resolution but instead focuses on how organizational members practically live with tension and contradiction. Employing this perspective enables the “development of organizational theories that are at once more complex and responsive to actual practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911423761">Ashcraft &amp; Trethewey, 2004</xref>, p. 171).</p>
<p>While research on organizational tensions and contradictions holds that a variety of tensions exist in all forms of organizing, I extend this argument to suggest that because of its tension-filled and contradictory position in society, the nonprofit sector is guided by an <italic>organizing tension</italic> that is an ontological feature of all organizations that are dedicated to fulfilling social missions and building civil society within market economies. This tension is inescapable without compromising either the integrity of the nonprofit endeavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911423761">Nikel &amp; Eikenberry, 2009</xref>) or violating the responsibly to remain financially viable for those who support and receive services that nonprofit organizations provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911423761">Dees &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing this organizing tension is both theoretically and practically useful. Theoretically, it allows scholars to understand nonprofit marketization more fully. For example, rather than framing marketization as a current trend that needs to be solved or overcome, this perspective reframes the tension between financial imperatives and social goals as a central feature of nonprofit organizing that must be managed and preserved rather than closed off or resolved. Practically, it enables practitioners to see the existence of these competing concerns and recognize their mutual importance even though they may seemingly contradict each other. Indeed, successful nonprofit management may depend on recognizing, understanding, and managing this tension. As a result, organizational communication practices should engage this tension as productive and constitutive rather than destructive or disabling.</p>
<p>Theorizing the tension between the financial imperatives of the market and the pursuit of a social mission as an organizing tension and ontological feature of nonprofits is an important initial step in answering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318911423761">Lewis’ (2005)</xref> call to take into account the unique features of the nonprofit endeavor. Doing so has important implications for how organizational communication scholars conducting research in the nonprofit sector conceptualize and investigate organizing phenomena. For example, analyzing the concept of organizational culture would require analysis of the artifacts, values, and assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911423761">Keyton, 2005</xref>) that reflect both the organization’s social mission <italic>as well as</italic> its financial stability and credibility. Understanding how employees, volunteers, and donors create and sustain cultures that give meaning to differing and tension-filled organizational goals and priorities would expand our current knowledge of communication and organizational culture in important ways. Such knowledge will be particularly valuable as many for-profit organizations now pursue social goals through corporate social responsibility or social business enterprises.</p>
<p>Our understanding of organizational and professional identity would also be enriched by research from this perspective. Given the strong identification that many nonprofit professionals have with the missions of their organizations and the higher calling of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318911423761">Mize Smith, Arendt, Bezek Lahman, &amp; Duff, 2006</xref>), it is important to understand the communicative practices in which nonprofit organizations and their members engage to manage tensions between the market-based and mission-based professional identities. Likewise, as organizations seek to establish an identity with a broad and diverse public, they will need to communicate an identity that draws on the meaningfulness of nonprofit work as well as the economic sustainability of their operations.</p>
<p>As distinctions between the business, government, and nonprofit sectors continue to blur and their efforts overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423761">Frumkin, 2002</xref>), all organizations will need to understand how to deal with the inherent tensions of pursuing social goals while attending to the financial imperatives of the market. Theorizing nonprofit organizations as contradictory enterprises and analyzing organizational communication concepts through that lens will aid in developing more complex and responsive knowledge that organizations in other sectors will need in order to be successful in such endeavors.</p>
