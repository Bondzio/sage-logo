<abstract>
<p>The number of elderly persons is expected to increase to 55 million by 2020, with the minority population increasing to 12.9 million, yet fewer than 30% of Americans have advance directives in place. Cultural values, religious beliefs, and family support systems are a few of the factors that influence or hinder the completion of advance directives. Health care provider perspectives regarding advance directives vary greatly with health care settings. Many primary care providers are reluctant to initiate conversations regarding advance directives for multiple reasons. Nurse practitioners cover more than 600 million office visits per year in the United States and are in a key position to educate, advocate, and assist in the completion of advance directives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The federal Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) of 1990 requires all hospitals, health-maintenance organizations, nursing homes, and health care institutions receiving Medicare/Medicaid funding to (<italic>a</italic>) provide written information to each client regarding the right to make decisions concerning medical care, the right to accept or refuse, and the right to create advance directives (ADs), (<italic>b</italic>) asking whether the client has executed an AD and document the client’s response in the medical record, (<italic>c</italic>) provide staff education on issues concerning ADs, (<italic>d</italic>) ensure compliance with requirements of state law regarding ADs, and (<italic>e</italic>) not to condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate based on the ADs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111419293">1</xref>
</sup> The PSDA was designed to acknowledge a patient’s right to either refuse or accept medical treatment, empowering the patient by safeguarding autonomy, protecting the patient against maltreatment, and fostering communication with health care professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111419293">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Many factors influence older adults to complete ADs however, there are a number of barriers that hinder that completion. Fewer than 30% of Americans have ADs in place. These directives include a living will, durable power of attorney for health care (DPAHC), or a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111419293">3</xref>
</sup> These ADs can spare chronically ill and dying patients much physical and emotional suffering. Advance directives can also spare families the burden of making decisions at a time when they are emotionally stressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909111419293">
<title>Advance Directives</title>
<p>The living will is a legal document which enables a person to provide specific instructions regarding health care wishes in the event that he or she becomes unable to communicate.</p>
<p>The DPAHC enables the patient to designate an agent to make health care decisions for them in the event that they become mentally incapacitated. Even though the DPAHC is in effect immediately, the agent is not empowered to make decisions unless the patient is deemed to be incapable of informed consent. Once the patient is deemed incapable, the agent can then make decisions regarding treatment.</p>
<p>The DNR order gives an individual the opportunity to exercise their right to limit care in emergency situations. A standardized form created by the Ohio Department of Health is recognizable as well as portable in multiple health care settings. Ohio law offers 2 options under the DNR order, DNR-comfort care, and DNR-arrest. Other state laws and forms may vary, making it imperative that each practitioner be familiar with their state practices.</p>
<p>For many patients and family members, the DNR order is confusing at best and leads one to believe that no treatment will be issued. When, in fact, the American Medical Association states that a DNR order precludes resuscitative efforts only in the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest and should not influence other therapeutic interventions that may be appropriate for a patient including vasopressors, antibiotics, artificial nutrients, and hydration and at times intubation.<sup>

<title>Growing Number of Elders</title>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau, there are more than 37.9 million people over the age of 65. By 2020, the total number of people 65 years and older is expected to increase to 55 million.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111419293">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Majority of older persons have at least 1 chronic condition, while many have multiple comorbidities. In 2006, over 13 million elderly persons over the age of 65 were hospitalized for an average of 5.5 days.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111419293">6</xref>
</sup> A small portion of elderly persons—approximately 1.6 million—reside in long-term care facilities nationwide. These residents are often cognitively or physically impaired and many are frail. Nearly 70% have ADs in place compared to only 20% of elderly persons in the general population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111419293">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In 2008, 19.3% of persons 65 years and older were minorities. In all, 8.3% African American, 6.6% Hispanic, 3.2% Asian or Islander, and less than 1% native Alaskans and American Indian. The minority population is expected to increase to 12.9 million in 2020, with 23.6% being over the age of 65.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111419293">
<title>Patient Barriers to Completion</title>
<p>Many providers and elderly people feel a strong need to document wishes well in advance of need. Despite this feeling, few people actually complete the AD forms. The 5 major reasons why ADs are not completed include (1) the patients need more information about ADs, (2) the patient has never heard of ADs, (3) no one has ever spoken to the patient regarding ADs, (4) the patient would rather have the primary care provider make health care decisions for them, and (5) the patient has wanted to complete the forms but “have not gotten around to it.”<sup>7(p272)</sup>
</p>
<p>Data from another study indicated that 84% of all participants perceived advance care planning to be irrelevant—stating they were “too healthy,” “they preferred to leave it in God’s hands or to fate,” “hadn’t given it much thought,” or their “provider, family and friends knew their wishes.” Personal barriers in this study were cited as “makes me nervous,” “don’t want to think about death,” and “am too busy with work and family.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111419293">8</xref>
</sup> Other reasons for noncompletion included relationship concerns, information needs, health encounter time constraints, and problems with the forms themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909111419293">
<title>Legal Barriers to Completion</title>
<p>Five legal barriers have been identified; these include poor readability, health care agent restrictions, execution requirements, inadequate reciprocity and religious, cultural and social inadequacies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111419293">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<sec id="section6-1049909111419293">
<title>Inadequate readability</title>
<p>Approximately 40% of Americans read at an 8th grade level or below.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111419293">10</xref>
</sup> The documents used in the AD process are written at a 12th grade level, making them difficult to read and/or understand. To add to the difficulty, many of these forms are unavailable in the patients’ native languages.<sup>9(p122)</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049909111419293">
<title>Health care agent restrictions</title>
<p>Restrictions on who may serve as a health care agent are currently active in 37 states, only 8 states recognize domestic partners and same sex partners in their health decision law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111419293">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111419293">
<title>Execution requirements</title>
<p>Nearly all states require at least 2 witnesses, 18 states permit notarization as an alternative, however, 2 states require both, 2 witnesses and notarization. To further complicate the process, many states have strict guidelines as to who can serve as a witness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111419293">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049909111419293">
<title>Inadequate reciprocity</title>
<p>Forty seven states currently have reciprocity laws, these laws ensure that out-of-state ADs are considered validly executed but does not ensure that they will be interpreted in the same way.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111419293">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049909111419293">
<title>Religious, cultural, and social inadequacies</title>
<p>The AD forms are standardized and do not allow for expressions of alternate religious, cultural, or social beliefs.<sup>9(p124)</sup>
</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049909111419293">
<title>Multicultural and Ethnic Consideration</title>
<p>The United States has become increasing culturally diverse with 19.3% of persons 65 years and older being in the minority category. It is essential that health care providers be sensitive to the differences in values, attitudes, customs, and beliefs embraced by different cultural and ethnic groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111419293">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Cultural values are the design of living. Most cultures have taboos surrounding what is and what is not acceptable to speak about. In some cultures, illness is viewed as a punishment and therefore discussions regarding diagnosis and prognosis are forbidden.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111419293">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Korean Americans as well as Mexican Americans utilize a family-centered model of decision making and are less likely to believe that the patient should be told about the diagnosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111419293">15</xref>
</sup> They believe that the family should make decisions regarding end-of-life choices.</p>
<p>African Americans believe that caring for and/or being cared for by family is a sign of respect and dignity. African Americans are more likely to request life-sustaining treatments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111419293">16</xref>
</sup> This is possibly due to their religious values and the belief that only God can decide when one lives or dies.</p>
<p>In order to assist patients with end-of-life decisions, it is necessary to have a strong cultural understanding and to negotiate with patients to obtain mutually acceptable goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049909111419293">
<title>Provider’s Perspective of Discussions on ADs</title>
<sec id="section13-1049909111419293">
<title>Physicians</title>
<p>A study by Morrison et al proposed 5 essential barriers to initiation of discussion and/or completion of ADs. These include physicians’ lack of understanding, erroneous beliefs about appropriateness, discomfort with the participant, time constraints, and compensation concerns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111419293">17</xref>
</sup> In a fee-for-service–based health system that discourages lengthy office visits, it is not feasible to initiate discussions pertaining to end-of-life decisions. This is a complicated issue that requires input from not only the patient but also the family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049909111419293">
<title>Medical Residents</title>
<p>Many resident physicians are inadequately taught the art of communication regarding end-of-life decision making. A study by Deep et al states that medical residents report internal conflict regarding previous experiences discussing resuscitation with patients. Their approach to these discussions focuses on resuscitation versus the processes that might improve patient decision making. Many residents feel that “their skill perpetuates a concentration on imparting information rather than the emotional and psychosocial elements patients and families find critical to decision making.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111419293">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049909111419293">
<title>Nurses</title>
<p>Nurses are involved in patient education and advocacy in regard to ADs. They hold the role of educator, initiator, facilitator, advocate, and liaison with in the family unit as well as the health care team. A study by Black revealed that nurses perform “multiple roles along a continuum of interactions with patients and families.” The nurses involved stated that they are comfortable speaking to the patients regarding end-of-life decisions and feel that the information shared with the patient represents important contributions to “informed decision making.”<sup>

<title>Nurse Practitioner as an Advocate</title>
<sec id="section17-1049909111419293">
<title>Primary Provider</title>
<p>According to the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (NPs), there are 140 000 practicing practitioners in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111419293">20</xref>
</sup> Of these, 49.2% are certified in family practice, 17.9% in adult health, covering more than 600 million office visits per year. These statistics place NPs at the front line for the education and the initiation of ADs. Primary care focuses on health promotion and maintenance. The establishment of ADs is an integral part of overall health maintenance and should be initiated and completed when the patient is unburdened by acute illness. The NP has the ability and the opportunity to initiate end-of-life discussions with his or her patients in the primary care setting. This opportunity begins with the practitioner helping patients articulate and prioritize goals of care. These goals should be readdressed and expanded with each visit.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049909111419293">
<title>Providing Appropriate Care—Not Limiting Treatment</title>
<p>Establishing clear goals about the plan of care is the best way to facilitate the appropriate medical treatment per the patient’s wishes. As for the DNR order, there is overwhelming evidence that the order is often unclear and fails to define limits. The data also demonstrate that the DNR order is often applied to other therapies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111419293">21</xref>
</sup> In the state of Ohio, the DNR form clearly identifies what will occur and when it will cease. For example, the patient with a DNR comfort care arrest order will receive all of the appropriate medical treatment, including resuscitation, until a cardiac or pulmonary arrest occurs. On the other hand, the DNR comfort care is very specific regarding what treatment is to be given and what treatment can be withheld. In both cases however, this order does not mean “do not treat.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049909111419293">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Advance directives can be very confusing for patients and family members, therefore the number of older adults with completed ADs remain low. The forms are written at a 12th grade level, even though 40% of Americans read at a lower level. Physicians are reluctant to initiate talks regarding ADs due to time and other constraints. The NP is in the perfect position to assist older persons in the understanding and completion of ADs.</p>
