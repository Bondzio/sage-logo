<abstract>
<p>This article verifies the hypothesis that a spatial mismatch between jobs and housing exists in two typical low-income housing neighbourhoods, Tangxia and Tongde, in Guangzhou city, where surveys were undertaken. The research shows that the types of residents in Tangxia and Tongde have changed significantly during the past few years. Housing types transferred comprise subsidised rental housing, commercial housing and private lease housing. At the same time, the jobs–housing mismatch among residents in subsidised rental and commercial houses has become striking. The mechanisms responsible for the mismatch vary from a passive process for residents in subsidised rental housing to an active process for those in commercial housing. In comparison, private lease housing residents do not experience a jobs–housing mismatch. This result shows that, with the interaction of the legacy of the socialist land and housing market with the new market-orientated system, government still plays an important role in housing supply. This is especially so for low-income families, who face a ‘passive’ jobs–housing relocation and mismatch, while the market-orientated parts of the system play an active role in people’s job–housing relocation.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The spatial mismatch hypothesis (SMH) was first put forward by John F. Kain from Harvard University. He believed that the suburbanisation of jobs and the barriers that prevent inner-city lower-skilled residents from shifting their labour supply to suburban areas would result in high unemployment, low income, living in poverty and other problems for disadvantaged groups such as Blacks and minorities and that this would become a source of social unrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012465906">Kain, 1968</xref>). Over the past 40 years, Kain’s theoretical hypothesis has been widely extended to many fields of urban research, not only in the US, but also in other regions of the world.</p>
<p>Initially, studies of the SMH focused on the specific issue of the poor labour market (high unemployment and low wages) for the low-skilled Black inner-city residents who were disconnected from suburban job opportunities. The SMH also suggested that inner-city Blacks did not relocate to the suburbs where the jobs were because they were racially discriminated against in the suburban housing market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012465906">Gobillon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research on the SMH was extended to the young, Asians, Hispanics, new immigrants, women and other vulnerable groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012465906">Farley, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012465906">Holzer, 1991</xref>). The research emphasis also changed from testing the validity of the SMH to analysing employment problems of the vulnerable groups such as the barriers to employment, commuting stress and social welfare policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012465906">Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012465906">Kain, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012465906">Mclafferty and Preston, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012465906">Stoll, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012465906">Taylor and Ong, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>After 2000, with the rapid development of urbanisation and an accompanying growth of residences and working spaces, some new problems emerged and injected new vitality into the SMH research field. Many scholars tried to analyse spatial mismatch from a new perspective. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012465906">Ihlanfeldt (2002)</xref>, whose study focused on spatial mismatch relationships, unemployment and crime, found that the spatial mismatch in the Los Angeles bay area caused a lower employment rate (30–50 per cent) and higher crime rate (21 per cent) in young Black men compared with Whites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012465906">Patacchini and Zenou (2005)</xref> studied the problem caused by spatial mismatch from the perspective of transport. They researched whether private car ownership and availability of public transport influenced the unemployed men’s travel time, efforts in looking for work and job accessibility.</p>
<p>In the meantime, much attention has been put into possible solutions to the problems caused by spatial mismatch. Based on research on the means, distance and costs of commuting of the low-income group, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012465906">Martin (2001)</xref> argued ‘commuter subsidies’ to solve the problem of spatial mismatch. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012465906">Ong and Miller (2005)</xref> studied the relationship between employment rates and transport accessibility and showed that neighbourhoods with higher rates of car ownership tended to have higher employment rates. A recommendation made as a result of their study was that the government should support people from vulnerable groups to buy cars. In addition, researchers made suggestions for housing, transport and other welfare policies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012465906">Ong, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012465906">Shen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012465906">Kawabata, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012465906">Gobillon <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> summarised these recommendations thus: helping the Black population to move to suburban areas; attracting sufficient jobs to the city centre; and, improving physical connections between inner-city Black workers and suburban jobs. Many empirical studies have shown that the first two approaches tended to be less effective whereas the third method was the most attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012465906">Rosenbaum, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012465906">Mendenhall <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012465906">Katz <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although urban population mobility in China is significantly different from that in the West, the SMH has received growing attention from Chinese scholars in recent years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012465906">Zhou (2004)</xref> was among the first to introduce the idea of the SMH from the US into China. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098012465906">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> contended that studies of the SMH in the Chinese context should be of great significance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012465906">Li and Wu (2006)</xref> suggested that China should learn from the findings of overseas research about the SMH when formulating employment policies and undertaking transport planning and urban regeneration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012465906">Liu and Weng (2008)</xref> assessed the progress made in the study of the SMH and suggested that the government should pay more attention to the housing and employment needs of laid-off workers, demolition resettlement households, low-rent housing tenants and other vulnerable groups when formulating welfare policies.</p>
<p>As for empirical research, Chinese researchers have applied the concept of the SMH to the analysis of the problems caused by the job–housing mismatch in some large Chinese cities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012465906">Zhou and Yan (2005)</xref> used Guangzhou as a case study and investigated the job–housing (im)balance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012465906">Meng and Fang (2007)</xref> found that the spatial mismatch phenomenon existed in Beijing. They suggested that the government consider the SMH when making decisions about project locations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012465906">Qian <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> applied the SMH model to a study of the location of low-priced commercial housing in Shanghai. Other researchers have applied the SMH to studies of suburbanisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012465906">Song <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and urban villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012465906">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Thus far, most of the research conducted in China supports the applicability of the SMH model to Chinese cities, although the background, related factors and process mechanism may be different.</p>
<p>Research on the SMH has played an important role in urban development and policy-making in the US. However, in China, the SMH has only been introduced and tested fairly recently. With rapid urbanisation and a different social and economic system, the situation in China differs from that described in the original model of the SMH. Nevertheless, the ideas put forward by the SMH aimed at solving urban unemployment, alleviating traffic congestion and filling the gap between the rich and the poor should still apply to Chinese cities. There is a need to combine the theoretical model of the SMH with Chinese realities by conducting research on spatial mismatch problems involving vulnerable Chinese groups, especially low-income families.</p>
<p>Based on the interaction of the legacy of the socialist land and housing market with the new market-orientated system in China, both the market and the government have played an important role in housing supply. In recent decades, the provision of housing to low-income households, named affordable housing, and subsidised rental housing have become an important part of urban development policies adopted by the post-reform government in China. A large number of low-income neighbourhoods were built after the housing reform in the 1980s, but most of them are located in the urban fringe for economic and political reasons. Has this brought SMH problems to the low-income residents? At the same time, some affordable housing has been changed into commercial and private lease housing by the market. Do these different groups of residents meet with the same problems? If so, how does the dual housing supply system add to the dynamics of the problem? What roles do the government and market play in people’s job–housing relocation decisions?</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper will focus on these topics and will present the results of a survey conducted in two low-income neighbourhoods (Tangxia and Tongde) selected from those that were built during 1992–97 in Guangzhou.</p>

<title>2. A Brief Introduction to Chinese Housing Policy</title>
<p>Before the reform and opening up in 1978, urban housing provision in China was moved from the private to the public sector, and most housing was arranged by the government and work units (called <italic>danweis</italic>). However, as urban development and market reforms continued, the government started to experiment with housing reform in the cities in the 1980s. The main purpose was to shift new housing provision from the government and work units to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012465906">Wang and Murie, 2000</xref>). In February <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012465906">1988</xref>, the State Council of China issued the <italic>Notice on implementing town housing reform in batches</italic>, in order to improve housing consumption through the privatisation of the previously welfare-oriented housing system. Profound changes have since taken place in housing provision and uptake. There have been significant investments in commercial and self-built housing in both the public and private sectors which have been promoted through various means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012465906">Huang and William, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the important consequences of implementing the new housing policies has been increased social segregation in the cities. A small number of wealthy people began to move to the new improved housing. However, most of the low-income households had to stay on in dilapidated and crowded flats. In order to solve the housing problems of these low-income groups, local governments formulated a series of interim policies and began to build some low-income neighbourhoods. By <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012465906">1994</xref>, the State Council had published the <italic>Decision on deepening the urban housing reform</italic>. This marked the establishment of the dual housing provision system with subsidised housing for low-income households and a commercial housing supply for middle- and high-income households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012465906">Wang and Murie, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012465906">1998</xref>, in order to speed up the process of housing reform and support the market-based real estate industry, the Chinese government decided to terminate the traditional welfare housing allocation system. The State Council published the <italic>Notice on further deepening the reform of urban housing system and speeding up housing construction</italic>. Many urban dwellers were forced to enter the market for housing provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012465906">Lau and Li, 2006</xref>). However, the regulation highlighted the housing problems of low-income groups and mandated local governments to strengthen subsidised housing provision for them. A number of affordable housing and subsidised rental housing projects were then undertaken. According to the regulation, both of these types of housing must be subsidised and constructed by local government. Affordable housing has limited private tenure and can be resold as commercial housing with private tenure after five years of occupancy, while subsidised rental housing is only for local, poor urban families and has public tenure in perpetuity.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012465906">2006</xref>, the State Council published the <italic>Policy advices on adjustment of housing supply structure and stability of housing prices</italic>. The regulations clearly required local governments to speed up the construction of subsidised rental housing. Subsequently, the State Council launched the <italic>Policy advices on the settlement of urban low-income families</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012465906">2007</xref>. The government’s focus had returned again to the housing problems of low-income groups.</p>
<p>It has always been a challenging task to deal with the housing problem in China, the most populous nation on Earth. A great deal of research has been done to shed light on Chinese housing reform practices, including studies of Chinese urban housing policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012465906">Logan and Bian, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012465906">Zhou and Logan, 1996</xref>); residential mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012465906">Li and Sui, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012465906">Li, 2003</xref>); housing supply and the housing provision system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012465906">Wu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012465906">Zax, 1997</xref>); and housing affordability as well as the consumer preferences of urban residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012465906">Wang and Li, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012465906">Lau and Li, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In regard to the spatial implications of housing reform, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012465906">Wang and Murie (2000)</xref> indicated that the land use zones in large Chinese cities are the legacy of the old self-sufficient economy and the socialist planned economy, as well as the product of the new market economy. They also concluded that reform will change the structure of communities and cities from work-based to residence-based. Most of the existing literature has focused on the provision of housing for the growing population. Relatively less has focused on the following topics which need more attention: changes in lifestyles after resettlement has taken place; the impacts of the dual housing supply system on job–housing relocation; and, the possibility of social exclusion and poverty among disadvantaged groups who remain in a particular locality (such as a low-income housing neighbourhood) due to lower mobility (both in employment and housing).</p>

<title>3. Spatial Mismatch of Residents in Low-income Housing Neighbourhoods in Guangzhou</title>
<p>Guangzhou is a coastal city in southern China with a long history of more than 2200 years. It is the capital city of Guangdong Province whose gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest of all provinces in China. As one of the earliest cities opened to the world and with a population of more than 10 million, Guangzhou’s economy has been growing rapidly in recent decades. The total GDP of Guangzhou was RMB711 billion (US$92.7 billion) in 2007, which accounted for 20 per cent of the provincial total and 2.85 per cent of the national economy’s GDP. Moreover, Guangzhou’s GDP has been growing at an annual rate of more than 14 per cent from 1979 to 2007. The city has been ranked within the top three strong comprehensive local economies in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012465906">National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012465906">Guangzhou Statistical Bureau, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, Guangzhou has improved its urban infrastructure services level continuously. In 1990, Guangzhou’s per capita road space was only 3.7 square metres, but in 2007 it rose to 14.13 square metres. At the same time, four subway lines extending 108.21 km and 497 bus lines covering 8492.70 km were operational in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012465906">Guangzhou Statistical Bureau, 2008</xref>). However, these improvements were not enough to tackle the traffic congestion problems of Guangzhou, which were extremely serious during peak hours. This shows that, in addition to the supply of facilities, traffic congestion problems have a close relationship with urban spatial structure and travel demand. The household surveys held in 1984, 1998 and 2005 by local government show that the travel distance for local people in Guangzhou has increased continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012465906">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012465906">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Changes in urban space and social diversity go some way to providing answers for this situation.</p>
<sec id="section4-0042098012465906">
<title>3.1 Low-income Housing Neighbourhoods in Guangzhou</title>
<p>There are about 20 neighbourhoods for low-income groups in Guangzhou constructed by local governments since 1986, most of which are located in the suburbs. The neighbourhoods are quite similar because of their unified planning, construction and allocation. They are assigned to low-income groups and follow uniform regulations. Housing in the neighbourhoods was divided into three types when constructed: subsidised rental, affordable and a small number of <italic>danwei</italic> houses (housing provided by the stated-owned work units for their employees during the socialist planned economic period; after housing reform in 1998, some employees were able to purchase their <italic>danwei</italic> houses which were similar to housing reform and commercial houses with private tenure.)</p>
<p>By leasing and reselling, very old low-income housing in the neighbourhoods changed from the first three types (subsidised rental, affordable and <italic>danwei</italic>) into six types: subsidised rental, affordable, commercial, private lease, public lease and housing reform housing (note the disappearance of <italic>danwe</italic>i housing). Compliant with the regulations, some of the affordable housing has been resold as commercial housing or leased privately. Some of the <italic>danwei</italic> housing has changed into commercial housing, whilst some has kept its public tenure status and been rented to employees of the stated-owned work units as public lease housing. At the same time, some of the commercial housing was converted to private lease housing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012465906">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To obtain insights into the nature and consequences of low-income housing programmes, we conducted detailed investigations and in-depth surveys in two low-income neighbourhoods in Guangzhou. Tongde neighbourhood is located in the north-west of Guangzhou and Tangxia is located in the north-east of the city. Both are located about 10 km from the old city centre (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098012465906">Figure 2</xref>) and are two of the largest low-income neighbourhoods constructed by local government in the 1990s. Based on the dual housing provision system mentioned earlier and <bold>s</bold>imilar to other government-led low-income neighbourhoods, the old housing in Tangxia and Tongde is subsidised and includes affordable housing that has limited private tenure (can be sold or sub-let after five years); subsidised rental housing with public tenure and a small number of <italic>danwei</italic> houses. Low-income households who met the requirements (low income, small housing area) could apply to buy the affordable housing or rent the subsidised rental housing for much less than commercial housing at that time. Generally speaking, poorer people apply for subsidised rental housing rather than buy affordable housing. Although the services in low-income areas (such as public transport and schools) are becoming better, they are still inconvenient compared with those provided in other commercial housing neighbourhoods. The same applies to most of the other government-led low-income housing neighbourhoods. By leasing and reselling (mostly old affordable housing), households in Tangxia and Tongde have now added some commercial and leased housing households to create a housing mix. However, most of the poor households in subsidised rental housing have remained because of a low incidence of jobs–housing relocation and the public tenure status of the housing.</p>

<title>3.2 Variable Statistics and Structural Characteristics of the Residents Surveyed</title>
<p>The basic data used in this research came from a household survey conducted during May to August in 2007. After considering factors such as location, scale and sources of housing types, 11 different types of neighbourhoods were selected to complete the household questionnaire survey. Subsequently, 800 households and 1006 residents chosen randomly were surveyed (one or two questionnaires were completed randomly in each household). In this case study, to a certain degree, the survey may reflect the residence and employment status of Guangzhou residents (note that data in regard to ‘residents in Guangzhou’ or ‘the whole city’ in this paper come from this survey). The survey includes the characteristics of individuals and families, residence and employment choices and changes from 1996 to 2007. These represent the impact of housing reform and the travel log of the latest working day and so on. Among the 11 neighbourhoods, the old housing types are different. Tangxia and Tongde are the neighbourhoods whose old housing is subsidised for low-income households. There are about 20 000 units of housing in all. Our sampling rate was set at about 1 per cent, for which we sent out a total of 280 questionnaires in the two neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Similar to the other low-income housing neighbourhoods in Guangzhou, the survey shows that there are six types of housing in the Tangxia and Tongde neighbourhoods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012465906">Table 1</xref>). Respondents were divided into different groups according to the different housing tenures. The population structure had undergone significant changes. The percentage of respondents in subsidised rental housing was 34.5 per cent; in commercial housing 24.9 per cent; and in private lease housing 29.3 per cent. These three types of housing thus account for almost all of the housing supply and are, therefore, most representative of the new housing supply after housing reform in China. Subsidised rental housing represents the government’s new type of housing supply for low-income groups. At the same time, commercial and private lease housing controlled by the market represents the new type of housing supply for other income groups. The following analysis of structural characteristics and jobs–housing relationships will focus on these three types of household.</p>

Subsidised rental housing residents’ education level, occupation, income and transport affordability are lower than the city’s average level. Their average age was about 39 and their education level was concentrated in the high school level. Most of them engaged in low-paid technical or more general jobs, had lower family incomes and weaker transport, housing and communications affordability.</p>

<title>3.3 Spatial Mismatch of Residents in Low-income Housing Neighbourhoods</title>
<sec id="section7-0042098012465906">
<title>Job–housing distance</title>
<p>With the aid of computer programmes, we used straight lines to join the residence and workplace by year and then calculated the length of the line to obtain the straight commuting distance. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098012465906">Figure 3</xref> shows, between 1996 and 2007, Guangzhou residents slightly increased the distance from their residence to workplace. During these 10 years, the distance between home and workplace was maintained at between 3.5 km and 5 km, which was basically within a psychologically acceptable range for most people. Overall, Tangxia and Tongde neighbourhood residents also experienced a general process of increasing distance between their homes and workplaces, although the level of increase was more significant.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0042098012465906-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The average commuting distance for subsidised rental housing residents increased from 4 km in 1996 to 9 km in 2000. The increased rate was as high as 225 per cent. Since then, the distance has reduced gradually, despite some fluctuations. This is because most of the subsidised rental housing households moved in before 2000. It also shows that the resettlement had caused a significant increase in commuting distance. Only a few people reduced their commuting distance by moving to other places. As for the commercial housing households, their average commuting distance rose from 2 km to 9 km between 1996 and 2007. This growth rate far exceeded the average city level. This means that purchasing low-income housing has brought about a substantial increase in commuting distance for the majority of these households. In contrast, private lease housing tenants’ average commuting distance is the shortest, increasing from 1 km to 3.5 km, which was still close to the city’s average.</p>
<p>When comparing the jobs–housing distance of the households before and after moving into Tangxia and Tongde neighbourhoods, it is clear that the jobs–housing distance for subsidised rental and commercial housing residents became much longer after moving into these neighbourhoods. For private lease housing households, it is almost the same or even shorter (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012465906">Table 3</xref>). Private lease housing residents in Tongde only comprise 8.86 per cent of all residents, compared with 40 per cent in Tangxia. This suggests that houses in Tangxia, which were originally located in the suburb but are now nearer to the new city centre, were more welcomed by the tenants.</p>

<p>The residence and workplace of surveyed subsidised rental housing residents, commercial housing residents and private lease housing residents were connected separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098012465906">Figure 3</xref>) and the spatial relationships between residences and workplaces of these three types of residents were analysed. We found that most of the subsidised rental housing residents were living and working in the old city centre before moving into low-income housing neighbourhoods. They enjoyed a short job–housing distance at that time. However, after moving into these neighbourhoods, they had to suffer a long job–housing commute because most of their workplaces were still located in the central district. Similarly, the average job–housing distance of commercial housing residents was long. When moving to suburban areas, they also had to come back to the inner city to work every day. In terms of the private lease housing tenants, most of them were working near the new CBD close to Tangxia before their housing relocation, so their commuting distance had not changed much. There were also a few private lease housing residents working near the Tongde neighbourhood in similar circumstances to those in Tangxia.</p>
<p>This analysis shows that the subsidised rental and commercial housing residents in low-income neighbourhoods had a long-distance daily commute, while private lease housing tenants enjoyed a shorter one. Meanwhile, with an increase in the attractiveness of the location of Tangxia and Tongde, some of the previously affordable housing was sold and leased. The market enabled some of them to reselect their residences closer to the workplace by leasing or selling their housing. This approach partially solved the spatial mismatch problem. However, it is illegal to sub-let subsidised rental housing, which means that the most disadvantaged groups were experiencing relocation barriers and were unable to resolve their spatial mismatch problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0042098012465906">
<title>Commuting cost</title>
<p>Commuting costs (inc-luding time and money) are closely related to people’s daily life and work and are also an important indicator of spatial mismatch. The research found that commuting costs varied between housing type groups.</p>
<p>First, they had different commuting times. The average commuting time of Guangzhou residents was 34.95 minutes, similar to the commuting time of private lease housing residents. However, subsidised rental housing residents and commercial housing residents had much higher commuting times, of 58.30 minutes and 52.09 minutes respectively, nearly twice the average of all samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012465906">Table 4</xref>). Compared with commuting times of US residents at the same time, they were still very high. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012465906">McKenzie and Rapino (2011)</xref>, the average commuting time of US residents in 2009 was 25.1 minutes; the New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island metro area commuting time was the longest at 34.6 minutes, followed by Washington–Arlington–Alexandria at 33.4 minutes. From these statistics, it is obvious that the commuting times of subsidised rental housing residents and commercial housing residents in Tangxia and Tongde were relatively long.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Secondly, residents from different housing types had different commuting expenses. The subsidised rental housing residents had fewer commuting expenses than the commercial and private lease housing residents, who had similar costs. This is because the subsidised rental housing residents were much more reliant on cheaper commuting modes such as buses. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012465906">Table 4</xref>, public transport fares accounted for more than 80 per cent of the commuting expenses of subsidised rental housing residents, compared with 74.19 per cent for private lease housing residents and 60.54 per cent for commercial housing residents. In comparison, commercial housing residents spent 27.32 per cent of their commuting fares on private cars or motorcycles and private lease housing residents spent 20.08 per cent on taxis. Both of these groups could afford more convenient and comfortable transport options due to their higher incomes.</p>
<p>Lastly, commuting costs directly impact on the daily life of residents. Based on the ArcGIS platform, we designed a programme to analyse the travel logs of surveyed residents. It is clear that the activity space of residents both in subsidised rental housing and commercial housing was much larger than that of the whole city’s samples, plus the time away from home for daily activities was much longer, especially for residents in subsidised rental housing. For example, some subsidised rental housing residents were away from home from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm.</p>
<p>The jobs–housing mismatch not only became apparent in long-distance commuting, but also in long-distance shopping and doing business. The average distance for shopping and doing business for residents in subsidised rental and commercial housing was much longer than that for tenants in private lease housing. Disadvantaged by being unable to afford efficient travel modes such as private car and taxi, residents in subsidised rental housing needed to spend much more time away from their residence for working and other activities such as doing business, etc. The situation in this regard of residents in commercial housing was better whereas that of tenants in private lease housing was the best.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0042098012465906">
<title>Job accessibility</title>
<p>Our survey found that the three kinds of housing type residents had different employment rates. According to neighbourhood management staff responsible for employment, subsidised rental housing residents had the lowest employment rate of under 50 per cent, with a high proportion of laid-off workers and residents without regular employment. In contrast, the employment rate of private lease housing residents was relatively high, around 70 per cent. Many of these residents chose to live in the neighbourhoods because they had a job nearby. Of the three kinds of residents, commercial housing residents had the highest employment rate of over 90 per cent, with most having stable jobs and incomes. They, too, chose to purchase housing in the neighbourhoods of Tongde and Tangxia. These varying employment rates are mainly due to different job accessibility amongst the groups. By comparing the average age, educational level and occupational category of these three types of households, differences in the job markets for each become apparent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012465906">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>On the one hand, their employment situation differed. Those who lived in the neighbourhoods because of government programmes, such as subsidised rental housing residents, had much more difficulty in finding suitable jobs in the vicinity, resulting in a lower employment rate. However, most of the commercial housing residents had stable jobs before moving into these neighbourhoods. Their motives for moving included living in a better built environment and lower house prices. So the employment environment around low-income housing neighbourhoods had little impact on them. As for the private lease housing residents, most of them were temporary dwellers. If unable to find a job in the vicinity, they would have to move out, so most of them had jobs near these neighbourhoods when they acquired their places of residence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, job opportunities and personal abilities were a mismatch to a certain extent. Most of the subsidised rental housing residents were older than 40 and had lower educational levels compared with the other two kinds of residents, so they found it harder to secure employment. Even though new job opportunities were created around some low-income housing neighbourhoods (such as the Tangxia neighbourhood) because of urban expansion, it was still difficult for subsidised rental residents to find suitable jobs in the vicinity. In contrast, the other two types of residents were more likely to find new jobs.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>An analysis of our survey data reveals that the proportion of passive resettlement of subsidised rental housing residents was 45.40 per cent, including demolition resettlement, forced relocation and government welfare housing distribution. In this case, the residents have no other choice. However, there were still 38.4 per cent who chose to live here just for the lower housing price. As for employment choices, this group first considers those jobs they are capable of doing and their personal preference. Because of their lower incomes, they can only rely on the government’s low-income housing. As a result, they settle wherever the housing is located. Because of a lack of vocational skills and their older age, they have found it difficult to get a job near their new houses and this means that they have to endure long-distance commuting. This kind of spatial mismatch is termed ‘passive resettlement’.</p>
<p>The majority of commercial housing residents chose the houses they are living in now for active reasons (87.70 per cent). This was mainly to take advantage of cheaper house prices and more convenient commuting. This is referred to as a kind of ‘active resettlement’. As for their employment, 65.4 per cent of commercial housing residents chose their current jobs mostly for active reasons, pursuing self-interest, generous treatment or a promising career. Only 13.8 per cent chose their current job because of a lack of personal ability. Therefore, it can be concluded that commercial housing residents have more housing and employment choices and that they choose to pay for long-distance commuting as the ‘cost’ for better living conditions and lower house prices.</p>
<p>As for the private lease housing tenants, most of them work near the neighbourhood. Rents are lower, it is more convenient for work and they can access a better environment (these factors accounted for 97.10 per cent of relocation choices). In regard to their employment, 80.5 per cent of them chose their current jobs mostly for active reasons, pursuing self-interest, generous treatment or a promising career, whereas only 13.9 per cent felt they lacked personal ability. In the case of adequate available housing, their residential and employment spaces matched well.</p>

<title>3.5 The Mechanism of Jobs–housing Mismatch</title>
<p>Generally speaking, the jobs–housing mismatch is a phenomenon associated with a market economy. However, with the legacy of a socialist planning economic system and the new market-orientated economic system, the mechanism of the mismatch is more complicated in China.</p>
<p>The analysis has shown that both subsidised rental housing residents who get their houses from the government and commercial housing residents who get their houses from the market in low-income neighbourhoods are meeting with a jobs–housing mismatch, the causes and mechanism of which are different between the two groups. The research indicates that a jobs–housing mismatch phenomenon exists in the former two housing groups with the cause attributed to both passive and active factors. The following analysis will elucidate the causes and effects of these two types of resettlement.</p>
<sec id="section12-0042098012465906">
<title>The mechanism of passive jobs–housing mismatch for low-income house-holds</title>
<p>For the passive style of spatial mismatch for low-income households living in subsidised rental housing, the economic factor is one of the most important causes. Along with the continuous development of the market economy, the price of land and houses was rising rapidly. Differential rents for land depending on its location started to play a role and encouraged local governments to treat selling land as an important source of local finance. In order to get better economic returns, the local government often auctioned land near to the jobs centre and on the periphery (with a good environment) for commercial housing while building low-income housing neighbourhoods along the edge of the centre or in the suburbs to reduce costs. In order to improve their living conditions, and because of the gentrification of the city centre, the low-income groups who applied for subsidised rental housing had no choice but to accept the resettlement. However, the suburbs have failed to provide appropriate jobs for the low-income group, resulting in long-distance commuting between residences and workplaces.</p>
<p>With rapid urbanisation, some places in the suburbs have gradually become high-tech industrial districts or new business centres, with new job opportunities focused on knowledge-intensive industries. These jobs are not suitable for the poorly educated low-income group with less mobility. This has become one of the root causes of the passive jobs–housing mismatch.</p>
<p>Moreover, most local governments have treated the provision of low-income housing as a political task and have blindly pursued this agenda from a quantity perspective, whilst neglecting the quality of housing. The total number of dwellings and proportion of the supply of low-income housing to overall housing provision are thus emphasised without giving enough consideration to the location and service facilities of the housing. As a result, local government may choose to build housing in the suburbs to reduce the trouble of demolition resettlement and to finish the ‘task’ with less financial investment.</p>
<p>Social factors, such as low income and low job-specific skills, also impact on the jobs–housing mismatch of low-income groups. While studying the occupational characteristics and employment spatial distribution of this group, we found that most of the households in this group were working in the old city centre as unskilled workers, labourers and attendants. On the one hand, there are more job opportunities in the city centre, but the workers cannot buy a flat there due to the high prices. On the other hand, most of the areas around low-income neighbourhoods are newly developed areas. This means that low-skilled jobs are not available locally, whereas the high-skilled jobs available nearby are not suitable for the low-income group. Consequently, the low-income group is at a disadvantage both in employment and housing. Furthermore, long-distance commutes also increase the burden of their lives. Thus, subsidised rental housing residents have been identified as undergoing a passive resettlement style of jobs–housing mismatch as mentioned earlier.</p>

<sec id="section13-0042098012465906">
<title>The mechanism of active jobs–housing mismatch for commercial housing households</title>
<p>As for the active style of spatial mismatch, economic factors also play an important role in its cause. Most of the affordable housing is sold for lower prices due to government subsidies. The market-oriented transition of housing and land, a strong demand for commercial housing and a large profit from selling affordable housing are the main reasons for the active resettlement spatial mismatch. Since the reform and opening up, China has entered a new era of social and economic transition. The Chinese government abolished the welfare housing allocation policy in 1998 which caused a strong demand for commercial housing. Housing prices have now become the chief factor for buyers. With expanding urban areas and improving traffic conditions, some of the very old affordable housing has been sold. Sellers can earn a large profit by selling such residences and can then afford a new apartment located closer to their workplaces. For the buyer, this kind of housing still has a price advantage compared with the newly developed commercial housing, so they can share in the benefits of welfare policies and urban development. The average income of commercial housing residents is much higher than that of subsidised rental housing residents and this means they are able to afford higher transport costs. Considering housing prices and traffic costs, they may choose a lower housing price, and in this way form an active resettlement spatial mismatch.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>Over the past several decades, the problem of spatial mismatch has attracted great scholarly attention. While much has been written on the cases in the West, relatively less has been done to shed light on the SMH in the context of a socialist economy undergoing market transition as in China. This paper has examined the pattern and processes of spatial mismatch in the Guangzhou metropolis, one of the most rapidly growing urban economies in China where the effects of marketisation and globalisation are most striking. An analysis of the results of our survey conducted in two significant neighbourhoods of low-income housing has confirmed the hypothesis of spatial mismatch with additional findings.</p>
<p>Our research has found that residents living in both subsidised rental housing, representing the new housing supply for poor urban residents supplied by the government, and in commercial housing, supplied by the market for other income groups, have experienced the spatial mismatch problem to a different extent and via different mechanisms. The nature of the spatial mismatch for subsidised rental housing residents has been defined as a passive job–housing mismatch, whereas that for commercial housing residents is an active spatial mismatch.</p>
<p>A passive job–housing mismatch is the result of urban renewal that has led to higher housing prices in the city centre. As the low-income group can no longer afford to purchase there, they have been forced to move to the city outskirts. Furthermore, the mismatch between the new jobs created in the suburban areas and the poor work skills of the low-income group has further exacerbated the problem. They thus have to endure long commutes and a high cost of living. This kind of spatial mismatch appears to be similar to that found in the US where the urban problems of residential segregation, distance from employment opportunities and long-distance commuting for disadvantaged groups are pronounced. The only difference is that the problem of racial segregation in American cities does not seem to be visible in their Chinese counterparts.</p>
<p>By contrast, active jobs–housing mismatch is the result of inner-city expansion and improvements in traffic conditions, leading to escalating prices for low-income housing closer to commercial housing in the inner city. As a consequence, some old affordable housing residents with better incomes are able to compensate for the price gap between low-income housing and commercial housing and choose to resettle in areas near their workplace, giving rise to a large amount of sub-letting and resale. The buyers generally have a stronger capacity to pay for the cost of commuting compared with the residents of subsidised rental housing, although they often cannot afford the high-price housing in the inner city. They can choose private cars or taxis and other more convenient transport options to reduce their commuting time and have opted for housing far away from their workplaces.</p>
<p>The spatial mismatch problem has resulted in the increased cost of living, rising unemployment, persistent poverty and other social problems for the low-income group. From the perspective of urban development, it may cause traffic congestion, increased commuting costs, low-skilled labour force unemployment, a widening income gap and a series of other urban problems.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, the interaction of the legacy of the socialist planning system and the new market-orientated system has played an important role in determining the spatial structure in urban China. Based on the dual housing supply system, both the government and the market play their important roles in job–housing relocation, while the market plays a much more active role and is better able to satisfy different needs.</p>
