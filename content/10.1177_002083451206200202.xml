<p>62.1632 ABOY CARLÉS, Gerardo — <bold>Populismo, regeneracionismo y democracia (Populism, regeneration and democracy).</bold> <italic>POSTData</italic> 15(1), Apr. 2010: 11–32.</p>
<p>This work develops a critical dialogue with Ernesto Laclau's theory of hegemony and his conceptualization of populism. Firstly, it argues that the impunity that characterizes the logics of hegemony leads us to conceive political identities as hybrid solidarities, with overlapping borders. This is a different image from Laclau's exclusive identities. Classic Latin American populisms have constituted a particular mechanism, among others, of solving tensions between the representation of one part and that of the whole community. Laclau's identification of politics and populism becomes problematic. Consequently, populism cannot be reduced to an antagonistic dichotomization of the community. The regeneration of the actors involved in populist practice will thus occupy a central place in the characterization of this political phenomenon. [R]</p>

<p>Legal paternalism is commonly defined as interference with someone's choices and actions, against his will, whose aim is to prevent harm to self. This type of paternalism is frequently believed to be incompatible with liberalism. However, is it possible to exclude paternalism from criminal law? Joel Feinberg's theory of “soft paternalism” preserves autonomy and justifies interference to prevent individuals from committing harmful self-regarding actions that are non-voluntary. We analyze this version of paternalism, its principles and its consequences in criminal law. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1659]</p>
<p>62.1634 BUSSOLINI, Jeffrey — <bold>Ongoing founding events in Carl Schmitt and Giorgio Agamben.</bold> <italic>Telos</italic> 157, Winter 2011: 60–83.</p>
<p>This essay considers those aspects that, for lack of a better term, I call ongoing founding events in the work of Schmitt and its interpretation by Agamben. This term is meant to refer to decisive “events” in Schmitt that, although they may be exceptional (or perhaps because they are), play a continual role in generating and maintaining the political order. It is important that these events are not merely mythic or imaginary devices to describe politics, as are the social contract and the veil of ignorance. These events are crucial also, in Schmitt's terms, in understanding “concrete reality”. [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1661]</p>
<p>62.1635 CHIU, Yvonne; TAYLOR, Robert S. — <bold>The self-extinguishing despot: Millian democratization.</bold> <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 73(4), Oct. 2011: 1239–1250.</p>
<p>J.S. Mill sometimes endorses nondemocratic forms of governance. This article explains the reasons behind this seeming aberration and shows that Mill actually has complex and nuanced views of the transition from nondemocratic to democratic government, including the comprehensive and parallel material, cultural, institutional, and character reforms that must occur, and the mechanism by which they will be enacted. Namely, an enlightened despot must cultivate democratic virtues such as obedience, industriousness, spirit of nationality, and resistance to tyranny in the population and simultaneously prepare the way for his own demise and secure his own legitimacy by transitioning to the rule of law. This challenges recent scholarship that paints Mill's nondemocratic views as crudely and uncritically imperialist, because it fails to recognize and engage seriously with his sophisticated theory of individual and institutional development under enlightened colonialism.

<p>62.1636 CISNEROS ARAUJO, María Eugenia — <bold>La naturaleza humana en Hobbes: antropología, epistemología e individuo (Human nature in Hobbes: anthropology, epistemology and the individual).</bold> <italic>Andamios</italic> 16, May-Aug. 2011: 211–240.</p>
<p>This essay aims to show the concept that Hobbes developed of man as an individual; the concept is structured as a dynamic link, moving constantly between the subject and the object, where the subject calls on his/her powers and abilities to generate objectivity. It seeks to expose that Hobbes's interest is in the individual social experience, because his anthropology and epistemology lead to the social praxis of the individual whose product is the creation of the state. Hobbes lays the groundwork for a political practice that consists in setting in motion a political model embodied in the very action of the natural power of man as an individual. [R]</p>
<p>62.1637 COUDERC, Yann — <bold>Une approche holistique de Sun Tzu est-elle possible? (Is a holistic approach to Sun Tzu possible?).</bold> <italic>Revue Défense nationale</italic> 745, Dec. 2011: 121–128. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The author explores what is revealed by a holistic approach which includes all of Sun Tzu's much quoted <italic>The Art of War</italic>. He takes advantage of Chinese culture and its special symbolism to discern, under the famous aphorisms, the more general lessons set out by Sun Tzu. This new approach offers useful revelations, even if it cannot be considered the definitive key. [R]</p>
<p>62.1638 CUEVA FERNÁNDEZ, Ricardo — <bold>Republicanismo y autogobierno (Republicanism and self-government).</bold> <italic>Revista de Estudios políticos</italic> 154, Oct.-Dec. 2011: 41–70.</p>
<p>Republicanism is an ancient self-government model. It arose in the Greek <italic>polis</italic>, surviving through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. From then on it was supportive of the birth of liberalism, as seen in Locke's <italic>Second Treatise of Civil Government</italic> [1689]. However, with the appearance of colonial assemblies in NorthAmerica, democracy became a new model for self-government which was better adapted to liberal ideas. Neo-republicanism, the political trend arising in the 1980s, tries to develop an alternative to classical republicanism. It allows for design of public policies, but cannot function as its predecessor as a model for self-government, since in present times it is not possible to maintain values or status systems from ancient societies.

<p>62.1639 DILTS, Andrew — <bold>To kill a thief: punishment, proportionality, and criminal subjectivity in Locke's</bold> <bold><italic>Second Treatise</italic>.</bold> <italic>Political Theory</italic> 40(1), Feb. 2012: 58–83.</p>
<p>This essay argues that the thief, a liminal figure that haunts the boundary of political membership and the border between the law of reason and the law of beasts, drives J. Locke's accounts of the foundation of the commonwealth and the right to rebellion in the <italic>Second Treatise of Government</italic>. Locke's political theory is best read through punishment as a theory of subject formation, which relies on an unstable concept of proportionality to produce this liminal figure in order to secure the member as a “stable” political subject.

<p>62.1640 DUFF, Alexander S. — <bold>Republicanism and the problem of ambition: the critique of Cicero in Machiavelli's</bold> <bold><italic>Discourses</italic>.</bold> <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 73(4), Oct. 2011: 980–992.</p>
<p>Ambition enjoys an ambiguous status in political practice. It is at once necessary and dangerous. Although Machiavelli's engagement with Cicero in the <italic>Prince</italic> has been well-noted, his critique in the <italic>Discourses</italic> of his pre-eminent rival authority on republicanism has received very little attention. This critique concerns Cicero's failure to respond to the threat posed to republican institutions by the ambition of leading citizens. By following out the details of this critique, this article speaks both to recent debates about Machiavelli's republicanism and to the obscurity about the problem of ambition in contemporary politics. [R]</p>
<p>62.1641 EIDUJIENE, Dalia — <bold>Polibijus: apie valstybes kilme ir dinami ka jos formu morfologija (Polybius on the origin of the state and the dynamic morphology of its forms).</bold> <italic>Filosofija. Sociologija</italic> 22(3), 2011: 272–277.</p>
<p>Polybius's political ideas were influenced by the political doctrines of Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics. However, Polybius sought his own interpretation of his times, which were creating qualitatively new political realities that made it possible for Rome to conquer so many lands and bring them under its absolute power in such a short period of time, i.e., in less than fifty-three years. He constantly repeats that not only did the tangle of events in his day become more apparent, but that it also began to exert a global influence on the historical process. This factor dictated a new perception and interpretation of events. This is why Polybius attempted to encompass the development of the whole ancient world of his time and to relate it to contemporary political processes in the Mediterranean region. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1642 FINE, Jonathan — <bold>Laughing to learn: irony in the</bold> <bold><italic>Republic</italic></bold> <bold>[of Plato] as pedagogy.</bold> <italic>Polis</italic> (<italic>Nicosia</italic>) 28(2), 2011: 235–249.</p>
<p>Although recent commentators have attended to dramatic and ironic aspects of Plato's <italic>Republic</italic>, a more sustained examination of the relation between irony and the exchanges of Socrates and Glaucon is required because a crucial purpose and presentation of the irony have largely gone unnoticed. This paper argues that Socrates employs irony in part to parody Glaucon's extremism and that he does so to exhort Glaucon to think critically. First, it examines how Socrates uses the term <italic>makaria</italic> (blessedness) primarily ironically and pedagogically. Then, a possible reason for this use of <italic>makaria</italic> is advanced: aspects of Kallipolis are a parody of Glaucon and that the parody aims to instruct Glaucon intellectually. Such a reading deserves further articulation and examination. [R]</p>
<p>62.1643 FISSELL, Brenner M. — <bold>Plato's theory of democratic decline.</bold> <italic>Polis</italic> (<italic>Nicosia</italic>) 28(2), 2011: 216–234.</p>
<p>While democracy is derided for a variety of reasons in Plato's thought, his most damning critique of that regime type does not involve an observation about democracy <italic>qua</italic> democracy, but of the transition that is so easily engenders: the decline to tyranny. regimes are composed of individuals and groups, though, and Plato is anxious to ascribe culpability for the degradation. Two actors are the primary focus of his analysis — the political leaders and the <italic>demos</italic>. At times he emphasizes the puissance of the <italic>demos</italic>, but in other passages he suggests it is the leaders who are most authoritative. This paper discusses these apparently contradictory passages, and works towards a reconciliation. Neither is assigned sole culpability, as both work in complex synergy; the underlying cause of the decline is greed for material wealth. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1644 GROLLIOS, Vasilis — <bold>J.S. Mill's views on democracy after 1848.</bold> <italic>Critical Sociology</italic> 37(6), Nov. 2011: 871–887.</p>
<p>In his philosophical anthropology, Mill assimilated a moderate form of capitalist values. Viewed from the perspective of class, this made it impossible for him to fully applaud socialism and democracy. Many commentators confuse these two terms and, as a result, do not understand that Mill tried to promote working class interests and social power only to the extent that they would not assail the foundations of the capitalist mode of production. Contrary to these mainstream interpretations, I emphasize that Mill's views on democracy are strongly connected to the value-laden content that the capitalist mode of production contributes to exploitation, liberty and equality. As such, Mill was not a democrat but instead was afraid of a fully fledged democratic system because it would lead to socialism. [R]</p>
<p>62.1645 GÜNDOĜDU, Ayten — <bold>“Perplexities of the rights of man”: Arendt on the aporias of human rights.</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Theory 11</italic>(1), Jan. 2012: 4–23.</p>
<p>This article provides a new interpretation of Hannah Arendt's critical analysis of the “perplexities of the Rights of Man” by drawing attention to its overlooked methodological orientations, especially its “aporetic” nature. Arendt's critique is aporetic as it centers on the paradoxes of human rights and analyzes them by putting into practice a mode of inquiry that she associates with Socrates. The article challenges the conventional understanding of aporia as a paralyzing impasse and suggests that aporetic thinking can create possibilities of rethinking key concepts especially in times of crises. To make this point, I respond to Jacques Rancière's criticism that the paradoxes introduced by Arendt paralyze thinking and doom human rights to an inevitable destiny of failure. I argue that, precisely because of its aporetic nature, Arendt's critique attends to possibilities of rethinking and reinventing human rights, as can be seen in her articulation of “a right to have rights”.

<p>62.1646 GÜNDOĜDU, Ayten — <bold>Potentialities of human rights: Agamben and the narrative of fated necessity.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(1), Feb. 2012: 2–22.</p>
<p>G. Agamben presents us with one of the most powerful and controversial criticisms of human rights. He contests conventional understandings of human rights as normative setbacks on sovereign power, and shows instead how these rights reinforce sovereignty by producing bare lives that are irredeemably exposed to violence. This essay [examines] the distinctive aspects of Agamben's critique and assesses his concluding call for a politics beyond human rights. It suggests that this call is necessitated by a counternarrative of Western politics that ties human rights inextricably to the logic Agamben ascribes to biopolitical sovereignty. Within this stringent logic, any politics organized around human rights cannot help but reproduce sovereign violence. The essay questions this counternarrative. [R abr.]</p>
<p>62.1647 HAN, Sang-Jin — <bold>From the Asian value debate to cosmopolitanism: an active interpretation of the political thoughts of Kim Dae-jung.</bold> <italic>Korea Journal</italic> 51(3), Autumn 2011: 196–222.</p>
<p>This paper explores the significance and consequences of a rare combination of a cosmopolitan vision with an Asian identity found in the political thoughts of Kim Dae-jung, the late President of the Republic of Korea (1998–2003). The cosmopolitan reading of the Asian value debate neither rejects nor defends Asian values as they exist but embraces these within the framework of respecting diversities and differences. The paper draws attention to the substantive field of reconciliation policy between North and South Korea, notes how Kim attempted to overcome the West-centered globalism while keeping alive Asian identity in his progressive journey from the Asian value debate through universal globalism to cosmopolitanism.

<p>62.1648 ILIVITZKY, Matías Esteban — <bold>La desobediencia civil: aportes desde Bobbio, Habermas y Arendt (Civil disobedience: the contributions of Bobbio, Habermas and Arendt).</bold> <italic>CONfines de Relaciones internacionales y Ciencia política</italic> 13, May 2011: 15–18.</p>
<p>This article explores the complex topic of civil disobedience from three different theoretical perspectives, namely those of N. Bobbio, J. Habermas and H. Arendt. The correlation between this subject and other kinds of resistance to state's authorities or to its constitutional and normative order will be analyzed. The similarities and discrepancies between the three authors selected will be compared, in order to assemble in the conclusion a synthetic view of their most relevant perspectives over the question.

<p>62.1649 KISTNER, Ulrike — <bold>The exception and the rule: fictive, real, critical.</bold> <italic>Telos</italic> 157, Winter 2011: 43–59.</p>
<p>Political order involves the rule of law: the author turns our attention to the problem of the exception to that rule, and its alternative understandings by C. Schmitt and G. Agamben, against the backdrop of W. Benjamin. While Agamben poses as a reader of both, the author underscores key differences in the understanding of dictatorship, especially with regard to the political crisis of the moment: on Agamben's analysis, petty sovereigns are proliferating everywhere in the world today, whereas for Schmitt, sovereignty is receding in society, while the need to call it to thought — and with it, to the reconstitution of the political — is becoming ever more urgent.

<p>62.1650 KNOLL, Manuel — <bold>Die “Politik” des Aristoteles — Aufsatzsammlung oder einheitliches Werk? Replik auf Eckart Schütrumpfs Erwiderung (Aristotle's</bold> <bold><italic>Politics</italic></bold> <bold>— a collection of essays or a unified work? Reply to Eckart Schütrumpf's response).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für Politik</italic> 58(4), 2011: 410–423.</p>
<p>The essay is mainly a refutation of E. Schütrumpf's objections [<italic>ibid</italic>. 58(3), Sept. 2011: 243–267; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.365] to my argument [<italic>ibid</italic>. 58(2), June 2011: 123–147; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 61.6054] that Aristotle's politics is a unified work. First, it corrects Schütrumpf's inadequate reconstruction of the method of my argument and outlines the criteria of a unified philosophical work. It then explains the central role that the concept of distributive justice plays in Aristotle's political theory. Furthermore, it shows that Aristotle's distinction of five kinds of kingdoms corresponds to his division of sorts of democracy and oligarchy. Finally, it suggests a way to distinguish between a strong and a weak unitary thesis. [R]</p>
<p>62.1651 LAUER, Christopher — <bold>Multivalent recognition: the place of Hegel in the Fraser-Honneth debate.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(1), Feb. 2012: 23–40.</p>
<p>In their 2003 exchange <italic>Redistribution or Recognition?</italic> [London, 2003] N. Fraser and A. Honneth present competing visions of the place of recognition in social justice. Whereas Fraser argues that justice entails a universal right to pursue recognition on a level playing field without appealing to any particular conception of the good, Honneth contends that questions of just recognition can be settled only by appealing to the needs and histories of the particular groups struggling for recognition. This essay argues that each position can be understood as a moment in Hegel's <italic>Phenomenology of Spirit</italic> and that Hegel shows why each fails to conceive the full role of recognition in human life. Nevertheless, Fraser and Honneth both make important insights that Hegelian thought ought to preserve. [R, abr.]</p>

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 1 sets the basic framework for interpreting the US Constitution. It contains an implied definition of “good government” that occupied the founders as they built a stronger national government. This essay explains the conflict embedded in the debate between the two theories of good government offered by Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson and asks how the competing definitions might be reconciled with recent experience.

<p>62.1654 LUND, William R. — <bold>Reconsidering “supreme emergencies”: Michael Walzer and his critics.</bold> <italic>Social Theory and Practice</italic> 37(4), Oct. 2011: 654–678.</p>
<p>M. Walzer [<italic>Just and Unjust Wars</italic>, New York, 1992] has argued that nations fighting a just war may be permitted indiscriminate attacks on enemy noncombatants if they are genuinely necessary to avoid an imminent and morally disastrous defeat. Critics often challenge this “supreme emergency” exemption from just war principles by arguing that it is inconsistent with his critiques of utilitarianism, realism, and sub-state terrorism. While morally troubling, I argue that Walzer's doctrine is both tightly cabined and consistent with his meta-ethical pluralism, his emphasis on the value of political community, and his doubts about abstract philosophy's ability to answer pressing political questions.

<p>62.1655 LYNN, Laurence E., Jr. — <bold><italic>Federalist</italic></bold> <bold>No. 51: is liberty guaranteed by structures?</bold> <italic>Public Administration Review</italic> 71, Suppl. 1, Dec. 2011: 83–89.</p>
<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 51 can be read as a statement of the national government's dual responsibility to serve the public interest and to preserve liberty. It is built on James Madison's belief in checks and balances as a method for keeping government's parts in their proper places. This essay asks whether this gridlock has gone too far in rendering the constitutional design obsolete. Drawing on previously unpublished fragments of <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 51, the author argues that Madison fully anticipated these problems, and he offers the unpublished text as a salutary appendix to this iconic defense of liberty.

<p>This article advocates two criteria to distinguish good and bad paternalism in a liberal perfectionist view. it identifies paternalism based on the value of autonomy and paternalism based on other values. Only the first is compatible with liberalism. Within the first group, I identify paternalism based on a specific definition of autonomy and another that does not assume a specific definition of autonomy. Whereas the first is morally justified, legally, only the second is compatible with liberalism. through a discussion of how care economics works and is justified — and other particular examples — this article shows how paternalistic policies may be desirable, acceptable or unacceptable according to their compliance with these criteria.

<p>This article has a double purpose. First of all, it analyzes Skinner's definition of liberty. It focuses on distinction between “neo-roman liberty” and “gothic liberty”. Three historical and ideological moments are particularly highlighted: Italian pre-humanism, Florentine humanism, and the “Glorious Revolution,” as well as the Skinner's latest books. Secondly, the article studies Skinner's methodology, and more particularly stresses his analytical philosophy inspiration. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1359]</p>
<p>62.1658 MAXWELL, Lida — <bold>Toward an agonistic understanding of law: law and politics in Hannah Arendt's</bold> <bold><italic>Eichmann in Jerusalem</italic></bold> <bold>[</bold><bold><italic>A report on the Banality of Evil</italic></bold>, <bold>New York, 1963].</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(1), Feb. 2012: 88–108.</p>
<p>Contemporary readers of <italic>Eichmann in Jerusalem</italic> often cast it as a juridical text, concerned with justice rather than politics. These juridical readings rightly focus attention on what Arendt calls the primary challenge of the case — judging Eichmann's unprecedented crimes against humanity in a rule-bound court — but they insufficiently attend to Arendt's resistance to a juridical response to this problem, especially as evidenced in her criticism of the Jerusalem Court's rule-following. Taking Arendt's resistance to the Court's approach as my guide, I argue that <italic>Eichmann in Jerusalem</italic> does not authorize a juridical approach to the unprecedented, but instead points toward the importance of an agonistic understanding of law — an understanding that foregrounds law's dependence on political contestation of legal strictures and constraints.

<p>Liberal perfectionism, even when paternalistic, is compatible with state neutrality. I defend this compatibility as follows. (1) I distinguish three types of neutrality. (2) I distinguish three types of paternalism. (3) I then examine under what conditions neutrality and paternalism can be compatible. (4) Finally, I argue that neutrality of consequences, which seems to be the most demanding version of neutrality, is also compatible with paternalism and will conclude by suggesting that the only way to make paternalism and neutrality incompatible is to require that neutrality encompasses at the same time neutral justifications, aims, and consequences.

<p>This article assesses the extent to which security regimes are the products of authorization in the thought of Th. Hobbes and C. Schmitt. The Hobbesian security regime offers a contingent construction of security in terms of processes of authorization and brings into view questions about the epistemic construction of security within security discourse today. The Schmittian concept of security involves the naturalization of security through the state, meaning that security is understood as condition rather than regime. Rather than look to Schmitt's concept of security as the paradigm of international security today, there are clear benefits in returning to the contractual account of security evident in the Hobbesian emphasis on authorization. Security is the means by which political communities realize their internal goods. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.1661 NORBERG, Jakob — <bold>Day-to-day politics: Carl Schmitt on the diary.</bold> <italic>Telos</italic> 157, Winter 2011: 21–42.</p>
<p>A number of Schmitt's diaries have already been published, and more are being prepared for future publication. Naturally, readers of Schmitt hope that these voluminous journals will shed light on his controversial work and biography. Yet for reasons that I make clear, Schmitt's diaries must be approached with some interpretive caution, for the diarist himself was deeply skeptical of and even averse to his chosen medium. Early on in his career, Schmitt produced a satire of diary writing as the matrix of a self-obsessed human existence, and this critical attitude also comes through.

<p>Hobbes can be considered Machiavellian, although not in the usual meaning of the term (to which Machiavelli himself did not adhere), that is the reduction of politics to the recourse to force and deceit. Hobbes's Machiavellianism is not to be found only where it would be expected (political realism, the need to use force and trickery) but also where it is not usually sought: in recognizing that the sovereign has to take his people into account and to act in their favor, if only for self-serving reasons.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>With the aim of analyzing the complex relationship between a morally “robust” civic education and pluralism, this article confronts and compares the stances of William Galston and Stephen Macedo. Based on their rejection of “neutralist” liberalism, both authors argue for the inculcation of values and virtues constitutive of the liberal “good citizen”. However, the “unity amid diversity” challenge still divides them. The main oppositional node between their “liberal-pluralist” and “civic-liberal” standpoints is on the appropriate limits of the liberal state's educational intervention vis-à-vis “dissenting” families and groups. This therefore opens up a potential clash of paternalisms. The article concludes with an emphasis on the theoretical and practical tensions and problems resulting from the use of a “values” lexicon to promote liberal democratic citizenship.

<p>Bentham deserves a prominent position in the history of democratic ideas. He not only thought popular rule as a vehicle for materializing his vision of utilitarian society, but also gave us a detailed picture of the basic institutions of the form of democratic governance he envisaged. It is also noteworthy that in his radical system, the people, the ultimate and undisputable source of all power, are protected from the authoritarian tendencies of state authorities not by a bill of constitutional rights but by a set of enhanced democratic powers that enable them to exercise strict control over their elected representatives. We present an outline of his “unusually liberal” theory of democracy based on recently published texts and studies as well as a brief assessment of its strong and weak points. [R]</p>

<p>In Hobbes, freedom of choice requires non-frustration: the option you prefer must be accessible. In Berlin it requires non-interference: every option, preferred or un-preferred, must be accessible — every door must be open. But Berlin's argument against Hobbes suggests a parallel argument that freedom requires something stronger still: that each option be accessible and that no one have the power to block access; doors should be open and there should be no powerful door-keepers. This is freedom as non-domination. The claim is that freedom as noninterference is an unstable alternative between freedom as non-frustration and freedom as non-domination.

<p>It has been said on numerous occasions that Frankfurt School critical theory is, and always was, a spent force. Its totalizing theory of reification leads to a reification of the theory itself. Famously, T. Adorno was forced to answer to the “reproach” of “resignation” from his students during the 1960s. Adorno had already defined his project as “melancholy science,” and it is not difficult to connect melancholia to resignation. In this essay, Adorno is read by way of a polemical inversion of melancholy, as it is commonly understood. [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1661]</p>

<p>J.S. Mill's liberal vision included a notion of “civil advancement” whereby the free expression of a diversity of opinion would result not only in an initial collision of difference but also in an eventual consolidation as truth. This article explores the ways and extents in which such liberalism can translate into a cosmopolitan anthropology. Is toleration of difference the appropriate anthropological ethic, or can one hypothesize a liberal “magnanimous” overcoming of difference? The voice of Mill is juxtaposed against those of C.P. Snow, E. Gellner, S. Smith, and K. Popper. Much commentary would suggest that liberalism is passé. A political context dominated by renascent particularisms, militant religions, and resurgent ethnicities spells the collapse of any Enlightenment project of liberal-humanist universalism.

<p>F.

In the former, the state (based on the <italic>Staatsnation</italic> doctrine) is essentially political. In the second, however, the state (based on the <italic>Kulturnation</italic> doctrine) is considered to be a “cultural product”. The importance of Meinecke's theory of the state is that these typified models serve to categorize the majority of cases of formation and evolution of the modern state in Europe and Latin America since the 19th c.

<p>The modern conception of representation, decisively connected with the state as modern type of political order, not only represents a radical cut with regard to pre-modern forms of representation, but is also the result of evolution through which many key elements of the antique and medieval perception of representation were built into the modern perception. This is confirmed by two eminently modern theories of representation: those of Hobbes and of Hegel. In both cases, the theories prove to be largely based on the ancient and medieval legal-political heritage. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines Aristotle's discussion of the Spartan revolt of the <italic>Partheniae</italic> in <italic>Politics</italic> V.7. Aristotle appears to use the <italic>Partheniae</italic> as examples of two sources of instability within so-called aristocraties, but the analysis of this case raises delicate interpretative issues. Sections I-III draw upon surviving accounts of the Parthenian revolt from Antiochus, Ephorus and Myron of Priene in order to illuminate the significance of this example for Aristotle's ethical and political thought. Section IV reconstructs the state of the Spartan constitution around the time of the revolt in order to understand what Aristotle might have thought about what precipitated the revolt. This article argues that generational politics is at stake in the revolt, and Section V locates the revolt's politics within its broader historical and cultural context. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article proposes an approach of Emile Durkheim's work that leaves aside a strictly “social” vision of his concepts and rescues his ability to analyze the central political issues of the 20th c. Taking into account “anomie” as a factor of social disintegration, it detects in several works his central concern to find ways of organizing society that considers everyone's rights and where power is exercised in a balanced way. it tries to find Durkheim's answers around the state, democracy, political parties, the various forms of social organization and representation, war and peace. Therefore, in the same way that Max Weber and Karl Marx's contributions are valuable in the study of political theory, so as can Durkhemian theory serve as an analytical framework for these issues.

<p>Ph. Pettit has famously argued that an agent is free if each option is not only accessible but also un-dominated, that is, if no one has the power to block access. On the basis of counter-examples, this article shows that the will to rule out any domination can lessen, rather than extend, individual freedom. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1359]</p>

<p>This article considers the ongoing difficulties for mainstream political theory of actualizing human rights, with particular reference to R. Rorty's attempt to transcend their liberal foundations. There is a problematic disjuncture between his articulation of exclusion and his hope for inclusion via the expansion of the liberal human rights culture. More specifically, Rorty's description of victimhood is based on premises unavailable to him, with the consequence that stateless persons are rendered inhuman, and, further, his accounts of sentimentality and solidarity have limited potential for the inclusion of such victims within the liberal “community of justification”. In the final analysis, there is a substantial mismatch between Rorty's dependence on both liberal norms and international political practice, and his hopes for the human rights culture to include those stripped of human dignity.

<p>This article interprets <italic>demokratia</italic> and <italic>arete</italic> as dynamically related terms of political thought in ancient Greek culture, from Homeric times to the end of the classical era. It identifies three stages in which this relationship is developed: (1) from the Homeric to the archaic eras; (2) 5th c. Athenian democracy, in which <italic>demokratia</italic> and <italic>arete</italic> are posed as complementary terms; and (3) the 4th c. era in which philosophers used virtue to critique democracy. The argument emphasizes the inherently political dimension of <italic>arete</italic> during this period of Ancient Greek culture. Noting different ways in which <italic>arete</italic> is related to political power in general and democracy in particular, it also illustrates the manner in which <italic>arete</italic> is neither philosophically pristine nor merely an instrument of practical power.

<p>This article explores the virtues of generosity and magnificence in Aristotle's <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic>. Generosity involves private individuals giving moderately; magnificence is spending by individuals on a grand scale for public purposes. Inequality grounds and motivates these virtues. For Aristotle, generosity and magnificence are products of inherited wealth, and the generous and the magnificent person seek the noble in their actions rather than the benefit of their recipients. The generous and the magnificent intend to place themselves in a superior position to those who receive their gifts. Moreover, magnificence flows from a great inequality of wealth and requires that the provision of public goods be in private hands. Aristotle means to critique rather than embrace these virtues by pointing to the inequality and privacy at their foundation. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>J. Habermas's paradigm of communicative action is usually taken to be pretty much dominated by consensus, “Yes-saying”. What if this were a radically one-sided perception? We take up this unorthodox position by arguing that “no-saying” in this paradigm is typically overlooked and underemphasized. To demonstrate this, we consider how negativity is figured at the most basic onto-ethical level in communicative action, as well as expressed in civil disobedience, a phenomenon to which Habermas assigns the remarkable role of “touchstone” (<italic>Prufstein</italic>) of constitutional democracy. Once the importance of no-saying is drawn out, the paradigm looks distinctly less hostile to dissensus and agonism in democratic life. [R]</p>

<p>Although republican political theory has undergone something of a revival in recent years, some question its contemporary relevance on the grounds that republicanism has little to say about central questions of modern economic organization. In response, this paper offers an account of core republican values and then considers how capitalism stands in relation to these values. It identifies three areas of republican concern related to: the impact of unequal wealth-distribution on personal liberty; the impact of the private control of investment on popular sovereignty and pursuit of the common good; and the impact of capitalism on the level and quality of political participation. In view of these concerns, we can see some of the likely requirements of a distinctively republican, but contemporary political economy.
