<sec id="section1-0363546512447785">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Tears of the superior labrum (superior labrum anterior and posterior [SLAP] lesions) of the shoulder are uncommon injuries; however, the incidence of surgical correction seems to be increasing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512447785">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To report the findings of a review of a proprietary descriptive database that catalogs cases for the purpose of board certification on the demographics of SLAP lesion repair. It is the authors’ impression that the percentage of cases of SLAP lesion repairs reported by young orthopaedic surgeons is high and that complications associated with this are not insignificant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512447785">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512447785">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We searched the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery (ABOS) Part II database to evaluate changes in treatment over time and to identify available outcomes and associated complications of arthroscopic repair of SLAP lesions. The database was searched for all SLAP lesions (ICD-9 code 840.7) and SLAP repairs (CPT code 29807) for the years 2003 through 2008. Utilization was analyzed by geographic region and was also obtained based on applicant subspecialty declaration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512447785">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were 4975 SLAP repairs, representing 9.4% of all applicants’ shoulder cases. Mean follow-up was 8.9 weeks because of the time-limited case collection period. There were 78.4% who were men, and 21.6% of patients were women. The percentage of shoulder cases that were SLAP repairs increased over the study period from 9.4% to 10.1% by 2008 (<italic>P</italic> = .0163). Mean age of male patients was 36.4 ± 13.0 years, with a maximum of 85 years. Mean age of female patients was 40.9 ± 14.0 years, with a maximum of 88 years. Pain was reported as absent in only 26.3% of patients at follow-up and function as normal in only 13.1%. There were 40.1% of applicants who self-reported their patients to have an excellent result. The self-reported complication rate was 4.4%. Declared sports medicine specialists had a higher percentage of SLAP repairs than did general orthopaedic surgeons: 12.4% versus 9.2%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512447785">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The percentage of shoulder cases that are SLAP repairs reported by the candidates is 3 times the published incidence supported by the current literature. The large number of repairs in middle-aged and elderly patients is concerning. Focusing on educating young orthopaedic surgeons to appropriately recognize and treat symptomatic SLAP lesions may bring the rate of SLAP repairs down.</p>

<p>Superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions have been recognized as a cause of shoulder pain since the mid-1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447785">1</xref></sup> Controversy regarding what is a normal variant and what is an abnormality that could be consistently associated with a patient’s symptoms surfaced almost immediately thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512447785">20</xref></sup> Snyder et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512447785">34</xref></sup> established the current understanding of the pathological anatomy of SLAP lesions, especially the concept that some lesions require repair rather than debridement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512447785">38</xref></sup> While the true incidence of SLAP lesions is unknown, the percentage of SLAP repairs as a function of their overall surgical cases was quite low at 3.3%. This increased slightly to 4.7% in a follow-up study in 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512447785">33</xref></sup> Percentage rates have varied slightly from these low numbers in other series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512447785">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447785">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512447785">40</xref></sup> but the published literature consistently suggests that these are uncommon injuries.</p>
<p>Despite this, there has always been disproportionate enthusiasm for this diagnosis. Some of this may be because of the high incidence of false-positive radiological interpretations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Prior work done by Weber and Kauffman (“Orthopedic Versus Radiology Interpretation of Shoulder MRI Scans.” Presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2007) showed that as high as 35% of community-read MRI scans were interpreted as either labral tear or “possible labral tear.” Significant clinical findings on shoulder examination of patients with SLAP lesions are also inconsistent. While a number of tests and clinical examination maneuvers have been suggested, all have proven difficult to validate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512447785">¶</xref></sup> These issues create problems for the surgeon in diagnosing these lesions preoperatively. The interpretation of intraoperative findings is also difficult; even experienced surgeons disagree on what findings represent a normal variant requiring no treatment and those that benefit from repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512447785">11</xref></sup> Guidelines for which lesions require repair have been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512447785">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512447785">32</xref></sup> (Weber SC, Higgins DA. “Arthroscopic Management of Type 2 SLAP Lesions of the Shoulder.” Presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2002) but have not as yet been clinically validated.</p>
<p>More recent studies have focused on complications and found that patients often have residual symptoms after SLAP repair. Persistent discomfort,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447785">8</xref></sup> with loose hardware,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447785">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512447785">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512447785">31</xref></sup> persistent rotator cuff defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447785">8</xref></sup> articular cartilage injuries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512447785">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447785">16</xref></sup> persistent synovitis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512447785">10</xref></sup> and low rates of return to sports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447785">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512447785">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512447785">35</xref></sup> have all been reported after the procedure. Because arthroscopic SLAP repair is a technically demanding arthroscopic procedure that may be associated with significant complications, it is important to undertake the procedure in those cases where the potential reward from the procedure outweighs the risk.</p>
<p>Because it was the authors’ impression that the incidence of repairs seems to be increasing, we sought to review the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery (ABOS) Part II database to see what percentage of the applicants’ shoulder procedures was in fact SLAP repairs and to assess whether the percentage of applicants’ shoulder cases that were SLAP repairs was increasing with time and was consistent with the percentages reported in the literature. This database had been used in the past to review changing national trends in distal radius fixation by Koval et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512447785">21</xref></sup> It was hoped that this database could help to identify similar trends in SLAP repair.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512447785" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The ABOS database contains information that is voluntarily self-reported by candidates who have applied and been approved for admission to the Part II (oral) Examination. A similar process is used by board-certified surgeons who choose to recertify through an oral examination pathway, which was not part of this study. These candidates have completed an accredited residency in orthopaedic surgery, passed the Part I (written) Examination, actively practiced orthopaedic surgery for 22 months, and undergone peer review. Board certification is a voluntary process, and each applicant signs a release allowing use of deidentified data in research projects approved by the ABOS. The strengths of this database are that it contains all the cases (&gt;75,000 per year) performed over a 6-month period by a large number of surgeons (&gt;650 per year) across the country. The data submitted are verified by sampling during an examination, and the data are collected in a standard format under clear, uniform instructions.</p>
<p>In preparation for the oral certification process for the ABOS, candidates submit a list of all surgical cases performed over a defined 6-month period (July through December) within their preceding 22-month period of practice. Seventy percent of these candidates take the oral examination within 2 years after completion of their training (residency or fellowship), and 98% take the examination within 5 years after completion of their training. All data are entered into a secure Internet-based database (SCRIBE). As the examination occurs in July of the following year, long-term outcomes are not available.</p>
<p>The collected information included the date of the procedure, the geographic location of the candidate’s practice, ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) surgical procedural codes, deidentified patient demographic data such as age and sex, surgical and medical complications, and 4 surgeon-reported outcome measures (pain, deformity, function, and patient satisfaction).</p>
<p>The scales that were used for the outcome measures were as follows. Pain was described as increased, unchanged, decreased, or absent; deformity was described as increased, unchanged, improved, or normal; function was described as decreased, unchanged, improved, or normal; and patient satisfaction was described as poor, fair, good, or excellent. These outcomes are physician derived and generic, as they are meant to apply to the full spectrum of orthopaedic procedures and to give a very general sense of the success or failure of a procedure. These scales are provided to candidates by means of drop-down menus during the online submission of case data; however, candidates are not provided with specific definitions.</p>
<p>Each candidate is allowed to enter these outcomes on the basis of his or her own subjective patient assessment. There are no patient-derived (self-reported) data, and the assessment period for each patient can vary from a few weeks to a few months. All cases are included, even those lacking postoperative follow-up. Complications are also physician reported and are entered from drop-down menu lists containing medical and surgical categories. In 2004, the category of “surgical unspecified” was added to the complication list to capture the occurrence of rare adverse outcomes associated with the surgical procedure.</p>
<p>The ABOS Part II database was searched for all SLAP lesions (ICD-9 code 840.7) and SLAP repairs (CPT code 29807) for the years 2003 through 2008. Utilization was analyzed by geographic region and compared with regard to complications and outcomes as self-reported by candidates during the online application process. Data were analyzed to obtain the number of SLAP repairs over the 6-year study period and, as a percentage of shoulder cases, the number of SLAP repairs for each year. Data were also analyzed for complication rates of SLAP repairs; surgeon-reported pain, function, deformity, and satisfaction for SLAP repairs; and age and sex distributions for SLAP repairs. Percentage of shoulder cases that were SLAP repairs was also obtained based on applicant subspecialty declaration.</p>
<p>The United States was divided into 6 geographic regions, loosely based on the regions of the United States Census Bureau, for a geographic analysis. This research protocol was reviewed by the institutional review board of Sacramento Knee and Sports Medicine and was judged to be exempt from requiring consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512447785">21</xref></sup> Candidates applying for this examination are informed by the ABOS that the deidentified data that they submit as part of the voluntary process of board certification may be used for research purposes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 4975 SLAP repairs, representing 9.4% of all applicants’ shoulder surgical cases over the study period. Mean follow-up was 8.9 weeks because of the time-limited case collection period. There were 78.4% who were men, and 21.6% of patients were women. The candidates reported that 13.3% of these cases were isolated SLAP lesions, with the remainder performed with a variety of other shoulder procedures. The percentage of candidates’ cases that were SLAP repairs increased moderately over the study period from 9.4% to 10.1% by 2008, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512447785">Figure 1</xref>. This represents a statistically significant increase in SLAP repairs as a percentage of total shoulder cases from 2003 to 2008 (<italic>P</italic> = .0163, χ<sup>2</sup> with Yates correction). Mean age of male patients was 36.4 ± 13.0 years, with a maximum of 85 years. Mean age of female patients was 40.9 ± 14.0 years, with a maximum of 88 years. The SLAP repair percentage as a function of examination subspecialty is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512447785">Figure 2</xref>, with repair percentage as a function of fellowship training shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512447785">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The diagnosis and treatment of SLAP lesions remain challenging. While the literature has evolved over the past 2 decades since the initial reports of simple debridement of all SLAP lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512447785">38</xref></sup> there is nothing to suggest that the incidence of this lesion has increased or should be treated more commonly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512447785">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512447785">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447785">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512447785">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512447785">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512447785">40</xref></sup> These reported percentages of overall shoulder cases are all in shoulder subspecialty practices. Snyder et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512447785">34</xref></sup> showed that their percentage of SLAP surgeries as a function of their overall surgical cases was quite low at 3.3%. This increased slightly to 4.7% in a follow-up study in 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512447785">33</xref></sup> Percentage rates have varied slightly from these low numbers in other series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512447785">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447785">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512447785">40</xref></sup> The percentage of SLAP repairs reported by ABOS Part II applicants exceeds all the reported rates except for the study of Maffett et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447785">23</xref></sup> a series with a disproportionate number of patients with anterior instability. It might be expected that general orthopaedic surgeons would have an even lower percentage of these cases than subspecialty orthopaedic surgeons. While regional variation in the percentage of SLAP lesions was statistically significant, the actual percentages are fairly close and probably do not suggest a clinically relevant difference. Because of the confusion that surrounds the diagnosis, an increase in procedural intervention may be occurring to treat the wrong element of the shoulder disorder or a normal variant that is also not the source of the patient’s discomfort.</p>
<p>As noted in the study of Weber and Kauffman (“Orthopedic Versus Radiology Interpretation of Shoulder MRI Scans.” Presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2007), the high rate of MRI results positive for SLAP lesions makes it important for the surgeon to be discriminate in operating on patients with SLAP findings on radiological review alone. Blaine et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512447785">3</xref></sup> point out that many of these patients with SLAP lesions on radiological review could be managed nonoperatively. Boileau et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512447785">4</xref></sup> reported better outcomes with biceps tenodesis for all age groups than with SLAP repair. Certainly, the complication rates in this study and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447785">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512447785">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512447785">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447785">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512447785">31</xref></sup> reinforce that SLAP repair carries a measurable complication rate. Complications were self-reported by the surgeons and might be expected to be significantly higher than this review suggests. The outcome data in regard to pain and function are also worrisome, as only 26% of patients were pain free, and only 13.1% were self-reported as showing normal function. The short follow-up available from the ABOS database is less than is usually considered adequate for surgical procedures. Longer follow-up might yield different results, either better or worse than the short-term results reported here. These results are consistent with the results of Cohen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447785">8</xref></sup> who showed that despite improvement, less than one half of their patients were able to return to unrestricted sports activities. Stetson and Snyder,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512447785">35</xref></sup> in the only other study of isolated SLAP lesions, showed only 68% good or excellent results, and Cohen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512447785">9</xref></sup> showed only 31% of professional baseball players returned to play in their review of SLAP repairs done by multiple surgeons for a single professional baseball organization. The results suggest that SLAP repair may not be the benign procedure that casual inspection of the literature would suggest. Weber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512447785">39</xref></sup> reported a series of failed SLAP repairs in which 2 of 24 shoulders had severe iatrogenic arthritis at follow-up and 14 of 24 shoulders had articular cartilage injuries. Reoperation improved the mean University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores to only 29.2, a fair result, showing that repeat surgery rarely restored a normal outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512447785">39</xref></sup> Similar results with failed SLAP repair were reported by Katz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447785">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The age of the patients at the time of treatment in this review is also at variance with the reported literature. In almost all previous reports, SLAP lesions occur in youngerpatients (Kim KT, Cosgarea AJ, McFarland EG. “Clinical Significance of SLAP Lesions.” Presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2002). One half of male patients in this review were over 36 years of age, and one half of female patients were over 40 years of age. Patients in their 80s would not be expected to either have SLAP lesions or benefit from repair. Increasingly, patients over 40 years of age have been shown to be better served by biceps tenodesis as opposed to a SLAP repair, which can be performed using a proximal soft tissue tenodesis with minimal additional morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512447785">41</xref></sup> (Kauffman JI, Weber SC, Higgins D. “Arthroscopic Biceps Tenodesis: Experience With the Castagna Technique.” Presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2004). Burns et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447785">7</xref></sup> point out that while the decision to repair a SLAP lesion is “a relative indication,” they counsel that “patients aged younger than 40 years are usually repaired, whereas patients physiologically older than 40 are usually tenodesed.” As is the case with new procedures, the SLAP repair method may be taught in lieu of teaching alternative procedures that have a longer track record in the orthopaedic literature. From an educational perspective, it seems crucial that residents and fellows are taught to carefully consider the elements that characterize this condition and the treatment alternatives that have the best chance of restoring the maximum function for the patient. In this light, SLAP repair is best performed when the patient’s age, physical examination findings, and response to differential injection indicate that the procedure is warranted rather than the MRI appearance or visual appearance at surgery.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are limitations with this type of study. It involved the use of a retrospective database, with all of the problems inherent to this methodology. It does, however, offer some measure of practice patterns across the country and has been previously used by Koval et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512447785">21</xref></sup> to similarly assess practice trends in treating distal radius fractures. This type of data is currently difficult to obtain otherwise. The weaknesses are that it is self-reported data and thus theoretically subject to conscious or unconscious bias. The follow-up period was very short (mean, 8.9 weeks), and the outcome measures are not well defined. It should be noted that these data are collected from surgeons who are not yet board certified and are quite early in their careers. It may not be representative of practice patterns or outcomes in all orthopaedic surgery practices.</p>
<p>Similar to most database projects, users cannot independently verify the accuracy of the data, its standardization, or its input. The ABOS database does not currently include detailed clinical information such as medication history, the severity of the associated comorbidities, lifestyle factors, body mass index, or mechanism of injury. Therefore, we do not have all of the information necessary to fully evaluate the appropriateness of specific interventions or to control for all relevant patient factors that may affect the outcome. A major limitation of the present study is the portion that relies on outcome data entered by the candidates themselves. As noted above, the 4 outcome categories (pain, function, deformity, and patient satisfaction) are not clearly defined, are not scientifically validated, and are dependent on subjective judgments that are self-reported by the candidate surgeons. That is, because the surgeons use self-applied outcome scales and may have a stake in better outcomes, their reporting may not have been as accurate as that of an unbiased observer. Self-reporting of complications is always difficult and might result in underreporting. Follow-up is short, and outcomes might improve with time. That said, most patients with SLAP repairs should be largely recovered within the reporting period and might actually get worse with longer follow-up.</p>
<p>In summary, the percentage of SLAP repairs as a percentage of overall shoulder cases in ABOS Part II applicants was 3 times higher than the literature would suggest is appropriate for this condition and is increasing with time. Many of the patients reported were of an age where SLAP repair might be better served by other procedures. Complications were not uncommon, and outcomes were rarely normal at the time of short-term follow-up. Likely, the cause for this increase in operative treatment of SLAP lesions is multifactorial. The data suggest that more educational resources should be devoted to educating residents and fellows regarding the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of this difficult condition.</p>
