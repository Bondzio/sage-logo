<abstract>
<p>Established in 1991, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is still struggling to define a clear and commonly accepted identity for itself. As the member states hold very different views of the future CIS, they pull the organization in different directions, giving it a somewhat fuzzy character. While the Russian-led core is seeking closer integration, possibly even a transfer of decision-making to the supranational level, another group of states is insisting that the CIS should remain a loose and non-binding forum for cooperation. As a reflection of this reality, the CIS space is home to a number of other organizations which all take their members from the CIS circle. These organizations deliver what the CIS as a whole—because of its lowest common denominator policy—cannot do. The host of acronyms offer something to most member states, but they also cause the CIS space to be highly fragmented. Russia, in particular, has worked to bring all the different parts of the CIS closer together under its own leadership, but has remained largely unsuccessful. With its most recent initiative, a Eurasian Economic Union to be established by 2015, Russia is making a new effort to achieve what has failed so far. Little suggests that it will have any greater success now than before, and it therefore seems likely that the CIS will remain in the future also a complex organizational setting and a difficult challenge for Russia to handle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Established in December 1991, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is the leading international organization in the area, stretching from the Baltic Sea over the Caucasus and Central Asia to the Russian Far East. Despite its nearly 25 years of existence, however, the organization is still struggling to define a clear identity for itself and to bridge the political gap between the pro-integration core member states and the much more skeptical dissident states. While Russia leads the former group, Georgia was, until its formal departure from the CIS in August 2009, arguably the most critical member state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2233865913490938">1</xref></sup> Others, however, have also kept a clear distance from the Russian-led processes of the CIS, remaining suspicious of Moscow’s intentions and jealously guarding their hard-won political freedom.</p>
<p>This conflict over direction manifested itself already soon after the establishment of the CIS. Inspired mainly by the development of and within the neighboring European Union (EU), a number of member states, most notably Russia, saw the CIS as the foundation on which something much more ambitious eventually would be built; for others, however, it was little more than a necessary evil designed to manage the complex interdependencies created by their shared existence within the former unitary Soviet state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2233865913490938">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As an almost inevitable consequence of these divergent views, the CIS space has been left with a fragmented organizational structure. Member states have not only developed a habit of picking and choosing from the overall CIS menu—or opting-out, to use a term from the integration literature—but they also join various subgroups and other regional organizations, some of which support the CIS, some of which undermine it. All in all, since 1991 more than a handful of major international organizations have existed within the CIS space. With one exception—the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)—all are exclusive to the circle of CIS member states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2233865913490938">
<title>The CIS</title>
<p>The CIS is the umbrella organization which—as the only organization discussed here—has had as members all 12 relevant former Soviet republics (even prior to the establishment of the CIS, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had made clear their decision to make a <italic>complete</italic> break with the former Soviet Union and to seek integration into Western security structures instead).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2233865913490938">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The establishment of the CIS was complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2233865913490938">Kosov and Toropygin, 2009</xref>: 19–21). The then leaders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine signed the founding Agreement on 8 December 1991, announcing that the Soviet Union would cease to exist by the end of the year and that a new structure for cooperation between <italic>sovereign</italic> states was now being set up instead. Faced with this <italic>fait accompli</italic> and fearful of a highly uncertain future, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan quickly accepted the invitation to join the new Commonwealth, which they all did by signing the Alma-Ata Protocol on 21 December 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2233865913490938">Gleason 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Georgia, however, insisted it would follow the path of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and so decided against membership of the CIS. Cracks were soon showing elsewhere as well. Thus, following the arrival of Abulfaz Elchibey in the Azerbaijani presidency in June 1992, he announced that he was pulling his country out of the CIS altogether, and in Belarus, Moldova, Turkmenistan and Ukraine the national parliaments refused to ratify the later 1993 CIS Charter, citing concerns about centralization and about Russian interference in their domestic affairs. Even by late 1993, then, Azerbaijan and Georgia were non-members and Belarus, Moldova, Turkmenistan and Ukraine all held an unclear status.</p>
<p>As Russia became increasingly dissatisfied with the post-Cold War international order, it started to search for allies within the CIS space, even if reluctant ones, to help it oppose the West. By offering political support to the regime of Heidar Aliyev, who assumed power as Elchibey was overthrown in a coup in June 1993, and much-needed military support to Georgian troops fighting secessionists groups within that country, Moscow managed to bring both Azerbaijan and Georgia into the CIS by the end of 1993. In addition, by threatening to step up support to the break-away region of Transdnestr, in April 1994 Russia finally convinced Moldovan law-makers that the costs of non-ratification were simply too great for the small country to accept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2233865913490938">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Belarus, finally, a gradual but very strong pro-Russian (if not even pro-Soviet) turn among the voters, who were disappointed to find that the new order did not bring much improvement over the old one, in January 1994 prompted members of parliament to accept the Charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2233865913490938">Burant, 1995</xref>). This marked the beginning of a process that has eventually led Belarus, since July 1994 ruled by heavily pro-Russian president Alexander Lukashenka, to take up a position at the very core of the CIS. The country follows the Russian lead closely—in fact closer than any other member state—and it calls for stronger integration in all spheres; since 1994 it has even declared its willingness, in principle at least, to give up its status as a sovereign state in favor of a new union state with Russia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2233865913490938">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ukraine and Turkmenistan, however, have never ratified the Charter. While the former has quite consistently referred to itself as an associated member state, it was only in 2005 that Turkmenistan made a unilateral decision to follow this example, arguing that only this would be consistent with the country’s status as a non-aligned state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2233865913490938">6</xref></sup> The associated member status is defined by article 8 of the CIS Charter according to which it is for those wanting “to take part in isolated activities” of the organization;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2233865913490938">7</xref></sup> it carries unclear rights and obligations and it seems to be of a mainly symbolic nature as even full members also pick and choose from the CIS menu.</p>
<p>As an all too clear illustration of some of the intra-organizational conflicts of the CIS, in August 2008 Russian troops invaded Georgian territory, causing the Georgian parliament to decide in a unanimous vote the immediate and complete withdrawal of Georgia from the CIS. However, according to article 9 of the CIS Charter, any decision to leave the organization should be given 12 months in advance, and so it was only in August 2009 that Georgia formally brought to an end its participation in the CIS.</p>
<p>Summing up, the CIS has a membership record of nine full and two associated members. It is perhaps best visualized as a series of concentric circles; at the risk of over-simplification, it can be said that the core holds Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the strongest pro-integration members, while the middle circle contains the positive yet somewhat distanced members Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, while the outer circle holds the CIS dissidents Moldova, Turkmenistan and Ukraine. Georgia in 2008 catapulted itself away from the outer circle, where it had spent 15 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2233865913490938">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even this cursory look at the development of the CIS indicates that the organization differs fundamentally from the EU, even if for some of the member states the latter has been a source of inspiration. There is little doubt that otherwise well-tested and oft-used theories about the demand for and supply of integration need to be applied with care to the CIS; generally, the weight of voters’ preferences is simply too light, the influence of non-competitive yet state-protected industries too great and the spill-over of positive lessons from the CIS structures to the domestic arenas too obstructed by closed and unreformed bureaucracies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2233865913490938">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>While in principle there is a demand throughout the CIS space for integration to deliver a free or at least less restricted exchange of goods, services, capital and labor and thus to help improve overall cost efficiency and raise living standards, this is decisively weakened by national fears of loss of autonomy in decision-making and by concerns about distributional imbalances (some will win while others will lose; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2233865913490938">Metcalf, 1997</xref>). The former aspect in particular will be well known to students of other integration projects, where national feelings may also occasionally trump rational cost–benefit analysis. However, within the context of the CIS it takes on a different and much narrower quality; it is perhaps best explained by the theory of omnibalancing, which assumes that “the most powerful determinant of alignment is the drive of [non-democratic] leaders to ensure their political and physical survival” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2233865913490938">David, 1991</xref>). The theory of omnibalancing has been developed to help explain what seem to be anomalies in patterns of international alignment, some of which we find among the CIS member states, and it may also be applied to and tested in situations where non-democratic leaders decide to forego otherwise seemingly rational opportunities of integration; the fear of losing influence by empowering domestic rivals in what is often a highly dichotomized “winner takes all” political system causes them to hold back the demand for integration. A policy of integration with other states may, in other words, be good for the country, but it is not necessarily good for the regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2233865913490938">David, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if rivalling domestic actors succeed in putting integration on the agenda—or the regime decides to do so by itself—the process may still be obstructed by distributional imbalances. Integration theory rooted in rational choice assumes that states will often be reluctant to engage in integration projects if there is a risk that they will be on the losing side relative to the more successful states. This tendency for states to be concerned with relative gains leads, in the words of Walter Mattli, to a key supply condition: the presence within the group of states of a <italic>benevolent</italic> leader, which may ease distributional tension by giving side-payments to the states suffering relative losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2233865913490938">Mattli, 1999</xref>: 42).</p>
<p>Given the prior history of integration outlined briefly above, Russia is hardly in a position to act as a benevolent leader. In fact, even its overwhelming dominance within the group may disqualify it from assuming this role. Thus, its population of 142.5 million represents just over 50% of the combined CIS-12 population, while its gross domestic product (GDP) of US$2504 billion represents a full 70.3% of the combined CIS-12 GDP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2233865913490938">10</xref></sup> By comparison, Germany, the biggest and leading EU member state, has only a 16% share of the combined EU-27 population and its economy represents 20% of the combined EU-27 GDP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2233865913490938">11</xref></sup> All in all, Russia may be too dominant to be able to inspire trust—even if it promises to hand out side-payments.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing some of the insightful observations by former US national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, Russia’s overall CIS predicament perhaps lies in the fact that it suffers deficiencies in both of the two ways in which it may exercise its power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2233865913490938">Brzezinski, 1997</xref>: 114–115). Thus, on the one hand it has not been strong enough to simply impose its will on the other member states (as witnessed for instance by Moscow’s humiliating failure to bring any of these to follow it in recognizing the Georgian break-away areas Abkhazia and South Ossetia), and on the other hand it has also not been attractive enough to be able to seduce them. For all of the other CIS member states this means, then, that, while they have had to accept compromises, they have also been somewhat free to simply ignore Russia’s ambitions and priorities and to seek profitable alternatives elsewhere. It is this dynamic that has left the CIS in its present state of mixed motives and fragmentation.</p>
<p>As a consequence of all of this, the CIS has proved unable to move any of its decision-making procedures to the supranational level. There is no delegation or even pooling of authority—only unanimity among equal member states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2233865913490938">12</xref></sup> While we do find two institutions with the potential to develop into supranational bodies, both have been kept strictly at the advisory level. This is true first and foremost of the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, currently consisting of national delegations of nine member states, which has from the outset been designed to offer recommendations only to national policy-makers;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2233865913490938">13</xref></sup> and it is even true for the Economic Court which, ideally of course, should be able to settle disputes through the use of legally binding judgments but which has been reduced to offering non-enforceable opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2233865913490938">Danilenko, 1999</xref>). It is the rule of the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>The insistence that decision-making should remain based on unanimity may also reflect differences in identities; the more dissimilar actors are, all things equal, the more likely it is that one or more policy outliers will be voted down on matters of importance, thereby having to abide by unacceptable majority decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2233865913490938">Koenig-Archibugi, 2004</xref>). Constructivist integration theory hypothesizes that states operating within a shared setting—such as the CIS—will gradually become more similar, developing still more similar preferences in that process also. The underlying assumption is that actors “learn” from each other through interaction and that this brings them to gradually internalize new and <italic>shared</italic> worldviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2233865913490938">Checkel, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A comprehensive study of the foreign policy behavior of the CIS member states in the years 1992–2011 shows that this has <italic>not</italic> happened in the CIS membership circle in general. On the contrary, foreign policy preferences show clear signs of increasing divergence, causing member states to adopt still more different stances on various issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2233865913490938">14</xref></sup> According to the CIS Charter, member states should strive for “foreign policy coordination” and for the “… <italic>strengthening</italic> of … [their] mutual understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation”; this suggests that the original ambition, as a minimum, has been to see greater policy convergence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2233865913490938">15</xref></sup> The actual foreign policy record goes against this, however, as member states disagree still more over issues such as human rights and disarmament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913490938">Hansen, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The failure of the CIS perhaps has never been felt more clearly than during the October 2009 summit meeting in Kishinev which ended after just 30 minutes of excruciating silence; the heads of state, so noted the Russian newspaper <italic>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</italic>, simply “had nothing to say to each other”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-2233865913490938">16</xref></sup> This led the host of the summit, then Moldovan President Mihai Ghimpu, to publicly announce the CIS “a dead old woman”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-2233865913490938">17</xref></sup> Famously pro-European and anti-Russian, Ghimpu may have had a desire to exaggerate the state of affairs inside the organization in order to accelerate its final disintegration; it does seem reasonable, however, to draw the conclusion that, while the CIS may not be dead quite yet, it is clearly <italic>dying</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section3-2233865913490938">
<title>Eurasian Economic Union</title>
<p>A relatively new and ambitious project, the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) is supposed to bring with it a much deeper and binding integration than that achieved earlier by the CIS as a whole. Related ideas have been discussed in political and media circles almost since the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the EEU was really put on the table by then Russian Prime Minister (and now President) Vladimir Putin in an article published in the daily <italic>Izvestiya</italic> in October 2011.</p>
<p>The occasion was the opening, on 1 January 2012, of the Single Economic Space (SES), linking the economies of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan in what is supposed to be a single market with a full harmonization of relevant legislation and a free flow of goods, services, capital and labor. However, the SES is only temporary, as Putin made clear when announcing that “we do not stop at this but instead set ourselves an ambitious goal: To continue onto the following and higher level of integration—to the Eurasian Union”. It is, in Putin’s own slightly hyperbolic words, “a future which is born today” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2233865913490938">Putin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This future begins in 2015 when, as agreed by the presidents of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the EEU should be ready (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2233865913490938">British Broadcasting Corporation, 2011</xref>). According to Putin, what the SES member states have put forward is “a model for a powerful supranational association with the potential of becoming one of the poles of the current world and, as such, of playing the role of an effective “hub” between Europe and the dynamic Asia-Pacific region” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2233865913490938">Putin, 2011</xref>). Once established like this, so it is said openly, the EEU should support on-going efforts to “strengthen Russia’s position in the world”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-2233865913490938">18</xref></sup> The centrifugal tendencies of the CIS clearly do little good to Russia’s ambitions to project its influence beyond its current reach.</p>
<p>When questioned by a member of the Duma about the feasibility of the project, Putin offered his recipe for successful integration by explaining that “we have to make it so that we become an attractive magnet, which the others will want to join”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-2233865913490938">19</xref></sup> This simple—and somewhat sad—realization by Putin tells us a lot about the failures of the CIS; unknowingly echoing the words of Brzezinski just cited, Putin is admitting that Russia has failed to draw the other member states closer to it, and since there can be no <italic>real</italic> integration across the post-Soviet space without Russian involvement and leadership, it follows that, for the EEU to be successful, Russia will first have to change.</p>
<p>Given both the record of the CIS and the fanfare surrounding the launch of the EEU project, this clearly is a critical moment for the future of integration in the post-Soviet space. Should the EEU fail to achieve anything beyond the symbolic and largely undelivered integration which has characterized the CIS, the “mother organization” will suffer as well. If the Russian “engine”, supported by two of its most loyal, developed and affluent allies cannot clear and then lead the way to the declared end state, then this is unlikely to ever happen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-2233865913490938">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The core of the EEU of course will be the SES member states Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Should other CIS members join the SES before 2015, it is probably expected that they will also join the EEU, thereby helping to make the SES ready for liquidation. Everyone will have their eyes fixed on Ukraine, the second-largest CIS member in terms of population, economy and military spending.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-2233865913490938">21</xref></sup> In what is clearly an attempt to win over Ukraine, Putin has repeatedly put forward the argument that membership of the EEU, in addition to its economic benefits, will actually speed up “integration into Europe”, that is, pave the way for a closer relationship with the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2233865913490938">Putin, 2011</xref>). However, as noted earlier, Ukraine has remained a CIS dissident and we find little to suggest that this policy line will change. Successive Ukrainian administrations have maintained a strategic vision of EU membership for Ukraine, and there will undoubtedly be a concern in Kyiv, quite reasonably so, that membership of an <italic>alternative</italic> union will actually prove detrimental to the realization of that vision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-2233865913490938">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Russia may find it difficult to persuade Ukraine to join the EEU, it will probably be facing a very different challenge as far as some of the poorer CIS member states are concerned. This is especially so in Central Asia, where EURASEC (Eurasian Economic Community) members Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan should be expected to lobby intensively to gain access to the new and more ambitious integration project. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2233865913490938">Table 1</xref>, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan constitute the rest of EURASEC, and with the establishment of the EEU, the former organization must be considered obsolete.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-2233865913490938">23</xref></sup> This puts both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan somewhat in limbo; stuck inside a slowly disintegrating structure and with no invitation to join the CIS vanguard, they must either force their way into the EEU or look for alternatives. The former strategy could include warnings about a possible social or political collapse, should these vulnerable states be left to care for themselves, and the second strategy could entail a re-orientation towards China, the giant neighbor with whom Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan already have strong and institutionalized ties and which represents the number one trading partner for both states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-2233865913490938">24</xref></sup></p>

<p>The dilemma for Moscow will be whether to keep a strict focus on the EEU project, thereby having to exclude hopeful but less developed candidate countries, or to attempt to arrest the fragmentation of the CIS space by leading in the development of an organization which, while it may achieve less than hoped for, promises to preserve most of Russia’s influence in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-2233865913490938">25</xref></sup> Given the continued nostalgia for and emotional attachment to the former Soviet Union among a considerable part of the Russian population as well as the country’s security and military interests in Kyrgyzstan and, even more so, in Tajikistan, we should expect arguments for an inclusive approach to carry considerable weight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-2233865913490938">26</xref></sup> Even technocrats in the finance ministry in Moscow may not have the stomach for the prospects of a more independent and, even worse, possibly unstable Central Asian backyard.</p>
<p>The EEU project clearly is ambitious. Its details, however, remain obscure. Leading politicians in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan talk loosely about an “economic union” and even a common currency, both of which require strong fiscal discipline and well-developed institutions, preferably with a right to intervene in the monetary and budgetary policies of otherwise sovereign states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-2233865913490938">27</xref></sup> The lowering of transaction costs, delivered for instance through the introduction of a common currency, is of interest to all, but the transfer of political power to a supranational body may prove unacceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-2233865913490938">28</xref></sup> When we add to this discussion of <italic>will</italic> the element of <italic>capacity</italic>, the future development is even more uncertain.</p>
<p>Within the CIS the three SES member states lead in terms of both per capita income and human development indicators. Figures also show, however, that all three states suffer from massive corruption (on par with Iran and Mauritania), have a relatively poor business climate, including bureaucratic and other restrictions on trading across borders, and struggle with low government effectiveness and regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2233865913490938">Transparency International, n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2233865913490938">World Bank, n.d.a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2233865913490938">b</xref>). Needless to say, this is a poor starting point for the development of a complex economic union based on a common market with unrestricted and non-discriminatory access for all. Even the best intentions and highest ambitions may prove inadequate in the face of realities on the ground.</p>

<title>The Collective Security Treaty Organization</title>
<p>The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is the main military alliance in the CIS space. Contrary to its name, it is exactly that—a straightforward alliance and <italic>not</italic> a collective security organization; it is designed against external threats and <italic>not</italic> against intra-organizational aggression pitting two or more member states against each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-2233865913490938">29</xref></sup> The “musketeer oath” of the CSTO, found in article 4 of the Treaty, simply stipulates that “if an act of aggression is committed against one of the member states, all other member states will provide it with the necessary support, including military”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-2233865913490938">30</xref></sup> The Treaty has none of the regulatory machinery usually associated with the more sophisticated collective security system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2233865913490938">Kupchan and Kupchan, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The alliance was set up already in May 1992 when representatives of Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST), also referred to as the Tashkent Treaty as the Uzbek capital was the scene of the signing. The new alliance, basically a Russian–Central Asian defense agreement with the inclusion of then war-fighting Armenia, was mainly concerned with developments within the greater Central Asian region.</p>
<p>Most disturbingly perhaps, as the Soviet Union was collapsing, tension built up in Tajikistan, eventually escalating into a high-intensity civil war in the spring of 1992. The civil war claimed as many as 60,000 casualties and threatened to alter the political reality in post-Soviet Central Asia by bringing to power a new government coalition of Islamists and democrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2233865913490938">Derouen and Heo, 2007</xref>: 753). Russian troops—counting some 25,000—gave indirect military support to the traditional, pro-Moscow power circles from the outbreak of the conflict, and they were later given additional muscle and legitimacy through a nominal CIS peacekeeping contingent which also included troops from CST allies Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Adding to this feeling of unease among the later CST signatory states, in neighboring Afghanistan the administration of Mohammad Najibullah, the former head of the Communist Revolutionary Council, in April 1992 was forced to resign and to seek refuge inside the United Nations compound in Kabul. While the extreme Islamization now associated with the Taliban would only make itself felt—and enter global public consciousness—a few years later, the introduction of the conservative and repressive “Mujahideen rule” in the wake of Najibullah’s resignation clearly suggested that the country was facing a highly uncertain future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2233865913490938">Wahab and Youngerman, 2007</xref>). This future, so it was feared throughout a number of CIS capitals, could bring with it political radicalization and increased inter-ethnic conflict and thus prove highly destabilizing for the region as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-2233865913490938">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>As political developments prompted a gradual widening of the CIS membership circle, so the number of states signatory to the CST also increased in late 1993. Thus, as Georgia and Azerbaijan were brought into the CIS, both states also felt compelled to join the CST;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-2233865913490938">32</xref></sup> Belarus, on the other hand, freely gave up its former status as a non-aligned state to join—and to enjoy the protection of—Russia and its allies in the CST. This brought the number of member states to a total of nine, the highest ever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2233865913490938">Kosov and Toropygin, 2009</xref>: 103–104). Only Ukraine, Moldova and Turkmenistan have never been members of the organization and all three states have in fact constitutional or other legal restrictions preventing them from joining military alliances.</p>
<p>The original focus of the alliance on the Central Asian theater shifted gradually, however, as more pressing concerns developed in the West. A defining element for especially Russian foreign policy for close to two decades, NATO enlargement into former Warsaw Pact territory and perhaps even into the CIS has met with fierce opposition in Moscow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2233865913490938">Black, 2000</xref>). The alliance has remained a balancing tool, but instead of preventing the spread of radicalism, for which it was always poorly equipped and prepared, under Russian leadership it has since been redefined to lead the opposition to NATO enlargement; among those opposed to this latter process there has clearly been a hope, however illusory this has been, that the risk of provoking a military response from within the CSTO would cause NATO to rethink its successive plans for eastward enlargement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-2233865913490938">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>As explained by traditional balancing theory, when facing international developments considered harmful to its own interests, the state may draw on two sources of power: it may rely on its own capabilities, trying to increase these still more relative to those of the opposing state(s), and, if possible, it may rely on the capabilities of allies, aiming to use the combined influence of itself and its allies to deter or even roll back a given development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2233865913490938">Waltz, 1979</xref>: 118). As an alliance the CSTO has been mediocre at best—in terms of both military capabilities and perhaps even more so political cohesion—but for a number of member states it has still represented their best chance of withstanding the alleged Western domination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-2233865913490938">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The gradual re-orientation of the alliance to confront the West in general—and NATO more specifically—proved unacceptable to some of the member states. Always reluctant members, Georgia and Azerbaijan swiftly left when the Tashkent Treaty expired and had to be renewed in 1999, and the two states were joined by Uzbekistan whose highly authoritarian and somewhat unpredictable President Islam Karimov had suddenly decided to embrace the West. The three states instead came together in the loose forum GUUAM (consisting of Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova), which had an openly pro-Western and only slightly more implied anti-Russian orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-2233865913490938">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>All of this reduced the number of alliance members to the current six only.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-2233865913490938">36</xref></sup> Relieved of the more foot-dragging member states, these six proceeded to institutionalize their cooperation by adding “Organization” to the name—hence the CSTO. The institutionalization, effective since 2003, has given the CSTO many of the organizational trappings that we also find in NATO. Headed by a Secretary General (the Russian General Nikolay Borduzha), the organization also has an international secretariat staffed by representatives of the various member states and subdivided into military and political branches. This organization in turn is controlled by a number of political and ambassadorial bodies, the most powerful of which is the Council on Collective Security, where we find the heads of state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-2233865913490938">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The institutionalization of the cooperation clearly was supposed to demonstrate a coming of age of the alliance. Compared with the turbulent 1990s, it now stands on a much more solid organizational footing and it also enjoys greater cohesion. It still suffers fundamentally, however, from the fact that it is effectively a <italic>CIS</italic> military alliance from which as many as 50% of all members have deliberately opted out; it has never covered the entire CIS and the big prize—Ukraine—has never been won over. Add to this the observation that the anti-Western and anti-NATO sentiments are not felt or at least not expressed equally strongly by all member states—only Russia openly recognizes NATO as a military threat in its military doctrine—and a picture emerges of an organization still struggling to deliver.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-2233865913490938">38</xref></sup> Its geographical reach is not as extensive as key members would like it to be and its <italic>raison d’être</italic> is vaguer than Moscow pretends.</p>
<p>While Borduzha rejects any talk of a crisis, heard still more often even among Russian analysts, in 2011 he <italic>did</italic> lead work to define a new mission for the organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-2233865913490938">39</xref></sup> Unable to agree on a shared positive political value (such as NATO’s liberal democracy), the working group simply recommended that “stability” should guide the continued development of the CSTO.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-2233865913490938">40</xref></sup> This recommendation reflects a Russian government preference for a more active and assertive role for the alliance in the handling of possible unrest in Central Asia in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-2233865913490938">41</xref></sup> Fearful of a democratization or—possibly even worse—an Islamization of the region, Moscow seems to be ready to go to great lengths to preserve the status quo.</p>
<p>This thinking has been fueled by the 2010 revolution in Kyrgyzstan, which led to the ousting of then President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Following these events then Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev suggested that it would be necessary to “make the organization more efficient in tackling current threats”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-2233865913490938">42</xref></sup> What has since followed is a legal, mental and even operational preparation designed to clear the way for the CSTO to intervene in domestic conflicts if the regime of one of the member states is facing collapse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-2233865913490938">43</xref></sup> A Brezhnev Doctrine for the twenty-first century, this may seem like an effective response to the threat of more revolutions—be they Ukrainian orange, Kyrgyz pink or Islamic green—spreading across the CSTO space, but it also carries the obvious political risk of undermining whatever legitimacy the CSTO, and in a wider sense the CIS, may have. The fight against political change may come at great costs, as the Warsaw Pact learned all too well in Czechoslovakia in 1968.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-2233865913490938">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, instability may also spring from an entirely different source, and it may bring the CSTO full circle. As the 2014 NATO drawdown from Afghanistan approaches, the CSTO members are watching nervously to see what will happen in that country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-2233865913490938">45</xref></sup> The concern is expressed at many different levels and in many different ways, but it was felt at its strongest perhaps when Putin addressed the Duma in April 2012. Responding to a highly critical comment about NATO, Putin rejected the black-and-white character of the debate, arguing that
<disp-quote>
<p>in some cases, NATO does actually play a stabilising role in world affairs … In Afghanistan, for instance, NATO operates under a United Nations mandate … We both understand what is going on in Afghanistan, isn’t that true? We both want the situation there to be under control, right? Neither of us wants our soldiers to fight on the Tajik–Afghan border. We don’t want that. But the Western community and NATO are there. God grant them good health, let them work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-2233865913490938">46</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The anti-NATO platform has served Putin well politically, and it would be naive to think that he will give that up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-2233865913490938">47</xref></sup> However, his comments indicate that a more nuanced view of NATO may be creeping into the Russian public debate as the future security environment takes on a clearer shape. The CSTO has in fact been appealing to NATO for cooperation over Afghanistan since the mid 2000s (only to see its invitations declined), and this fact may also serve to explain why earlier attempts to demonize NATO have failed to give the CSTO that strong sense of purpose and direction sought by its most ardent supporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2233865913490938">Kokeyev, 2007</xref>); clearly, so the thinking could go, if the CSTO is willing to cooperate with NATO troops on the ground to handle common security challenges, then the latter cannot be <italic>that</italic> bad. This in turn suggests that a possible re-interpretation and greater endorsement of NATO’s role may be of little consequence for the CSTO.</p>
<p>Both status quo preservation within the CSTO area and the containment of possible anarchy in Afghanistan post-2014 may be different, however. These are strategic objectives which promise to bring the member states—or at least their authoritarian regimes—closer together. However, the potential risks are high. While the former may gradually undermine the alliance from within because of public discontent, the latter may wear it down from the outside in an irregular military challenge which everyone in the CSTO capitals is wisely hoping to avoid. The future for the CSTO may therefore very likely hold either growing irrelevance or sudden fighting in complex operational settings. Neither of course is desirable.</p>

<title>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization</title>
<p>The SCO today is one of the most heavily advertised members of the family of international organizations and it attracts widespread international attention. Built on the basis of the Shanghai Five, which in turn was set up in 1996 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to help support confidence-building measures in the border areas between China and the former Soviet member states, the SCO in 2001 was established as an institutionalized expression of the achievements already made and of the ambitions found within the membership circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2233865913490938">Hansen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At the founding meeting of the SCO Uzbekistan joined the five others, bringing the total number of members to the current six. In 2004 Mongolia, completely surrounded by SCO members China and Russia, was granted observer status, and the country was later followed by Pakistan, Iran and India (all 2005), and Afghanistan (2012); at the organizational edge, Belarus and Sri Lanka (both 2009) have been admitted as dialogue partners. These two alternative statuses have been defined rather vaguely by the SCO and the differences in rights and obligations are hard to find; indeed, it seems that the main purpose has been to create symbolic categories into which could be fitted those states which either <italic>could</italic> or <italic>would</italic> not be admitted as full members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-2233865913490938">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The SCO charter identifies three main threats—or “evils”—which the organization has to combat: extremism, secessionism and terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-2233865913490938">49</xref></sup> More recently, an additional but yet unofficial “evil” has been added to this list—the trafficking of narcotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2233865913490938">Nikitina, 2009</xref>: 88). The three original “evils” not only represent the best attempt so far by the member states to identify a shared focal point for the future; they have also given the member states a set of labels that may—often quite selectively—be used to legitimize the suppression of almost any type of domestic opposition.</p>
<p>The shared focal point should be able to lift the work of the organization from the negative security integration of the Shanghai Five to the positive security integration of the SCO. Put differently, it should give the member states a shared understanding of an organizational purpose once the basic conditions for a series of “normal” or non-conflictual relationships have been established.</p>
<p>This, however, has proven difficult. The fight against the “evils” is still advertised as a central part of the foundation on which the SCO is built, but little exists beyond that. Most successful regional integration projects elsewhere have been driven by a demand for a still freer economic exchange, but the SCO has found even this first step difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2233865913490938">Mattli, 1999</xref>). The figures show, for instance, that trade among the six full members in 2011 amounted to a mere 5.6% of their total trade;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-2233865913490938">50</xref></sup> the weak economic basis of some of the member states and the relatively high complementarity among them give us important reasons for these low figures.</p>
<p>Trade also suffers, however, from a fear of especially China—of its future intentions and its superior competitiveness. We see the former issue most clearly perhaps in the energy trade, where after 16 years of cooperation an energy-starved China in 2011 still received only approximately 12.1 and 1%, respectively, of its oil and natural gas imports from Russia and Kazakhstan, the two major net energy exporters of the organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-2233865913490938">51</xref></sup> Behind this seems to lie a feeling, especially in Moscow, that by fueling China’s meteoric rise, Russia may be undermining its own long-term position in the Far East, in post-Soviet Central Asia and in the wider international system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-2233865913490938">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>While leading Russian Sinologists deny that there is a fear of China in Russia and also insist that there is no basis for it, more alarmist views are now increasingly being expressed openly in books and in the media;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-2233865913490938">53</xref></sup> these will often be of the type “I have friends in Amur Oblast and they say that the Chinese expansion into Russia is really fast in that region” or “every year 100,000 Chinese immigrate into Russia in the Far East … imagine how it will be in 5–10–15 years”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-2233865913490938">54</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, opinion polls show that a substantial part of the Russian population sees China as an emerging threat—not least because of the country’s rapid economic growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-2233865913490938">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observers have noted a painful realization among policy-makers, commentators and not least “ordinary” people that the Chinese economy is more competitive than those of the other SCO member states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2233865913490938">Lukin, 2011</xref>). According to the World Economic Forum, China has the 29th most competitive economy in the world, while Kazakhstan stands in 51st place, Russia at 67, Tajikistan at 100, Kyrgyzstan at 127 and Uzbekistan is not even listed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-2233865913490938">56</xref></sup> The largely unreformed and/or cost-inefficient economies of the three latter states would simply be put under immense pressure should intra-SCO trade be further liberalized, but even Kazakhstan and Russia, where goods “made in China” now dominate the shelves in many stores, would also be facing increasing difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2233865913490938">Rautava, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As a twist to this, there are also complaints in, for instance, Russia that China does not leave the other states any option other than to defend themselves; in the words of Alexander Lukin, a leading Russian expert on China, SCO trade could develop more easily if only “Beijing displayed a more balanced approach and a better understanding that, apart from direct economic benefits, there are also long-term benefits based not only on economic but also on political, civilizational and other interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2233865913490938">Lukin 2007</xref>). China, in other words, is encouraged to demonstrate greater economic largesse—all to give the less competitive economies more room for manouver and to strengthen the trade dimension of the SCO cooperation. While China wants the SCO to flourish as much as the other member states do, it seems unlikely that the country will be willing to subsidize the unreformed economies simply to alleviate grievances within the group.</p>
<p>What the SCO <italic>does</italic> do quite well is to provide a shield for especially the smaller and less powerful member states against Western criticism. Fast learners, several of the member states are now expert users of normative power, defined here as “the ability to define acceptable standards of behavior”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-2233865913490938">57</xref></sup> They simply insist on the equal legitimacy of their own standards, rejecting alleged Western normative dominance in the process. We find a clear example of this in the unconditional support extended to the Uzbek leadership following the May 2005 massacre in Andijon, which human rights organizations say left “hundreds of unarmed protesters dead” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2233865913490938">Human Rights Watch, 2008</xref>). Condemned by the West, Karimov surely must have been relieved to learn that his SCO colleagues consistently referred to the massacre as an “internal Uzbek matter”, and of course he was congratulated by the Chinese authorities on his handling of the pro-democracy protesters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-2233865913490938">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Labeled “the club of dictators” by critics, the SCO is an attractive organization for authoritarian rulers looking for protection against Western states and international organizations. From within the anteroom, Iran and Belarus, both of which have heavy sanctions imposed against them, have clearly indicated that they would like to be granted full membership. Both, however, have been turned down as the full members have been able to agree on one enlargement aspect only, namely, that it should be postponed. This seems to reflect not only disagreement over who should be admitted—and who should <italic>not</italic>—but also unwillingness to import into the organization additional conflict with the West. The full members first dealt with this by introducing a five-year moratorium on the acceptance of new members, and when this expired in 2011 they went on to formulate a set of demanding criteria for membership, the purpose of which clearly is to provide them with a legal reason to turn down unwanted applicant states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-2233865913490938">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to these criteria, new members should <italic>inter alia</italic> be in the Eurasian region, enjoy a full spectrum of relations with the other SCO member states and be completely free from both United Nations sanctions and conflict with third states. A quick look at the list of observer states and dialogue partners suggests that most of these may find it hard to negotiate these obstacles—and this in turn suggests that even in a medium- to long-term perspective the list of full members will remain unchanged. Seemingly anxious to avoid both an embarrassing dispute within the organization and a conflict with the West over new and controversial member states, this may be exactly what the full members have intended.</p>

<title>Conclusion and perspectives</title>
<p>Willerton, Slobodchikoff and Goertz have presented an impressive case study of CIS cooperation. Analyzing the entire complex of CIS security related treaties in the years 1992–2005, they argue that the high number of treaties (147 multilateral treaties alone) and the high level of nestedness (the inclusion in a treaty of specific references to one or more other treaties) are signs of a relatively well-developed and dense governance system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2233865913490938">Willerton et al., 2012</xref>). The security regime thus established they see as “[advancing] intergovernmental cooperation even as states’ interests clash”, and it is understood that they are guided in their analysis by assumptions about the positive effect of these treaty lock-ins for learning, socialization and incremental change among the signatory states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2233865913490938">Willerton et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Theirs is a “glass half full” perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-2233865913490938">60</xref></sup> Willerton et al. note that “all pressing security questions [were] addressed via multilateral agreements during the CIS’ first two years”, explaining that more than half of all security-related treaties signed before 2004 were prepared in the first two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2233865913490938">Willerton et al., 2012</xref>: 65). Yet, when offering a full assessment of the CIS in the 1990s, Richard Sakwa and Mark Webber make it brutally clear that “[it] has failed to integrate the Soviet successor states in any meaningful sense”, adding that “although, on paper, it has been the forum for several ambitious projects of cooperation, in reality the CIS has been gradually emptied of responsibility and has been witness to a diminishing base of collaborative initiatives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2233865913490938">Sakwa and Webber, 1999</xref>). <italic>Theirs</italic> clearly is a “glass half empty” perspective.</p>
<p>As a further illustration of the difference in perspectives, consider again the security-related treaties. While a full 147 multilateral treaties alone were introduced in just 13 years, the general level of ratification remained low and the level of implementation even lower. Ukraine, the second largest military power in the CIS, signed just over half of the entire body of these treaties and the 1992 CST, the “all-important” security document in the words of Willerton et al., and the one “nesting” treaty which most subsequent treaties make references to, was notably <italic>not</italic> among these.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-2233865913490938">61</xref></sup> As suggested in this study, the absence of Ukraine from the core of the military cooperation is one of several signs of the weakness of this latter.</p>
<p>Building on the Soviet legacy of high treaty activism, Russia has led in the formation of especially the CIS as a highly legalized organization in which member states are tied together through extensive treaty networks and complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2233865913490938">Triska, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2233865913490938">Willerton et al., 2012</xref>). However, as demonstrated through numerous examples, non-participation remains widespread as does also the lack of implementation; there is no supranationality in decision-making, no means of enforcement and no legal means of punishing defectors; more importantly perhaps, there is no shared understanding of how this organization and the space which it covers and represents should develop in the future. Against this background the treaty activism seems relatively symbolic.</p>
<p>The CIS may easily continue its existence for a few additional decades but not in its current shape; hence the earlier claim that the CIS as we have known it since 1991 is dying. It is likely that the Russian-led core of the organization will become denser through closer integration, while the outer circle of member states will see some of these disappearing altogether. This trajectory has in fact been observable since the early 1990s and it seems to have a high probability even in a long-term perspective. What <italic>could</italic> derail this development in either a pull or push fashion is a system-upsetting event; examples include the collapse of central power and the concomitant rise of anarchy in Afghanistan or the offer by the EU of a membership perspective to the European CIS member states, respectively.</p>
<p>This means that the CIS space is likely to become more fragmented. Russia has failed to keep the space together and the membership record of every single CIS state is characterized by some measure of defection from earlier agreements, by unwillingness to commit to the common project or, in the case of Georgia, by exit even. There is little reason to expect that Russia will be more successful in this respect in the future; the obvious risk is that, by lowering the costs of such anti-integration behavior, all in the hope of strengthening the CIS by giving it a more voluntary nature, Russia will open the door for the exact opposite of what is intended.</p>
<p>Growing fragmentation suggests that the CIS “alphabet soup” will be preserved. The CIS will remain the umbrella organization under which a range of other acronyms will be found. As the future group of members is likely to hold states with even more dissimilar adaptation capacities than today, some of the more successful ones may have to create exclusive fora in which to advance their specific interests, while the rest may join them in less demanding structures or perhaps even set up their own subgroups with easy entry and few formal obligations. All of this means that, while the future CIS space is likely to be reduced in size as additional member states leave, it will continue to be a complex organizational setting and a difficult challenge for Russia to handle.</p>

<p>Illustrating this dilemma, a November 2011 poll in Russia showed that, while 48% of respondents were of the opinion that ties among the former Soviet republics should be re-built on the basis of various types of integration (8% thought they should be finally ended), those polled also expressed a clear preference for Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine as Russia’s partners, while the remaining CIS members were all considered quite unattractive and poorly run; among these latter, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan were at the very bottom.

<p>The Russian population in general has a complicated and painful relationship with the rest of the former Soviet Union; Putin undoubtedly expressed the thoughts of a majority of Russians when he famously declared the collapse of the Soviet Union to be “the greatest geopolitical disaster” of the twentieth century, yet polls also show that they hesitate when asked about the positive aspects of CIS integration and that they seem willing to integrate with a few select CIS member states only; see ibid.</p>

<p>It should be added that all CIS states have in fact been part of a common currency (Ruble) zone. It lasted from January 1992 until September 1993, when it collapsed spectacularly after a prolonged struggle. The problem with this currency cooperation, so the Swedish economist Anders Åslund explains, was that “if one country issued more credits than the average, it gained a disproportionate share of the common GDP” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2233865913490938">Åslund, 2007</xref>: 113).</p>

<p>As Azerbaijan joined the CST, it became a member alongside Armenia with which it was then at war over Nagorno–Karabakh; a delicate matter even for an alliance, this situation would be very problematic for a true collective security system to handle. While the organization as a whole has wisely avoided involvement in this conflict, whenever it conducts military exercises in Armenia (most recently in September 2012), these are easily read as being directed against a possible Azerbaijani attack on the Armenian controlled enclave.</p>

<p>GUUAM is not discussed here as the forum has practically ceased to exist.

<p>A note should be offered on Uzbekistan, which actually re-joined the CSTO in 2006 only to leave again in 2012. The theory of omnibalancing seems particularly well suited to explain the inconsistent alliance behavior of Uzbekistan. Eager to preserve his own rule and to maximize his political freedom, Karimov seems to be turning to Russia for support whenever the Western criticism of his regime becomes too loud (as happened following the May 2005 massacre in Andijon) and to the West whenever Russia attempts to rein in its more independent CIS allies; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2233865913490938">David (1991)</xref>.</p>
