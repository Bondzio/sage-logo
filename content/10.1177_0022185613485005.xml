<abstract>
<p>Much of the discussion in the public domain about Australian industrial relations has been concentrated quite narrowly on the legislative environment in which it is occurring, partly due to the Fair Work Act Review that took place in 2012. Given that the major parties are pursuing legislative changes that favour their interests, the discussion has been quite divisive, which has diminished the quality of public debate over industrial relations. The political context has also contributed to this outcome. The articles included in this review edition provide an opportunity for discussion to expand beyond this narrow base.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185613485005" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Review of the Fair Work Act (FW Act) combined with the ongoing review of modern awards and the multiplicity of other federal and state legislative changes (McCrystal and Orchiston, this edition) has focused discussion about Australian industrial relations (IR) in the public domain quite narrowly around legislation. As each party has pressed for amendments and outcomes in line with their own interests, the debate has not always been overly edifying or constructive; indeed, one commentator described it as lacking ‘rigour, logic, fact and integrity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613485005">Bornstein, 2012</xref>). This annual review edition of the <italic>Journal of Industrial Relations</italic> provides an opportunity for more considered reflection on contemporary Australian IR. The articles focus on the actions of the influential IR parties (employer associations, unions, tribunals and legislators), the outcomes and the ongoing trends. This introductory article will first consider the discussion in the public domain about IR in Australia, including the political context in which it is occurring. It will then summarise the articles in the review edition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185613485005"><title>Public debate on industrial relations in Australia</title>
<p>Debate in the public domain about IR in Australia continued in 2012 to focus primarily on the federal regulatory environment, specifically the FW Act. Although the Act was introduced three years ago, it is still a system in transition, partly due to the lengthy transition arrangements agreed to by the government in relation to the changes in the workplace determination of wages and conditions, and partly due to the ongoing challenges to the workability of the Act via litigation and publicly aired opinion pieces, mostly by employer spokespeople, conservative politicians and commentators. The FW Act Review also focused the attention of all IR players on the Act and provided a forum for all to assert their interests both in submissions to the Review and subsequently when the Review’s report was released in August.</p>
<p>The evidence presented to the FW Act Review, together with the findings being presented by those doing workplace-based research, reveals a far greater diversity of outcomes and experience than is represented in the press releases and media. In particular, industry differences are highlighted by Sheldon and Thornthwaite in their consideration of employer concerns, by Bailey and Peetz in their analysis of union activities, as well as by Jefferson and Preston when outlining trends in employment and wages. One can simply compare the situation of two high-profile industries in Australia – the mining and care sectors – with their vastly differing financial contexts and geographies, differing workforce compositions, contrasting union strategies and very different wage outcomes, to begin to appreciate the complexity of regulating IR at a national level. This is certainly not to suggest that a federal system of regulation is inappropriate, but more a recognition of the diversity of workplace experiences occurring in Australia.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0022185613485005"><title>Political context</title>
<p>Before turning to the regulatory debates of the past 12 months, it is essential to consider the political context in which much of this recent IR discussion has been occurring. Historically, in Australia, politics has had a clear impact on IR policy, with the two main political parties being identified with differing IR philosophies. These differences have become much greater in recent decades, resulting in IR sometimes being a major point of contest in election campaigns. Since the last federal election in 2010, the Gillard-led Labor Party has been governing as a minority government with the consequence that both parties have been effectively in ongoing election mode throughout the government’s term. This has given greater impetus to opposition forces to criticise government policies and legislation as part of a general strategy to undermine the government’s credibility and bring about an early election. As Sheldon and Thornthwaite point out in their article in this edition, conservative forces have included their criticism of the FW Act in their raft of hostile commentary on the Gillard government. The federal opposition has largely side-stepped articulating a specific alternative IR policy so as to avoid being tainted with the unpopular WorkChoices regime introduced during their previous period as government.</p>
<p>Both employer associations and unions have contributed to the politicisation of the IR debates, with spokespeople for both sides expressing outrage over apparent union militancy on the one hand and excessive employer exploitation on the other. However, apart from diminishing the quality of public discussion about IR, perhaps one of the most significant impacts of politics upon Australian IR in recent years has been the government’s response to pressure from employers, one of compromise, by imposing a lengthy delay on the implementation of the changes. The introduction of the FW Act was accompanied by such lengthy transition provisions that some employers have been able to continue to operate under agreements registered in the last quarter of the Workplace Relations Act and thereby avoid engaging in collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185613485005">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; Veen, 2013). Thus, although the Labor government is approaching the end of its second term in office, the implementation of the FW Act has not been complete, an aspect that has favoured those employers wanting to exclude unions from their workplaces and maintain high levels of managerial control. Similarly, the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 is accompanied by a very long phase-in period (see Charlesworth, this edition), which makes it more vulnerable should a change in government be accompanied by changes in policy. Furthermore, the decision in the equal remuneration case involving workers in the social, community and disability services industry (the SACS case) determined that the pay increases be phased in over eight years, which has raised concerns about these gains being eroded over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185613485005">Connolly et al., 2012</xref>). This strategy of moderating major change initiatives by imposing lengthy implementation periods is undoubtedly aimed at appeasing employer opposition to the reforms, but may well result in minimising the level of change actually achieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185613485005"><title>Contestation over regulation</title>
<p>Turning to the regulatory debates over the past 12 months, the FW Act combined with the ongoing review of modern awards provided a focus for much discussion of the appropriateness of Australia’s IR legislation, as noted earlier. Given that the FW Act was introduced in 2009, one might expect the regulatory environment to be more settled at this point, but there continues to be major contestation over the regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Wide differences remain between the IR players over many issues, including unfair dismissal claims, right of entry of union officials to workplaces, the content of modern awards, penalty rates, statutory individual agreements, the bargaining process and the taking of industrial action, adverse action claims, greenfield agreements, casualisation and the use of contractors. The conflict is also being played out in ongoing litigation as the parties continue to test the boundaries of the FW Act in courts and tribunals (see Catanzariti and Kane, this edition).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185613485005"><title>What might public debate on industrial relations focus on?</title>
<p>While IR legislation clearly shapes workplace outcomes and is therefore understandably of critical importance to employers and employees, the focus for public discussion would be better placed around the sustainability of our workplaces: the achievement of maximum participation in the workforce, collaborative employment relations and productive workplaces.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the distractions of the debate about the legislation, it can be seen that much of the conflict of interest is occurring around how work and employment are arranged, rather than wages. Much has been written about the evolution of employment from the full-time ongoing standard employment relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613485005">Bosch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185613485005">Standing, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185613485005">Watson et al., 2003</xref>). The utilisation of casual workers, temporary migrants, labour hire and contract workers alongside, or in place of, permanent employees with differing wages and conditions has implications for workplace culture and productivity, as well as raising concerns for employers and employees. Thus, we should not be surprised to find control over the use of these forms of employment being contested strongly. Consideration of these issues leads us inevitably to the question of what constitutes ‘good work’ (see Johansson, Abrahamsson and Johansson, this edition) or, at the very least, ‘decent work’. There has been much research, nationally and internationally, to guide such discussions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185613485005">Charlesworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613485005">Lee and McCann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613485005">Owens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613485005">Pocock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185613485005">Vosko et al., 2009</xref>), which, in turn, would provide the groundwork for policy debates based on more solid long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>Related to any discussion of decent work and long-term sustainable workplace relations is the link between IR and the family, or, more specifically, care in our society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613485005">Heron and Charlesworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185613485005">Pocock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613485005">Skinner et al., 2012</xref>). Achieving the goals of maximum workforce participation and committed employees is dependent upon quality care being available at home and/or in affordable institutions. In the workplace, job security, reasonable hours of work and flexibility are critical for primary carers, yet the public debate appears to be centred narrowly around who should be entitled to request flexible work arrangements and the process for doing so. As this edition is being finalised, the federal government has announced proposed changes to the FW Act that, when implemented, will address some aspects of the work–family situation. The legislative changes are to include: the extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements to more categories of employees; improved entitlements for pregnant employees; increased entitlements for parents taking unpaid parental leave; and the inclusion of a new duty in award and agreement model consultation clauses requiring employers to consult employees before changing rosters or working hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185613485005">Shorten, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Another area deserving of much more balanced discussion is employee voice, including the role of trade unions. The mainstream media, combined with employer association submissions and media releases, present a picture of FW Act-induced union militancy and industrial action. While there will always be examples of union militancy, as with employers, the evidence does not match the rhetoric (see Bailey and Peetz, this edition). As Palmer (this edition) points out, Australia’s IR system is still dependent upon unions to represent employees’ interests. There is little evidence of employers advocating genuine alternative mechanisms for employee voice in place of unions, yet the importance of employee voice for successful workplace relations is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185613485005">Charlwood and Terry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185613485005">Dundon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185613485005">Markey and Monat, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In late 2012, the federal government proposed the formation of a Centre for Workplace Leadership, which can be viewed as a welcome indicator of the government’s desire to move the workplace relations discussion beyond the detail of the FW Act. The minister emphasised the broader fundamental goals of increased quality of jobs, improved workplace-level productivity and leadership capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613485005">Shorten, 2012</xref>). More constructive discussion of IR in Australia will, however, require greater collaboration between the representative bodies – employer associations and unions – than appears likely in the current political context.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0022185613485005"><title>Summary of articles in this review edition</title>
<p>The majority of the articles published in this edition examine particular aspects of Australian IR during 2012. The contributors, leading scholars and practitioners, submitted their articles to the journal in late 2012. We have included a new initiative by publishing several opinion pieces from practitioners. I owe a big thank you to Elyane Palmer (now employed by Slater &amp; Gordon, formerly with United Voice) and Shelley-Anne Brace (Michael Sing lawyers) for submitting their pieces; a number of practitioners proved to be rather shy of participating in this initiative. It is hoped that these two articles might stimulate others to contact me with proposals for short pieces for next year’s review edition. Readers should note that the Brace and Palmer articles are quite intentionally opinion pieces and, as such, do not attempt to canvas the issues in the same way that might be expected of academic articles. Following on from the past few review editions, there are also two academic articles included that are based on international workplace experience: Sweden and Japan. Both countries have long fascinated employers, unions and policymakers in Australia and elsewhere. Apart from being interesting analyses in their own right, there are a number of points of relevance to contemporary Australian IR in both articles.</p>
<p>Shae McCrystal and Tashina Orchiston (University of Sydney) characterise 2012 as a ‘bumper year for industrial relations legislation’. They anticipate that this volume of legislative developments in the industrial relations sphere will continue in 2013, with a number of significant pieces of legislation anticipated. Not surprisingly, a consideration of the Review of the FW Act and subsequent amendments to the Act comprises the largest component of their article. They also outline a number of other federal legislative changes, including: revised governance obligations for registered organisations; the new employee entitlements scheme to replace the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS); the overhauled workplace gender equality laws; and industry-specific regulation concerning ‘road transport’, ‘textile, clothing and footwear outworkers’ and ‘building and construction’. McCrystal and Orchiston conclude with a summary of developments within the states, paying particular attention to legislative changes in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland relating to public sector workplace law.</p>
<p>Therese Jefferson and Alison Preston (Curtin University) review labour market and wage outcomes for the past 12 months and find that, as in 2011, there are strongly contrasting outcomes for different industries and groups of employees: varying rates of unemployment between states; more subdued rates of growth in full-time employment among males than females; and employment growth in industries such as mining and information media and telecommunications, but decline in construction. Underutilisation of labour remains at relatively high levels. Interestingly, analysis of earnings trends finds that they do not always match employment trends, with some sectors encountering decreasing employment but simultaneously enjoying earnings growth. Jefferson and Preston also note that the relativity between the minimum wage and male average earnings is at its lowest level (42%) in recent decades, providing evidence of growing earnings inequality. Finally, they consider the public discussion that has been occurring in Australia on the low levels of productivity, and conclude that there is little evidence that Australia’s productivity slump is related directly to labour market regulation.</p>
<p>Joe Catanzariti and Chris Kane (Clayton Utz) document a number of significant decisions from Fair Work Australia, the High Court and Federal Court that provided clarification on the application of the Fair Work Act. Among the cases they consider is the Barclay case relating to adverse action, and several cases that provided important illumination of good-faith bargaining requirements: the Endeavour Coal decisions of Fair Work Australia and the Federal Court, as well as the JJ Richards case focusing on the use of protected action ballot orders prior to the commencement of good-faith bargaining negotiations.</p>
<p>Catanzariti and Kane outline the resolution of the conflict that had emerged over the use of ‘opt-out’ clauses in enterprise agreements and report on the appeal considered by Fair Work Australia relating to unfair dismissal based on offensive comments on an employee’s Facebook page. Finally, they consider the Barker decision, in which the Federal Court confirmed for the first time the existence of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence in an Australian employee’s contract of employment.</p>
<p>Sara Charlesworth (Centre for Work + Life, University of South Australia) considers developments during the past year affecting women and work. A major theme in her analysis is the unanimous agreement by policymakers about the importance of increasing women’s labour force participation, yet their ‘apparent blindness to the poor quality of many of the jobs in which women are located’. As Charlesworth points out, the potential for increased workforce participation by women largely relates to mothers of dependent children, many of whom will seek part-time employment. Yet these jobs are often casualised and therefore bereft of the entitlements associated with permanent employment and lack predictability of working hours, consequently making it very difficult for such employees to balance work and family responsibilities. Apart from discussing women’s paid workforce participation, Charlesworth also looks at the operation of aspects of the FW Act in supporting gender equality, as well as overviewing developments during 2012 in the areas of pay equity, sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination, paid parental leave and the passing of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012. Having detailed many of the unresolved inequalities being encountered by women in paid work, she concludes with the more optimistic observation that the goal of gender equality is now much more apparent in Australian mainstream policy debates and legislation around women and work.</p>
<p>Peter Sheldon (University of New South Wales) and Louise Thornthwaite (Macquarie University), in their review of employers and employer association matters, identify the strong consensus among employers and their associations in their criticism of the current IR regulatory environment, particularly the FW Act: limits on employer flexibility and choice; productivity issues; the emboldening of unions; increasing labour costs; and the ‘go away money’ associated with unfair dismissals. They are critical of the negativity by many employer bodies about Australia’s IR and economy, arguing that, for some, it is part of a broader political campaign to undermine the federal Labor government’s legitimacy. Given the Reviews of the FW Act and the modern awards, much of the discussion in their article focuses on the submissions by employers and employer groups to these Reviews. They note the considerable instances of industrial militancy displayed by employers in the form of lockouts and aggressive bargaining strategies. In addition, they briefly outline employer initiatives in response to the lack of available ‘reasonably priced’ labour in the resources sector. Sheldon and Thornthwaite conclude by reminding employers of the implications of their advocacy of enterprise bargaining: bargaining, often with a union, with its associated conflicts and concessions.</p>
<p>Janis Bailey and David Peetz (Griffith University) detail the variety of issues being addressed by unions in the past 12 months. Apart from the usual bargaining over wages, the issues they identify as being prominent include working hours, job insecurity, supply chain intervention, gender-based undervaluation in the care sector, collective rights and, of course, organisation and membership. Following a brief but informative analysis of statistics on union membership and industrial disputes, Bailey and Peetz analyse by industry the principle foci of the unions. This once again illustrates how the IR concerns and strategies vary between industries. Throughout the article, the authors contrast the portrayal of unions in the mainstream media with that of ‘the real world inhabited by most unions’.</p>
<p>Bailey and Peetz outline the concerns and actions of unions in the state public sectors of NSW, Queensland and Victoria in response to what they view as challenges by the conservative governments, in those states, to long-standing systems of public sector employment relations. They maintain that these state governments are using the rationale of ‘fiscal discipline’ to minimise wage increases, remove jobs and lessen employee industrial rights. Given this, their report that 46% of the days lost in industrial disputation in 2011–2012 were in the public sector ‘collection of industries’ is unsurprising.</p>
<p>Elyane Palmer presents a perspective on the representative role of unions that is often not heard in the mainstream media. She argues that the Fair Work system is dependent upon unions to represent workers to enable fair outcomes, as individual employees rarely have the resources to engage in enterprise bargaining or, more generally, to seek equal remuneration orders or to participate in reviews. Yet, Palmer claims, the Fair Work Act does little to resource unions to perform this representative role and, in some aspects, undermines them. Her views would undoubtedly be viewed by some as controversial and should generate debate, an outcome to be encouraged.</p>
<p>Shelley-Anne Brace reflects on the Queensland public sector redundancies that occurred in 2012, including the espoused rationale, the legal challenge by the unions and the implications for workforce morale post-redundancies. She raises the question of how the decline in job security might impact on attraction and retention of employees in the Queensland public sector, particularly in a labour market environment where there is competition for skilled labour.</p>
<p>Michele Ford and Kumiko Kawashima have contributed an interesting article analysing temporary labour migration in the Japanese health and care sectors. While they detail the experience in Japan, there are numerous points of interest for those considering temporary labour migration schemes in other countries. Ford and Kawashima identify the decision to open Japan’s hospitals and residential care facilities to foreign labour as emanating from regional trade negotiations rather than workforce policy decision-making. The operation of the scheme has been shaped by the interests and lobbying of employers, unions and different elements of government, with union interests prevailing over employer demands in several key respects, including increasing incentives to attract local former care workers to return to employment in their sector. Ford and Kawashima conclude ‘that a poorly designed temporary migration scheme can create as many problems as it solves’.</p>
<p>Jan Johansson, Lena Abrahamsson and Stina Johansson (Luleå University of Technology, Sweden) present us with a useful overview, based on many years of research, of management’s introduction of lean production in Swedish industry and the unions’ ongoing response to it. The analysis of the contemporary situation is preceded by an extensive outline of the historical context, including the long tradition of cooperation between employers and Swedish unions over work organisation, the union movement’s extensive earlier policies and advocacy on ‘good work’, and the development and implementation of lean production and various management models in Sweden. The authors report that lean production is resulting in much organisational change in many companies, but that there is often a discrepancy between the rhetoric and practice, with some of the ideals missing in the implementation.</p>
<p>The authors report that the Swedish trade union movement has generally chosen to work with employers rather than resist lean production and to use that cooperation to soften its impact. They conclude that this strategy has been driven by pragmatism, as it was not possible to prevent employers’ implementation of lean production in Sweden given the wider global context diminishing labour’s power. The Swedish unions’ consideration of what constitutes ‘good work’, and later ‘sustainable work’, resonates with ongoing discussions in Australia and internationally that often struggle to gain traction in non-labour forums. Similarly, the complex challenge facing unions internationally as to whether to resist management strategies that threaten the well-being of their members or aim for a ‘small gains’ approach via cooperation is illustrated in this article.</p>
<p>In conclusion, discussion in the public domain about Australian IR has been focused rather narrowly on the legislative context as parties continue to lobby for changes to the FW Act. With a federal election to be held in 2013, the political context is likely to continue to shape public debate about IR in unhelpful ways. The articles in this edition of the <italic>Journal of Industrial Relations</italic> aim to provide more considered commentary and analysis on Australian IR over the past 12 months.</p>
