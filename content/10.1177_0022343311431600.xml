<abstract>
<p>Over the last three decades, a growing number of countries have experienced a transition from authoritarianism to democracy, and the new governments have been increasingly expected to address past human rights violations. While the academic literature on the impact of human rights prosecution is relatively well developed, the literature on the causes of such prosecution is still sparse. Why do states pursue criminal prosecutions against former state officials on the charge of human rights violations? This article answers this question by testing three key theories: the balance of power between old and new elites, transnational advocacy networks, and the diffusion theory. I conduct a cross-national study of 71 countries that were in a state of democratic transitions between 1980 and 2006, using a new dataset on domestic human rights prosecutions. I find strong evidence to support the transnational advocacy networks and diffusion explanations. First, active domestic and international human rights advocacy for individual criminal accountability is a key factor guaranteeing persistent and frequent human rights prosecutions. My study further shows that domestic advocacy plays a crucial role in criminal prosecutions of high-profile state officials while international pressure is more effective in promoting prosecutions of low-profile officials. Second, the diffusion theory is also supported since the occurrence of human rights prosecution in neighboring countries is a relevant factor. Interestingly, transitional countries are most sensitive to trials occurring in culturally or linguistically similar countries and this supports the constructivist norm diffusion theory, which focuses on the role of identity and communication in the diffusion process. However, I find that the power balance explanation, which has been the prevailing explanation, is valid only for the immediate use of human rights prosecutions.</p>

<p>Over the last three decades, an increasing number of countries have experienced the transition from authoritarianism to democracy and the new governments have been increasingly expected to address past human rights violations. To guarantee the non-repetition of human rights violations, governments have adopted a wide range of measures such as criminal prosecution, truth commissions, judicial reform, reparations, memorialization, exhumations and reburials, and the lustration of police and security forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022343311431600">Roht-Arriaza, 2002</xref>: 97).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343311431600">1</xref>
</sup> The number of states initiating criminal prosecutions against former state officials has been steadily increasing and scholars refer to this new trend as ‘the justice cascade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311431600">Lutz &amp; Sikkink, 2001</xref>) or ‘a revolution in accountability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022343311431600">Sriram, 2003</xref>). A close examination of the diffusion of human rights prosecutions throughout the world has important theoretical and policy implications since the importance of criminal prosecutions remains ‘unrivaled’ compared to other measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343311431600">Freeman, 2006</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, scholars of democratization argued that the human rights trials of former military leaders in Latin America would cause political instability and thus be less likely in the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431600">Huntington (1991</xref>: 228), for example, observed that no effective criminal prosecution and punishment occurred in most transitional countries in the 1970s and 1980s and concluded: ‘In new democratic regimes, justice comes quickly or it does not come at all.’ Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022343311431600">O’Donnell &amp; Schmitter (1986</xref>: 29) predicted that such prosecutions would become less likely as ‘the bitterness of memories attenuated with the passage of time’ in transitional societies. However, contrary to their expectations, human rights prosecutions have dramatically increased since the mid-1990s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343311431600">Lutz &amp; Reiger (2008</xref>: 12) document the prosecutions of 34 heads of state for human rights violations between 1990 and 2008. This number dramatically increases when the cases of lower-ranking officials are also considered. For example, more than a dozen prosecutions against former presidents, military and police officers, and torture experts occurred in South Korea alone after democratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343311431600">Kim, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Several factors provide the preconditions necessary for this change: the end of the Cold War and the subsequent accelerated wave of democratization, the atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the creation of ad hoc international criminal tribunals, and the accretion of human rights treaties and the development of corresponding organizations. This new trend has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism. Many scholars maintain that such prosecutions deter future violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343311431600">Mendez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022343311431600">Orentlicher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022343311431600">Roht-Arriaza, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022343311431600">Roht-Arriaza &amp; Mariezcurrena, 2006</xref>) while others believe that prosecution will not deter future violations and that in some circumstance they will lead to an increase in repression by disrupting a nascent stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343311431600">Elster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343311431600">Goldsmith &amp; Krasner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022343311431600">Snyder &amp; Vinjamuri, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, while the academic literature on the impact of human rights prosecution is relatively well developed, the literature on the causes of such prosecution is still sparse. Why do states pursue criminal prosecutions against former state officials on the charge of human rights violations? What explains the global diffusion of such prosecutions? There have been a few attempts to integrate dispersed theories from various disciplines and subdisciplines of political science, sociology, criminology, and law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343311431600">Backer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343311431600">Grodsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343311431600">Huyse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343311431600">Pion-Berlin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022343311431600">Skaar, 1999</xref>), but we still know little about them. Moreover, despite the emergence of recent examples of cross-national analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343311431600">Dancy &amp; Poe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431600">Olsen, Payne &amp; Reiter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022343311431600">Roper &amp; Barria, 2009</xref>), the field has been dominated by case studies of a single or a small number of countries. Although the details of the prosecution process can be traced closely in these case studies, the variations in the way decisions are made to adopt human rights prosecutions across different countries cannot be properly examined.</p>
<p>It is necessary to empirically test the recurring and overlapping explanations on how states decide to criminally prosecute former state officials. For this article, I have tested three key theories after surveying the existing literature in the fields of human rights, transitional justice, democratization, and international relations: the balance of power between old and new elites, transnational advocacy networks, and the diffusion theory. The validity of each theory has been attested separately in case studies of individual countries but has not yet been simultaneously tested in a cross-national study of global samples. I conducted a cross-national analysis of 71 countries that were in a state of transition from authoritarianism to democracy between 1980 and 2006, using a new dataset on human rights prosecutions that I compiled with Kathryn Sikkink and Carrie Booth Walling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343311431600">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>I find that there is strong evidence to support the transnational advocacy networks and diffusion explanations. First, active domestic and international advocacy for individual criminal accountability is a key factor guaranteeing persistent and frequent human rights prosecutions. My study further shows that domestic advocacy plays a crucial role in criminal prosecutions of high-profile state officials while international pressure is more effective in promoting prosecutions of low-profile officials. Second, the diffusion theory is also supported since the occurrence of human rights prosecutions in neighboring countries is a relevant factor. Interestingly, transitional countries are most sensitive to trials occurring in culturally or linguistically similar countries and this supports the constructivist norm diffusion theory, which focuses on the role of identity and communication in the diffusion process. However, I find that the power balance explanation, which has been the prevailing explanation, is valid only for the immediate use of human rights prosecutions. I find that the level of repression in the former authoritarian regime, the past history of political instability, and prevailing current economic conditions are also relevant.</p>
<p>In the first section, I review and discuss the various arguments in comparative politics, international relations, human rights, and the international law literature that suggest some of the structural determinants of human rights prosecutions. In the second section, I present the research design including dependent and independent variables, controls and methods, and a discussion on the sample that defines countries undergoing democratic transition. In the third section, the statistical evidence is examined using various models of event history analysis. I conclude with a summary and suggestions for future research.</p>

<title>Balance of power between old and new elites</title>
<p>Why do states hold former state officials criminally accountable for past human rights violations following democratization? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431600">Huntington (1991</xref>: 215) asserts that such prosecutions are short-lived phenomena and are only possible within a short period immediately after transition. The most important determinant then is the balance of power that exists between the old and new elites immediately after transition. Huntington further argues that the power structures of transitional countries are determined by the type of transition (transformation, transplacement, and replacement), which significantly affects cohesion among security forces. Therefore, military defeat or other dramatic breaks within the old order that lead to a <italic>replacement</italic> of the old regime, work positively towards holding those responsible accountable. In other <italic>transformations</italic> where old elites decide to adopt democracy or <italic>transplacements</italic> where old and new elites negotiate the terms of the transition, accountability is less likely.</p>
<p>The power balance theory has been widely supported since the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343311431600">Huyse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022343311431600">Nino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343311431600">Pion-Berlin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022343311431600">Skaar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022343311431600">Zalaquett, 1992</xref>). These scholars generally agree on three assumptions and conclusions. First, the decision to use human rights prosecutions is mainly a function of domestic politics and, to some extent, is exclusively a function of the decisionmaking process of the new elites. Second, the new democracies are reluctant to hold the past authoritarian regimes accountable because of their concern for stability. However, when states do, they hold trials only shortly after transition. Third, demand for truth and justice is at its peak immediately after transition but usually diminishes over time. In general, scholars share Huntington’s pessimism about the prospect of human rights prosecutions in transitional societies. This theory leads to the following hypothesis.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H1: </italic>A new government will be more likely to use human rights prosecutions if the power of old elites has been critically undermined by a ruptured transition.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, scholars started to question the power balance theory when they noticed that more and more states were willingly using criminal prosecutions; and they saw that the demand for justice and accountability grew in intensity over time. First, the power balance theory loses its validity when it comes to cases of delayed justice, where the power balance becomes a constant, unvarying factor long after transition. Second, the power balance theory, which exclusively focuses on domestic politics, tends to neglect altogether the role of international politics or broader external social relations. Third, since the power balance theory relies on the decisionmaking model of a few elites, it fails to grasp the dynamics and changes in the demand for justice from victims and activists over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022343311431600">
<title>Transnational advocacy networks</title>
<p>Since the 1990s, scholars have observed that the demand for justice and accountability from victims has become increasingly effective. This change was a puzzle because the demand from the affected population had always been present but had not always presented a politically effective advocacy for judicial accountability. In other words, the demand from victims had been a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition to explain the new tide of accountability. Scholars, therefore, started to pay attention to the increase in the number and effectiveness of domestic and international advocacy groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022343311431600">3</xref>
</sup> Some scholars find the role of individuals and civil society movements to be more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343311431600">Backer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022343311431600">Roht-Arriaza, 2002</xref>), while others stress the role of international organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343311431600">Bassiouni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343311431600">Buergenthal, 1994</xref>) in promoting trials.</p>
<p>Scholars of international relations had already discovered the important role of individuals and advocacy groups in bringing normative changes to politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343311431600">Finnemore, 1996</xref>). The transnational advocacy networks theory provides a useful analytic framework for incorporating existing explanations both at the domestic and international level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311431600">Finnemore &amp; Sikkink, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343311431600">Kaufmann &amp; Pape, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343311431600">Keck &amp; Sikkink, 1998</xref>). Advocacy networks are committed and knowledgeable actors who work on specialized issues and promote causes and principled ideas and norms, which include international and domestic NGOs, the media, and parts of regional and international intergovernmental organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343311431600">Keck &amp; Sikkink, 1998</xref>: 8–9). This theory leads to the following hypothesis.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H2:</italic> The new government will be more likely to use human rights prosecutions if transnational human rights networks, domestically and internationally, advocate for such prosecution.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022343311431600">
<title>Diffusion theory</title>
<p>Diffusion refers to the process where ‘prior adoption of a trait or practice in a population alters the probability of adoption for remaining nonadopters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022343311431600">Strang, 1991</xref>: 325). Diffusion occurs when the decision to proceed with a human rights prosecution in one country is influenced by previous choices of other countries with an authoritarian past. In earlier studies of human rights prosecutions, the contagion effect was often introduced but found insignificant due to a lack of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343311431600">Pion-Berlin, 1994</xref>: 126). However, after witnessing the dramatic increase in human rights prosecutions around the globe, increasingly more scholars are suggesting that there is a diffusion of individual accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022343311431600">Roht-Arriaza, 2002</xref>: 97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022343311431600">Sikkink &amp; Walling, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The diffusion theory is plausible in cases of human rights prosecutions because the data show a spatial and temporal clustering pattern. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022343311431600">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this pattern both in terms of democratization and human rights prosecutions. In Latin America, 13 out of 15 transitional countries have had human rights trials (87%) while only four out of 14 countries had such trials in Asia (28%). Scholars of international relations have offered diffusion explanations on similar patterns in global politics, such as the spread of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343311431600">Gleditsch &amp; Ward, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022343311431600">Starr, 1991</xref>), economic policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022343311431600">Simmons, Dobbin &amp; Garrett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022343311431600">Simmons &amp; Elkins, 2004</xref>), wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343311431600">Most &amp; Starr, 1980</xref>), and treaty ratifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022343311431600">Simmons, 2008</xref>). Scholars agree that spatio-temporal clustering occurs because geographic proximity is the key determinant of the diffusion process.</p>

</fig>
<p>Constructivists in international relations studying the spread of norms lead us to similar expectations. Norms are ‘standards of appropriate behavior for actors with a given identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311431600">Katzenstein, 1996</xref>: 5) and human rights prosecution is a new judicial model containing the norm of individual criminal accountability, stating that the perpetrators of human rights violations <italic>should be </italic>held accountable. Scholars of norm diffusion discovered that after a tipping point, norms have an independent effect through ‘a combination of pressure for conformity, desire to enhance international legitimation, and the desire of state leaders to enhance their self-esteem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311431600">Finnemore &amp; Sikkink, 1998</xref>: 895). In this process, communication and shared understanding of the norm among like-minded states are more important than simple geographic proximity. In sum, both policy and norm diffusion theories lead us to the following hypothesis.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H3:</italic> The new government will be more likely to use human rights prosecutions if other – either geographically proximate or culturally similar – states have used such prosecution.</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>To test these hypotheses, I used our new dataset on human rights prosecutions in 71 countries that became democracies (democratization) between 1980 and 2006 (Appendix 1). Democratization refers to a situation where a state changes from a repressive and closed regime such as a military, one-party, authoritarian, dictatorial, or communist regime to an open and decentralized government. Usually, the evident indicator of democratic transition is a free, fair, secret, and direct national election for major government offices, including head of state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431600">Huntington, 1991</xref>: 7). Neither all the countries in the world nor only the 33 countries with human rights prosecutions would be a proper sample. The former would lead one to include many irrelevant cases without democratization and a repressive past and the latter would exclude many important cases that did not have trials although they had a high probability of doing so. Following established practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343311431600">Mansfield &amp; Snyder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431600">Olsen, Payne &amp; Reiter, 2010</xref>), I determined transitional countries using the dataset from the Polity IV Project.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<sec id="section6-0022343311431600">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Human rights prosecution is executive and/or judicial activities before, during, and resulting from criminal procedures brought against former state officials on charges of human rights violations. By prosecuting human rights violations, I refer to processes including indictments, arrests, extraditions, detentions, and trials for violations of core human rights by state officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343311431600">5</xref></sup> Some of the prosecutions involve former heads of state and high-level officials, but there are also trials of lower-level officials including police officers and prison guards. In these cases, the core set of human rights violations (torture, summary execution, disappearances, and political imprisonment), genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity are usually addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022343311431600">6</xref></sup> Human rights cases can also be prosecuted in foreign and international courts, as in the cases of Pinochet in the UK and Milosevic at the Hague. Although much attention is given to a number of high-profile international tribunals and foreign universal jurisdiction cases, most prosecutions take place in domestic judicial systems.</p>
<p>While information is readily available on the relatively small number of international trials, the data on domestic prosecutions are decentralized and difficult to quantify. To address this problem, we have created a new database consisting of data collected from the US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. When the reports mentioned a judicial proceeding that met the above criteria, a country is coded 1 for having a human rights prosecution in a given year and 0 if not. A binary variable was created to track whether a country had a prosecution at any point after transition. However, this measure has the potential danger of masking the complex, varying realities in the ranks of the accused. Consequently, I created additional variables that measure the human rights prosecutions of high- and low-profile state officials, defined by the rank of the accused (Appendix 1). Prosecutions are high-level if the accused falls under any of the following categories: generals, admirals, ministers, presidents, and heads/directors of security and intelligence sectors. Sometimes, countries decide to have either only high-level or low-level prosecutions. At other times, prosecutions of both high- and low-profile perpetrators proceed at the same time.</p>
<p>Our data show that 33 out of 71 transitional countries have used human rights trials and 21 countries had high-level prosecutions (Appendix 1). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022343311431600">Figure 2</xref> provides a snapshot of our dependent variables. The gray dotted line shows the cumulative number of countries that underwent democratization between 1980 and 2006. We see a steady increase in the number before 1989 and a sudden rise between 1989 and 1992, reflecting the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European regimes. The solid and dashed lines show the steady increase of countries pursuing human rights prosecutions.</p>

<p>Scholars of democratization and transitional justice agree that the type of transition is the most powerful predictor of the power balance between old and new elites after transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311431600">Huntington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343311431600">Huyse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343311431600">Pion-Berlin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022343311431600">Skaar, 1999</xref>). Military defeat or other political breaks within the old order critically undermine the power of old elites and thus strengthen the power of the new. Until now, data on transitional types have not existed to allow the testing of this hypothesis. Recently, the Transitional Justice Database (TJDB) project by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431600">Olsen, Payne &amp; Reiter (2010)</xref> created a transitional type dataset. I used one of their transitional type variables, the sudden transition variable, which indicates any military or political defeat of the old elites. If the power balance hypothesis were valid, we would expect to see a significant positive effect of ruptured transition on the likelihood of human rights prosecutions.</p>
<p>In addition, scholars supporting the power balance explanation suggest that human rights prosecutions can only be possible within a brief window of time after democratization. Although their prediction is proven wrong due to the emergence of delayed justice in many transitional countries, it is probable that the power balance factor has a time-varying effect. In other words, it may not be true that countries are using human rights prosecutions only shortly after transition, but it may be true that the power balance factor only affects the immediate or relatively early use of such prosecutions. The ruptured transition variable was interacted with the duration of ‘post transitional regime’ in order to measure the time-varying effect.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022343311431600">
<title>Transnational advocacy networks</title>
<p>Two variables were used to measure the effect of transnational advocacy networks on human rights prosecutions. First, the number of domestic human rights NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343311431600">Hathaway, 2007</xref>) was used to measure the power and effectiveness of domestic advocacy for individual criminal accountability. Although it is not entirely identical, many scholars have used the number of NGOs as an indicator of their activities and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343311431600">Mosley &amp; Uno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022343311431600">Ramos, Ron &amp; Thoms, 2007</xref>). Second, the presence of a UN peacekeeping operation in the country was used to measure international pressure for accountability. The leading role of the UN in promoting human rights prosecutions has long been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343311431600">Bassiouni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022343311431600">Guest, 1995</xref>) and many international NGOs are working directly and indirectly in partnership with the UN. It is commonly agreed that the key measure of the human rights commitment of the UN is its deployment of a peacekeeping operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343311431600">Dancy &amp; Poe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022343311431600">Roper &amp; Barria, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022343311431600">
<title>Diffusion</title>
<p>Policy diffusion and norm diffusion literature, respectively, point us to two different pathways through which human rights prosecutions spread: geographic proximity and cultural similarity. If the diffusion variable measured by geographic proximity is significant, it will support the conclusions of the policy diffusion literature, and if the variable measured by cultural similarity is significant, it will support norm diffusion theory. The number of states that used human rights prosecutions within a country’s geographic and cultural neighborhood was used to measure two different pathways of the diffusion process. First, I used the UN subregional division of the world to define a state’s geographic neighbors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022343311431600">7</xref>
</sup> Second, cultural neighbors were defined by using either religion or language. Religion grasps the fundamental value system of a culture and language provides a good indicator of information flow between states.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022343311431600">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>An example will help clarify the differences between these two conceptualizations of a neighbor. Argentina is classified in the South America category of the UN subregional division. Using the geographic concept, trial experiences in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay are relevant. When the cultural concept (religion) is used, trials in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay matter, since these are Latin American states where 50% or more of the population is Catholic.</p>

<title>Controls</title>
<p>Guided by previous studies in human rights and transitional justice literature, a set of variables is included to control for all other factors that might affect the likelihood of human rights prosecutions. First, I controlled for factors facilitating human rights prosecutions. Scholars have argued that democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343311431600">Herz, 1982</xref>), democratic consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343311431600">Moravcsik, 2000</xref>), private-prosecutor provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022343311431600">Sikkink &amp; Walling, 2007</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022343311431600">9</xref>
</sup> economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431600">Olsen, Payne &amp; Reiter, 2010</xref>), and compliance to international human rights norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343311431600">Ball, 2000</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022343311431600">10</xref></sup> positively affect the state’s decision to hold human rights prosecutions. Second, I controlled for factors negatively affecting the likelihood of human rights prosecutions. Previous studies found that the past levels and durations of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022343311431600">Roper &amp; Barria, 2009</xref>), the current level of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022343311431600">Nino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343311431600">Pion-Berlin, 1994</xref>), the existence of ‘spoilers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343311431600">Acuña &amp; Smulovitz, 1997</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022343311431600">11</xref>
</sup> and the past levels of political instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311431600">Kim, 2008</xref>) obstruct human rights prosecutions. Finally, I also controlled for legal traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022343311431600">Poe, Tate &amp; Keith, 1999</xref>) and alternative transitional justice measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022343311431600">Rotberg &amp; Thompson, 2000</xref>) (Appendix 2).<sup>

<title>Models</title>
<p>I use a Cox proportional hazards model, which predicts the hazard rates <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0022343311431600">

By estimating the hazard rates, not only whether or not a state had trials, but also when, is considered since the rate is conditional on the duration. Unlike other parametric or logit models, the Cox model provides the estimates of the coefficients without making any assumption about the baseline hazard function. In addition, the Cox model shares many asymptotic properties associated with other maximum likelihood estimates and provides useful diagnostics. The functional form for the model is:

<p>For each model, the correlations among the independent variables were checked for multicollinearity and three diagnostics were used: (1) a test for proportional hazards assumption using the rescaled Schoenfeld residuals, (2) a test for an appropriate functional form of the covariates using the Martingale residuals, and (3) a test for a general model fit using the Cox-Snell residuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343311431600">Box-Steffensmeier &amp; Jones, 2004</xref>). Grambsch &amp; Therneau’s global test did not yield a significant test statistic, suggesting that there were no violations of the proportional hazards assumption.<sup>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343311431600">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343311431600">II</xref> report the effects of the independent and control variables on the use of human rights prosecutions. Model 1 is a baseline model and Model 2 considers the possible time-varying effect of the power balance factor. Models 3 and 4, respectively, test each hypothesis further in case of high- and low-level human rights prosecutions. The coefficients measure the impact of the independent and control variables on the likelihood of using human rights prosecutions. The positive (negative) coefficients imply that the likelihood of using a prosecution increases (decreases) as an independent variable increases. The results show strong support for both transnational advocacy networks and diffusion explanations while partly validating the power balance explanation. For control variables, repression in the previous regime, past levels of political instability, and economic conditions are statistically significant. In the following, I will discuss my findings regarding each hypothesis.</p>

<title>Power balance</title>
<p>The result from Model 1 shows that, contrary to the conclusions drawn from many earlier studies, the power balance between old and new elites does not affect a state’s decision to use human rights prosecutions in general. The results from Models 3 and 4 also confirm this finding and suggest that the power balance explanation is not a valid framework for explaining either high- or low-level prosecutions. Then, why has the power balance theory been so widely supported by many earlier scholars? The answer can be found in the result from Model 2, which examines the possible time-varying effect of the power balance factor. Here, both the coefficients of the power balance variable and its time interaction effect are highly significant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022343311431600">15</xref>
</sup> The positive coefficient of the power balance variable suggests that human rights prosecution is more likely if the country experienced a ruptured transition, which dissolved the old elites’ power and strengthened that of the new. More specifically, my model predicts that the chance of using prosecution is 2.4 times greater if the country had a ruptured transition, holding all other factors constant. But the negative coefficient of the time interaction effect suggests that the impact of the power balance factor dramatically diminishes as time passes after transition. According to the model, the power balance factor is statistically significant up to the fourth year of transition but loses its significance after that.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022343311431600">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This finding suggests that there is a partial truth in the power balance explanation. Huntington and others correctly observed that the power balance between old and new elites is an important determinant of human rights prosecutions occurring shortly after democratization. However, these scholars were also wrong because the power balance factor can only explain a small part of the whole story. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022343311431600">Figure 3</xref> reveals the variations in the timing of human rights prosecutions after democratization. Only 39 out of 168 cases of human rights prosecutions (23%) occurred within the first four years of democratization and this is a percentage that can be adequately explained by the power balance theory, along with other factors. Nevertheless, the power balance theory cannot explain the remaining 77% of total prosecution cases occurring beyond the fifth year of transition. In sum, my analysis shows that the power balance theory is still a valid theoretical framework for explaining the immediate and relatively early use of human rights prosecutions. However, this explanation has to be complemented with two other more powerful theories, which explain not only the early but also the late use of human rights prosecutions: transnational advocacy networks and diffusion explanations.</p>

<title>Transnational advocacy networks</title>
<p>The statistical result strongly supports the role of transnational advocacy networks in promoting individual criminal accountability in transitional countries. Across all the models, variables measuring the impact of transnational advocacy networks turn out to be highly significant<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022343311431600">17</xref>
</sup> In general, a state with strong domestic and international organizations advocating human rights and individual criminal accountability is likely to use human rights prosecutions more frequently and persistently. To be specific, the chance of using human rights prosecutions is 4.3 times greater if a country were to move from the minimum to the maximum level of domestic advocacy. In addition, international pressure also increases the chance of such prosecutions by a factor of 2.4. If combined, the chances of prosecution are 10 times greater in a country with the highest level of domestic and international advocacy compared to those with the lowest level. This empirical finding is important since it shows that in addition to the decisionmaking processes of the elite, internal and external political pressure from civil society is an indispensable determinant of human rights prosecutions. In a sense, the role of domestic and international civil society is more important than the elite decisionmaking process because the latter has a short-term effect while the former has a lasting impact. My findings, therefore, strongly support field observations regarding the critical role of civil society advocacy groups in the transitional justice process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343311431600">Hayner, 2004</xref>: 47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343311431600">Kritz, 2004</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the results from Models 3 and 4 diverge in regard to domestic and international advocacy on the use of high- and low-level human rights prosecutions. In cases of high-level prosecutions, domestic advocacy is an important determinant of such processes while international advocacy is not. Conversely, in cases of low-level prosecutions, international advocacy is a crucial factor while domestic advocacy is not. This is a rather unexpected finding of my analysis and supports two observations from previous research. First, prosecution of high-profile officials has an important implication for domestic politics and any external pressure or involvement would cause complications, side-effects, or backlashes and thus be less effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343311431600">Grodsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022343311431600">Subotic, 2009</xref>). Therefore, effective and persistent domestic advocacy, not international pressure, is the key determinant of high-level prosecutions in domestic courts. Second, as in the case of Germany after World War II or Rwanda after the 1994 genocide, international advocacy for individual criminal accountability is specifically designed in such a way so as to promote high-level prosecutions in international courts and low-level prosecutions in domestic courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311431600">Bass, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022343311431600">Sarkin, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022343311431600">
<title>Diffusion</title>
<p>Diffusion theory is also valid in explaining the use of human rights prosecutions in transitional countries. In general, a state is more likely to initiate and repeatedly use human rights prosecutions if similar prosecutions had already been used by its neighbors. Of the two different pathways offered by the diffusion process, cultural similarity, rather than simple geographic proximity, determines the global spread of human rights prosecutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022343311431600">18</xref>
</sup> My model predicts that the chances of human rights prosecutions taking place would be almost four times greater if a country were to move from the minimum to the maximum level of human rights prosecution precedents of its cultural neighbors. The result from the model using the percentage of cultural precedents yields more meaningful interpretations. My model predicts that for each additional 10% increase in a neighboring country’s human rights prosecutions, the chances of using such prosecutions in that country increase by 13%, holding all other variables constant. Thus, if two hypothetical countries were to experience democratization simultaneously in 2006, the chances of a human rights prosecution is 55% more likely in a Catholic country in Latin America (where 61% of a state’s neighbors have already had human rights prosecutions in 2006) compared to a Muslim country in Asia (where only 26% have had prosecutions).</p>
<p>Contrary to the findings from previous studies of policy diffusion, a state’s decision to use human rights prosecutions is not affected by the practice of neighbors simply defined as geographically adjacent countries. It is rather prosecution precedents in neighboring countries who share common cultural identities such as religion and language that matter. This finding has two important theoretical implications. First, my finding strongly supports the constructivists’ norm diffusion theory, which emphasizes the role of identity, shared understanding, and communication in the diffusion process. Empirically, transitional countries are sensitive to the prosecution experience in culturally similar, not geographically adjacent, neighbors. Since human rights prosecution is a judicial model containing the norm of human rights and individual criminal accountability, this partly reveals the dynamic of the norm diffusion process. My findings indicate that the diffusion of human rights norms cannot be properly explained simply by geographic proximity, which seems to explain well the diffusion process of other ideas such as economic liberalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022343311431600">Simmons &amp; Elkins, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is probable that at least two diffusion mechanisms exist and function differently depending on the content or ‘intrinsic characteristics’ of the norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311431600">Finnemore &amp; Sikkink, 1998</xref>: 906).</p>
<p>Second, this finding bolsters the argument that human rights prosecutions have a deterrent effect across borders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343311431600">Kim &amp; Sikkink (2010</xref>) find a direct deterrent effect if a country’s neighbors are pursuing human rights prosecutions, suggesting that a state, even without prosecutions of its own, may experience a similar deterrent effect of human rights prosecutions if that country has enough neighbors using such prosecutions. The diffusion of prosecutions provides another, rather indirect, mechanism of cross-border deterrence. The increase in human rights prosecutions of a country’s neighbors first increases the chances of human rights prosecutions in that country through the contagion effect, and then deters future human rights violations in that country through the direct deterrence effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022343311431600">
<title>Other determinants</title>
<p>In addition, I find that repression in a previous authoritarian regime, past levels of political instability, and economic conditions affect a state’s decision to use human rights prosecutions. Two factors are related to the previous political history of the country and one factor is related to the current level of economic development. First, countries with an unstable past political history, measured by the number of coups and coup attempts, are more likely to use human rights prosecutions after democratization. This finding is interesting because it supports Moravcsik’s (2000) argument that newly established democracies tend to lock themselves into binding human rights treaties in order to protect their fledgling democracy from domestic challengers. My findings further specify the condition under which these new democracies are more likely to commit to a stronger application of domestic and international human rights norms. If a country had frequent coups and regime reversions in the past, new elites are more likely to use human rights prosecutions to overcome their instability and to gain legitimacy and popular support. This argument is plausible because scholars believe that human rights prosecutions achieve these goals in newly democratized regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343311431600">Hayner, 2002</xref>: 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343311431600">Minow, 1998</xref>: 88).</p>
<p>Second, my findings show that human rights prosecutions are more likely in developed countries rather than in developing countries after democratization. This finding illuminates an important but often overlooked dimension of the transitional justice process: the economy. My finding is consistent with previous studies on the relationship between development and transitional justice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343311431600">Elster (2004</xref>: 213), for example, suggests that criminal prosecutions would be less likely if pressing economic concerns were to prevail and new regimes had to face hard economic constraints. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343311431600">Olsen, Payne &amp; Reiter (2010)</xref> show that the health of the economy affects a country’s transitional justice choices and more affluent countries prefer human rights prosecutions to truth commissions or amnesty laws.</p>

<sec id="section18-0022343311431600">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My findings provide the first comprehensive test for three key theories explaining the emergence and diffusion of human rights prosecutions after democratization. In sum, I found very strong evidence to support the transnational advocacy networks and diffusion explanations and a limited support for the power balance explanation on the relatively earlier use of human rights prosecutions. When combined, these three theories adequately explain both the early and late adoption of human rights prosecutions in transitional countries. The diffusion factor, by its very nature, argues relatively weakly the cases of global and regional pioneers of human rights prosecutions such as Argentina or South Korea. On the other hand, both balance of power and the transnational advocacy factors, or some combinations of the two, are strong determinants of human rights prosecutions for those early adopters. However, as time passes in transitional societies, the power balance factor becomes increasingly less relevant and the impact of transnational advocacy and peer pressure from like-minded countries become stronger. In conclusion, it is a combination of peer pressure and transnational advocacy networks that explains the delayed justice phenomenon.</p>
<p>I hope that my findings from a cross-national analysis can facilitate a meaningful dialogue among scholars of human rights and transitional justice with different methodological orientations. I found empirical evidence that the balance of power, the transnational advocacy networks, diffusion, a past history of political instability and repression, and economic development all have an effect on human rights prosecutions. Some of my findings, such as power balance and advocacy networks, are explained in depth by previous case studies and field observations. However, others – the time-varying effect of the power balance factor, the divergent effect of domestic and international advocacy on high- and low-level prosecutions, diffusion paths of shared identity rather than geographic proximity, the detailed role of past political instability, and current economic conditions – still lack plausible theories or causal arguments supported by rich and detailed case studies. Further research is needed to explore the exact causal mechanisms of these factors and determine the relative importance of each factor. I believe a convincing and comprehensive theory of the adoption and diffusion of human rights prosecutions could be established through these further collaborations.</p>
