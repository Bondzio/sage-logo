<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I was pleased to read this article in the September issue of the journal, in which quality of life and patient reported measures of function were presented for reconstruction after brachial plexus injury. This type of outcome assessment is important. I would also congratulate the authors on their effort to encourage earlier referral of patients to their specialist service.</p>
<p>I note that patients requiring secondary reconstructive procedures were excluded from the study. The number excluded for this reason is not stated. Since secondary procedures are often carried out when nerve reconstruction has not been successful, it is not clear if this exclusion has created a bias in the outcomes reported.</p>
<p>I would be grateful if the authors could clarify the grading of external rotation. Figure 1B is stated to show ‘Reasonable external rotation’, but the photograph does not demonstrate any useful external rotation. Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3 requires movement against gravity through most of the range of movement of the joint.</p>
<p>The photograph in Figure 1A is suggestive that co-contraction of finger flexors with elbow flexion is occurring after reconstruction of elbow flexion using Oberlin’s transfer. Do the authors have any observations regarding co-contraction? My experience is that some degree of co-contraction is universal, despite the patients being trained to separate movements. As consequence I favour transfer of the medial pectoral to the musculocutaneous nerve, when this is possible (Hems, 2010).</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><bold>Re: Dolan RT, Butler JS, Murphy SM, Hynes D, Cronin KJ. Health-related quality of life and functional outcomes following nerve transfers for traumatic upper brachial plexus injuries. J Hand Surg Eur. 2012, 37: 642-51.</bold></p>
<p>We welcome the reader’s comments and would like to clarify the issues raised. All complete nerve root avulsion injuries resulting in a flail limb (C5–T1 inclusive) and patients requiring secondary reconstructive procedures following nerve transfer surgery, were excluded from this study. Since complete plexus avulsion injuries have poor functional and health-related quality of life outcomes following nerve transfer surgery, these were excluded to prevent skewing of the data and to maintain a homogeneous study cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412472105">Bentolila et al., 1999</xref>). Two patients underwent secondary reconstructive procedures following delayed presentations to the national brachial plexus injury service &gt; 1 year from the initial injury. In this context, primary nerve transfer was ruled out owing to motor end plate degeneration. Both patients scored Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 1 elbow flexion pre-operatively and underwent innervated free gracilis transfers to restore elbow function. At latest follow-up, both patients achieved MRC grade 4 elbow flexion. Since these patients did not undergo primary nerve transfer, comparative assessment could not be performed without bias, so they were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>External rotation was graded using the standard MRC classification system. The patient in question achieved MRC grade 3 active external rotation at latest follow-up. We agree Figure 1B does not adequately demonstrate external rotation and was a poor choice of illustration on our part.</p>
<p>In the senior author’s experience, co-contraction of elbow and finger flexors following partial ulnar (Oberlin’s) nerve transfer occurs in the initial rehabilitation period (up to 1 year post-operatively). With time, patients acquire the ability to separate these functions with the assistance of ongoing physiotherapy. This is particularly so in younger patients. In our practice, patients have not highlighted co-contraction as a problem at longer term follow-up. While we appreciate the success of the medial pectoral nerve transfer, partial ulnar nerve (Oberlin’s) transfers and partial ulnar and partial median nerve (double Oberlin’s) transfers remain the nerve transfers of choice in our unit for reconstruction of the musculocutaneous nerve.</p>
