<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the noun definitions given by Cantonese speakers at different ages. Definitional responses on six concrete nouns from 1075 children aged 4;10 to 12;01 and 15 adults were analyzed with reference to the semantic content and the syntactic form. Results showed that conventional definitions produced by Cantonese adult speakers were realized with specific superordinates and more perceptual than functional attributes. The content was carried by a syntactic frame, “NP<sub>1</sub> <italic>is</italic> NP<sub>2</sub>”, where relative clause was not the predominant form of NP<sub>2</sub> as in the English definition forms. Core attributes signifying the defining properties increased significantly with age while non-core attributes were observed relatively evenly throughout all groups. Preschoolers tended to drop the sentential-subject (i.e., NP<sub>1</sub>) and the copula <italic>is</italic>, and produce more functional than perceptual attributes. By Primary-2 (P2) (about 7;0), the taxonomic relation was coded with the frame of “NP<sub>1</sub> <italic>is</italic> NP<sub>2</sub>”. Beginning at P4 (about 9;0), children included a superordinate but the specificity of the adult-like superordinate was not achieved even by P6 (about 11;0). In general, developmental trends accorded with the trends observed in other languages, but typological features played a role in framing the development of the syntactic form.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>During the preschool years, one of the main developmental tasks of children is to learn language. From the late preschool years onwards, language becomes an essential tool for children to develop concepts and understand the world. At the same time, children learn to translate implicit concepts into words. This latter skill becomes more noticeable during the school years, when children are required to give definitions of various concepts. The task of defining nouns demonstrates the interplay between concept and more advanced language development. This skill does not represent a psychological reality or a purely ontological phenomenon in language acquisition; rather, it is seen as a systematic, explicit strategy for structuring a child’s mental lexicon and for the acquisition of new conceptual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson, 1985</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson’s (1985</xref>, p. 194) words, “[L]earning how to define words in such a systematic fashion enables the use of language to structure unarticulated semantic space, to analyse and revise the meanings of known terms, and leads ultimately to the stipulative, or constitutive role of definition which is central to all advanced forms of theoretical enquiry”.</p>
<p>During the process of defining a word, an individual needs not only to retrieve the necessary and sufficient properties of a heard label, but also to retrieve relevant vocabulary from the lexicon and to construct an appropriate frame to convey the information. These processes, from searching for implicit representations to explicitly defining representations and finally verbally reporting, involve various kinds of linguistic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren, De Lisi, &amp; Arnold, 1981</xref>). For example, vocabulary knowledge of the superordinate terms (e.g., “fruit”), adjectives to describe the entity (e.g., “sour, and yellow in colour” to describe the entity of a “lemon”), and the appropriate syntactic frame used to convey the definitional responses are needed. Unlike casual conversations, in which speakers often speak without explicit or conscious deliberation of the content or the form, noun defining requires speakers to think about the conventional genre-specific form and the most essential content. Knowledge of different relations related to the object to be defined, including part–whole relations and inclusion, and knowledge of the salient features that can distinguish the object from other class members in the same category must all be employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0023830912440794">Bialystok &amp; Majumder, 1998</xref>). Given the involvement of this lexical knowledge, definition skills have been considered as a more valid measure in tapping one’s lexical-semantic knowledge in later years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0023830912440794">Dockrell, Messer, George, &amp; Ralli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0023830912440794">Purser, Thomas, Snoxall, Mareschal, &amp; Karmiloff-Smith, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>All the studies on word definition development reviewed below are based on Indo-European languages (e.g., US English: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren et al., 1981</xref>; Italian: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830912440794">Benelli, 1988</xref>; French-English: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0023830912440794">Davidson, Kline, &amp; Snow, 1986</xref>; Spanish: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0023830912440794">Gutierrez-Clellen &amp; DeCurtis, 1999</xref>; Spanish-English: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0023830912440794">Carlisle, Beeman, Davis, &amp; Spharim, 1999</xref>; Bulgarian-English-Russian: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0023830912440794">Charkova, 2004</xref>), and there is practically no research on definition skills development in Asian languages. This study therefore seeks to examine how Cantonese-speaking children develop the skill. The normative data will improve our knowledge of how language and culture may affect one’s defining skills.</p>

<title>2 Development of noun definition skills</title>
<p>Before children can give a precise statement about an object, they have to select the content of information to be conveyed and the way to convey the information to their listeners most efficiently. In a study on the development of noun definitions produced by preschool children and Grade 2 students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren et al. (1981)</xref> reported that the children’s productions changed from personal experience to more abstract and more conventionalized responses. The young children’s descriptions tended to adhere to certain definite referents from their experience, which is context-bound, assuming that listeners have shared background knowledge with them. This observation is consistent with their speech in daily communication, which relied heavily on contextual support from their mature interlocutors. Full decontextualization in mature definitions, which signify correct assumptions about a listener’s presupposition, has not yet been mastered by young children during early school years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0023830912440794">Litowitz, 1977</xref>). Other research on noun definition development in the disciplines of linguistics and psychology has examined the changes in developmental patterns with reference to two dimensions, <italic>content</italic> and <italic>form</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0023830912440794">Johnson &amp; Anglin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0023830912440794">Litowitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0023830912440794">Nippold, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson, 1985</xref>). <italic>Content</italic> refers to the <italic>semantic information</italic> conveyed in a definition, and <italic>form</italic> refers to the <italic>syntactic frame</italic> carrying the content.</p>
<sec id="section3-0023830912440794">
<title>2.1 Content</title>
<p>Acquisition studies on definitional content have received relatively more attention than those on form in the literature. Qualitative changes in content have been well documented during the course of language development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0023830912440794">Al-Issa (1969)</xref> asked 201 English-speaking children aged from 5 to 10 years to define 30 common nouns. Responses were classified as functional (e.g., “It’s for riding”), descriptive (e.g., “It has four legs”) and categorical (“It’s an animal”). Results revealed predominantly functional responses (72%) in the youngest group; about 21% of the responses were descriptive, and only 7% were categorical. At 10 years of age, the proportion of categorical responses increased significantly to 61%, whereas functional and descriptive responses constituted 28% and 11% of the responses respectively.</p>
<p>Subsequent studies on noun definition have shown consistent findings to those suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0023830912440794">Al-Issa (1969)</xref> and provide a more complete picture about the development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830912440794">Benelli, Arcuri, and Marchesini (1988)</xref> found that the primitive definition form occurring in their young Italian preschoolers usually consisted of a list of associated objects or exemplars as an extension of the definition (e.g., Question: “What is a plane?” Answer: “In the airport” or “A ship”). Slightly more mature forms produced by young preschoolers often referred particularly to the entity’s function no matter whether it was a tool or not. For example, “An apple is to eat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0023830912440794">Litowitz, 1977</xref>). This early inclination towards functional responses has also been observed in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830912440794">Benelli et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0023830912440794">Nelson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren et al. (1981)</xref> studied the definitional responses produced by 80 English-speaking pre-primary and primary school children and 20 adults and reported that the youngest children tended to provide functional responses, while the older children were more likely to include descriptions of external appearance or perceptual characteristics of the reference (e.g., “A plane is white in colour”). The most mature definition incorporated precise semantic content which was <italic>general</italic> enough to include all instances under the same semantic field, i.e., by including the superordinate term, yet <italic>specific</italic> enough to distinguish one word meaning from other semantically related concepts, i.e., by including specifying attributes (“A plane is a transport which has two wings and can move in the air”).</p>
<p>With special reference to the <italic>types</italic> of the superordinate produced in the definitional responses, research found that older school-age children begin to use generic terms such as “a thing” or “stuff” as the superordinate category for later elaboration of the object’s attributes before they can use a specific one (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0023830912440794">Litowitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0023830912440794">McGhee-Bidlack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830912440794">Skwarchuk &amp; Anglin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson, 1985</xref>). For example, “Apples are something to eat”. When categorical responses were analyzed as opposed to functional and extension responses, research demonstrated that older school-age children were more ready to include a superordinate term, while the proportion of functional and extension responses decreased when compared to the younger groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830912440794">Benelli et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0023830912440794">Keil &amp; Batterman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0023830912440794">McGhee-Bidlack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the research on noun definition has focused on children’s verbal production. However, some researchers have argued that the realization of a concept in a definition is blocked by children’s immature expressive language ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0023830912440794">Keil &amp; Batterman, 1984</xref>). Even though a child may possess receptive knowledge about a word meaning, he/she often fails to define the word in terms of its salient and necessary information. For example, children may define the term ‘dog’ as ‘a dog can wave its tail’, yet they can nevertheless give correct answers to simple questions related to a dog’s membership, for example: “Is a dog an animal?” Given these observations, two studies attempted to use a judgment task to tap into children’s underlying concepts by bypassing children’s expressive production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0023830912440794">Keil &amp; Batterman, 1984</xref>). Keil and Batterman presented two types of brief stories about a word to their participants, who were asked to judge which story best described a particular term. One type of story consisted of <italic>defining</italic> features while the other consisted of <italic>characteristic</italic> incidental features describing the nouns to be defined. Defining features refer to features that are necessary and sufficient to set apart the reference from other exemplars in the category, whereas the characteristic features were only associated with the referent and not absolutely necessary (i.e., incidental). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0023830912440794">Keil and Batterman (1984)</xref> noted a “characteristic-to-defining” shift in children’s definitional concepts. Younger children had an overwhelming reliance on characteristic features when accepting a definition, while the older children’s and the adults’ judgment predominantly relied on defining features. This study attested that children’s concepts became more solid and the taxonomic boundaries between exemplars of entities became more discrete since more necessary and sufficient features were deployed to differentiate one term from the others. This shift from early function-preference and incidental features to inclusion of defining features as well as specific categorical terms accorded well with the claims that word definition skills develop in two stages: (a) functional definition through age eight, when children define objects in terms of their functions or uses, and (b) logical definition at age nine and older, when children can provide some more essential characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0023830912440794">Wolman &amp; Barker, 1965</xref>). This shift is parallel to the “thematic-paradigmatic shift” observed in early conceptual and vocabulary development. Thematic relations involve co-occurrence of entities in event schemas (e.g., carrot-rabbit), while taxonomic relations involve hierarchical categorical membership (e.g., carrot-potato, vegetables). For example, in a forced-choice paradigm, where children are presented with one target object (e.g., a carrot) and two alternatives, one having a thematic relation to the target (e.g., a rabbit) and the other having a taxonomic relation to the target (e.g., a tomato), young children tend to match the target with the thematic, as opposed to the taxonomic alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0023830912440794">Denney, 1974</xref>). According to the thematic-paradigmatic shift, with age, taxonomic relations become more salient in organizing children’s conceptual and semantic networks and assisting their retrieval of vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0023830912440794">Li, McGregor, &amp; Marian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0023830912440794">Nelson, 1977</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0023830912440794">
<title>2.2 Form</title>
<p>Given its particular linguistic configuration and specific purpose in school contexts, a definition is regarded as a special discourse genre. The genre is realized as a statement of semantic equivalence in the form of “Noun phrase1 (NP<sub>1</sub>) is NP<sub>2</sub>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0023830912440794">Bierwisch &amp; Kiefer, 1969</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0023830912440794">Markowitz and Franz (1988)</xref> represented these dictionary-like definitions by a more symbolic formula “X is a Y which Z,” where X is the noun to be defined definiendum, Y is the superordinate category and Z represents the attributes of X and is conjoined by a relative clause. Based on the linguistic form and the complexity of the taxonomic relations expressed in definitions by children from ages 3 to 15, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0023830912440794">Litowitz (1977)</xref> revealed that syntactically, the form changed from semantically empty or deictic description such as “like this (+ gesture)”, to simple predicates such as “scissors are what you cut paper” and finally to the mature form: “scissors are a tool which helps you to cut paper”. The use of a copula “is/are”, encoding the taxonomic relations between the noun to be defined, the genus and the differentiae, also marks one of the milestones of noun definition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0023830912440794">Watson (1995)</xref> reported that within the NP<sub>2</sub> mentioned above, superordinates, which supported many inferences, were more often given first by older speakers. Watson explained that according to the “relevance theory” proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0023830912440794">Sperber and Wilson (1995)</xref>, an element is relevant if it elicits the highest number of inferences at the lowest costs. Children progressively produce definitions which are maximally informative to the listeners, who can use minimal effort to figure out the entity being defined.</p>
<p>In summary, the above studies highlighted the very robust developmental aspects of noun definition skills during school years. These aspects included not only the semantic content in the form of salient and conventional attributes and a specific superordinate, but also the syntactic form encoding the taxonomic relation in the form of “X is Y which Z”.</p>
<sec id="section5-0023830912440794">
<title>2.2.1 Typological features of Cantonese</title>
<p>Cross-culture and cross-linguistic research shows that basic human cognition and language systems are similar throughout the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0023830912440794">Snow, Cancinio, Gonzalez, and Shriberg (1989)</xref>, however, claimed that different language inputs and cultures could bring about different developmental patterns in word definition ability. Given the different cultures and typological features of Indo-European languages, it is expected that Cantonese speakers may realize noun definition in a different way. Firstly, Cantonese is a “pro-drop” language in which null elements or zero forms are syntactically licensed in both subject and object positions, whereas English is categorized as a “non pro-drop” language in which null subjects and null objects are not allowed under all circumstances. Zero pronouns are highly productive in the discourse context in Cantonese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0023830912440794">Wong, 1990</xref>). When a full NP or a pronoun is used for a referent, and if there are adequate contextual cues from the physical situation or strong coreference with previous conversation, it is usually replaced by a zero pronoun as illustrated in Example [1] in which the answer is in the form of a subject-less reply.</p>
<graphic id="img1-0023830912440794" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0023830912440794-img1.tif"/>
<p>Along with the pro-drop feature, Cantonese is characterized by the property of “topic-chaining”. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0023830912440794">Huang (1984)</xref>, languages can be classified as being either “discourse-oriented” or “sentence-oriented”. Cantonese belongs to the former, in which the process of “topic-chaining” is a common way to conjoin clauses to give a syntactically more compact discourse. “Topic-chaining” refers to the process in which a discourse topic is first established and then elaborated by one or more clauses serving as comments about the topic with or without a linking verb. Each of the subsequent clauses contains null arguments, which refer back to the discourse topic. The topic, which always takes up the sentence-initial position, plays a role in the interpretation of the rest of the clauses in the sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0023830912440794">Li &amp; Thompson, 1981</xref>). It usually contributes to the provision of information for the identification of the subsequently mentioned referent, as in Example [2]:</p>
<graphic id="img2-0023830912440794" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0023830912440794-img2.tif"/>
<p>The NP “these books” in [2] (a) is the topic, which is maintained for four subsequent utterances with the use of zero forms in the subject position (c and d) or the object position (b and e). The examples show that zero forms can be used in any syntactic slot as long as coreferentiality can be established with an antecedent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0023830912440794">Li &amp; Thompson, 1981</xref>). With these language features, it is possible that the definitional structure “X is a Y which Z” may be realized as “0 is Y which Z” where the subject NP (X) is dropped by the Cantonese speakers. The speakers may drop not only the subject NP, but also the copula “is” when defining a word as the coreference is clear in the question asked by an investigator, and just provide the superordinate and specifying clauses as a comment. It is not an elegant definition, but it is not a syntactically incorrect structure since the missing elements can be filled in, giving rise to the complete “X is Y + Z” formula.</p>
<p>Another typological feature that may be relevant to noun definition is the pre-nominal nature of relative clauses in Cantonese. Relative clauses in Cantonese are constructed by nominalization of a predicative phrase, which appears in the <italic>pre-nominal</italic> position. In Example [3], the head noun ‘the cat’ /mau/ is in the clause final position, and the modifying clause ‘is wearing a dress’ tsœk kwɐn position comes before the head noun.</p>
<graphic id="img3-0023830912440794" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0023830912440794-img3.tif"/>
<p>In other words, the main difference between Cantonese and English relative clauses is the order of the modifying clause and the head noun. The modifying clause in English is after the head noun, while these two components are reversed in Cantonese. Example [4] is a definition of “a pen”, from a Chinese dictionary, which is in the form of a Chinese relative clause.</p>
<graphic id="img4-0023830912440794" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0023830912440794-img4.tif"/>
<p>If Cantonese speakers use a relative clause to convey the definitional content, the formula of the definitional form would be “X is Z + Y” as in Example [4]. If Cantonese speakers maintain the “X-Y-Z” sequence, as do their English counterparts, they would choose not to embed the attributes into a relative clause, but to use separate descriptive clauses instead as in Example [5].</p>
<p>One cultural feature in Cantonese that may make a Cantonese speaker’s conceptual knowledge in definition different from his or her English counterpart’s is the way in which nouns are classified. Cantonese, like other Chinese dialects, has an elaborated array of classifiers that categorize nouns into different classes. Classifiers in Cantonese are unique to nouns and other word classes such as verbs and adjectives do not take any classifiers. Classifiers are always an obligatory grammatical element when referring to common nouns with numerals and when the common objects are definite referents (e.g., “/jɐt/ (one) /tsεk/ (classifier) /mau/ (cat)”). The classification system is not arbitrary, but is cognitively-based, reflecting inherent conceptual structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0023830912440794">Tai, 1994</xref>). It is estimated that there are over sixty classifiers in Cantonese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0023830912440794">Matthews &amp; Yip, 1994</xref>) and classifiers can be subcategorized into mensural classifiers and sortal classifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0023830912440794">Lyons, 1977</xref>). The main function of mensural classifiers is to measure nouns in terms of <italic>quantity</italic> and play a fundamental role in quantification. They are similar to the word class of quantifiers in English. This type of classifier includes container-based classifiers, e.g., “/jɐt/ (one) /tsœn/ (bottle) /tsɐu/ (wine)”, standard measurements, e.g., “/jɐt/ (one) /pɔŋ/ (pound) /tɐitsi/ (grapes)” and collective classifiers, e.g., “/jɐt/ (one) /k<sup>w</sup>ɐn/ (group) /tuŋmɐt/ (animal)”. Sortal classifiers specify the <italic>kind</italic>/<italic>quality</italic> of the referred nouns, particularly the perceived features of the nouns, e.g., flatness, length, and size. For example, classifiers like /tiu/ and /tsi/ are used to decode long objects (e.g., snakes, belts and pens), classifiers like /fai/, /tsœŋ/, /fuŋ/ are used to decode flat objects (e.g., blankets, paper, letter), while classifiers like /lɐp/ and /dim/ refer to very tiny objects (e.g., beans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0023830912440794">Tai, 1994</xref>). It is speculated that this nominal classifying system may lead to variations in one’s object conceptualization, which would be reflected in one’s definitional statements. Given that the perceptual dimension of the object is highly valued in the nominal classifier system, it is speculated that young Cantonese-speaking children’s noun definitions may be predominant with perceptual attributes which would occur more often than functional attributes. In other words, the “functional” preference may not be observed during early development of noun definition in Cantonese-speaking children.</p>

<title>2.3 The present study</title>
<p>Building on previous studies and the typological and cultural features in Cantonese, the present study examined the developmental change in noun definition skills in Cantonese-speaking school-age children. More specifically the following hypotheses and research questions were advanced concerning the mature definitional form in Cantonese. Firstly, mature definitional forms in Cantonese will include four requisites, the subject to be defined (i.e., the “X” element), a copula “is”, a specific superordinate, and specifying clauses conveying the attributes. Secondly, with the two options of definitional form (in a relative clause frame “X is Z + Y” or the “X is Y + Z” sequence as in the mature forms in Indo-European languages), this study will explore whether mature Cantonese speakers would follow the discourse-oriented style or the more detached but formal style carried in a relative clause in their noun definitions.</p>
<p>In relation to developmental trends, the following hypotheses were made. Cantonese-speaking young children may show a tendency to produce more perceptual attributes than functional attributes given the perceptual-based classifier system in Cantonese. As with the development observed in other languages, here younger Cantonese children are predicted to produce more attributes that are context-bound than older speakers. Besides, responses containing superordinate terms as well as the specificity of the superordinate term will increase with age. Finally, given the special genre of definition, children’s awareness about the conventional definitional form will improve across age. In this way, the inclusion of the subject NP and the copula in the responses will also increase with age.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0023830912440794" sec-type="methods">
<title>3 Method</title>
<p>The data reported here were drawn from a large-scale project of later language development in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0023830912440794">T’sou et al., 2006</xref>), which aimed to develop a standardized language assessment battery in Hong Kong. The noun definition part is one of the six language subtests in the battery. In a previous study, where we reported children’s performance in the Narrative Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0023830912440794">To, Stokes, Cheung, &amp; T’sou, 2010</xref>), there was a detailed description of the research design and sampling of the whole study.</p>
<sec id="section8-0023830912440794">
<title>3.1 Participants</title>
<p>Child participants in the present study were 1075 typically-developing children aged between 4;10 and 12;01, who were recruited from primary schools, nurseries and kindergartens. As language develops more rapidly in preschool years, preschool children were grouped into two six-month age bands, while primary school children from 6 to 11 years of age were divided into six one-year age bands. Approximately equal numbers of boys and girls were included. Children with suspected speech-language impairment or history of this as reviewed in a parent questionnaire were excluded. Participant information is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0023830912440794">Table 1</xref>. In addition to the child participants, a group of adult participants, whose production represented the conventional forms, was included. Adult participants were 15 native Cantonese speakers who were recruited through word of mouth in Hong Kong. They were from a range of occupations such as undergraduates, clerks, nurses, and cleaning assistants. Their responses were used to address our first research question and aid with the scoring protocols of the children’s production.</p>

<title>3.2 Materials</title>
<p>Six common concrete nouns, with high imageability and high frequency, from the semantic domains of people, place, transport, clothes, stationery and daily objects were selected. The corresponding entities to be defined were <italic>policeman, school, plane, glove, ruler</italic> and <italic>fan</italic>. Since giving a definition requires that one possesses the corresponding concept in one’s knowledge bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0023830912440794">Locke, 1998</xref>), all the words selected were common objects which were very familiar to young Cantonese children in Hong Kong.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0023830912440794">
<title>3.3 Procedures</title>
<p>Each participant was interviewed individually by an investigator. A demonstration item was given to the participant prior to the test items. The probing question was: /kɐu/ (dog) /hɐi/ (is) /mɐtjε/ (what) /ne ka/ (particles)? “What is a dog?” The response of the demonstration item was constructed based on the responses of the adults’ productions: “A dog is an animal which can bark. It has a very good sense of smell. It can help us mind our house and be our pet”. The model answer in the demonstration item was a standard Chinese dictionary form in the form of “X is a Z + Y” (i.e., in the form of a Chinese relative clause). After the demonstration item, six test items were presented to the participants one by one. The probing question for each item was: X /hɐi/ (is) /mɐtjε/ (what) /ne ka/ (particles)? “What is a(n) X?” The participants were allowed to elaborate on what they wanted to say until they showed a sign of completion. The investigator would ask the participant once with a standard phrase, “Any other important points you want to add?” The whole testing section was audio-recorded. All verbal responses before and after the question were then transcribed verbatim for further analysis.</p>

<sec id="section11-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4 Coding</title>
<p>With reference to the above hypotheses, a coding scheme was devised to address the above hypotheses and research questions.</p>
<sec id="section12-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4.1 Superordinates</title>
<p>This dimension was coded according to the presence and quality of the superordinate term: (i) class-specific superordinates such as “a plane is transportation”, (ii) imprecise superordinates in the form of a higher or a lower level such as “a plane is a machine”, (iii) non-specific superordinates in general terms such as “thing/something”, (iv) incorrect superordinates such as “a plane is a plant”, and (v) did not include a superordinate. This would address the hypotheses concerning the adult pattern and child pattern regarding the use of superordinates in the definitions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4.2 Type of attributes</title>
<p>To investigate the hypothesis concerning the existence of “functional-attribute preference” in early Cantonese definitional forms, a dichotomous coding method was used to examine the types of attributes given as the defining property, i.e., either (i) functional or (ii) perceptual. A <italic>functional</italic> attribute refers to descriptions of the function, use or purpose of the referent (e.g., “A fan is to make us cool”), whereas a <italic>perceptual</italic> attribute refers to descriptions that are perceptually observable from the appearance of the referent (e.g., “A fan has a blade”). The numbers of each attribute were counted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4.3 “Coreness” of the attributes</title>
<p>This dimension aimed to investigate how closely children’s descriptions matched the conventional form in terms of <italic>defining</italic> semantic content. Relevant attributes were classified into two categories, core and non-core. A core attribute was operationally defined as an attribute that was mentioned by 70% or more of the adults in this study. A list of core attributes was then identified. Non-core attributes were those associated with and relevant to the reference, but were not necessary or just incidental. Both core and non-core attributes were counted.</p>
<p>For the hypotheses and the research questions related to the syntactic form of the definitions, the following measures were devised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4.4 Subject NP</title>
<p>The use of subject NP for the element “X” was coded as (i) an explicit NP, (ii) a pronoun, or (iii) a zero form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4.5 Linking verb</title>
<p>The linking verb was categorized into (i) copula /hɐi/ “is”, (ii) /jɐu/ “have”, (iii) other verbs or modal verbs, and (iv) nil.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0023830912440794">
<title>3.4.6 Relative clause</title>
<p>This measure was mainly used to determine whether adult speakers produced a relative clause frame to carry the superordinate and the specifying clauses. All responses with a subject NP, a relational copula, a superordinate term (specific, imprecise, non-specific or incorrect), and specifying clauses were further examined with reference to the syntactic frame that conjoined the noun to be defined, the superordinate and the defining properties. This structure can occur as either (i) a pre-nominal relative clause [relative clause + superordinate] (i.e., X-Z-Y) or (ii) a post-nominal modifier as predicate adjective [superordinate + descriptive clause] (i.e., X-Y-Z).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0023830912440794">
<title>3.5 Reliability</title>
<p>Point-by-point inter-rater reliability agreement was conducted with a second independent judge who re-scored five percent of the total definitional responses. Results indicated no differences in reliability across the types of the subject NP, relational verb, and use of relative clauses. The agreement levels for core, non-core attributes, perceptual and functional attributes were 98%, 90%, 94% and 92% respectively. Discrepancies mainly belonged to identification of non-core attributes. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus.</p>

<title>4 Results</title>
<p>The adult performances are presented first and serve as a reference of the mature and conventional form in Cantonese. They also address the hypotheses that mature definitional forms in Cantonese would include four requisites: the subject to be defined (i.e., the “X” element, a copula “is”, a specific superordinate, and specifying attributes), and that the predominant formal option of noun definition produced by mature Cantonese speakers would be “X is Z + Y” (i.e., using a Chinese relative clause rather than the “X is Y + Z” sequence in English). Superordinate terms were given in 90.0% of all the responses, and of the superordinates given, 86.7% belonged to specific superordinates. The taxonomic relation was signified by a copula /hɐi/ “is” in all the adults’ definitional responses. Attributes in the specifying clauses consisted of both functional and perceptual attributes, with nearly twice as many perceptual attributes occurring as functional attributes (perceptual: mean = 16.5; SD = 5.6; functional: mean = 8.5; SD = 2.4). Despite the strong coreference between the noun to be defined in the question and the reference in the participant’s response and the pro-drop property of Cantonese, 97.8% of the adults’ definitions restated the item to be defined in an explicit NP as the subject of the first sentence.</p>
<p>With reference to the predominant option of noun definitions produced by mature Cantonese speakers, it was found that the dictionary-like sequence was less frequently used than the discourse-style sequence. Of the responses containing the four important elements, 69.3% of the adult responses belonged to a [superordinate + descriptive clauses] (i.e., X-Y-Z) sequence, and the remaining 30.6% belonged to a [relative clause + superordinate] (i.e., X-Z-Y) sequence. Example [6] illustrates a response from an adult when defining the word “plane”.</p>
<graphic id="img5-0023830912440794" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0023830912440794-img5.tif"/>
<p>In summary, the content of a mature noun definition in Cantonese would include a specific superordinate and attributes which include more perceptual than functional features. In terms of the form, a noun definition in Cantonese consisted of four parts: the noun to be defined, the copula, the superordinate and the defining attributes. The noun to be defined (i.e., X) was restated with an explicit NP followed by a copula /hɐi/ “is”. The specific superordinate (i.e., Y), along with a numeral and a collective (i.e., mensural) classifier, followed the copula. Specifying clauses describing the attributes (i.e., Z) were often placed at the end. Both X-Y-Z and X-Z-Y sequences were observed with the former appearing more predominantly.</p>

<title>4.1 Developmental patterns</title>
<p>For the remaining hypotheses concerning developmental trends, the measures examined are presented first, followed by a general summary.</p>
<sec id="section21-0023830912440794">
<title>4.1.1 Superordinate</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0023830912440794">Table 2</xref> summarizes the percentages of different types of superordinates given by each group of participants. There was a significant rise in the use of a specific superordinate across age groups as confirmed by a univariate analysis of variance test (ANOVA), <italic>F</italic>(8, 1081) = 69.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = .34. Post-hoc analyses (using a Bonferroni correction) revealed that even the oldest child group at 11 years (P6) still employed a significantly smaller number of, and less specific, superordinates than the adult group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The three youngest groups were not significantly different in producing specific superordinates; neither were P1, P2 and P3, nor P4 and P5. All other groups were significantly different from each other (<italic>p</italic> values &lt; .001). The two youngest groups did not include a superordinate term in their responses nearly 90% of the time. When the K2 and K3 children included a superordinate term, it was more likely to be non-specific (2.85% and 6.03% of all their responses respectively). Across all age groups, only a very small percentage of children (&lt; 1.80%) used an incorrect superordinate (e.g., “A plane is a plant”). The use of non-specific superordinates increased from K2 to P4 and then dropped slightly afterwards, and finally disappeared in the adult group.</p>

Both tokens of perceptual and functional attributes increased significantly with age as confirmed by ANOVAs (perceptual attributes: <italic>F</italic>(8, 1081) = 28.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = .18; functional attributes: <italic>F</italic>(8, 1081) = 42.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = .24). Multiple comparisons of perceptual responses indicate that all child groups produced significantly fewer responses than the adults, while the children’s performance can be significantly differentiated into four groups, approximately K2 to K3, P1 to P2, P3 as an independent group, and the P4 to P6 as a group. Functional responses showed overlapping groupings: children from K2 to P2 performed similarly as one group, P2 and P3 also performed similarly and from P3 onwards, children performed similarly to the adult group. In order to compare the composition of the attribute (i.e., whether participants in different age groups preferred functional or perceptual features), a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine whether different grade levels differed on the Types (functional vs. perceptual) of the responses. Grade served as the between-subject variable, while the Type served as the within-subject variables with two levels. Both core and non-core attributes were included in the calculation. Significant two-way interactions between Type and Grade, <italic>F</italic>(8, 1081) = 7.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = .05, were obtained.

<title>4.1.3 “Coreness” of the attributes</title>
<p>The adult group performed relatively homogeneously, that is, their responses conformed to one another in general. The means (and SDs) for the core and non-core attributes were 15.4 (SD = 2.71) and 4.5 (SD = 3.10) respectively. The core attributes produced by one adult speaker were likely to be treated as core features by other adult speakers. A significant age effect was observed in the production of core attributes, suggesting that older groups produced more core attributes than the younger groups, <italic>F</italic>(8, 1081) = 110.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = .45. All child groups scored significantly lower on core attributes than the adult group, while the K2, K3 and P1 produced significantly fewer core attributes than the older children. Older children P6, P5 and P4 also scored higher in core attributes than children at P2 and P3. The use of non-core attributes showed a more gentle increase at the early age. A significant difference was only observed between the youngest group and P3 to P6, <italic>F</italic>(8, 1081) = 9.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = .06.</p>

<title>4.1.6 Summary</title>
<p>For a complete picture, the observations can be pulled together. When the total raw scores of the six items were plotted against grade level, the developmental patterns of linguistic structures in definitional form could be seen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0023830912440794">Figure 2</xref> shows that in their definitional responses, young children were more likely to include (core) attributes than a subject NP and a copula. In other words, young Cantonese-speaking children tended to drop the initial grammatical subject and/or the copula and only gave definitions in the form of a single predicative complement – (i) attribute (e.g., “(An aeroplane) can fly and brings people to the sky”). At the next level they would include a subject NP with the predicate used with a main verb other than a copula – (ii) NP1 + attribute (e.g., “An aeroplane can fly and brings people to the sky”). The copula “is” marked another milestone – (iii) NP1 + <italic>is</italic> + attribute (e.g., “An aeroplane is to bring people up to the sky”). Inclusion of a superordinate appeared at the next level – (iv) NP1 + <italic>is</italic> + superordinate + attribute (e.g., “An aeroplane is a transport which can bring people up to the sky”).</p>

</fig> <p>In summary, the prediction that there would be an absence of “functional preference” in early definitional form was not strongly supported in the present study. That is, early definitional forms in Cantonese were also mainly function-based, whereby most attributes were related to an entity’s function. Other hypotheses in relation to the developmental trend were generally supported: more core features were observed among older participants than among younger participants; inclusion and specificity of the superordinates increased as a function of age; and inclusion of subject NP and copula verbs in the syntactic frame of the definition also increased with age.</p>

<title>5 Discussion</title>
<p>The present study aimed to illustrate the extent to which culture and typological factors influence the content and form of noun definitions produced by children and adults. The discussion starts with the conventional forms of noun definitions in Cantonese. Then the general developmental patterns that coincide with the universal trends reported in previous studies in other languages and the language specific patterns will be discussed with reference to content and form.</p>
<p>With reference to the form, noun definitions in Cantonese have four essential elements: (1) subject NP (X), (2) a copula (“is”), (3) a specific superordinate (Y), and (4) attributes in specifying clauses (Z). This is consistent with the English form. For the syntactic frame, Cantonese speakers employed not only the sequence of “X is Y + Z”, but also the sequence of “X is Z + Y” in a relative clause. The predominant mature form produced by Cantonese adult speakers was not in the form of a relative clause. Instead, the mature speakers tended to follow a more discourse-oriented style, that is the [superordinate term + attributes in descriptive clause] X-Y-Z sequence (69.3%). As the superordinate term is the most informative part in a definitional response and is always given in an earlier part of the definition, listeners’ reference assignment of the defining object can be facilitated. The processing effort of the listeners needed in their comprehension can therefore be kept to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0023830912440794">Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0023830912440794">Watson, 1995</xref>). As described before, the relative clause in Cantonese occupies a pre-nominal position. Stating the attributes before the superordinate term in a relative clause would therefore slightly disturb the information flow in natural speech, adding an extra processing load to the listeners in figuring out what is the defining object the speaker intended to define. With this explanation, it is understandable why even though the relative clause form is coded in dictionaries, Cantonese speakers tended not to produce this form in conversation which would sound detached and impersonal. On the other hand, written definitions of nouns in Chinese dictionaries are supplied in the form of a relative clause followed by a superordinate term as in Example [4]. This literate style of definition in written form may provide an account for the non-negligible proportion of X-Z-Y sequence (30.6%) in the adult responses. Therefore, both syntactic forms can be considered as the conventional style of noun definition in Cantonese. Concerning the content of the definitional forms, the adult group in the present study represented a relatively homogeneous production of noun definitions of simple objects, sharing many common attributes among each other. Perceptual features were more predominant than functional attributes.</p>

<title>5.1.1 Function-dominancy in early definitions</title>
<p>Consistent with previous studies, the function preference was observed in early noun definitions, suggesting that functional features also serve as the salient characteristics for young children with Chinese cultural backgrounds. Even though Cantonese organizes objects in a classifying system dominant in perceptual features, such linguistic features may not be sufficient to alter the universal tendency for functions to be a fundamental element in a noun definition. This universal function-dominant pattern may suggest that there are some principles governing the way that children organize their language and concepts regardless of the languages they learn or the cultures they experience. In other words, there should be some universal “motivating” factor that makes some attributes more salient and others not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0023830912440794">Nelson, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0023830912440794">Nelson (1974)</xref> pointed out that the child’s experience with objects can be considered as the motivating factor. Children explore their environment through observing what is being done to it or what the thing could do, or by manipulating the objects. Therefore, function appears to be the most inherent characteristic of objects in the early years regardless of the languages children speak. This general cognitive process plays a more dominant role in early concept formation and vocabulary development than the linguistic features of the ambient language. It is also noteworthy that functional attributes existed in the responses in all age groups, but perceptual attributes grew more rapidly across years. This reveals that function plays a central role in structuring concepts at all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0023830912440794">Heidenheimer, 1978</xref>). When one’s knowledge about an object becomes more substantial, and there are more concepts to contrast, perceptual features will come into play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0023830912440794">Ross, Nelson, Wetstone, &amp; Tanouye, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>5.1.2 Use of core attributes</title>
<p>The measure of “coreness” of the attributes illustrates a progression from context-bound and personal definitions, to context-free and socially acceptable definitions. Although the number of participants in the adult group was small (<italic>n</italic> = 15), the attributes produced by them revealed that they were generally homogeneous. Many attributes were shared by 70% of the adults (mean = 15.4), and only a small proportion were counted as non-core (mean = 4.5) reflecting that adults’ conceptual and semantic structure of very simple objects is more or less alike. These core attributes then represented the most crucial and salient semantic correlates for a concept in the culture. As for the child groups, they dedicated their attention to producing non-core attributes, which were incidental in nature and drawn from their past personal experience. These non-core attributes increased slightly from K2 to P3 and then remained constant throughout the development. Conversely, the number of core attributes increased significantly across the age groups. The presence of both core and non-core attributes revealed similarity to the adults in the kind of attributes produced by school-age children, and even pre-primary children, when defining concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0023830912440794">Keil &amp; Batterman, 1984</xref>). The difference in their productions lay in the relative importance they assigned to core and non-core characteristics. With development, the weighting of conventional core attributes increased and ultimately outweighed that of non-core incidental attributes, which were also present among the mature speakers. Given such an observation, it is more appropriate to describe children’s production as approaching more conventionalized use, than to refer to children’s context dependence as a failure in decontextualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0023830912440794">Rommetveit, 1968</xref>).</p>

<title>5.2.1 Inclusion of superordinates</title>
<p>Akin to children speaking English and other Indo-European languages, inclusion of a specific superordinate was not always observed, even during the late school years at P6, the oldest group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830912440794">Skwarchuk &amp; Anglin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830912440794">Wehren et al., 1981</xref>). In the early school years, children’s tendency to include the superordinate was still low, and the children tended to include core attributes as the essential element in their definition responses. Not until later years were children more likely to include a superordinate and the specificity of the superordinate increased as well. However, the rate of inclusion of a categorical term (regardless of the quality) at P6 was still low (about 66% of the time). We reported in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0023830912440794">T’sou et al., 2006</xref>) that in a lexical-semantic relations test in which participants were requested to provide a superordinate term (e.g., “drinks”) for a given set of concrete nouns (e.g., “milk, juice, beer, coffee and coke”), the same group of children already demonstrated adult-like performance (i.e., providing a specific superordinate) at P4 (about 9 years old). The greater ability to give a superordinate term upon direct request lends support to the fact that the failure to include a precise superordinate in a definitional response is not entirely due to the lack of taxonomic knowledge about the references in children’s lexicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830912440794">Benelli, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0023830912440794">Snow, 1990</xref>). Instead, it is a matter of deployment. In other words, children only appreciated the importance of a superordinate term in a noun definition at this older age. Such late mastery may be explained by late development of the knowledge about the conventional usage of superordinates in a definitional form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0023830912440794">Benelli, Belacchi, Gini, &amp; Lucangeli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830912440794">Skwarchuk &amp; Anglin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0023830912440794">Snow, 1990</xref>) and more systematic lexical-semantic organization in adults’ mental lexicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0023830912440794">Anglin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0023830912440794">Nelson, 1985</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0023830912440794">
<title>5.2.2 Syntactic form</title>
<p>The initial subject NP and the copula carry limited value in terms of communication function, and are very likely to be dropped by the Cantonese speakers given the pro-drop and discourse-oriented property in Cantonese. However, the subject NP and the copula were well preserved in nearly all the Cantonese adults’ productions. This may be because the construction “NP<sub>1</sub> is NP<sub>2</sub>” was realized as a special genre or as a literate register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson, 1985</xref>). The NP in the sentence-initial position in a definitional response served the function of identifying the item to be defined and grounded the concept that would be further described later. The copula encoded the important taxonomic relation between the noun to be defined and the superordinate. Inclusion of these two structures therefore indicates whether a child is aware of the specific genre of noun definition.</p>
<p>A post-hoc observation about the syntactic forms produced by young Cantonese-speaking children is also noteworthy here: Some young children tend to provide a single predicative complement in the form of a superordinate or attributes as a definitional response without mentioning the subject and the copula. This pattern was not observed in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830912440794">Watson, 1985</xref>). Such a variance can be ascribed to the typological pro-drop and “discourse-oriented” properties of Cantonese. The deletion of the subject NP and copula is grammatically correct in Cantonese and commonly observed in casual dialogues as well as in acquisitional data. This typological feature may pose some problems for Cantonese-speaking children in mastering the formal style (syntax) of definition during the early years since there are options concerning how Cantonese speakers can express a concept. Young children may not be sensitive to the inclusion of these two structures in a definition because they simply conceive the definition task as a casual conversation. Only in the late school years, when older children are aware of the informative function of definitions and the formal requirements of these two elements, do they abandon the everyday “discourse-oriented” structure and adopt a more formal specific style (X is Y + Z). The increasing trends in inclusion of subject NP and copula show that older children are well on their way to producing formal language.</p>

<title>6 Conclusions</title>
<p>Like many other aspects of later language development, the defining skill is built on previously acquired lexical and grammatical skills. With increasing experience in school, children’s linguistic skills grow rapidly, and they learn more about the genre-specific features of a definitional form in classroom discourse. They manipulate the old resources in new ways as reflected in the gradual transition in the definitional content and form from inclusion of context-bound non-core attributes and some of the defining core attributes, to inclusion of more defining core attributes and a specific superordinate in the “NP<sub>1</sub> is NP<sub>2</sub>” frame. The commonalities observed between this study and previous studies point to the general universal cognitive skills required in the acquisition of noun definition. The early preference of functional attributes and convergence of core features in mature speakers imply that conceptualization of simple objects is very similar across languages and cultures. This study also highlights the contribution of language typology and culture during the course of language development. Cantonese-speaking children have to understand a definitional response constitutes a special genre for which the apparently redundant subject NP and copula have to be retained in the definitional form. In addition, they also need to appreciate the most conventional structure emphasized by the culture in order to achieve the mature form of noun definition.</p>
