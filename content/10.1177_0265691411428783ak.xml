<p>This book provides a masterly account of the shaping of the Swiss pension system during the twentieth century. It convincingly shows that one of the main drivers of this history was the issue of how to divide labour between social insurance bodies (or the State) and private pension provision (or private firms and insurers), and demonstrates in great detail how Swiss federal public authorities always strove to preserve the prerogatives of employers and insurers in the field of pension provision. Hence, the book focuses on the intricate nexus between public and private provision and underlines that social protection cannot be envisaged as the exclusive responsibility of public institutions, but can, and very often is, taken over by other actors, among which firms and private insurance companies play a prominent role. In Switzerland, the evolution of pay-as-you-go public pensions (the so-called AHV or old-age and survivors’ insurance) cannot be fully grasped if it is considered independently from the issue of private provision. Indeed, at all stages, the nexus between public and private tools for provision was at the core of the evolution of the Swiss pension system: the refusal of the first proposal for an AHV law in the 1930s can be accounted for by the wish to preserve private provision devices (conceived of as powerful tools for capital accumulation and personnel management) from the risk of being undermined by the emergence of an all-encompassing public system; the enthusiastic adoption of the AHV in the late 1040s is certainly the outcome of the post-war climate in favour of human rights and social protection, but it also derives from the option (favoured by Federal Councillor Walther Stampfli and endorsed – though with less enthusiasm – by left parties and trade unions) to limit AHV to paying basic cash benefits, thus leaving ample space for complementary private provision facilitated by tax exemption; finally, the inscription of the three-pillar doctrine into the Swiss federal constitution in 1972, officially presented as the unmistakable sign of the Swiss genius for partnership and welfare mixes, is also, and even in the first place, the outcome of the employers’ and insurers’ willingness to maintain their prerogatives over the private provision assets accumulated from the 1920s on. This corporate objective to limit the scope of social insurance and prevent it from taking over the occupational plans set up by private firms and insurers, was widely shared by political actors and social partners, as is also illustrated by the very late adoption of (modest) legislative provisions for regulating the management of private pension assets. Under such circumstances, private occupational plans were allowed to flourish with pensions assets reaching 150 per cent of the gross domestic product in the 2000s.</p>
<p>The book offers a powerful analysis of the intricate relationships between private interests and public actors in the Swiss context. It sheds light on the interdependencies between the public politics of social insurance (conducted in official arenas with highly visible political battles) and the more subterranean politics of private pension coverage (mostly confined to more confidential fields such as fiscal policy and financial regulation of pension assets, or more technical issues such as portability rights). The role played by the main actors in both fields is emphasized throughout the book, especially the rather ambivalent positions held by Federal Councillors and trade unions. The links between the federal administration and corporate interests is also demonstrated, as many actors such as Federal Councillors Edmund Schulthess and Walther Stampfli or Civil Servant Peter Binswanger successively represent both points of view. Business interests are presented as ‘conditional consenters towards social insurance programs’ (283), thus emphasizing that their concessions were mainly driven by the ambition to maintain their hold over the capital accumulated via occupational plans.</p>
<p>In analytical terms, the most significant contribution of the book is to show that to understand the welfare state, the analysis needs to go beyond public actors and arenas, and to take into account other forms of social protection and their potential competition with public social insurance systems. A more systemic approach to social policy is advocated: not only institutional actors or systems (as it is the case in most neo-institutionalist accounts along the line of Esping-Andersen’s analyses), but also their relationships with other providers (firms, associations, etc.) ought to be integrated into the empirical investigation.</p>
<p>One could somewhat deplore that international comparisons are not always used in the most appropriate way. While comparison with the US case clearly illuminates the evolution of the Swiss system, this is not always the case when comparison involves The Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, or the UK. But this is a really minor point, and there is no doubt that this book will be an important milestone in welfare state research. Hopefully, it will boost more encompassing empirical investigations bearing on all components of the complex nexus between the State, private companies, and associations.</p>
