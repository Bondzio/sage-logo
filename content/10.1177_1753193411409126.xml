<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of injections of dye into the first extensor compartment of the wrist using three different techniques in 150 wrists in 75 fresh cadavers. To compare injections, 50 wrists from 25 cadavers were used for each technique. After the injections, the first extensor compartment was dissected and the dispersion of dye around the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons was investigated. In 72 % of all the wrists, acrylic dye was dispersed into one compartment containing both the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons, but in 28% of the wrists there was a separate compartment for extensor pollicis brevis and dye entered only one of the compartments (14% for each compartment). For accurate injections, we think the injections should be made separately over the two tendons, to allow for the possibility of a septum within the compartment.</p>

<title>Introductıon</title>
<p>An osseofibrous tunnel, the first dorsal compartment of the wrist, contains the tendons of abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB). Constriction of the tendons in this region is known as de Quervain’s stenosing tenovaginitis or disease. The aetiology is uncertain, but the pathological process causes thickening and constriction of the tunnel and restricted thumb and wrist movements. It often presents with gradual onset of pain that may be exacerbated by grasping, thumb abduction and ulnar deviation of the wrist. The prevalance of de Quervain’s disease is not exactly known, but it is relatively common and affects women up to six times more often than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411409126">Harvey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193411409126">Weiss et al., 1994</xref>). The first choice of treatment is by nonoperative means, including rest, modification of activities, braces, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections into the first dorsal compartment. Corticosteroid injection is the most commonly used method of conservative treatment; a mixture of steroid and local anaesthetic is injected into the tunnel of the first dorsal compartment at the level of the radial styloid. Many patients experience complete relief of symptoms with a single corticosteroid injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411409126">Richie and Briner, 2003</xref>). In patients resistant to nonoperative treatment, the condition is managed by surgical release of the first extensor compartment.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the anatomy of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist is essential to understanding the pathophysiology of de Quervain’s disease. It is known that both APL and EPB tendons have different anatomical variations. These include a septum in the first dorsal compartment and the presence of multiple slips of the APL and, occasionally, of the EPB tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411409126">Bahm et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411409126">Giles, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411409126">Keon-Cohen, 1951</xref>). These anatomical variations may play a role in the underlying pathophysiology of de Quervain’s disease and may predispose to it. The patient with such a predisposition may respond poorly to corticosteroid injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411409126">Jeyapalan and Choudhary, 2009</xref>). Some techniques, such as ultrasound guided intrasynovial injection into the first extensor compartment of the wrist and injection through two points over the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons, have been described for enabling the injection to reach both tendon sheaths in the presence of a septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411409126">Jeyapalan and Choudhary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411409126">Sawaizumi et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to examine whether the injection reaches both the APL and EPB tendons in the first dorsal compartment and to identify the presence of a separate septum for the EPB, using three different injection techniques in the wrists of fresh cadavers.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The study included 150 wrists from 75 fresh cadavers (31 female and 44 male) and received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Forensic Science Institution. They were randomly assigned to three groups to compare three different injection techniques. Fifty wrists from 25 cadavers were used for each injection technique. The mean age of cases was 43 (SD 12.5, range 20–80) years, the mean height was 165 (SD 7.1, range 155–180) cm, and mean weight was 71 (SD 7.7, range 55–95) kg. A standard technique was used for injections. The wrist was flexed into ulnar deviation while the elbow was in 90° of flexion, and the forearm in neutral rotation. Both the APL and EPB tendons were palpated and marked with a surgical pen. A 25 gauge 3.8 cm needle was used to inject acrylic dye (black coloured condensed paint). For each case in the three groups, the length of the needle that had been inserted through the skin was measured after the injection of 1 cc of dye. This was done by measuring the length of needle outside the skin with a ruler and subtracting this from the total length of the needle. All injections were made by the first author.</p>
<p>
<italic>Group 1:</italic> The needle was inserted over the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons after palpating them, at an angle of 30° to the forearm distally from the radial styloid process. After subcutaneous penetration into the skin, the needle was directed almost parallel to the forearm, beneath the extensor retinaculum into the first dorsal extensor compartment to deliver the acrylic dye.</p>
<p>
<italic>Group 2:</italic> The needle was inserted over the abductor pollicis longus tendon after palpating it, on the radial side of the first extensor compartment distally from the radial styloid process. After subcutaneous penetration into the skin, the needle was directed almost parallel to the forearm, beneath the extensor retinaculum covering the abductor pollicis longus tendon to deliver the acrylic dye.</p>
<p>
<italic>Group 3:</italic> The needle was inserted over the extensor pollicis brevis tendon after palpating it, on the ulnar side of the first extensor compartment distally from the radial styloid process. After subcutaneous penetration into the skin, the needle was directed almost parallel to the forearm, beneath the extensor retinaculum covering the extensor pollicis brevis tendon to deliver the acrylic dye.</p>
<p>After the injections, a longitudinal incision was made over the first extensor compartment to see if there was any injury to the superficial radial nerve or other anatomical structures. It was also assessed whether the dye was inside or outside the compartment for all three groups. In the first group, the APL tendon sheath was incised on the radial side to visualize dispersion of the dye. The APL tendon was removed from the compartment to see if there was any septum in the compartment. In the presence of a septum, an incision was made also on the compartment covering the EPB. The same procedure was repeated in the second group. In the third group, the EPB tendon compartment was first incised on the ulnar side to visualize dispersion of the dye. Then the EPB tendon was removed from the compartment to see if there was any septum in the compartment, separating it from the APL tendon.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative variable data are given as means and standard deviations (SD) for descriptive analysis.</p>
<p>The accuracy rate of the three different injection techniques for the first dorsal compartment were compared using Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test (two-sided). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for dye dispersal percentage around both tendons was used in order to estimate a population parameter from our sample proportions. For each of the three groups, comparisons were made between the actual results (found in the study) of dye dispersal after injections and the expected result (100% placement of the injected material around both tendons) using Pearson’s chi-squared test. The actual results in all groups for the dye dispersal percentage around both tendons were compared using Fisher’s exact test. A <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.</p>

It was found that 35 wrists (70%) had no septum, and the dye was dispersed into the compartment containing both tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411409126">Figure 1</xref>). A separate septum was identified for EPB in 15 wrists (30%). The septum was unilateral in five cases, and bilateral in ten cases. Two wrists had an injury to APL, and one an injury to EPB with dye leaking into tendons.</p>

</fig>
<p>For all three injection techniques, no cadavers had injuries to the tissue in the wrists, particularly the superficial branch of the radial nerve. Dye injections into the tendons has been detailed above. The total number of septa for EPB was 42 in 150 wrists of 75 cadavers (28%); they were unilateral in ten wrists and bilateral in 32 wrists.</p>
<p>Comparison of the actual results of the three groups in terms of percentage of dye dispersion around both APL and EPB tendons did not reveal any statistically significant difference between them (Pearson’s chi-squared test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In the case of the percentage of dye dispersion into the first dorsal compartment, the 95% CI to estimate the population parameter for the first injection technique was 57–83%, for the second injection technique it was 57–82% and 62–86% for the third injection technique. These confidence intervals are presented to demonstrate the upper and lower limits of proportions for the population. In each group, there was a significant difference between the expected (100% placement of dye around both tendons) and the actual results found in the study for the percentage of dye dispersion around both tendons (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411409126">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Many anatomical variations of the first dorsal compartment have been reported and these include a separate compartment for the EPB tendon and multiple slips of the APL tendon. The role of anatomical variations of the tendons in the aetiology of de Quervain’s disease has been well accepted and some authors suggest that such variations should be considered the rule rather than the expection when the condition is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411409126">Giles, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411409126">Keon-Cohen, 1951</xref>). Some authors consider the septum as a main cause of the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411409126">Loomis, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411409126">Witt et al., 1991</xref>). In patients treated surgically for de Quervain’s disease, the incidence of a septum can reach up to 90%, which is significantly more than found in anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411409126">Visuthikosol and Chanyasawat, 1988</xref>). When there is a separate sub-compartment for the EPB tendon it may be difficult for injected medication to reach it.</p>
<p>The reported incidence of a dividing septum in the first dorsal compartment in cadaveric studies varies from 20–77.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411409126">Alemohammad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411409126">Giles, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411409126">Gonzales et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411409126">Jackson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411409126">Keon-Cohen, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411409126">Leao, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411409126">Leslie et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411409126">Mahakkanukrauh and Mahakkanukrauh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411409126">Minamikawa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411409126">Nayak et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1753193411409126">Table 3</xref>).

<p>These studies and our own results indicate the need to ensure that local steroid injections should reach both compartments. This can be accomplished by a common method in which the injection is is made directly into the first dorsal compartment. After accessing the first dorsal compartment, the needle is redirected after delivering some of the drug into one subcompartment and then the remainder is injected into the other subcompartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411409126">Mahakkanukrauh and Mahakkanukrauh, 2000</xref>). Another technique used for accurate injection is ultrasound guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411409126">Jeyapalan and Choudhary, 2009</xref>). This noninvasive technique ensures correct needle placement, avoiding intratendinous injection and allowing imaging of any septum in the first dorsal compartment. We suggest that two individual injections should be made around both the APL and EPB tendons from different points to take account of a possible septum for EPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411409126">Figure 4</xref>). We think that this modified method should improve the success rate for local steroid injection in de Quervain’s disease.</p>
