<p>Data for nationally representative samples of cohabiting couples in six developing countries show that intimate partner violence (IPV) increases the risk of self-reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for currently married women (<italic>OR</italic>s = 1.4-2.2) in all six countries, and that the strength of this relationship is not diminished by controls for proximate determinants such as husband’s self-reported STI status and men’s and women’s higher-risk behaviors. The robustness of the IPV–STI relationship suggests the need to acknowledge IPV as an STI risk factor for women on par with other recognized risk factors such as multiple sexual partners and unprotected sexual intercourse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An increasing body of research provides evidence that intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important correlate of a wide range of adverse reproductive health outcomes for women, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Although much of the evidence for the IPV–STI association pertains to the developed world and draws heavily on data from patients at STI clinics or women in shelters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212455358">Augenbraun, Wilson, &amp; Allister, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455358">Bauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455358">Wingood, DiClemente, &amp; Raj, 2000</xref>), research documenting this relationship for women in the general population of developing countries is also beginning to emerge. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212455358">Kishor and Johnson (2006)</xref> found that in the four countries studied, the likelihood of having self-reported STIs is almost twice as high among ever-married women who have experienced spousal violence than women who have not, and that this relationship is not diminished by controlling for wealth or education. Higher-risk sexual behaviors of women who experience violence, and/or of their partners who perpetrate it, are commonly provided as explanations for the positive IPV–STI association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212455358">Abrahams, Jewkes, Hoffman, &amp; Laubsher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212455358">Fonck, Els, Kidual, Ndinya-Achola, &amp; Temmerman, 2005</xref>). However, there has been little research to date validating this claim within a cross-cultural context and for married women in the general population of developing countries.</p>
<p>In light of the research gaps in understanding the pathways through which IPV may increase women’s STI risk, the objective of this article is to answer the following question for currently married women in developing country households: Is the IPV–STI relationship largely explained by the husband’s STI status and other sexual and related risk factors that can affect currently married women’s exposure to infection, or is IPV also an independent risk factor? The answer to this question is particularly critical for the design and targeting of intervention programs for the prevention of STIs including HIV. If IPV is an <italic>independent</italic> risk factor for STIs, then STI prevention programs will need to explicitly address IPV, both in terms of assistance to IPV survivors and programs to eliminate IPV, as a key design element of the intervention.</p>
<p>This article addresses the question of the IPV–STI association within a comparative framework using data from a representative sample of married or cohabiting couples in six countries with comparable data. The countries—two in the Caribbean (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); one in Asia (India); and one each in West Africa (Liberia), East Africa (Kenya), and South Africa (Zambia)—were chosen to cover a wide range of cultural contexts, marital and sexual norms, and levels of socioeconomic development to maximize the generalizability of the results. The variation in socioeconomic development across the countries is reflected in their 2006 rankings on the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Gender-related Development Index (GDI): the Dominican Republic (89, 74) ranks highest on both indices, followed at a distance by India (134, 114), Kenya (147, 121), and Haiti (149, not known); at the other end, Zambia (164, 136) and Liberia (169, 142) cluster together with the lowest rank on both indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212455358">United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Proximate Determinants of STIs for Married Women</title>
<p>By definition, in order to spread, STIs need sexual activity that involves exposure to infection. A direct measure of such exposure is information on the sexual partner’s infection status. However, the infection status of the partner is often not known. Furthermore, even if known, a partner’s current infection status may not have a one-to-one relationship with the respondent’s infection status when the respondent has more than one current sexual partner; she has a longer-standing STI that precedes the current relationship; or she is monogamous and acquired the infection from her current sexual partner who was cured, but did not or could not seek treatment for herself. For these and similar reasons, behavioral indicators that assess sexual risks need to be examined as proxies for infection exposure. Such indicators include higher-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple sexual partners, particularly nonmarital, noncohabiting partners; an early age at first sexual intercourse, since it increases the length of exposure to STIs and is a correlate of multiple sexual partners; and alcohol consumption, a correlate of higher-risk sexual behavior. A comprehensive comparative study of HIV prevalence in household populations in 19 countries by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455358">Mishra, Medley, Hong, Gu, and Robey (2009)</xref> found HIV, an STI, to be strongly associated with several higher-risk behaviors. Specifically, the likelihood of having HIV is higher in all 19 countries, the higher the number of lifetime sexual partners and, in most countries, for women and men who had sexual intercourse in the past 12 months with a nonmarital, noncohabiting partner, for those who consumed alcohol at the time of last sex, and for those, particularly women, whose sexual debut occurred before age 16.</p>
<p>Other developing country research also points to these factors playing a significant role in increasing the risk of STIs other than HIV. A study using a sample of 2,019 randomly selected women age 20 to 44 in Tanzania found that the likelihood of women having an STI (assessed from blood and urine samples) was significantly higher for women with multiple sexual partners than for women with only one partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212455358">Ghebremichael, Paintsil, &amp; Larsen, 2009</xref>). The study also found that alcohol consumption was associated with women having multiple sexual partners and, through this relationship, was positively related to having an STI. The study did not include data on the infection status of partners. A study in Mumbai, India, also found alcohol consumption by men to be positively related to men’s extramarital sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212455358">Schensul et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other risk factors that can be enablers of higher-risk behaviors and STI infections include large spousal age differences and gender-role attitudes. Large spousal age differences are likely to enhance women’s risk of STIs for at least two reasons: men entering marriage at older ages are more likely to be sexually experienced and thus could be bringing preexisting infections to the marriage; and a large age difference can reduce the ability of the much younger wife to negotiate safe sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212455358">Bruce &amp; Clark, 2004</xref>). Gender-role attitudes that promote or tolerate norms that emphasize men’s control of women are likely to negatively affect women’s ability to control their own sexual life and negotiate safe sex. A study on HIV in Cape Town, South Africa, found that large proportions of both women and men had traditional attitudes toward women’s social and gender roles and believed myths about rape, such as rape being a woman’s fault. In this study, the acceptance of rape myths and a history of sexual assault were significantly associated with a higher risk of HIV for men but not for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455358">Kalichman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</title>
<p>The key focus of this article is the other arrows in the figure: the IPV–STI link in developing countries. An increasing amount of research is documenting the positive association of IPV experience (sexual and/or physical) and STIs in developing countries for the general population of ever-married women (Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Cambodia: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212455358">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; Bangladesh: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212455358">Decker et al., 2008</xref>; Ukraine: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212455358">Dude, 2007</xref>; Goa, India: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212455358">Weiss et al., 2008</xref>; Cape Town, South Africa, IPV and a history of sexual assault: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455358">Kalichman &amp; Simbayi, 2004</xref>; among others). Despite the consistency of the IPV–STI association across many different cultural settings, the pathways through which the experience of IPV affects women’s risk of STIs are still not fully understood.</p>
<p>Clearly, one potential pathway for the IPV–STI link is through the association of IPV with the proximate determinants discussed earlier. Wives of abusive men may be at higher risk of STIs because abusive men have a greater likelihood of engaging in other higher-risk behaviors that are positively associated with STIs, such as alcohol abuse, promiscuity, and polygamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212455358">Abrahams et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212455358">Silverman, Decker, Kapur, Gupta, and Raj (2007)</xref> show that men in Bangladesh who perpetrated violence against their wives were more likely to report STIs and premarital and extramarital sexual partners. There is also consistent evidence across a large number of countries of a positive association of alcohol abuse by men with an increased risk of IPV for wives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212455358">Hindin, Kishor, &amp; Ansara, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potential pathway for the IPV–STI link is through women’s own higher-risk behaviors. Such a pathway would exist if mental health related issues stemming from the experience of IPV predisposes women to engage in such behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212455358">Fuentes, 2008</xref>), potentially as a coping mechanism, or if IPV is a consequence of such behaviors, or both. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212455358">Fonck et al. (2005)</xref>, using data for 520 women presenting at an STI clinic in Nairobi, Kenya, found more risky sexual behavior and STIs to be positively associated with partner violence, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212455358">Ghebremichael et al. (2009)</xref> found women’s own alcohol use positively associated with a history of physical and sexual violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212455358">Dude (2007)</xref>, using nationally representative data, found that women in Ukraine who had experienced IPV were more likely to have had multiple sexual partners in the past year. However, the direction of causality in most of these studies remains undetermined, in part due to the cross-sectional nature of the data used that precludes the time sequencing of IPV in relation to the behavior of interest.</p>
<p>Research documenting the likelihood of the experience of IPV being an independent risk factor for STIs among women is also beginning to emerge. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212455358">Fuentes (2008)</xref>, using U.S. data for ethnically diverse women, shows that IPV enhances the risk of STIs in a multiplicity of interlinked and overlapping ways, and these pathways include not only an enhanced risk of higher-risk sexual behaviors and substance abuse, but also psychological factors, such as depression and an inability to negotiate safe sex. Others also suggest the role of women’s disempowerment and gender inequities, especially within the context of poverty, as critical elements of the “risk environment” for STIs, including HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212455358">Krishnan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This article attempts to add to and enhance the existing literature on the IPV–STI association by using data on couples in six different countries spread across the developing world. The advantage of using couple data is that information on all key variables, including STI status, higher-risk behaviors, alcohol use, and background characteristics, are available for both members of the couple. Furthermore, because the perpetrator of any IPV is the male member of the couple, it becomes possible to examine whose behavior, attitudes, and characteristics—those of the perpetrator or the wife—mediate, if at all, the IPV–STI association. The hypotheses examined in this article are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1077801212455358" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Married women’s risk of STIs is positively associated with their experience of IPV.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> Higher-risk sexual behaviors of husbands and wives explain only part of the positive IPV–STI association.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic> Even after accounting for higher-risk behaviors of both husbands and wives, women who experience IPV are at a higher risk of STIs than women who do not, that is IPV has a net <italic>independent</italic> association with women’s risk of STIs.</p></list-item>

<title>Data, Variables, and Methodology</title>
<p>Demographic and Health Surveys’ (DHS) data for nationally representative samples of couples in six countries in the three major developing regions of the world are used to test the hypotheses discussed earlier. Specifically, the analyses are based on the matched sample of couples obtained from the DHS in the Dominican Republic (2007), Haiti (2005-2006), India (2005-2006), Kenya (2003), Liberia (2007), and Zambia (2007). The DHS program uses multistage probability sampling to obtain nationally representative samples of households. In each selected household, all women and men who stayed in the household the night before the interview and who meet the survey eligibility criteria are eligible to be interviewed. The eligibility criterion for women in all six surveys is women aged 15 to 49; the eligibility criterion for men in Liberia is men aged 15 to 49; for India and Kenya, it is men aged 15 to 54; and for the remaining countries, it is men aged 15 to 59. Although eligible women and men are interviewed separately and not all women and men who are interviewed are married to each other (or even married), the data collection methodology permits the identification of women and men who are married to each other in each sample household. Note that the definition of married couples includes both women and men who report themselves as currently married and those who are currently cohabiting with each other as if married. Accordingly, in this article the terms “husband” and “wife” include cohabiting partners.</p>
<p>The analysis of IPV data restricts the sample further in the following ways: (a) IPV questions are typically asked in a subsample of DHS households, and in this subsample, in keeping with the World Health Organization ethical guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455358">2001</xref>) on the conduct of domestic violence research, only one randomly selected eligible woman per household receives the violence module. The purpose of this subsampling within households is to maintain confidentiality and ensure respondents’ security; and (b) as an added ethical precaution, the interviewer must discontinue the interview if privacy cannot be maintained during the implementation of the violence module. Special domestic violence weights are used to make the data on violence nationally representative and to account for nonresponse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077801212455358">1</xref></sup> The resulting weighted sample sizes for matched couples range from 1,018 in Kenya and 1,039 in Haiti to 3,946 in the Dominican Republic and 28,904 in India (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212455358">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1077801212455358">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable for the analysis, women’s STI status in the 12 months preceding the survey, is based on the following combination of questions: a direct question (<italic>In the past 12 months, have you had a sexually transmitted disease (STD)</italic>?) as well as the two questions on STI symptoms (<italic>In the past 12 months have you had a genital sore or ulcer</italic>? and <italic>In the past 12 months have you had an unusual discharge from your vagina</italic>?). Women saying yes to one or more of these questions are counted as having had an STI in the past 12 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077801212455358">
<title>Key Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section8-1077801212455358">
<title>Women’s IPV status</title>
<p>IPV status is determined by asking married women the following set of questions that comprise a modified and greatly shortened Conflict Tactics Scale used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212455358">Straus (1990)</xref>. With only small variations across countries, each respondent is asked if her husband ever did each of the following: (a) Push you, shake you, or throw something at you? (b) Slap you or twist your arm? (c) Punch you with his fist or with something that could hurt you? (d) Kick you or drag you? (e) Try to strangle you or burn you? (f) Threaten you with a knife, gun, or other type of weapon? (g) Attack you with a knife, gun, or other type of weapon? (h) Physically force you to have sexual intercourse even when you did not want to? (i) Force you to perform types of other sexual acts you did not want to? Women who report experiencing one or more of these acts in the 12 months preceding the survey are counted as having experienced IPV in the past 12 months; those who report experiencing one or more of items (a) to (g) have experienced physical IPV, those experiencing one or more of the items (h) to (i) have experienced sexual IPV, and those experiencing at least one item from the first group and one from the second group have experienced both physical and sexual IPV in the past year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077801212455358">
<title>Husband’s STI status</title>
<p>The husband’s STI status is determined in the same way as the STI status of the wife described earlier. Husbands are also asked a direct question on whether they have had an STD in the past 12 months, followed by questions on genital sores or ulcers and a bad smelling, unusual discharge. If the respondent answers “yes” to one or more of these questions he is counted as having had an STI in the past 12 months.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077801212455358">
<title>Other Individual-Level Risk Factors</title>
<p>The analysis examines the relationship of women’s STI status and several other risk factors. The individual-level risk factors included are as follows:</p>
<sec id="section11-1077801212455358">
<title>Age at first sex</title>
<p>Both women and men were asked the age at which they first had sex. This information is grouped for both husband and wife as follows: less than 16 years, 16 to 17 years, and 18 years or older. Where the information on age at first sex is inconsistent or missing, the age at first marriage is used as a proxy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801212455358">
<title>Other sexual partners</title>
<p>Women and men who had sexual intercourse in the past 12 months are asked questions about their other recent sexual partners and their relationship with these partners. The variable “other sexual partners” identifies women/men who have had sexual partners in the past year who were not spouses or cohabiting partners, including (for men only) partners to whom payment was made in exchange for sex. Polygamous men who report sex with only wives are not categorized as having more than one partner since the analysis also includes a variable on husbands’ number of wives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077801212455358">
<title>Husband has other wives</title>
<p>In all countries except the Dominican Republic, men were asked how many wives/cohabiting partners they currently have; accordingly, the variable categorizes men as having one wife or more than one wife. This variable allows an assessment of whether the STI risk associated with having multiple partners varies by the type of partner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077801212455358">
<title>Alcohol consumption</title>
<p>Women were asked about their alcohol consumption in all countries, and men were asked about their alcohol consumption in all countries except Liberia and Zambia. Thus, for Liberia and Zambia, information available from women on their husbands’ alcohol consumption is used as a proxy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077801212455358">
<title>Gender-role attitudes</title>
<p>Gender-role attitudes are measured by a two-category variable based on a “yes” or “no” response to a question that asks if respondents agree that a wife is justified in refusing to have sex with her husband if she knows he has an STD.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1077801212455358">
<title>Couple-Level Risk Factors</title>
<p>Two risk factors specific to couples are also included in the analysis:</p>
<sec id="section17-1077801212455358">
<title>Number of times married</title>
<p>Information on prior marriages complements information on current sexual partners and polygamy and provides information on other sources of STI infection exposure. To fully capture and calibrate the effect of multiple marriages and minimize collinearity with other variables in the analysis, a four-category variable was created combining the information for wives and husbands: both wife and husband married more than once, only husband married more than once, only wife married more than once, and both married only once.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077801212455358">
<title>Spousal age difference</title>
<p>Spousal age difference is calculated by subtracting the wife’s age from her husband’s age and is categorized as follows: husband younger than wife; both the same age; and husband older by 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and 15 or more years.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077801212455358">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>The control variables included in the analysis are ages of wife and husband, education level of wife and husband, number of children, area of residence (urban or rural), and household wealth quintile. The household wealth quintile is based on a widely accepted wealth index constructed separately for each country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455358">Rutstein &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>) and included in the DHS data sets.</p>
<p>Two variables that could potentially have been included in the analysis are lifetime number of partners and condom use. The former is not included because the analysis already includes number of marriages and number of recent extramarital sexual partners for both husbands and wives, and number of current wives for husbands. Condom use is not included because of the potential for reverse causality in a sample of married couples since the couple could be using a condom because of existing infection.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1077801212455358" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Multivariate logistic techniques are used to explore the relationship of the wife’s self-reported STI status in the past 12 months with experience of spousal IPV in the past 12 months and husband’s self-reported STI status in the same period. Specifically the models tested were as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-1077801212455358" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Models 0A and 0B:</italic> The unadjusted association of spousal IPV in the past 12 months (Model 0A) and husbands’ STI status in the past 12 months (Model 0B) with women’s STI status in the past 12 months;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Model 1:</italic> Model 0A + women’s individual characteristics (age, education, number of children) and household characteristics (area of residence and wealth quintile);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Model 2:</italic> Model 1 + women’s higher-risk behavior variables (age at first sex, other sexual partners, alcohol consumption, and attitude toward a wife refusing her husband sex);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Model 3:</italic> Model 2 + husband’s characteristics (age and education) and couple-level higher-risk behaviors (number of times married and spousal age difference);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Model 4:</italic> Model 3 + husband’s STI status;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Model 5 (full model):</italic> Model 4 + husband’s higher-risk behavior variables (age at first sex, other sexual partners, number of wives, alcohol consumption, and attitudes toward a wife refusing her husband sex).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All models are weighted with the domestic violence weight, which accounts for nonresponse and the selection of one woman per household. The standard errors used to assess significance in the multivariate models are adjusted to take into account clustering effects of the complex sampling design.</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212455358">Table 1</xref> shows the sample characteristics for women and men in couples in each of the six countries. The percentage of currently married women who self-report an STI varies from 4% to 5% in Kenya and Zambia to 22% to 23% in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and 36% in Liberia. Self-reported STIs are lower among husbands than among wives, and range from 2% in the Dominican Republic and Kenya to 16% in Liberia. Given the sensitivity of the questions on STIs and the potential for inaccuracy in self-reports for any disease, the prevalence rates are of less interest here than the association of self-reported STI risk with explanatory variables and the consistency across countries of these relationships. Nonetheless, it is notable that self-reported STI status in the DHS is, in keeping with expectations, positively associated for both women and men with their HIV status measured with blood tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455358">Mishra et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The proportion of couples in which the husband has physically and/or sexually assaulted his wife in the 12 months preceding the survey ranges from a low of 12% in the Dominican Republic and 17% in Haiti to 36% in Liberia and 43% in Zambia. A possible biological pathway for the IPV–STI association is through sexual violence. Sexual violence, because it involves sex acts, directly exposes women to the risk of acquiring an infected partner’s STI; and because it involves force, it lowers the likelihood that a woman would be able to take any protective measures in anticipation of the violent sex act(s). The proportion of married women who experienced sexual violence in the past year ranges from a low of 3% in the Dominican Republic to 11% to 12% in Haiti and Kenya, and 15% in Zambia. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212455358">Table 1</xref> shows that women are more likely to experience physical than sexual IPV, and that in all countries except Haiti, the majority of women who experience sexual violence also experience physical violence.</p>
<p>Countries vary greatly on some but not other higher-risk factors. In all countries except India, at least one third of married women first had sex before age 16 and at least half of married men first had sex before age 18. In India, by contrast, only 26% of women had sex before age 16 and 15% of men had sex before age 18. The somewhat higher age at first sex in India is likely due in part to the fact that first sex tends to be closely associated with marriage in India and the median age at marriage for women is about 17 years and is about 23 years for men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212455358">International Institute for Population Sciences and Macro International, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Few women across all countries (0.1% in India to 6% in Liberia) report having extramarital sexual partners in the past 12 months. Men are much more likely than women to report an extramarital sexual partner in the past 12 months (from a low of 1% in India to 21% to 25% in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Liberia). In 4 of the 5 countries for which information is available, about 1 in 10 men report being polygamous.</p>
<p>Women are much less likely than their husbands to consume alcohol. Alcohol consumption among women is 12% or less in all countries except the Dominican Republic, where 70% of women consume alcohol. In contrast, 36% to 50% of men consume alcohol in all countries except the Dominican Republic, where 89% consume alcohol. The majority of women and men in all countries agree with a wife’s right to refuse her husband sex when he has an STD; however, wives are less likely than husbands to have this gender egalitarian attitude in all countries except the two Caribbean countries. In all countries except the Dominican Republic, the majority of couples are those in which neither has been married more than once. Also, women are much less likely than men to have been married more than once. The proportion of couples where both wife and husband have been married more than once ranges from only 1% to 3% in India and Kenya to 20% to 21% in the Caribbean countries. As expected, the majority of women are younger than their husbands. The proportion of women married to men at least 10 years older than them is similar in all countries (16% to 21%). Few women are either the same age or older than their husbands in India, Kenya, and Zambia; this group, however, accounts for 16% to 21% of couples in the remaining three countries.</p>
<p>In general, the sample of women is somewhat older in the two Caribbean countries than in the other countries, since ages at marriage are higher there. Educational attainment of women is particularly low in Haiti and Liberia, where only 22% and 16% of women, respectively, have any education beyond the primary level, and relatively high in the Dominican Republic, where 48% of women have at least some secondary education. Educational attainment among men is highest in India, followed by Liberia, and least in Haiti. Not surprisingly, in this sample of couples, few women have no children (5% to 9%). Thirty percent or more of women have five or more children in four of the six countries; in India and the Dominican Republic, in contrast, the proportion with five or more children is 18% and 15%, respectively. The Dominican Republic is the most urbanized of the countries, and Kenya, the least. In the remaining countries about one third of the couples are in urban areas.</p>
<p>Overall, this comparison of sample characteristics across countries shows great variation in women’s experiences and behaviors across countries. Nonetheless, what is consistent is that women in couples in all countries are likely to have enhanced vulnerability to STIs on several counts in addition to their experience of violence, their husband’s STI status, and their own high-risk behaviors. This is because wives tend to be much younger and less educated than husbands in most countries, and husbands in all countries are, on average, much more likely than wives to engage in higher-risk behaviors.</p>

<title>Analytical Results</title>
<p>A sequence of six logistic regressions was run to identify the factors that have a net effect on the likelihood of a woman reporting an STI in the 12 months preceding the survey. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212455358">Table 2</xref> shows the unadjusted odds ratios (<italic>OR</italic>) for the two key explanatory variables, spousal IPV and husband’s STI status, in the top panel, followed by the adjusted <italic>OR</italic>s in the full model (Model 5) for the key variables and higher-risk variables.

<title>Unadjusted and Adjusted Association of Women’s STI Status With IPV</title>
<p>The unadjusted association of women’s STI status with IPV is significant and positive in all countries: compared with women who have not experienced IPV, women who have experienced IPV are at least twice as likely to have an STI in all countries except Liberia where the <italic>OR</italic>, at 1.41, is lower but significant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212455358">Table 2</xref> also shows the results from Model 5 in which the <italic>OR</italic> value for each variable is an estimate of the association of the variable with women’s STI status <italic>net</italic> of all of the other variables in the model. A comparison of the <italic>OR</italic> values for IPV in Model 5 (fully adjusted) with those in Model 0A (unadjusted) shows only a slight decline in the <italic>OR</italic> values for all countries (from <italic>OR</italic> = 2.32 to 2.15 in the Dominican Republic; from <italic>OR</italic> = 2.00 to 1.83 in Haiti; from <italic>OR</italic> = 2.29 to 2.07 in India; from <italic>OR</italic> = 2.21 to 2.07 in Kenya; from <italic>OR</italic> = 1.41 to 1.36 in Liberia; and from <italic>OR</italic> = 2.59 to 2.19 in Zambia), and virtually no change in the level of significance for the IPV–STI relationship in any country except Kenya. In Kenya alone, the addition of variables capturing women’s higher-risk behaviors (see Model 2, appendix) first reduced the level of significance of the IPV–STI relationship to a marginal level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Nonetheless, the results for Model 5 show unequivocally that in all six countries, IPV has a positive and significant association with women’s likelihood of having an STI <italic>net</italic> of all other explanatory variables including women’s and men’s higher-risk behaviors and husband’s STI status.</p>

<sec id="section25-1077801212455358">
<title>Unadjusted and Adjusted Association of Women’s STI Status With Husband’s STI Status</title>
<p>The husband’s STI status has a net positive association with the wife’s STI status in only four of the six countries, namely the Dominican Republic, India, Liberia, and Zambia. The addition of husband-related variables to the equations does not change the <italic>OR</italic>s substantially (Model 4, appendix). Between Model 0B and Model 5, the <italic>OR</italic>s decline from 1.82 to 1.57 in India; from 1.65 to 1.59 in Liberia; and from 3.13 to 2.52 in Zambia, but increase in the Dominican Republic from 2.32 to 2.40. In all four countries where husband’s STI status was significant in Model 0B, it is also strongly significant in the full model. Thus, women’s and men’s own characteristics or behaviors do not explain away the positive association of women’s STI status with their husband’s STI status in four of the six countries.</p>

<sec id="section26-1077801212455358">
<title>Association of Women’s STI Status With Other Risk Factors</title>
<p>The lower panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212455358">Table 2</xref> shows that few of the other higher-risk factors are consistently associated across countries with women’s risk of STI. Furthermore, in some countries, even when significant, the associations are not in the predicted direction.</p>
<p>The variable most consistently associated with women’s risk of STI is “wife has other sex partners.” This variable, however, is unstable since few women report extramarital sexual partners in any country except Liberia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212455358">Table 1</xref>). In fact, the regression coefficients are not meaningful in Haiti and Zambia. Nonetheless, the results suggest that women who have extramarital partners have a much higher risk of having an STI than women who have no extramarital partners, <italic>net</italic> of all other explanatory factors. In contrast, “husband has other sex partners,” a somewhat more robust variable, does not have a significant association with a wife’s STI status in any country except Kenya, and there too the relationship is only marginally significant.</p>
<p>The couple variable “number of times married” bears a significant association with women’s likelihood of having an STI in half of the countries. In India, a woman’s STI risk is significantly higher only if she is part of a couple in which both husband and wife have been married more than once; in Kenya, STI risk is lower compared with other couples, only for women who are part of a couple in which neither husband nor wife has been married more than once (<italic>OR</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), and in Zambia women have lower odds of having an STI only if the wife has been married more than once (<italic>OR</italic> = 0.26). The result for Zambia is counterintuitive and needs further exploration, which is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Women’s age at first sex has the predicted negative association with women’s STI status only in Zambia (<italic>OR</italic> for age at first sex &lt;16 is 2.15 vs. 1.00 for age at first sex 18+) and the opposite association in Liberia. In Haiti, only women who first had sex at age 16 or 17 years have higher odds of having an STI (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.65) than women who had first sex earlier or later. The variable “husband has other wives” is significantly related to women’s STI status in three of the five countries for which information is available but is associated positively with women’s STI status in only one of these countries (Zambia). In India and Kenya, contrary to expectations, the odds of a woman having an STI are lower if the husband has other wives. A potential explanation for the negative association of husbands’ polygamy with a woman’s STI status could be that STIs are less likely to occur when the only other women that men are having sex with are their other wives.</p>
<p>Women’s alcohol consumption has the predicted positive and significant association with the dependent variable in only the Dominican Republic and Kenya, and husband’s drinking of alcohol significantly increases the likelihood of a woman having an STI in only Zambia. Contrary to expectations, in India, this variable is negatively associated with a wife’s risk of an STI. Only in the Dominican Republic is the likelihood of women having an STI lower if women have gender egalitarian attitudes (<italic>OR</italic> = 0.51). Men’s gender attitudes do not affect a woman’s likelihood of having an STI.</p>

<title>Types of IPV and Women’s STI Status</title>
<p>Given the clear importance of the IPV–STI relationship, variants of Models 0A and Model 5 were run that replaced the two-category spousal IPV in the past year variable with a four-category variable (no physical and sexual violence, physical violence only, sexual violence only, and both physical and sexual violence). This was done to determine which type of spousal IPV is most consistently associated with a woman’s likelihood of having an STI. The results for the regressions with the modified IPV variable are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212455358">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212455358">Table 3</xref> shows that in all countries, the relationships observed in Model 0A are also observed in the full model. In the full model, compared with women who have not experienced any IPV, the odds of having an STI are highest in all countries for women who have experienced only sexual violence (the Dominican Republic and Kenya) or both physical and sexual violence (the remaining four). This analysis shows that the experience of sexual violence is central to the IPV–STI relationship, although the experience of physical violence alone also increases the likelihood of women having an STI in four of the six countries.</p>

<sec id="section28-1077801212455358" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This article began with a conceptual model and three hypotheses about the relationship between women’s risk of STIs and spousal IPV.</p>
<list id="list3-1077801212455358" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The first hypothesis was that women’s risk of STIs and their experience of IPV are positively associated. This hypothesis is fully supported. No other variable in the analysis was as consistently related to a woman’s risk of STI in each of the six countries as was women’s experience of IPV.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The second hypothesis was that higher-risk sexual behaviors will explain only a part of the positive IPV–STI association. This hypothesis is also upheld. However, in most countries, the large number of variables included in the analysis to capture higher-risk behaviors and attitudes, as well as other relevant control variables such as education and wealth are able to reduce the <italic>OR</italic>s for IPV in all countries by only 15% or less. In five of the six countries, even in the full model, the relationship of IPV and women’s risk of STIs remains significant and robust. In Kenya alone, the relationship becomes marginally significant in the full model. Notably, however, even in Kenya, women who have experienced spousal sexual violence are found to be significantly more likely to have an STI than women who have experienced neither physical nor sexual spousal violence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The third hypothesis was that IPV has a positive association with women’s risk of STIs that is <italic>net</italic> of women’s and men’s higher-risk attitudes and behaviors. This hypothesis is also strongly upheld as is evident from the fact that IPV is significant for all countries in the full model.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As expected, in most countries the form of violence most closely associated with the risk of women having an STI is sexual violence, either on its own or in combination with physical violence. Also notable is the finding that women who experience both types of violence are at a particular disadvantage with regard to STI risk in four of the six countries.</p>
<p>The analysis in this article also yielded at least two unexpected results. The first was the lack of consistency in the relationship with a woman’s risk of STIs of most proximate risk-related variables other than sexual IPV. None of the eight variables measuring sexual risk, including the husband’s STI status, was consistently associated with the dependent variable in all six countries or even significantly related in all six countries. Even when significant, the relationship was often counterintuitive. The second unexpected result was that few of the husband’s behaviors or characteristics had any significant association with women’s STI risk; if and when significant, it was largely women’s own behaviors (e.g., other sexual partners, alcohol consumption, or woman married more than once) that were found to be most relevant to their risk of having an STI. One possible explanation for the weakness and inconsistency of the effect of known risk factors on women’s likelihood of having an STI is that higher-risk behaviors are being underreported. Nonetheless, this potential data inadequacy alone is unlikely to explain the associations found in this analysis.</p>
<p>The consistent, robust, and positive IPV–STI relationship in all six countries found in this article begs the question of why this relationship exists. Most current explanations of this relationship refer to the positive association of experience and perpetration of IPV and higher-risk sexual behaviors. However, the analysis in this article clearly shows that IPV has an association with women’s risk of STIs <italic>net</italic> of all of the various risk factors identified in the literature as correlates of either the experience of IPV or the perpetration by men of IPV. An obvious explanation that could be put forth is that women who experience IPV systematically overreport STIs. This, however, is unlikely to be the case given (a) the much more likely possibility of some women overreporting and other women underreporting STIs; (b) the consistency of the IPV–STI relationship across countries that vary greatly in terms of cultural contexts, level of education, and wealth; and (c) women’s reports of STIs were not found to vary consistently with either husbands’ or wives’ education or household wealth, even though it is expected that more educated and wealthier couples would have better knowledge of STIs and recognition of their symptoms (results not shown).</p>
<p>More likely explanations that are beyond the scope of this article include the following:</p>
<list id="list4-1077801212455358" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>IPV increases women’s risk of STIs because it disempowers women in intimate relationships in ways that prevent them from either having the will or the ability to protect themselves effectively or even at all.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition to the direct disempowerment resulting from the violence itself are the effects of fear of violence on women’s behavior and choices. Choices made in an environment of fear may not necessarily be the most rational from the perspective of desired health behaviors and outcomes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In most countries, gender-related constraints make it less likely that women, both absolutely and compared with men, will seek care for an STI, particularly if they experience or live in fear of violence. Consequently, for many women, STI symptoms of infection may persist long after the husband’s infection has been cured.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The finding that sexual violence alone or jointly in conjunction with physical violence is most strongly associated with women’s risk of STIs suggests that there may also be a biological explanation: force used for and during sexual intercourse may put women at greater risk of transmission in the face of infection.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite the consistency of the results regarding the IPV–STI relationship discussed here, several limitations of this research need to be mentioned: (1) The measurement of STIs is based on self-reports with no clinical verification. Self-reporting of health problems, as mentioned earlier, is notoriously unreliable and little is known about gender differentials in self-reporting. In these data, women in most countries report much higher rates of STIs than do men, and there is no way to know whether women are overreporting or men are underreporting, or both. Furthermore, information is available only on STIs and STI symptoms any time in the past 12 months; hence, there is no information on the current status of the infection for women or men and, if both members of a couple report having had an STI in the past 12 months, there is also no information on whether the infection overlapped in terms of time. (2) Several of the variables that are proximate behavioral determinants of STIs are likely to be underreported in face-to-face surveys. Key among these is the number of extramarital partners. Underreporting of extramarital partnerships can be expected for any population, but is even more likely in a sample of currently married/cohabiting women and men. (3) The DHS data sets on couples necessarily include only those couples for which both husband and wife could be successfully interviewed. Thus, couples where the husband was not in the household at the time of the interview or refused the interview are not included in this sample. The extent of bias introduced by exclusion of such couples is unknown. Finally, (4) the key independent variable “spousal IPV” may itself have been underreported. Such underreporting can occur even though the DHS provides special interviewer training for the collection of data on violence, tries to ensure privacy and security of respondents in accordance with WHO guidelines, and uses a set of questions that maximize the validity of data collected on violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212455358">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this article provides unequivocal support for the strong positive association of IPV with a woman’s risk of having STIs and shows that this relationship is not explained by husband’s STI status or woman’s own or her husband’s higher-risk sexual and related behaviors or attitudes. These findings clearly suggest that to reduce women’s risk of infection, programs and policies need to acknowledge IPV as an STI risk factor, which is at least on par with other acknowledged risk factors such as multiple sexual partners and unprotected sexual intercourse. This is particularly important given the high proportion of women affected by IPV worldwide and particularly in countries with high rates of STIs, including HIV.</p>
