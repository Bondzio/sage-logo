<abstract>
<p>There has been a scarcity of work examining the political consequences of discrete emotions. This article examines the political effects of several emotions—anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm. Emotional ads should influence whether voters become politically active. To test this, two experiments were administered. The first examines emotional responses to campaign messages; the second tests whether emotions influence political participation. The results indicate anger is mobilizing, by increasing participatory intentions and factors related to participate. This result is then replicated using ad-tracking data. The findings indicate that emotions are an important factor in studying campaign effects.</p>

<p>Emotions are a staple of American political campaigns, and one need not look far to find examples of emotional campaign ads. Both scholars and political pundits describe campaigns in emotion-centered terms, noting how candidates connect with voters, how a cold, emotionless persona alienates voters, and how campaign advertisements elicit a host of emotions. Consider Hillary Clinton’s “3AM” advertisement released during the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, or prototypical spots, such as Lyndon Johnson’s “Daisy Girl” ad in which an unaware girl picking apart a daisy precedes images of a nuclear explosion. Since the onslaught of television advertising, candidates have drawn on many emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">Brader 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While political advertisers attempt to elicit many emotions in the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">Brader 2006</xref>), there has been a scarcity of scholarly work examining whether specific emotions aroused in political campaigns influence political behavior. Much of the literature on campaign advertising has examined the implications of emotional valence—positive versus negative advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912912449697">Ansolabehere et al. 1994</xref>) or ads that elicit enthusiasm versus fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Brader 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">2006</xref>). Moreover, one of the more contentious issues to emerge in the study of American campaigns is whether negative ads affect political interest and participation. In the decade and a half following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912912449697">Ansolabehere et al.’s (1994)</xref> seminal finding that attack advertisements reduce turnout, there has been a flurry of academic and nonacademic interest in the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912912449697">Clinton and Lapinski 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912912449697">Lau and Pomper 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912912449697">Brooks 2006</xref>), with the consensus being that under particular conditions attack ads depress turnout. Yet much of this work fails to consider the effect of emotions.</p>
<p>In this article I examine the consequences of emotional appeals in campaign ads by (1) demonstrating that individuals experience an array of emotions in response to campaign advertisements and (2) disaggregating emotions of the same valence; specific emotions have unique and important political consequences. Using two experiments and ad-tracking data, I demonstrate that emotions are a vital characteristic to consider when describing the consequences of political campaigns. In these studies, anger emerges as a mobilizing force. Anger-evoking political messages heighten participatory intentions, consistent with previous research showing that anger is associated with behavioral approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912912449697">Lerner and Tiedens 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912912449697">C. Harmon-Jones et al. 2011</xref>). Before describing the consequences of emotional campaign ads, I review several theoretical approaches.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912912449697">
<title>Dimensional and Discrete Models of Emotion</title>
<p>Research on affect has exerted a growing influence on the study of political behavior, and affect is an essential component in social judgment and behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912912449697">Davidson, Scherer, and Goldsmith 2003</xref>). The political implications of emotion are pervasive, having been empirically linked to perceptions of candidates and vote choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912912449697">Lodge and Taber 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Brader 2005</xref>), media consumption and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912912449697">Marcus and MacKuen 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912912449697">Huddy et al. 2005</xref>), policy attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912449697">Huddy, Feldman, and Cassese 2007</xref>), and political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912912449697">Valentino et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1065912912449697">Rudolph, Gangl, and Stevens 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparatively little research has examined the motivational and persuasive impact of <italic>specific</italic> emotions in the context of a political campaign (the exception being <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912912449697">Valentino, Gregorowicz, and Groenendyk 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912912449697">Valentino et al. 2011</xref>). Much of the extant work in political science has advocated a <italic>dimensional</italic> approach to the study of affect, with one dimension being defined by positive emotions and a second by negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912912449697">Marcus 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Consider the pioneering work of George Marcus and colleagues and their theory of affective intelligence (AIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912912449697">Marcus and MacKuen 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912449697">Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912912449697">Neuman et al. 2007</xref>). According to this approach, emotional responses fall within one of two systems—disposition and surveillance. These systems provide guidance as to whether habits are sufficient for judgment, or whether greater attention needs to be paid to the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912449697">Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000</xref>). Positive emotions promote operating in the disposition system and a reliance on habit. On the other hand, when the surveillance system is activated, usually through a particular threat, the individual relies less on predispositions and habit. Anxiety is central to this theoretical perspective since it is the emotion that moves people to operate in the surveillance system.</p>
<p>Scholarly work has sought to understand which emotions are rooted in these two systems, given evidence that negative emotions sometimes have effects similar to positive emotions. For example, anger and anxiety are highly correlated emotions yet entail different physiological, psychological, and motivational consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912912449697">MacKuen et al. 2010</xref>). Unlike anxiety, anger tends to accompany behavioral approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912912449697">Harmon-Jones et al. 2011</xref>) and determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912912449697">C. Harmon-Jones et al. 2011</xref>). Anger also activates left anterior areas of the cerebral cortex, much like positive emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912912449697">E. Harmon-Jones et al. 2004</xref>). Moreover, anger leads to information-processing strategies qualitatively similar to positive affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912912449697">Bodenhausen, Sheppard, and Kramer 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912912449697">MacKuen and colleagues (2010)</xref> incorporates anger into AIT by arguing that anger, or what they call “aversion,” aligns with the disposition system. “Aversion, including feelings of anger, disgust, contempt, and hatred, signals the need to confront an adversary. When familiar aversive stimuli are encountered, people rely on previously learned routines to manage these situations, just as they do for familiar rewarding circumstances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912912449697">MacKuen et al. 2010</xref>, 441; for contrary evidence, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912912449697">Watson 2009</xref>). Whether one operates in the disposition or surveillance system depends on how one interprets threatening stimuli. Familiar threats activate anger, whereas unfamiliar threats trigger anxiety. Drawing on these findings, campaign ads that elicit anger or enthusiasm may have the behavioral consequence of elevated participation, whereas ads that elicit sadness or fear should depress participation.</p>
<p>A parallel approach in the study of emotion focuses on discrete emotions. Much of this research is guided by <italic>appraisal theory</italic>, which centers on how the evaluation of a stimulus shapes one’s emotional experience. Several appraisals have been consistently cited to underlie emotional reactions: certainty, valence, control, motivation, and responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912912449697">Smith and Ellsworth 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912912449697">Carver and Harmon-Jones 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912912449697">2009b</xref>). Anger, for example, stems from evaluating a stimulus as negative; it accompanies a heightened perception of personal control that one can effectively cope with the event. Anger also results in approach motivation and attributing blame to an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912912449697">Lazarus 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912912449697">Berkowitz 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912912449697">Berkowitz and Harmon-Jones 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912912449697">Ellsworth and Scherer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912912449697">Mackie, Devos and Smith 2000</xref>). Sadness and fear, on the other hand, stem from beliefs that a negative event cannot be prevented, blame is not easy to assign, and one cannot as easily cope with the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912912449697">Keltner, Ellsworth, and Edwards 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912912449697">Lerner and Keltner 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Because anger and enthusiasm involve a heightened sense of personal control, these emotions facilitate behavioral <italic>approach</italic> over <italic>withdrawal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912912449697">Marsh, Ambady, and Kleck 2005</xref>). Fear and sadness, however, promote perceptions of reduced personal control and should subsequently lead to behavioral <italic>avoidance</italic>. Physiological findings comport with these expectations, whereby discrete emotions correlate with particular action tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912912449697">Levenson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912912449697">Frijda, Kuipers, and ter Schure 1989</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912912449697">Frijda, Kuipers, and ter Schure (1989</xref>, 213) note, emotions motivate “approach or attentional interest, flight and withdrawal, and opposition and attack are modes of manifest behavior resulting from these impulses.”</p>
<p>Despite the theoretical differences between dimensional and appraisal models, in some instances the models predict similar outcomes. Both approaches contend that anger should facilitate behavioral approach (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912912449697">Watson 2009</xref>). Similarly, Tellegen and colleagues introduce an integrated model of affect that considers input from both approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912912449697">Tellegen, Watson, and Clark 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912449697">Huddy, Feldman, and Cassese 2007</xref>). Their “hierarchical model” posits that affect is arrayed hierarchically, with discrete emotions at the first level, a negative and positive affect factor at the second level, and a bipolar happiness versus unhappiness factor at the third level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912912449697">Tellegen, Watson, and Clark 1999</xref>). The model does not undermine the existence of discrete emotions, nor does it challenge the notion of a single dimension of affect. Rather, discrete and dimensional approaches are synthesized into a general model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912449697">Huddy, Feldman, and Cassese 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering these approaches, and the observation that scholars typically restrict their analysis to positive versus negative ads, I examine whether four emotions aroused in campaign ads influence political behavior. <italic>Do anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm have unique and differentiated effects?</italic></p>

<title>Hypotheses and Design</title>
<p>An underexplored question is how negative emotions differ from one another in their political consequences. Given the unique relationship between emotions and particular action tendencies, four emotions aroused in campaign ads—anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm—should have important and differentiated consequences for political behavior. In this study, I focus on these emotions because, when taken together, they constitute many of the emotions appealed to in political campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">Brader 2006</xref>). As such, anger in the political domain should be tightly bound to perceptions of efficacy. However, since sadness and fear correspond to apathy and withdrawal, these emotions should reduce efficacy and participatory intentions. On the other hand, fear and sadness, two emotions associated with helplessness and withdrawal, should lead to political disinterest and abstention.</p>
<p>My two expectations are that (1) anger, fear, sadness, and enthusiasm should be unique and differentiated constructs that (2) have varying consequences on political participation and factors associated with participation. Specifically, anger and enthusiasm should be relatively strong predictors of both political efficacy and the desire to participate in politics, whereas sadness and fear should lead to comparatively less participation.</p>
<p>Three studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. The first study focuses on whether participants can differentiate their emotional reactions felt in response to campaign ads. In study 1, participants were randomly assigned to view one of four ads designed to elicit a discrete emotion. The stimulus materials from this study were then used in study 2, where the goal was to measure the effects of emotional advertisements on participation. The results indicate that anger increases the desire to be politically active. Finally, because of the external validity limitations of study 2, I analyze a third study of content-analyzed advertisements that were merged with the Wisconsin Advertising Project (WISCAD) and National Annenberg Election Study (NAES) data. These data similarly demonstrate that anger enhances participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1065912912449697">
<title>The Experiments</title>
<p>Two experiments (study 1 <italic>N</italic> = 287; study 2 <italic>N</italic> = 274) were administered to test the hypothesis that emotions evoked in advertisements affect political involvement. Participants were recruited from two universities: a large northeastern university and a large southern university. Both experiments followed a similar logic, so they are explained together.</p>
<p>On entering the lab, participants were seated at a computer terminal and instructed that they were to view a campaign ad followed with a short survey. Participants were asked to watch and react to a political web advertisement released from a previous congressional election. The stimulus materials consisted of videos created using professional video-editing equipment, and the ad script for several of the messages consisted of slightly modified versions of those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912912449697">Ansolabehere et al. (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Brader (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">2006</xref>) as well as segments from existing political ads. Participants were told they would view an ad drawn from a congressional race between two candidates, John Wilkins and Dave Reade. All participants watched the advertisement at individual computers equipped with headphones. Each participant was randomly assigned to view only one of four ads, after which point he or she completed a short survey. After completing the survey, participants were asked to see the researcher, at which time the study was discussed and participants were thanked.</p>
<p>In the first study, participants were randomly assigned to view one of four ads designed to evoke a particular emotion—anger, sadness, fear, or enthusiasm. Although these ads all focused on the same substantive issue, crime, they did vary considerably in the types of crime discussed. In the anger ad, the focus was drugs, in the sadness and fear ads the focus was violent crime, and in the enthusiasm ad the focus was the crime rate in the United States. This was intentional, as the purpose was to maximize the differences in experienced emotions across conditions and examine whether emotional responses are sufficiently differentiated. The purpose of the manipulation was to generate an emotional reaction and examine whether individuals are able to differentiate specific emotional reactions to campaign messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912912449697">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>After demonstrating differentiated emotional reactions to these messages, a second study was conducted to address the “stimulus equivalence” limitation of study 1 and examine the behavioral ramifications of emotional campaign messages. Here, I focus on the anger and sadness ads, which were more systematically analyzed by creating <italic>baseline</italic> conditions. In the baseline condition information was held constant and audiovisual cues associated with emotional reactions were varied. The experiment follows from exposing participants to either the anger or sadness ad from the first study, crossed with whether emotional cues are present or absent. The musical backdrop, certain images, and the emotional tone in the narrator’s voice were present in the cue condition and were absent in the no cue condition. Following exposure to the ad, participants were then asked a series of questions about their emotional state and their intention to participate in politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912912449697">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section4-1065912912449697">
<title>Emotion</title>
<p>To ascertain whether the manipulation evoked an emotion, several questions were asked regarding the participant’s emotional state. In study 1, several questions were asked regarding the participant’s levels of enthusiasm, anger, fear, and sadness. Enthusiasm was measured with three items—hopefulness, happiness, and optimism. Fear was measured with two items (afraid, fearful), as was anger (angry, disgusted). Sadness was measured with two items (sad, depressed). In study 2, the focus is on contrasting anger and sadness. Sadness was measured with the same two items (sad, depressed), as was anger (anger, disgust).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1065912912449697">
<title>Participatory intentions</title>
<p>Intention to participate in politics was operationalized in a number of ways and is the focus of study 2. An <italic>internal efficacy</italic> scale was created from six questions that were combined into a scale ranging from 0 to 1 (α = .80). The statements were similar to those consistently asked in the American National Election Studies, for instance, “People like me don’t have a say in what the government does” and “I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of the important political issues facing our country.” <italic>External political efficacy</italic> was measured with a single item: “I don’t think public officials care much about what people like me think”; responses range from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>stron gly agree</italic>). Several participation questions were also included: <italic>voting</italic> (“How likely is it that you’ll vote in the next election?”) and <italic>volunteerism</italic> (“How likely is it that you’ll volunteer in the next election?”). Finally, an agree–disagree <italic>civic duty</italic> statement was analyzed: “People should vote whenever there is an election.” The ad scripts for studies 1 and 2 and the analyzed questions are available in the online supplementary material (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prq.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://prq.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Study 1: The Structure of Emotions</title>
<p>Dimensional models contend that emotions collapse to one or two dimensions; discrete models argue that the emotions are more nuanced. It is entirely feasible that both models are accurate—that is, emotions may collapse to several correlated “specific” emotion dimensions. To examine my first expectation and the underlying measurement structure of emotional response, several confirmatory factor models were estimated. Because of the categorical nature of the indicators, all models were estimated using mean and variance adjusted weighted least squares in Mplus version 6.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912912449697">Muthén and Muthén 1998–2010</xref>). A confirmatory factor model was estimated because it provides information about the measurement structure of the data, allowing for a test of whether anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm are separable constructs <italic>or</italic> whether these emotions are indicators of a general positive versus negative affective state.</p>
<p>A single factor model was first estimated. This model tests whether anger, disgust, fear, fright, hope, happiness, and enthusiasm all load on a single bipolar dimension, with “positive” affect on one end and “negative” affect at the opposing end. On the whole, the one-factor model provided an extremely poor fit to data (comparative fit index [CFI] = .694, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] = .591, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .392).</p>
<p>A bivalent model was estimated next, in which negative emotions load on one dimension and positive emotions on a separate dimension. This is the model most frequently relied on in work that advances the <italic>dimensional</italic> approach to emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912912449697">Watson and Clark 1992</xref>), and it is closely aligned with the <italic>affective intelligence</italic> literature. There is little empirical support for this model, as it, too, does not provide an acceptable fit to data (CFI = .947, TLI = .927, RMSEA = .166).</p>
<p>Next, two hybrid models were estimated. The first model specifies that anger is defined by anger indicators (i.e., anger, disgust), fear by fear-related indicators (i.e., fearful, afraid), and happiness versus sadness by enthusiasm indicators (i.e., hope, optimism, happiness) and sadness indicators (i.e., sad, depressed). This three-factor model provided a poor fit (CFI = .759, TLI = .639, RMSEA = .369). A second hybrid model was estimated where negative affect was defined by the anger and fear indicators, and a positive affect factor was defined by the enthusiasm and sadness indicators. This model also provided a very poor fit to data (CFI = .750, TLI = .654, RMSEA = .361)</p>
<p>The best fitting model was a four-factor model, such that anger and disgust load on an anger dimension; sadness, depression, and happiness define a sadness dimension; afraid and fearful items define the fear dimension; and hope, optimism, and happiness load on an enthusiasm dimension (CFI = .995, TLI = .9991, RMSEA = .059).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912912449697">3</xref></sup> In other words, the best fitting factor model was one where specific emotion terms load on four specific emotions constructs. The estimates for the four-factor model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912912449697">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>While the best fitting model is one where anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm are separate constructs, the constructs are correlated. Emotions co-occur, particularly emotions of the same valence. For instance, the correlation between anger and fear was substantial (<italic>r =</italic> .715), as were the correlations between sadness and anger (<italic>r</italic> = .750) and between sadness and fear (<italic>r</italic> = .830). However, the correlations between the three negative emotions and enthusiasm were smaller (<italic>r</italic><sub>Anger,Enthusiasm</sub> = −.148; <italic>r</italic><sub>Fear,Enthusiasm</sub> = .076; <italic>r</italic><sub>Sadness,Enthusiasm</sub> = .005), which is congruent with previous work demonstrating that emotions of the same tone are heavily correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912912449697">Diener and Iran-Nejad 1986</xref>), whereas positive and negative affect are orthogonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912449697">Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000</xref>). Indeed, constraining the correlation between enthusiasm and fear to zero did not worsen the overall model fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.509, <italic>ns</italic>, nor did constraining to zero the correlation between sadness and enthusiasm, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.006, <italic>ns</italic>. The correlation between anger and enthusiasm, however, was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.208, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. While positive and negative emotions are largely orthogonal, the model supports the notion that anger, sadness, and fear should be treated as separate, albeit correlated, constructs.</p>
<p>Study 1 also allows for a preliminary test of whether the manipulations elicit the expected emotions. For instance, does the anger ad elicit anger or some other emotion? Since the emotions are a consequence of the treatment conditions, I extend <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912912449697">Table 1</xref> by estimating a multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) model. The four factors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912912449697">Table 1</xref> were predicted by dummy variables corresponding to the participant’s assignment to a treatment condition.</p>
<p>The point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912912449697">Figure 1</xref> illustrate that felt enthusiasm was highest in the enthusiasm condition. The estimates for the treatment variables leading to felt enthusiasm are all negative, and the confidence intervals do not overlap with zero.</p>

<p>Contrasting the negative emotions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912912449697">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that experienced anger was highest in the anger condition relative to the fear condition, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.340, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and the sadness condition, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.486, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. However, the effect of the fear manipulation was not nearly as clean. The anger manipulation elicited approximately equal levels of fear relative to the fear manipulation, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.171, <italic>ns</italic>, which is not uncommon given the heightened co-occurrence of anger, fear, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912912449697">Diener and Iran-Nejad 1986</xref>). However, the fear manipulation did elicit marginally more fear than the sadness manipulation, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.903, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Regarding sadness, felt sadness was higher in the sadness condition relative to both the anger condition, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.639, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and the fear condition, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.358, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .07.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912912449697">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>These findings point to heterogeneity in emotional reactions felt in response to campaign messages, echoing work that demonstrates variation in the consequences of political ads of the same tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912912449697">Kahn and Kenney 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912912449697">Brooks and Geer 2007</xref>). Several key findings emerge from this study. First, emotions—particularly negative emotions—can be differentiated. While several theoretical approaches contend positive emotions reside on one dimension and negative emotions on a separate dimension, the results do not support this view. Rather, sadness, fear, anger, and enthusiasm appear to be unique constructs, despite being heavily correlated. Second, the study illustrates that three of the four manipulations were effective in eliciting a specific emotion. Sadness was most prevalent in the sadness condition relative to all other conditions, anger was higher in the anger condition relative to all other conditions, and enthusiasm was greater in the enthusiasm condition relative to all other conditions. Because the primary motivation is to contrast emotions of the same valence, in study 2 I slightly modify the anger and sadness ads to better document the electoral consequences of these emotions.</p>

<title>Study 2: Does Anger Mobilize?</title>
<p>A concern in political communication research is whether a documented effect can be attributed to emotions, cognition, or some combination of the two. The complexity of political messages—ranging from evocative cues to editing techniques and the use of coded language—renders it even more difficult to isolate the distinct effects of cognition and emotions.</p>
<p>In the previous experiment, while all ads focused on the substantive issue of crime, somewhat different aspects of crime were discussed. The sadness ad drew on violent crime, whereas the anger ad emphasized mandatory sentencing and drug policy. Because the anger and sadness manipulations were relatively clean with respect to the manipulated emotion, slight modifications were made to these ads to explore whether anger mobilizes and sadness demobilizes.</p>
<p>In one condition, participants were exposed to an advertisement that included emotionally evocative elements; specifically, an ominous voiceover, music, and threatening images accompanied the message. In a second condition, these cues were absent. While the information was held constant—that is, the information was essentially equivalent—the ads varied in the degree to which a particular emotion should have been evoked. This method is similar to the approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Brader (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As such, participants were assigned to one of four conditions following from a 2 (emotion ad: anger vs. sadness) × 2 (cues: present vs. absent) between-subjects design.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912912449697">5</xref></sup> This allowed for a test of whether emotional ads (relative to a baseline condition) affect participation.</p>
<p>A two-way emotion ad × audiovisual cues interaction suggests that the emotion advertisements vary depending on whether the emotional cues are present or absent. Specifically, the anger ad with the audiovisual cues should elicit a greater desire to participate (relative to the less emotional baseline); the opposite should occur for the sadness ad. This would suggest that anger is mobilizing, sadness demobilizing. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912912449697">Table 2</xref> reveals the effects of the manipulation on internal and external political efficacy, volunteerism, voting, and civic duty. The internal efficacy column contains ordinary least squares coefficients, whereas the remaining columns are maximum likelihood estimates from ordered logistic regression. Given gender differences in political participation, I also control for the effect of gender in the models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912912449697">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>Given the manner in which the variables are coded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912912449697">Table 2</xref>, the effect of the “cue” variable contrasts the sadness ad with the cue to the sadness ad without the cue. The cue variable does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance for internal efficacy (<italic>t</italic> = −0.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .20, one-tailed), civic duty (<italic>z</italic> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .20, one-tailed), voting (<italic>z</italic> = 0.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .25. one-tailed), or external efficacy (<italic>z</italic> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .41, one-tailed). The difference is marginally significant for volunteerism (<italic>z</italic> = −1.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .07, one-tailed).</p>
<p>To contrast the anger ad with the cue to the anger ad without the cue, the emotion variable was simply recoded, such that 0 = <italic>anger ad</italic> and 1 = <italic>sadness ad</italic>. This variable was then interacted with the cue manipulation dummy. Contrasting the anger ad with and without the cue leads to a significant difference for internal efficacy (<italic>t</italic> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025, one-tailed), voting (<italic>z</italic> = 1.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, one-tailed), and volunteerism (<italic>z</italic> = 1.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025 one-tailed). The contrast was nonsignificant for external efficacy and civic duty, however.</p>
<p>To facilitate interpretation of several of these effects, predicted values generated from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912912449697">Table 2</xref> are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912912449697">Figure 2</xref>. Examining the upper-left plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912912449697">Figure 2</xref>, anger with emotionally evocative elements increased efficacy relative to the same ad lacking emotionally evocative cues. The light gray line represents external efficacy, the dark gray line internal efficacy. On a scale of 0 to 1, the predicted internal efficacy mean for participants in the anger/emotion cues present condition was 0.58. Absent these cues, the expected value was 0.51. The opposite pattern emerged for sadness. The sadness ad with the emotional cues leads to an expected value of 0.47, whereas the same ad without the emotional cues leads to an expected value of 0.49. While anger increases internal efficacy, sadness decreases efficacy. The same countervailing pattern was found for external efficacy. For the anger ad, including the emotionally evocative cues increases external efficacy from 0.54 to 0.44. The sadness cues decrease external efficacy from 0.54 to 0.46.</p>

<p>Predicted probabilities were also generated based on the respondents’ reported intention to participate in upcoming elections. Specifically, the probabilities that one would “definitely” vote as well as whether one would “definitely” or “probably” volunteer in the next election were calculated in all treatment conditions. For voting, anger again boosts participatory intentions. The probability of voting is 0.56 in the anger ad/emotional cue condition, whereas the probability is 0.44 in the anger ad/no cue condition. The probability of voting in the sadness ad/cue condition was 0.38 versus 0.43 in the sadness ad/no cue condition.</p>
<p>The strongest effect emerged for volunteering. Anger increased the likelihood of stating one would volunteer—an increase from 0.15 to 0.26. The sadness ad without the emotion cue led to a greater likelihood of volunteering (0.15) relative to the ad with the cue (0.10). Taken together, these results imply that emotional appeals—more specifically, negative emotional appeals—do not have uniform effects. Anger seems to energize voters. Sadness has a less consistent effect. While the direction of the effect points to demobilization, the contrasts between the sadness ad with the cues and the sadness ad without the cues were consistently nonsignificant. Only in the case of volunteerism did sadness approach conventional levels of statistical significance.</p>
<p>While these results are informative and demonstrate an effect of anger on participation and several correlates of participation, the data are limited in the sense that the college student participants are a homogeneous subset of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1065912912449697">Sears 1986</xref>). In addition, the laboratory environment is sufficiently different from the typical “living room” setting in which campaign ads are typically consumed. Study 3 attempts to reconcile these limitations by employing public opinion and emotion-based ad-tracking data to examine the consequences of campaign advertising. From these data, I construct a measure of emotional ad exposure, which is used to predict participatory behavior.</p>

<sec id="section8-1065912912449697">
<title>Study 3: Emotions in the 2004 Presidential Campaign</title>
<p>To examine the consequences of emotional ads during an actual campaign, independent coders classified all advertisements included in the 2004 WISCAD presidential advertising data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912912449697">Goldstein and Rivlin 2007</xref>). The ads were classified according to their degree of anger, fear, hope, and sadness. I use hope as a general measure of enthusiasm. Although hope and enthusiasm are clearly distinct emotions, I rely on hope—as opposed to enthusiasm or other positive emotions—for the following reasons: First, scholars have demonstrated that positive emotions are typically more difficult to differentiate and that positive emotions often have relatively similar information processing consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912912449697">Fredrickson 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912912449697">2001</xref>). Second, AIT has generally used “hope” and “pride” as measures of enthusiasm. Finally, from an empirical perspective, I expected that enthusiasm and pride, relative to hope, would be difficult to detect in campaign ads, thus leading to lower interrater reliability estimates.</p>
<p>I rely on the 2004 WISCAD data set, which includes ad storyboards and detailed tracking information of ads released in the 2004 presidential campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912912449697">Goldstein and Rivlin 2007</xref>). Coders were first trained to categorize the ad storyboards according to the ad’s emotional tenor. Ads were coded as 1 if the ad made an appeal to the emotion, 0 otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912912449697">7</xref></sup> A total of 656 advertisements were coded by three trained coders. To calculate intercoder reliability, 96 ads (14.6 percent) were randomly selected and coded by two coders. Intercoder reliability was good for anger and enthusiasm, marginal for fear, and somewhat low for sadness, indicating that sadness is somewhat more difficult to reliably detect in campaign advertisements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912912449697">8</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section9-1065912912449697">
<title>Ad Exposure</title>
<p>The coded ads were next merged with the 2004 NAES data. Respondent-level measures of anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm ad exposure were created from the number of presidential ads released in a respondent’s media market, weighted by the respondent’s media consumption habits. The weighting procedure, which is explained in the online supplementary materials, is a variant of the strategy developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912912449697">Freedman, Franz, and Goldstein (2004)</xref>. The exposure variables were all recoded to vary from 0 to 1 (anger exposure: <italic>M</italic> = 0.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.25; sad exposure: <italic>M</italic> = 0.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.26; fear exposure: <italic>M</italic> = 0.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.25; enthusiasm exposure: <italic>M</italic> = 0.61, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.25).</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Political participation was constructed by summing responses to four items—whether one tried to influence another’s vote, attended meetings, did other work for the candidates or parties, contributed money, and posted a yard sign (kr-20 = .65). Efficacy was approximated from a single item: “People like me do not have a say in what the government does.” I also analyze the likelihood that the respondent closely follows the campaign and politics, which is averaged from two questions (<italic>r</italic><sub>polychoric</sub> = .96). A measure of political discussion was constructed from three items regarding how much the respondent discusses politics with friends, coworkers, and people online (α = .55).</p>
<p>Given the observational nature of these data, several important control variables were included in the models. Media consumption was approximated from the average number of days the individual watches local news, network news, and late-night comedy and reads the paper (α = .50). Knowledge was generated by calculating the average number of correct responses to a four-item knowledge test (kr-20 = .88). Respondent age, income (divided by 1,000), gender, race, education, and voter registration were also included in the models. Finally, I include the natural logarithm of the number of ads released in each media market and cable television through the time of the respondent’s interview.</p>
<p>To estimate the consequences of emotion ad exposure, I estimated a two-level hierarchical model, in which respondents were modeled as nested within their media market. Discussing politics and following politics/campaigns were treated as continuous dependent variables; efficacy and participation were treated as ordinal dependent variables. Accordingly, linear random intercept models were estimated for the continuous dependent variables, whereas proportional odds models with random intercepts were estimated for the ordinal variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912912449697">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912912449697">Table 3</xref> displays the estimates for the four models. Across these four models, anger emerged as mobilizing emotion, enhancing interest, discussion, participation, and efficacy. Fear, however, had the opposite effect, by decreasing political discussion, interest in politics, and participation. The effects of enthusiasm and sadness were somewhat contrary to expectations. Enthusiasm was not related to interest in politics but decreased participation in politics, discussing politics, and efficacy. Sadness, similarly, has inconsistent effects; it enhanced discussion, interest, and participation but led to a nonsignificant effect on efficacy and political interest. With respect to sadness, the estimates should be interpreted with caution, as the interrater reliability for sadness was somewhat low.</p>

<p>A consistent finding across these three studies is that anger is mobilizing by elevating the desire and importance attached to political participation. Negative emotions do not have uniform consequences; anger is unique relative to other negative emotions. Across these studies, the analyses demonstrate that anger generates heightened interest and involvement, attesting to the mobilizing, approach-oriented nature of this emotion.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>With the onslaught of television advertising in the 1950s, scholars and pundits alike feared the adverse impact of televised campaigns, noting that advertisements offered little substantive information about political candidates and would displace more personal modes of campaigning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912912449697">Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912912449697">Geer 2006</xref>). And while the electorate has grown increasingly dissatisfied with the state of American campaigns by staying away from the polls in large numbers and showing distrust of politicians, much of this dissatisfaction has been attributed to the increase in spots better suited to elicit an emotion than to inform. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">Brader (2006</xref>, 47) aptly notes, “A tremendous gap exists between what most people believe about the importance of emotional appeals (the ‘conventional wisdom’) and what is actually known from these appeals.”</p>
<p>Despite conventional wisdom that emotions are politically important, a scarcity of scholarly work has empirically assessed the consequences of emotional campaign ads. A notable exception is the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Ted Brader (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">2006</xref>). In several experiments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Brader (2005)</xref> finds that fear-evoking messages stimulate greater attention to information, whereas enthusiasm leads to a larger reliance on habit, largely congruent with the theoretical expectations accompanying AIT. Yet the vast majority of empirical work has contrasted negative and positive messages, resulting in conflicting findings regarding whether campaigns promote participation, interest, and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912912449697">Lau and Pomper 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912912449697">Freedman, Franz, and Goldstein 2004</xref>). Since the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912912449697">Ansolabehere et al. (1994)</xref> finding that attack advertisements reduce turnout, the consensus seems to be that only for certain political ads, among particular individuals, does attack advertising increase electoral participation.</p>
<p>A potentially fruitful way to understand the consequences of negative and positive campaign messages is to consider an ad’s emotional appeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912449697">Brader 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">2006</xref>). The studies in this article were designed to examine the behavioral impact of four commonly appealed-to emotions in advertisements—anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm. In line with the theoretical expectations, the results showed that anger is unique when compared to other negative emotions. Anger, an emotion marked by elevated perceptions of control, promotes the propensity to become politically active and leads to an augmented belief that one’s behaviors are politically consequential. On the other hand, fear and sadness had different effects, by lessening civic engagement.</p>

<title>Toward an Integrated Model of Emotion in Politics</title>
<p>These findings have both psychological and political ramifications, as they advance our understanding of the political consequences of emotion. While much work pits negative and positive emotions against one another, there is nuance in the consequences of emotions of the same valence. The findings in these three studies underscore the importance of discrete emotions. The emotions explored were conceptually distinct, with unique behavioral consequences.</p>
<p>The question thus remains, does the dimensional or discrete approach better account for the nature of emotional reactions felt in response to campaign messages? While these results appear to support the discrete emotion perspective, dimensional approaches have addressed the paradoxical effects of anger. Affective intelligence theorists have introduced “aversion” as a subcomponent of the disposition system, noting anger’s similarities to positive affect. While the term <italic>aversion</italic> would seem to denote withdrawal and avoidance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912449697">Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen (2000)</xref> find that anger is qualitatively similar to enthusiasm. However, scholars disagree on whether anger is approach or avoidance oriented. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912912449697">Carver and Harmon-Jones (2009b)</xref>, for instance, contend that anger is a negative, approach-oriented emotion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912912449697">Lerner and Tiedens (2006)</xref> argue that anger should be considered a positive emotion given its behavioral and psychological similarities to positive affect. Citing a growing body of work showing that anger is more aligned with negative emotions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912912449697">Watson (2009)</xref> argues that anger has both avoidance- and approach-oriented properties. The results provided here support both discrete and dimensional perspectives.</p>
<p>In its purest form, the discrete emotion perspective contends that emotions should not co-occur since all emotions originate from unique constellations of appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912449697">Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000</xref>). A nontrivial correlation among specific emotions may be taken as evidence discrediting the discrete model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912449697">Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000</xref>). Yet as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912912449697">Izard (1972)</xref>, “Most theorists who deal with discrete emotions have suggested that existence of pure emotion, such as pure fear or pure guilt, is probably fairly rare in day-to-day living and virtually impossible to obtain in the laboratory or in any other research setting. I share this position” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912912449697">Watson and Clark 1992</xref>, 499). Study 1 demonstrates that while anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm are heavily correlated factors—in line with the dimensional perspective—these emotions are sufficiently unique to be treated as separate constructs.</p>
<p>Setting aside the correlations among emotions, discrete emotions have unique patterns of physiological, neural, cognitive, behavioral, and motivational tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912912449697">Ekman, Levenson, and Friesen 1983</xref>). And in contrasting emotions of the same tone—particularly anger and fear—these emotions have unique electoral consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912912449697">Valentino et al. 2011</xref>). Studies 2 and 3 support this position by demonstrating these emotions have unique and differentiated consequences for political behavior.</p>
<p>The findings in these three studies point to the importance of an integrated model of emotion—effectively retaining the necessary complexity and nuance of the discrete perspective and the parsimony of the dimensional perspective. The findings are congruent with the hierarchical model of affect developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912912449697">Tellegen, Watson, and Clark (1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912912449697">Watson and Clark 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912912449697">Watson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912449697">Huddy, Feldman, and Cassese 2007</xref>). According to this approach, affect is arrayed hierarchically, with discrete emotions at the first level, positive and negative affect at the second level, and a bipolar “happiness” versus “unhappiness” dimension at the third level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912912449697">Tellegen, Watson, and Clark 1999</xref>). In some contexts focusing on “core affect” or general positivity versus negativity may be sufficient; in other circumstances, it is important to consider negative and positive affect simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912912449697">Lavine 2001</xref>); and in other circumstances, where one expects differentiation among discrete emotions, the unit of analysis should be specific emotions. Focusing on specific emotions need not preclude exploring the commonalities between emotional states. Given the heterogeneity of emotional responses to campaign ads, a particularly advantageous strategy to understand campaign messages rests on better understanding the consequences of discrete emotions.</p>
<p>While there are clear consequences of emotion for civic engagement, an important extension of this finding is to simultaneously consider how emotions moderate information-processing strategies. While anger may have the normatively desirable consequences of producing a more active electorate, anger often has undesirable consequence of leading to a greater reliance on heuristics, biases, and reduced attention to contemporaneous information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912912449697">MacKuen et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912912449697">Valentino, Gregorowicz, and Groenendyk 2009</xref>). Anger may facilitate participation, though not necessarily <italic>thoughtful</italic> participation. Fear and sadness may increase effortful information processing, but with the adverse consequence of demobilization.</p>
<p>It is important to underscore the limitations of this project. On the whole, the project explored only four emotions, yet other emotions may be politically consequential, such as disgust. Future work should more precisely detail the consequences of these emotions. Candidates also appeal to a broader array of emotions, and an advantageous avenue of future research is to detail the consequences of more emotional appeals. Moreover, future work should establish whether particular emotions resonate differently with certain voters. For example, does political expertise moderate the consequences of emotional campaign messages? Perhaps with greater empirical scrutiny of specific emotions, we will more fully understand why some campaigns are so successful in meeting the dual goals of persuasion and mobilization.</p>

<p>The first study also included a number of political participation questions. There were significant differences in political participation across the four conditions. However, because a nontrivial amount of content varies across conditions, these results were not included. Cell sizes are as follows: enthusiasm <italic>n</italic> = 66; sadness <italic>n</italic> = 74; fear <italic>n</italic> = 73; anger <italic>n</italic> = 74.</p>

<p>It is important to note that a model absent the happiness cross-loading provided an acceptable, albeit somewhat inferior, fit to data (CFI = .982, TLI = .969, RMSEA = .108).</p>

<p>A manipulation check indicated that the correct emotions were elicited in each condition. Specifically, an anger scale was created based on reported disgust and anger (<italic>r</italic><sub>polychoric</sub> = .64); a sadness scale was created from sadness and depression (<italic>r</italic><sub>polychoric</sub> = .65). A 2 × 2 ANOVA was conducted with emotional appeal and cues entered as covariates. For felt anger, the two-way interaction approached significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 270) = 2.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .15; the main effect of cue appeal was marginally significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 270) = 3.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10; the main effect of the emotion manipulation approached significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 270) = 2.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .12. The reason for a nonsignificant interaction was that while anger was highest in the high cue, anger appeal condition (<italic>M</italic> = 0.586, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.191), the remaining means were approximately equal (anger/no cue: <italic>M</italic> = 0.486, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.277; sadness/cue: <italic>M</italic> = 0.491, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.266; sadness/no cue: <italic>M</italic> = 0.482, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.279). Anger was more pronounced in the cue anger condition relative to the no cue anger condition (<italic>t</italic><sub>121</sub> = 2.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, one-tailed), higher than the cue sadness condition (<italic>t</italic><sub>130</sub> = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025, one-tailed), and higher than anger in the no cue sadness condition (<italic>t</italic><sub>125</sub> = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025, one-tailed). Regarding sadness, neither the two-way cue × emotion interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 270) = 0.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .62, nor the emotional manipulation main effect were significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 270) = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .40, though the main effect for the cue was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 270) = 8.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The sadness ad absent the cue elicited less sadness (<italic>M</italic> = 0.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.25) relative to the same ad with the cue manipulation (<italic>M</italic> = 0.49, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.27), a difference that is significant (<italic>t</italic><sub>149</sub> = 1.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, one-tailed). However, the anger ad with the cue manipulation elicited comparable levels of sadness (<italic>M</italic> = 0.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.25; <italic>t</italic><sub>130</sub> = 0.23, <italic>ns</italic>), though the anger ad lacking the emotional cue manipulation elicited less sadness (<italic>M</italic> = 0.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.28) relative to the cue, sad ad (<italic>t</italic><sub>145</sub> = 2.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, one-tailed). While the emotion manipulation was not as clean as anticipated—perhaps because of the complexity of the stimuli—the subsequent contrasts made in the article are not problematic: the sadness ad elicits primarily sadness, but not anger; the anger ad, on the other hand, elicits a combination of sadness and anger. Because these emotions often have countervailing effects, I anticipate this provides a more, not less, conservative test of the primary hypothesis that anger mobilizes.</p>

<p>Because of the “gender gap” in political participation, gender is included as a control variable. However, the substantive conclusions remain unchanged by excluding gender from the model.</p>

<p>Coders were instructed that they were to code the advertisement based on the intended emotional appeal, not necessarily the emotion they experienced in response to the ad. They were told to metaphorically step in the shoes of the candidate or advertiser and make an inference about the emotion the ad was designed to evoke. This is similar to the procedure employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912449697">Brader (2006)</xref>. All ads were coded on a graded scale from 1 (<italic>no appeal</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strong appeal</italic>). Coders then classified ads based on a number of emotions. I analyze the degree of “fear,” “sadness,” “hope,” and “anger” in the ads. Because I am interested not in the extremity of the appeal but rather in a count of how many appeals occurred in a media market, the variable was recoded to be a binary variable (1 = <italic>emotion present</italic>, 0 = <italic>absent</italic>) and a count variable was generated.</p>
