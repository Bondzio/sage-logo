<p>Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter have written a wonderful book that earns its place within a growing genre of books, including McKenzie Wark’s <italic>Hacker Manifesto</italic>, Alexander Galloway’s <italic>Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture</italic>, Tiziana Terranova’s <italic>Network Culture: Politics for the Information Age</italic>, and Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi’s <italic>Precarious Rhapsody: Semiocapitalism and the Pathologies of the Post-Alpha Generation</italic>, all of which combine contemporary radical social theory with an in-depth analysis of the Liberatory possibilities of new media technologies. In this project Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter avoid the neo-luddite declension narratives or facile celebrations of ‘gaming’ that have become common among North American new media critics.</p>
<p>Building upon the tradition of autonomist Marxism explored in Dyer-Witheford’s previous book, <italic>Cybermarx</italic> (particularly chapters 3 and 4), the authors present contemporary capital not as a thing with its own internal laws of development, but rather as an antagonistic relation. Capital attempts to reduce labor to a mere object, the dead labor of <italic>labour power</italic>, while ‘the working-class,’ although within the capitalist relation, seeks a way out of work, wage, and the extraction of profit through the affirmation of its capacities, which constantly exceed capitalist command (i.e. living labor). In <italic>Cybermarx</italic> this antagonism was defined as Capital against the working class. This same antagonism reappears in <italic>Games of Empire</italic>, reimagined with Hardt and Negri’s latest conceptual contributions and within the reality of contemporary transnational Capital, as the mechanisms of capture belonging to <italic>Empire</italic> against the self-organized vitality of the <italic>multitude</italic>.</p>
<p>With this insight in mind, <italic>Games of Empire</italic> appropriately begins with ‘Immaterial labor: a workers’ history of videogaming’, explicitly bridging autonomist perspectives and videogaming so as to provide a strong theoretical framework anchored in the identification of antagonisms. The following chapters tell the story of the video game industry’s major ‘players’, from game designers (increasingly indistinguishable from its actual players in its ‘player force’) to their worldwide nemesis in the transnational network of videogame piracy; from corporate console producers to the ‘hardcore gamer’ who is interpellated into (or, rather, produced in) the role of militaristic thug in games such as <italic>Full Spectrum Warrior</italic>, <italic>World of Warcraft</italic>, and <italic>Grand Theft Auto</italic>. The authors then analyze gaming’s potential as a site for unraveling such subjectivities by feminist game designers and players. Videogames afford two key instruments for the multitude to move beyond Empire. First, gaming unwittingly trains participants to build an experimental grasp of ‘totality’. Second, videogames are powerful sites for the virtual rehearsal of ‘counter-planning’, where movements can experimentally develop large-scale alternative regimes of political organization that induce widespread forms of horizontal participation and social cooperation.</p>
<p>Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter apply their autonomist perspective to these phenomena to show that, counter to much analysis on the subject, gaming is neither simply the handmaiden for contemporary Empire nor the site for some form of vanguard political action. Rather, gaming is simply a new battlefield where forces and counter-forces meet, clash, and frequently morph into their opposing camps, making video games the ‘paradigmatic’ media for both Empire and the forces of ‘immaterial labor’ that oppose it. Gaming is, then, and this I believe to be the authors’ ultimate contribution, a privileged site from which to witness and understand the hologramatic shadowing between Empire and multitude that seems to best characterize our era as a whole.</p>
<p>Yet, if despite demographic shifts, the average videogame <italic>aficionado</italic> is white, male, early 30s and relatively affluent, as the authors note, isn’t the ambivalence between Empire and the immaterial laborer simply a doubling of the relatively privileged position of this worker within Empire? One wonders of the potential intensity of liberatory antagonisms among other segments of the multitude who remain less visible, those who do not have a dependable wage, or whose experience of inner city zones of abandonment is lived out in daily life and not mediated primarily through a video-screen (even if they too partake in the pleasures of gaming). This is not to point out the shortcomings of <italic>Games of Empire</italic>, but rather to express serious hesitations regarding the desire for the relatively valorized immaterial worker to move us beyond Empire.</p>
