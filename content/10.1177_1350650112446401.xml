<abstract>
<p>The main difficulties of brake disc infrared temperature measurements are the unknown of disc surface emissivity, non-uniform and time-varying, and the high rotation speed and deceleration of the disc, which makes it difficult to follow the special distribution of the temperature. To provide information on the emissivity variation during braking, brake disc temperature and emissivity were investigated by an original optic-fiber two-color pyrometer combined with an infrared camera, which allows monitoring the true friction areas. In addition, an optical top-tour was used to identify disc revolutions. The evolutions of the surface temperature and emissivity on successive disc revolutions were successfully determined. It was showed that circumferential thermal gradients form on the surface and maintain their angular position, they can, however, win or lose in intensity with braking progress.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650112446401" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Friction brakes transform large amounts of kinetic energy into heat at the contact interfaces between brake rotors and stators; this takes place over relatively short periods of time, particularly in the case of emergency braking. The heat generated by friction and its distribution in the contact area are complex phenomena that can directly affect brake performance. Indeed, a rise in temperature may lead to thermal stresses that may, in turn, cause surface degradation such as thermomechanical failure, especially premature cracking,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112446401">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112446401">2</xref></sup> as well as chemical damage such as oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112446401">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112446401">4</xref></sup> More specifically, it has been well established that the limit of friction brakes is generally related to the temperature levels and distribution on the rubbed surface, from which the thermomechanical loading experienced by the brake disc may indeed be determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112446401">5</xref></sup> Thus, given all of the above, it is clear that the disc surface temperature during braking is an important factor in the failure of brake discs. Therefore, the true surface temperature and its spatial and temporal variation during braking is a vital element that must be taken into account in the design of brake components.</p>
<p>Despite the many investigations that have been reported in the literature over the past few decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112446401">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650112446401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650112446401"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650112446401">9</xref></sup> thermal measurements in braking remain particularly tricky and unclear for several different reasons. These include, among others: the very high rotational speeds involved, especially during emergency braking;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112446401">10</xref></sup> modifications of the surface condition, which is not uniform and varies over time as a result of continuous changes in friction conditions; the heterogeneity of third-body debris and their distribution in the contact area;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112446401">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112446401">12</xref></sup> and finally, the fact that the true contact area is not uniform and changes during braking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650112446401">13</xref></sup> The non-contact method of measuring temperatures – also known as the radiometric method – uses infrared thermography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650112446401">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112446401"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112446401">16</xref></sup> or pyrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112446401">17</xref></sup> to determine the temperature of a disc based on its surface luminance. However, the lack of information on the surface emissivity and how it varies over space and time makes it difficult to accurately determine the disc surface temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112446401">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112446401">19</xref></sup> In a recent investigation, an original combination of a high-speed, fiber-optic two-color pyrometer developed for braking applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112446401">20</xref></sup> and an infrared (IR) camera enabled us to correctly measure the surface temperature of a brake disc during friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112446401">21</xref></sup> However, in this particular work, we did not study the surface temperature and emissivity as a function of disc rotation angle, which is in fact of great importance in monitoring the disc surface temperature over space and time.</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of the present article is to provide information about the non-uniformity and space/time variation of the surface temperature and emissivity of a brake disc during several successive revolutions at various braking stages. The brake disc surface temperature and emissivity were investigated by means of a fiber-optic two-color pyrometer combined with an IR camera. This pyrometer was used to determine local disc surface temperatures and emissivities while the IR camera monitored the true friction areas (contact localization). An optical trigger was used to keep track of disc revolutions and synchronize the IR camera and two-color pyrometer measurements. Finally, in order to study the correlation between thermal aspects and friction forces, we conducted a time–frequency analysis of the emissivity, the two-color temperature measurements and the friction forces for the entire stop-braking simulation.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1350650112446401"><title>Tribometer</title>
<p>Stop-braking experiments were performed on a pin-on-disc braking tribometer developed at the Laboratoire de Mécanique de Lille. This high-performance tribometer is capable of reproducing, at a reduced scale, the loading conditions and thermal levels reached during railway stop-braking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112446401">22</xref></sup> In addition, a scale conversion rule has been developed in order to calculate the mean surface temperature rises that occur at full scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112446401">23</xref></sup> This involves a three-parameter set comprising the mean contact pressure, the initial sliding velocity and the braking duration, which are determined in such a way as to reproduce thermal loadings observed at full scale. A schematic drawing of this tribometer and the geometry of the specimens (disc and pin) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112446401">Figure 1</xref>(a) and (b), respectively. The disc is driven by an electric motor with a rotational speed of up to 4000 rpm (i.e. a maximum sliding velocity of 70 ms<sup>−1</sup> at the maximum radius of 160 mm). Control of the disc rotation enables us to simulate moments of inertia around the flywheel, whose own moment of inertia is 3.35 kgm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112446401">2</xref></sup>. The hydraulic actuator applies a normal load of up to 1200 N on the pad. The tribometer instrumentation is composed of a tachometer for measuring rotational speeds and a 3D piezoelectric sensor (located behind the pad) for measuring the friction forces (normal, tangential and radial), which are used to calculate the friction coefficient µ.

<sec id="sec4-1350650112446401"><title>Materials investigated</title>
<p>The materials investigated were commercial friction materials designed for railway braking applications in intra-urban travel. The friction pair consisted of a C-45 steel for the disc and an organic matrix composite (OMC) for the pad. This pad was made up of more than 30 components, including steel and mineral fibers and ceramic particles, all embedded in a phenolic resin matrix. In terms of shape, the disc had a friction track that was 16 mm wide and 22 mm thick, with an average friction radius of 100 mm. The pad was elongated and bean-shaped in the sliding direction, measuring 16 mm wide, 15 mm thick, and spanning an angle of 39° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112446401">Figure 1</xref>(b)).</p>
<p>Before conducting the friction experiments, the disc had to be polished up to grade 320 in order to eliminate any machining defects in particular grooves. This was followed by grinding, which was achieved through stop-braking at low energy levels (∼22 kJ). Such grinding helped to ensure good contact between the mating surfaces (pad and disc). During this step of grinding the contact conformity is obtained by the wear up of the pad.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1350650112446401"><title>Surface temperature measurements</title>
<p>The disc surface temperature was determined by using an original coupling of two complementary thermal measurement devices, namely an IR camera and a fiber-optic two-color pyrometer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112446401">21</xref></sup> whose characteristics are described below.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1350650112446401"><title>IR camera</title>
<p>The IR camera used in this study was a JADE from CEDIP (InSb detectors 256 × 320 pitch: 30 mm, temperature range: 0–1200 °C, maximum acquisition rate: 170 frames/s, spectral range: 3–5 µm). Fitted with a 100 mm lens, the IR camera was located 1 m from the rubbing surface and positioned in such a way as to observe the lower right-hand portion of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112446401">Figure 1</xref>(b)). This camera enabled us to monitor the true friction areas and their evolution during braking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1350650112446401"><title>Fiber-optic two-color pyrometer</title>
<p>The fiber-optic two-color pyrometer, which was specially developed at the Laboratoire de Mécanique et d’Enérgétique in Valenciennes for braking applications, measured the temperature at a single point located on the average friction radius (100 mm) at 90° from the center of the pad-disc contact region (corresponding to an angular length of 157 mm); this point is situated at the top right-hand corner of the region observed by the IR camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112446401">Figure 1</xref>(b)). The optical fiber was placed close to the pad-disc contact using a black mounting bracket, which was kept at near room temperature in order to avoid reflections on the brake disc surface. The distance between the fiber and the rubbed surface of the disc was 5 mm, which corresponds to a spot diameter of 2.4 mm. The two-color pyrometer comprised two HgCdTe detectors (temperature range of 200–1000 °C and response time of 8 μs) equipped with two bandwidth filters (λ1 = 2.55 µm and λ2 = 3.9 µm), a fluoride glass optical fiber, and a data conditioning and acquisition device. This two-color pyrometer was used to measure the energy radiated by the brake disc for the two bandwidth filters (central wavelengths λ1 and λ2). The disc surface temperature was determined from the voltage ratio of the wavelength outputs, based on the assumption of grey-body behavior (disc surface emissivity was assumed to remain constant between λ1 and λ2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112446401">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650112446401">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350650112446401">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pyrometer detectors, which are cooled by means of the thermoelectric effect, i.e. thermoelectric cooling, detect temperatures from approximately 220 °C onwards. Thus, temperature and emissivity data were only obtained for surface temperatures above 220 °C. The uncertainty of the temperature measurements was verified in a previous work: it was less than 8 °C for temperatures higher than 300 °C, and was found to decrease with increasing temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112446401">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec9-1350650112446401"><title>Monitoring of disc revolutions and synchronization of data</title>
<p>An optical trigger was used to keep track of the disc revolutions and therefore synchronize the IR camera and two-color pyrometer measurements. This optical trigger delivered a signal each time an optical reflector that was stuck onto the disc came into alignment with its detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112446401">Figure 1</xref>(b)).</p>
<p>At the first signal:
<list id="list1-1350650112446401" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>–the acquisition of the two-color pyrometer was turned on at a frequency of 1 kHz;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>–the acquisition of the IR camera was turned on at a frequency of 50 Hz.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Knowing both the acquisition time for each image and the optical trigger signal made it possible to determine the two-color pyrometer measurements corresponding to the same area observed by the IR camera.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that apart from the data recorded by the IR camera, all other experimental data, i.e. from tribological measurements (normal and tangential forces), the two-color pyrometer detectors and the optical trigger, were recorded at the same frequency (1 kHz) in the same data acquisition system. This centralized system made it possible to correlate all the experimental data.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1350650112446401"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>In order to heat up the disc surface, several successive stop-braking operations with heat accumulation were conducted prior to the actual stop-braking experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350650112446401">26</xref></sup> Data acquisition was only activated when the disc surface temperature reached 220 °C (minimum operating temperature of the two-color pyrometer detectors).</p>
<p>The operating parameters were:
<list id="list2-1350650112446401" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>–an initial surface temperature of 220 °C;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>–a normal force of 720 N, corresponding to a contact pressure of 0.6 MPa;</p></list-item>

</list></p>
<p>These experimental parameters were chosen in order to achieve a total energy dissipation level of ∼100 kJ. According to scale conversion rules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112446401">23</xref></sup> this corresponds to the amount of energy dissipated by each disc during full-scale railway stop-braking (urban train) with an initial speed of ∼80 km/h.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1350650112446401"><title>Friction coefficient</title>
<p>The instantaneous friction coefficient was obtained by dividing the tangential force (generated by friction) by the normal one. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112446401">Figure 2</xref> presents the instantaneous friction coefficient as a function of time for the entire stop-braking experiment. This graph shows that under the chosen operating conditions, the friction coefficient remained relatively constant at the beginning of stop-braking, with an average value of ∼0.32. This was followed by a slight increase and the appearance of a “bulge” at about <italic>t</italic> = 35 s, at which point its average value reached ∼0.37, then subsequently decreased. In the next section, we will discuss this friction “bulge” in relation to the true friction areas. Another noteworthy aspect of the graph is that the fluctuations in the friction coefficient were relatively small, starting with an average amplitude of approximately 0.03, which increased only slightly to 0.05 towards the end of the experiment. This relatively small fluctuation amplitude is indicative of stable friction conditions throughout the stop-braking experiment.

<sec id="sec14-1350650112446401"><title>Thermography of the disc track</title>
<p>The IR camera allowed us to monitor the effective friction areas over time. However, the true temperature could not be calculated as the surface emissivity was unknown at this stage. Thus, the measurements of the IR camera presented in this section only focused on monitoring the effective heated areas and their evolution during the experiment. As previously mentioned, the IR camera only observed the lower right-hand part of the brake disc.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112446401">Figure 3</xref> gives the evolution of the disc surface temperature on the outer (∼107 mm), mid (100 mm) and Inner (∼93 mm) radii during the stop-braking experiment. It should be mentioned that at this stage, disc surface temperatures were calculated based on the assumption of blackbody behavior (i.e. surface emissivity ε = 1). From this figure, we can see that the disc surface temperature at each radius followed the same pattern, which was characterized by an increase, a peak value, and finally a decrease. This peak temperature was first attained on the outer radius, followed by the mid-radius and finally the inner radius. This thermal behavior corresponds to the formation of a hot band on the outer radius of the friction track at the beginning of the braking process, which then migrated towards the inner radius as braking proceeded. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112446401">Figure 3</xref> clearly shows that the migration of the hot band from the outer to the inner radius was accompanied by a rise in temperature within the hot band itself. Nevertheless, temperatures at the inner and mid-radii decreased towards the end of stop-braking as a result of decreasing heat input, which was, in turn, due to the drop in disc sliding velocity. This suggests the occurrence of “contact homogenization”, which led to an increase in the true friction area between the mating surfaces, and therefore an increase in the friction coefficient in the form of the “bulge” that was observed towards the end of the stop-braking experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112446401">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>The formation and migration of hot bands occurs systematically in friction brakes and has previously been reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112446401">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112446401">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112446401">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350650112446401">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350650112446401">28</xref></sup> These thermal localizations pertain to disc deflection and distortion induced by thermal expansion and wear of components in particular of the pad. Hot band relates to the localization of the contact at the pad-disc interface: contact is closed inside the hot band, open outside. There is a strong link between the contact opening and oxide layer formation. During braking, the open area allows the growing of oxides on the disc track, leading to formation of oxide layers, while oxides are continually eliminated by friction in the hot band. In fact observations of pads and discs at different steps of the hot-band migration show powder layers formed on the worn surfaces ahead of the hot band formed on the disc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112446401">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350650112446401">28</xref></sup></p>

<p>The disc surface temperature and emissivity were calculated from the signals recorded by the detectors of the two-color pyrometer. This measurement considers the surface emissivity of each point of the disc viewed by the detectors. For this reason, the temperature determined in this way is called the “true temperature”. Given that the optical fiber of the pyrometer was positioned in such a way as to focus on the mid-radius of the friction track, the true temperatures and emissivities given in this section apply to this mid-radius. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112446401">Figure 4</xref> shows the plots of true temperature and emissivity against stop-braking time. The occurrence of a hot band on the mid-radius is easily distinguishable: this corresponds to the point at which the surface temperature reached its peak value of 400 °C, i.e. at <italic>t</italic> = 15 s. It may also be observed that the temperature experienced instantaneous fluctuations of relatively large amplitude (∼110 °C). These fluctuations suggest the presence of circumferential thermal gradients arising from circumferential thermomechanical deformation, which subsequently led to an increase in the normal force and consequently the tangential one. In a previous paper, we successfully correlated such temperature fluctuations with the normal and tangential forces in the contact area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112446401">21</xref></sup> As for the emissivity at mid-radius, a noticeable dip occurred upon the formation of the hot band: as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112446401">Figure 4</xref>, the minimum emissivity of ∼0.25 coincided with the peak surface temperature of approximately 400 °C at <italic>t</italic> = 15 s. Subsequently, the emissivity increased and reached an average value of ∼0.6.

From this, we may observe that the true temperatures and thermal gradients measured by the two-color pyrometer were significantly greater than those obtained by using the IR camera and assuming blackbody behavior (ε = 1). This clearly illustrates the limitations of using an IR camera for the quantitative analysis of thermal values and gradients in braking applications.

<p>In order to monitor the evolution of the surface temperature and emissivity, we plotted their values for successive complete revolutions (360° disc rotations) at different stop-braking stages, and more specifically at <italic>t</italic> = 15, 25 and 40 s. To do so, we used an optical trigger device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112446401">Figure 6</xref>) to help us keep track of the disc revolutions. This provided us with the first and last data points of a given disc revolution, which therefore enabled us to plot the profile of surface temperature and emissivity for complete disc revolutions (360°) and track any variations during the stop-braking process.

These results suggest that once circumferential thermal gradients develop, the resulting profiles do not move circumferentially during stop-braking. However, their intensity may increase or decrease over time, depending on the evolution of the friction conditions in the contact area.

These profiles show a decrease in emissivity gradients (fluctuations) and a stabilization of the average emissivity around 0.6. This behavior is indicative of emissivity homogenization arising from rapid oxidation of the friction track – a phenomenon that will be described in greater detail in the next section. If we consider the evolution of emissivity at mid-radius during stop-braking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112446401">Figure 5</xref>), we observe that it increased significantly between <italic>t</italic> = 15 s (occurrence of the hot band) and <italic>t</italic> = 25 s (middle of the stop-braking process). The IR thermograms show that during this period, there was no friction at mid-radius; therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the surface roughness here remained constant. Under such conditions, the variation of the surface emissivity may be largely attributed to physicochemical surface modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112446401">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350650112446401">30</xref></sup> Consequently, we can conclude that in our case, the surface emissivity was very sensitive to the physicochemical surface conditions, which changed rapidly and continuously during braking, most notably in terms of variations in the local friction conditions within the contact area (formation and elimination of an oxide coating).</p>
<p>This finding is of great importance in the field of thermal measurement in braking applications. Indeed, it clearly demonstrates that surface emissivity is not uniform over space and time, and must therefore be measured in situ. Any post-friction quantification of the surface emissivity would give rise to significant errors resulting from surface oxidation, and consequently lead to erroneous values of surface temperature.</p>

Due to the asymmetry of the contact, the normal load and the thermal expansion induced progressive axial bending of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112446401">Figure 10</xref>). This disc bending was monitored thanks to a high frequency displacement sensor which was located in such a way to observe the mid radius of the disc. The bending of the disc led to radial migration of the localized contact between the mating surfaces from the outer to the inner radius. At the beginning of the stop-braking experiment (stage 1), contact was localized on the outer radius, and the oxide coating there was thus eliminated by friction. Subsequently, as contact localization migrated towards the mid-radius (stage 2), a new oxide coating formed rapidly on the outer radius. This regeneration of an oxide coating may have been accelerated by the elevated temperature, the presence of oxygen and the absence of friction (outer radius in stages 2 and 3 and mid-radius in stage 3).

<sec id="sec19-1350650112446401"><title>Frequencies of temperature, emissivity and friction forces</title>
<p>In order to study any potential correlation between thermal aspects and friction forces, we conducted a time–frequency analysis of the emissivity, the two-color temperature measurements and the friction forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1350650112446401">Figure 11</xref>). To do so, frequency was plotted against time. It should be noted that the data obtained from the two-color pyrometer (temperature and emissivity) only apply to surface temperatures above 220 °C, this being the minimum operating temperature of the two-color pyrometer. We can easily identify the harmonics of the rotational speed, the first of which corresponds to a frequency of 25 Hz (at the beginning of braking). Although these harmonics decreased with decreasing disc rotation speed as the braking experiment proceeded, their intensity persisted. These results clearly show that in the present case, the circumferential thermal and emissivity gradients maintained their positions throughout the braking process, thus confirming the results presented in the previous section. It should be noted that the highest values were reached when the hot band crossed the mid-radius. This time–frequency representation also confirms the good correlation between surface temperature and emissivity, as well as that between the normal and tangential components of the dynamic friction forces. There is also a strong correlation between surface temperature and friction forces at the low harmonics (1, 2 and 3), but not at the high harmonics (4, 5 and 6), which suggests that contact dynamics play an important role in energy dissipation in braking applications.

<p>The surface temperature and emissivity variations during railway stop-braking were investigated by using an IR camera in combination with a fiber-optic two-color pyrometer. Stop-braking experiments were performed on a pin-on-disc braking tribometer capable of reproducing, at a reduced scale, the mechanical and thermal loading in full-scale railway braking. The materials investigated were an organic matrix composite for the pin and a C-45 steel for the disc. The IR camera was used to monitor contact localization by tracking the true friction areas during the experiment, while the two-color pyrometer enabled us to determine the evolution of true surface temperature and emissivity, which were calculated based on the signals recorded by the detectors of the two-color pyrometer.</p>
<p>During the initial stage of stop-braking, a hot band would systematically develop on the outer radius of the friction track. It would then migrate progressively towards the inner radius as braking proceeded. This hot band is attributed to contact localization and is therefore associated with an increase in temperature and a decrease in surface emissivity arising from changing contact conditions (more specifically, the elimination and regeneration of an oxide coating). The two-color pyrometer used in this study also enabled us to monitor the surface temperature and emissivity during successive disc revolutions at various stages of the stop-braking process. It was shown that circumferential thermal gradients developed on the disc surface, and that the resulting profiles maintained their angular position throughout the experiment. However, their intensity could increase or decrease as braking proceeded, depending on the friction conditions in the contact area. The development of such gradients may well constitute the first step in the formation of hot spots, a very familiar phenomenon in braking.</p>
<p>It was also shown that disc surface emissivity experienced strong variations during braking, with values ranging from 0.35 to 0.8. This is a good illustration of the difficulty in correctly estimating disc temperature and thermal gradients by using an IR camera and assuming uniform and constant emissivity. In addition, it was demonstrated that the emissivity depended strongly on the physicochemical surface conditions, which changed rapidly and continuously during friction, most notably due to the elimination and regeneration of an oxide coating. It was demonstrated that the circumferential temperature and emissivity profiles that developed on the disc surface moved radially but not circumferentially, and that their intensities changed with varying friction conditions during braking. A strong correlation between surface temperature and friction forces was observed for low-frequency phenomena, but not for high-frequency ones. This suggests that contact dynamics play an important role in the energy dissipation process.</p>
