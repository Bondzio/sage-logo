<p>It is well known that companies are putting primacy on managing people as strategic priorities. It is becoming critical for managers that they develop global business competencies and stop relying on their rootedness to singular cultures. Some business schools have begun teaching international human resource management (IHRM) as a core course to their MBA students. The discipline of IHRM is reflecting changes in its content so as to accommodate the latest thinking in that area. Larger number of companies are being seen giving particular attention to, among others, issues such as global leadership development, cultural awareness training and global communication plans. With more number of companies operating globally, they feel an urgent need to build global leaders who can deliver results in cross-cultural settings. At the same time, companies from the high-growth emerging markets are becoming major global investors. This has led to reduction of the advanced world share in a number of world’s largest corporations; and several companies from countries like China, India, Taiwan, Mexico and Brazil are showing up, making their presence felt in the top 500 company club. In view of the rising importance of global operations of companies, the academic world is gradually responding to offer better texts, cases and other teaching material. Quite a few new texts have come out, and many existing ones are being brought out with updated better material.</p>
<p>The book under review is a substantially updated or even transformed version of its 4th edition. Despite the availability of the new material, not much can be said to be interesting enough, including the 4th edition of this book. But the same is not true of the present edition. The new contents in this edition are going to make the book one of the leading texts/casebooks and a source of material on the subject. Its contents are divided into five parts; each part consisting some relevant and interesting cases and material (in the form of thematic chapters) on the subject. These are: the context of IHRM; cross-national and global leadership; training, performance management and compensation issues for global managers; people issues in international teams, alliances, mergers and acquisitions; and global business ethics and corporate social responsibility. In all, there are 16 chapters consisting of readings, and 15 cases on some of the most important topics in the subject.</p>
<p>The best part of the book is the new introductory case (titled: The white waters of Robin Earl) that has been added. The case contains in it material as well. The authors have hinted that ‘white matter’ here refers to ‘unpredictable, dynamic nature of doing business’. This synthetic case is what I like the best way of expounding the intricacies of the issues involved in IHRM. It raises all possible issues in a coherent manner through an interesting story. I think book writers in any management discipline can learn lessons from this approach.</p>
<p>As far as other contents are concerned, interestingly, the chapter writers are not wholly prescriptive but are largely analytical in building their formulations. Yet, the book’s hallmark is lucidity, coherence, precision and rootedness of the material in research. These features make the book still more useful. Most part of the material and cases are focused on contemporary practices resorted to by multi-national companies (MNCs) in different continents. Cultural realities operating in several countries have been cited as examples to buttress formulations. HR practices have been analyzed in the context of the prevailing socio-economic forces. Another great strength of the book is Part 3, which I believe is its most important part. It deals with cases and material on expatriation issues. This issue no doubt is the crux of IHRM anywhere. A large number of failed experiments are noted in the literature on the inability of the expatriates to understand and behave as per the expectations of the local environment. This part rigorously discusses emerging alternatives in expatriation management, problems and solutions related to their performance appraisal and intertwining local perspectives to expatriate success. Studies have revealed that lack of the requisite support by HR department to international assignees is often wanting or that line and HR handling of these issues is often not quite competently integrated, which may result in the failure of the expatriation exercise in many cases. But the book handles these issues quite competently. The cases are on problems in fourteen different countries. I must say, however, that while a substantial part of the contents and cases are focused on China, there is almost no material or case on India at all, barring a few examples on ethics. Interestingly, there is a good case on violation of child rights in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Overall, the book represents a thoughtful collection of material and cases on international HRM. It contains a useful analysis of issues in globalization dynamics and its cross-cultural implications for managing people. It will also help managers who want to acquire knowledge of contextual understanding of cross-cultural issues. I must say without doubt that those managing HR in global settings or wanting to acquire global HR competencies must read this book from cover to cover, which is what I ended up doing, and I enjoyed the exercise thoroughly. I have been teaching a global HRM course to Global MBA students in a foreign locale where I was using this book’s 4th edition only as a reference book. But I find that the present edition is so beautifully conceptualized and caters to the contemporary needs of academics and the learners that this is going to be my textbook now onwards until something still better gets my attention. One may also use cases from this text if one wants to adopt some other text on the subject. The cases are mostly of medium length, and will be especially liked by students. The book has succeeded well in its attempt to articulate the complexity of the IHRM issues in actual settings. It provides a great help to resolving Robin Earl’s (the imaginary HR Director in the case in the book’s preface) dilemmas while she is drafting a report for her CEO. Kudos to the editors and the publishers!</p>
