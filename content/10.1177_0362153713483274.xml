<p>Transactional analysis as a therapeutic method is based on the assumption that words and gestures can have a therapeutic effect without any bodily contact with the patient beyond a handshake. If a transactional analyst considers that bodily contact is desirable for a certain patient, he refers her to a dance class, sensory-awareness group, or a “permission class.” Permission classes differ from the other two because they are run by people trained in transactional analysis who follow the prescription of the therapist rather than imposing their own theories or needs upon the patient. Thus, the transactional analyst may decide: “This patient needs hugging, but I can’t hug him and still do well-planned therapy, so I’ll refer him to a permission class with a prescription for hugging. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713483274">Berne, 1972</xref>, p. 371)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section1-0362153713483274">
<title>In the Beginning</title>
<p>This quote, opening Eric Berne’s (1972) discussion of “The Dynamics of Permission” (pp. 370–376), is so remarkable that it merits an article all on its own. For example, we might wonder about the circumstances that Berne imagined would require a prescription rather than a contract. Why his sudden shift to the authority of a physician, away from the mutual consent and consideration of a contract? What is the theoretical or clinical basis for his insistence that in the practice of transactional analysis psychotherapy there be no bodily contact? Berne stressed that permission classes be run as groups to ensure that “the patient does not get individual hugging or individual dancing exercises” (p. 371). His strident position leads me to wonder what sorts of unnamed hell and chaos he feared would break loose, in the process destroying the treatment (or perhaps the transactional analyst).</p>
<p>In quite an extraordinary passage, Berne described his personal experience in a permission class, groups that were created by Claude Steiner and his wife in the late 1960s (C. Steiner, personal communication, 15 July 2012). I quote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713483274">Berne (1972</xref>) here at some length:
<disp-quote>
<p>Dr. Q [Berne] attended a permission class in order to find out how it felt and what he could learn. When the instructor suggested: “Everybody sit on the floor,” the voices in his head said: “My Child and my Adult agree to accept your suggestion to sit on the floor,” and he did so. Where was his Parent? His Adult and Parent had previously agreed that the Parent would leave the Child free to do as he pleased, under some Adult control, unless things “went too far,” i.e. got too sexy. His Child did get slightly aroused but there was no need for the Parent to come out, since his Adult was quite able to handle the situation. This gives some clue as to how permission takes effect. (p. 372)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While I think this paragraph reveals more about Berne’s level of sexual anxiety than it does about the nature of permissions, he did then elaborate his ideas about permission, which he described as “the decision intervention for script analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713483274">Berne, 1972</xref>, p. 372). In these few pages of his <italic>Hello</italic> book, Berne seemed to be thinking out loud to himself, in a few short pages generating several ideas that he never fully thought through in terms of their contradictions. But these ideas have come to be incorporated in the transactional analysis canon. He outlined a sequence of permission transactions that have become fundamental in the practice of transactional analysis and that were central to how Berne distinguished transactional analysis methodology from that of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Berne was clearly situating the permission transaction as essential for script change, introducing the importance of protection and potency, too, as psychological safeguards while clients incorporate permissions to change. He insisted, “Potency means power to confront. ‘If’ and ‘but’ do not signify potency to a Child. Any permission which contains an ‘if’ in the form of a condition or a threat, is no good, and if it is conditioned, qualified, or reduced by a ‘but’ it is no good either” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713483274">Berne, 1972</xref>, p. 375).</p>
<p>And yet, to my mind, it is a curious contradiction—an “if” and a “but”—that at these crucial therapeutic junctures a transactional analysis therapist might refer the patient to a permission class in which someone else would carry out the therapist’s “prescription.” What does this referral do to the therapist’s potency? I think a therapist’s or counselor’s potency is better served by the capacity to reflect on his or her own anxiety and uncertainty in making an intervention rather than referring out to a specialist.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are wondering what place this discussion on permission has in a special issue of the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>devoted to examining issues in transactional analysis counseling. I suggest that we find in Berne’s professional anxieties and biases and the creation of permission groups the roots of how counseling in transactional analysis came to be assigned a second-class professional status. In this article I will examine the impact of Berne’s investment in creating a transactional analysis psychotherapy at the expense of other modes of facilitating learning and growth.</p>

<sec id="section2-0362153713483274">
<title>The Creation of “Special Fields”</title>
<p>It is clear that Berne himself conceived of transactional analysis as a psychotherapy. From the start, transactional analysis training and examination resulted in clinical membership in the ITAA, with the requirement that the right to practice had to be in keeping with local regulations. However, with Berne’s idea of permission specialists, there came to be other kinds of transactional analysis practitioners (many of whom lacked traditional academic credentials), and while they were not seen as the “real deal,” they clamored for some form of recognition. In 1972 (after Berne’s death), the ITAA created the category of “Special Member” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0362153713483274">International Transactional Analysis Association, 1972</xref>, p. 5). Such individuals were required to take and pass the TA 101 basic course, receive 100 hours of training, and pass an oral examination based on the presentation of 3 hours of tape-recorded work. Special Members were then authorized to “apply T.A. in specialized fields, teach members of [the] specialized field, attend clinical meetings and congresses, and [have] voting status” (p. 5). Such members could also then go on to become Special Fields Provisional Teaching Members (PTMs).</p>
<p>Permission specialists became Special Fields Members, running groups and workshops typically seen as adjuncts to individuals’ personal therapy and ongoing training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713483274">Bellinger, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713483274">Wyckoff, 1975</xref>). Having myself been a member of the ITAA during those years and in transactional analysis training in the early 1970s, I attended many permission workshops, which typically included structured play activities (mimicking childhood games), dance, massage, and redecision work that seemed suspiciously like psychotherapy. Bellinger, for example, was a special fields PTM who, as a dancer by training, had none of the requirements to pursue clinical certification. But her workshops and groups involved many activities that carried participants into regressed states and often involved clients making redecisions. The main differences that I saw between what she did and what a transactional analysis psychotherapist of that era did were not in what she did not do but more what else she did do, that is, touch and move with her clients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713483274">Wyckoff (1975</xref>), writing from within the radical psychiatry movement of the time, argued, “In doing permission exercises, no one is giving anyone anything they didn’t originally have. People are born O.K., but [are] oppressed away from their full human potential” (p. 108). She gave perhaps the most complete written account of permission classes, which consisted of<italic> “Introduction and Trust; Stroking; Getting O.K.; Being O.K.; and Fantasy” </italic>(p. 109).</p>
<p>Gradually, special fields membership became the landing place for educational and organizational practitioners because they were not seen as clinicians and did not have the right to practice as psychotherapists under U.S. regulations. Being a Special Fields Member was not a happy experience for many as they struggled with their clearly second-class status. In preparation for this article, I contacted Jean Illsley Clarke, who has lived the history of special fields membership in transactional analysis. In response, she wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>Great that you are writing about special fields. It’s about time to get that history out.…Possibly because of the Muriel James/Dorothy Jongeward connection, it appeared to me that in the early days, the special fields people were organizational consultants. They developed a sizable body of theories and methodologies but soon left the ITAA because of the hostile environment (I was told by some of them). I myself recall two leading TA gurus telling me directly that I did not belong in TA because I was an educator, not a therapist, and I was not to come to conferences. I have invited many educators into the ITAA. One or two conferences and they quit. “This is only for therapists,” they tell me.</p>
<p>Russ [Osnes] encouraged us educators in his training group, and Joanne Moses, Ph.D. in education, became the first educator to go through the ITAA training and testing system to become a Teaching and Supervising Transactional Analyst. I wrote the article you mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0362153713483274">Clarke, 1981</xref>) in an effort to point out that we educators are not unskilled wanna-be-therapists but a parallel set of professionals who use TA principles with a different professional toolbox of methods and with different goals. We believe a build-on-the-health goal is as valuable as the go-for-the-illness one and that both are necessary if TA is to be adequately used in the population at large.</p>
<p>So, we had TA—the real TAers, the therapists, and the special fields of organizational consultants and educators. Then came the counselors, and now, I hope, the coaches. Because of the therapists-are-OK/special-fields-are-not-OK culture, the discounting was (and still often is) pervasive and discouraging. The counselors, I was told, were more acceptable because they were not quite therapists.</p>
<p>I thought I had died and gone to heaven some years ago when the ITAA board decided to drop the then current use of special fields as a designator of “not therapists” and declare that there were four special fields, always with therapists listed first. Perhaps that message never really got out? (J. I. Clarke, personal communication, 20 June 2012)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clarke’s comments mirror my own observations over many years of membership in the ITAA. There has been an enduring tendency, not only in the United States or the ITAA, but throughout transactional analysis organizations around the world, to view nonclinical applications of transactional analysis as of lesser status (and less substantial).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0362153713483274">
<title>The Status of Counseling</title>
<p>At that time, the vast majority of ITAA members were U.S. and Canadian citizens. In Canada, counseling was a recognized mental health profession, so counselors were often eligible for clinical certification by the ITAA. In the United States, in contrast to many other nations, a psychotherapist was defined on a state-by-state basis, credentials being granted by individual states rather than the federal government. Nonetheless, national organizations had profound influence on state regulations. So, for example, in 1986 the American Mental Health Counselors Association adopted the following definition of the field of practice:
<disp-quote>
<p>Clinical mental health counseling is the provision of professional counseling services involving the application of principles of psychotherapy, human development, learning theory, group dynamics, and the etiology of mental illness and dysfunctional behavior to individuals, families, and groups, for the purpose of promoting optimal mental health, dealing with normal problems of living and treating psychopathology. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713483274">American Mental Health Counselors Association, 2011</xref>, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote>So, in the United States, the main distinction between counseling and other clinical practices was that the insurance companies felt free to pay counselors at a significantly reduced fee in comparison to psychiatrists and psychologists.</p>
<p>In the ITAA, special fields became the membership status for educational and organizational specialists or for anyone else who did not have the right of clinical practice by governmental designation. As the practice of transactional analysis spread worldwide, counseling (especially in many European countries) was not a recognized clinical field, so counseling was also often cast into the special fields category.</p>

<title>Questions Raised in the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal</italic></title>
<p>Looking back on this now 40-year history, it is fascinating to notice how little of this discussion was taken up, developed, or challenged in the pages of the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>(<italic>TAJ</italic>). These classifications and categorizations were the result of administrative and bureaucratic decisions made in training standards committees and examination and certification councils. In the early years of the <italic>TAJ</italic> there would occasionally be a subsection denoted as Special Fields Applications, typically educational or organizational, though it was sometimes hard to tell why certain articles were relegated to that section. In 1978 the <italic>TAJ</italic> had a subsection called Special Fields Applications that contained articles based on organizational and systems theories and techniques. There was no consistent or thoughtful attention to the theoretical development or specific skill sets of the various “special” disciplines.</p>
<p>In 1981 Clarke wrote one of the few articles in the <italic>TAJ</italic> (actually a total of two that I have been able to find) addressing the distinction between clinical and special fields work. She began her article with “You are a Clinician and I am a Special Fields member” (p. 169) and went on to offer a kind of quiz of leadership tasks and functions in groups, inviting the readers to assess their own identifications within clinical or special fields work. The article raised questions for readers to consider in an interesting way. She followed the party line of the ITAA as she wrote, “I think of Special Fields members as people who ‘offer information and structure learning experiences’ and of Clinical members as the people who do that ‘more that is needed’ to help other people deal with script changes” (p. 169). Even so, the <italic>TAJ</italic> editor at that time found it necessary to add a note at the end of the article stating, “The ideas presented in this article are the author’s beliefs and working assumptions. They are not ‘the final statement’ of the differences between CM and SFM” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713483274">McNeel, 1981</xref>, p. 170). Somehow, somewhere along the line, even though Berne clearly designated the permission transactions as fundamental to script change and sanctioned permission classes (perhaps to compensate for his own anxiety and timidity), anything touching on script change had 10 years later been firmly removed from the hands of special fields practitioners. In examinations, it had become as important for special fields members to clearly delineate the limits of their practices as to demonstrate their competencies.</p>
<p>Many years passed, and the European Association for Transactional Analysis (EATA) redefined the fields of transactional analysis practice as psychotherapy, education, organization development, and counseling, delineating the core competencies within each specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713483274">European Association for Transactional Analysis, 2008</xref>, Section 5, pp. 2–14). These new designations were then accepted by the ITAA. The EATA code made it explicit: “There may be national legal restrictions on who can practice as a psychotherapist, and it is important that trainees discuss these with their Principle Supervisor when choosing this field of specialisation” (p. 2). The EATA distinctions between counseling and psychotherapy practices emphasized the attention to building on strengths and resources in counseling in contrast to the diagnostic and script-level interventions in psychotherapy. Both emphasize encouraging the client’s autonomy.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the EATA categorizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713483274">Grégoire (1998</xref>) took up a complex and challenging discussion of these distinctions, examining them within the realities of actual, ongoing practice. He noted that the four fields of application share in common such areas of emphasis as basic transactional analysis theory, the use of contracts, the valuing of autonomy and other philosophical presuppositions, and some styles of intervention. He delineated the central differences as emerging in the contexts of “different types of contracts, diverse organizational contexts, distinct professional competencies…distinct relationships and interventions, [and] conformity with a particular subdomain of transactional analysis” (p. 312).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713483274">Grégoire (1998</xref>) argued that “as applied to therapy, there is a dichotomous way of thinking that is tied to the metaphor of the ‘territorial’ or linear boundary” (p. 313). He then went on to list several common beliefs about essential distinctions among the fields of application:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><italic>“Certain subjects and themes are reserved for therapy.”</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>“The intrapsychic is the domain of therapy, and other fields limit themselves to behavior.”</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>“For the clinical field, structure; for others, function.”</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>“Therapy is the only place for script modification or the only place for redecision.”</italic> (p. 313)</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>He showed how, on closer examination, these traditional biases and assumptions, which I suggest are rooted in the unexamined group canon of transactional analysis, do not hold up in actual practice and cannot be limited to the clinical field. Grégoire then quoted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713483274">Berne (1972</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>The script apparatus is much more flexible than the genetic apparatus and is continually being modified by outside influences, such as life experience and the injunctions inserted by other people.…It may be a casual remark accidentally overheard at a carnival or in a corridor, or it may be the result of a formal relationship such as marriage, school, or psychotherapy. (p. 296)</p>
</disp-quote>This quote again demonstrates that Berne was clearly reconsidering his earlier thinking. His final book, only published in that form because of his sudden death, is full of contradictions and proclamations that he was never able to fully think through in terms of their implications for practice.</p>
<p>Following the Berne quote, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713483274">Grégoire (1998</xref>) then wondered,
<disp-quote>
<p>If script modification can be produced through life experience as well as through psychotherapy, other nontherapy approaches and applications should be considered fertile fields for facilitating script change, because people can find information, permission, protection, and potency in them.…Script modification is often the goal of nonclinical approaches. (p. 314)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For anyone seriously interested in both the history and, more importantly, the future development of transactional analysis counseling (as well as other fields of application), Gregoire’s (1998) article is essential reading. He did not provide simple answers and categorizations but offered the means by which to call our assumptions about these special fields of application into informed question. He concluded, “It is indisputable that profound personal change, including script change, takes place in supervision, education, counseling, and organizational development, as well as in daily life” (p. 320).</p>
<p>There have been a few articles in the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0362153713483274">Cornell &amp; Hine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0362153713483274">Fassbind-Kech, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713483274">Monin, 2011</xref>) that have sought to expand the definition and practice of counseling, but few have questioned the actual assumptions underlying the definitions and limitations imposed on the field. In her discussion of ethical challenges within a counseling perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713483274">Monin (2011</xref>) did not directly challenge the traditional definitions of counseling, but she did gently nudge the borders of counseling practice in her discussion of long-term counseling and work within transferential and countertransferential dynamics (p. 120).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0362153713483274">
<title>In Conclusion and to the Future</title>
<p>To look effectively to the future of a discipline, we need to know its past, as we often live with its influences, the group canon, even as the actual, lived history has faded into the shadows. I think the history of permission classes and special fields is not present enough in our group consciousness to help us to think realistically about the future. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713483274">Berne (1963</xref>) wrote about the group canon, “The canon may be defined as the traditional influences, written and unwritten, which regulate the attitudes and workings of the group, including the group culture, and give authority to the leader” (p. 47). The leader may be an individual or, as we have come to see in the ITAA and EATA, it has become the examination and certification councils. Berne also noted that “every canon requires interpretations, amendments, and elaborations” (p. 46), and we cannot make competent amendments without knowing the history of the canon.</p>
<p>In <italic>Principles of Group Treatment, </italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713483274">Berne (1966</xref>) observed,
<disp-quote>
<p>Precedent, of course, is always important when stress arises in social situations. A therapist’s knowledge of his predecessors may serve as a useful guide for his own behavior; on the other hand, it indicates what kinds of difficulties he may run into if he wishes to introduce a technical innovation. (p. 146)</p>
</disp-quote>Clarke’s account quoted earlier certainly captures the difficulties one may run into when challenging precedent (canon) or attempting to create innovations in the field.</p>
<p>This special issue of the <italic>Transactional Analysis Journal </italic>offers us a long overdue opportunity to reassess and challenge the place of the counseling field in the practice of transactional analysis. Berne passed on to us as transactional analysts the permission and, I would suggest, the responsibility, to question tradition, to innovate, to bring our work into all areas of human endeavor, and to recognize the relentless human hungers for learning and growth.</p>
<p>The pages of this journal must provide a vehicle for these discussions on a regular basis and must actively represent all four fields of application in transactional analysis. Our governing authorities and certifying boards need to question the assumptions underlying the definitions of the core competencies. Are the distinctions so clear? Our governing bodies within transactional analysis communities around the world need to recognize the regulatory limits placed by various cultural and national definitions, but we also have the responsibility to question these limits, to educate the regulators, and to expand the breadth and depth of our competencies.</p>
<p>Counseling as a field includes a breathtaking range of clientele, work environments, and clinical challenges and responsibilities. It is a field of endeavor that merits pride. Counselors have their own personal and professional responsibilities not to perceive themselves as inevitable victims of a second-class status but to define themselves and fight for recognition and respect.</p>
