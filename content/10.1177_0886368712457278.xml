<p>Benchmark Senior Living has created a unique benefit by establishing a nonprofit organization, the One Company Fund, to help employees who find themselves faced with unanticipated financial crises. Benchmark associates can access one-time grants up to $5,000 to overcome financial hardship caused by an emergency or natural disaster, a death in the family, an accident or illness or disability. The Fund has distributed more than $500,000 to more than 300 Benchmark associates.</p>

<p>Human resources management has changed dramatically over the past decade. Long gone are the days when successful companies would offer employees static compensation and benefits packages offering strict salary schedules and limited benefits. This is the era of flex time and shared positions, and the most successful companies treat employees like valued associates, rather than mere commodities.</p>
<p>Compensation and benefits packages are keys to recruiting and retaining talented staff. Sometimes, however, traditional approaches to salary, vacation, and other benefits are not enough to take care of employees’ needs. In those situations, companies need to take extraordinary steps to bulk up their human resources programs.</p>
<p>This was the thinking behind the creation of the One Company Fund, a nonprofit organization created by Benchmark Senior Living to help Benchmark associates who find themselves faced with unanticipated financial crises. Through the Fund, Benchmark associates can access one-time grants up to $5,000 to overcome financial hardship caused by an emergency or natural disaster, a death in the family, an accident or illness or disability. The grants do not have to be repaid by recipients, and they are not considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

<p>The Fund was initially crafted in 2007 by Benchmark’s founder, Tom Grape, who wanted to make sure that the company’s employees were protected if they faced unforeseen hardship. Since then, the Fund has distributed more than $500,000 to more than 300 Benchmark associates. The grants have gone to a wide range of employees, from nurses to direct care associates to dishwashers, and all nonmanagement associates are eligible for grants.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712457278">
<title>Benefits to the Company</title>
<p>Although the One Company Fund was created with philanthropic intentions, it has returned significant benefits back to the company. In establishing the Fund, the company anticipated that the program would provide important customer service advantages. These expectations have been borne out 10-fold.</p>
<p>In the senior living business, nothing is more important than customer service. Residents of senior living facilities are often frail or vulnerable, and caregivers need to be extremely attentive to residents’ well-being. It is essential that staff go about their daily tasks in as positive a mind-frame as possible. One Company Fund grants relieve the stress that can be caused by financial hardship and, as a result, can have a salutary impact on employee performance.</p>
<p>In the 4 years since the One Company Fund was created, residents and their loved ones alike have commented on the way the Fund has improved morale, and a number of them have become financial supporters of the Fund.</p>
<p>The Fund has also fostered an increased sense of teamwork among staff. When Benchmark associates become aware of a financial challenge facing a colleague, they are able to encourage and support that coworker in applying for a grant. This has created an environment in which associates look out for each other, and this attitude has carried over into work tasks as well. As a result, Benchmark’s direct care staff work more closely together, which provides significant benefits to residents and generally improves the quality of care they receive.</p>
<p>After 5 years of recession and stagnant recovery, financial issues remain a primary concern for many people. Much has been written about the millions of workers who have lost their jobs and who are struggling to find work. Much less attention has been paid to those who have kept their jobs but are nonetheless struggling financially. There are numerous manifestations of these struggles: Some people are unable to pay mortgages on homes with plummeting values; others are faced with the challenge of providing for family members who have lost their jobs; others are having trouble paying rising health care costs or a child’s tuition. There are hundreds of reasons that people struggle. Regardless of the cause of these financial challenges, they can have a huge impact in the workplace, taking a toll on workers’ concentration, productivity, creativity and sense of teamwork.</p>
<p>In fact, the problem is so widespread that a term has been coined for it: <italic>presenteeism</italic>. Presenteeism describes the loss of productivity that occurs when workers are present in body, but not performing their best. It manifests itself in a host of ways, including employees making mistakes and being less productive, diminished work quality, impaired social functioning, burnout and anger. Obviously, in a business that revolves around caring for seniors, many of whom may have significant needs, none of these behaviors is acceptable.</p>
<p>The International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans estimates that presenteeism costs companies $150 billion each year. That does not even include the implications of employees missing work because of stress-related illnesses. Clearly, programs that reduce stress in the workplace can provide immense value to the company and employee alike. Because personal finances are among the most common causes of stress, programs like the One Company Fund can play a vital role in helping employees overcome issues that can affect their performance at work.</p>
<p>Finally, the One Company Fund has provided one unanticipated benefit to Benchmark Senior Living: It has become a terrific recruitment tool for the company. People want to work for an organization that shares their values. Employees spend more waking hours at work then just about anyplace else, and they want a sense that what they are doing matters, and that the company for which they work is a good corporate citizen. The One Company Fund demonstrates Benchmark’s values in a tangible, clear way that affects both employees and residents of the company’s senior living communities. Benchmark has been able to use the program and the values it reflects to attract qualified and experienced senior living professionals to the company, and this has played an important role in assuring that the company has continued to thrive when so many others have struggled in recent years.</p>

<title>How the Fund Works</title>
<p>Although The One Company Fund exists solely to provide support to employees of Benchmark Senior Living, it operates as a separate nonprofit, tax-exempt organization. The original capital for the Fund was contributed by Benchmark Senior Living, and today it is supported by donations from the company, its executives, directors, employees, residents and other friends. Benchmark associates are given an opportunity to support the Fund through payroll deduction, although it is not required of them.</p>
<p>Today, the individual Benchmark senior living communities are the most important sources of capital for the Fund. The company has 46 senior living communities spread throughout the Northeast, each of which has a goal to raise $2,500 or more a year. Some raise much more than their targets, with communities raising as much as $11,000 or $12,000 each year. In addition to contributions from associates and friends, the communities raise money through special events, such as bake and rummage sales and motorcycle rides. One successful fundraiser revolved around the creation of a cookbook, which was sold to staff, residents, and friends. Ultimately, each community is given the freedom to raise money however its associates wish. The corporate office of Benchmark supports this effort by sponsoring four company-wide events each year, including its signature golf tournament.</p>
<p>Residents and their families also donate to the Fund. In fact, there have been bequeathed memorial gifts made in honor of deceased residents. This is a reflection of how much residents and their families value the Fund and the impact it has on their care and the staff who provide that care.</p>
<p>Finally, the Fund is supported by corporate supporters, including a number of Benchmark’s strategic partners. Corporate sponsors can make direct corporate donations or participate in the Fund’s golf tournament or other company-wide events.</p>
<p>All of this capital is set aside to directly benefit Benchmark associates. When associates face a financial crisis—or when coworkers see that they are struggling—they can apply or be nominated for a grant up to $5,000. Applications are directed to the Fund’s Selection Committee, which is composed of an executive and an employee of Benchmark’s home office, two supervisors from separate Benchmark communities and one front-line team member from a Benchmark community. The committee considers each application individually and makes the final decision on whether to approve the grant.</p>
<p>Grants can be awarded for a variety of reasons, from personal crises to natural disasters. The one thing every successful application has in common is that the associate’s crisis ultimately revolves around financing.</p>
<p>For instance, a young associate of Evans Park, a Benchmark Senior Living Community in Newton Corner, Massachusetts, unexpectedly lost her husband just before Christmas in 2011. As a result of her husband’s death, she became the family’s sole earner and had to support herself and four children, one of whom has serious medical issues. Through a One Company grant, the associate and her family got enough money to pay off pending bills and forestall a threatened eviction from their home.</p>
<p>The experience of this associate was typical. The grants are intended to help associates meet an immediate financial challenge. Another example occurred in Concord, New Hampshire where an associate was facing eviction from her home because she had spent most of her savings caring for her niece who had cancer and was living out her final days in hospice. Not only did the Fund provide the money she needed to pay her rent and keep her house, but it also paid for necessities like food and electricity.</p>
<p>Another important element of The One Company Fund is that it does not just provide the funds to pay bills. The Fund actually pays the creditors, taking on the responsibility from associates. This is an added level of support that lets associates focus on their personal lives and jobs and other important considerations and frees them from the burden of having to pay each creditor. In cases where the grant is going to be used to pay daily necessities, such as food, the Fund is able to give grant recipients preloaded debit cards to purchase what they need, which provides an added level of convenience.</p>
<p>Grants are not limited solely to Benchmark associates; their families are also eligible in certain cases. For instance, in November 2011 a young associate at Haverhill Crossings in Haverhill, Massachusetts, had a heart attack and passed away unexpectedly, leaving behind a disabled husband and a teenage daughter. One of her coworkers was aware of the family’s plight and applied for a grant on their behalf. Ultimately, the husband and daughter received $10,000 to help them get through this very difficult time. This was the rare occasion when the Fund’s board decided to exceed the $5,000 limit, essentially giving the family two grants.</p>
<p>Although the Fund’s grants are designed to help people through unforeseen events or crises, they are not limited to unexpected events. New England is one of the most expensive places in the country to live, and sometimes people just have trouble making ends meet. The Fund can also provide emergency assistance in these cases.</p>
<p>For instance, last year a dishwasher working at The Village at Buckland Court in South Windsor, Connecticut found himself in dire financial straits after years of caring for his elderly mother who had severe dementia. In addition to caring for his mother each night after work, he had to pay for daytime caregivers so he could go to work. The cost quickly added up to the point where he could no longer afford to pay for heating fuel or food. His supervisor noticed that he had lost a lot of weight and seemed extremely stressed, and encouraged him to apply for a grant to get back on his feet. The Fund provided money for heat, food and clothes, and also brought up-to-date utilities that were in danger of being shut off.</p>
<p>Finally, the One Company Fund is able to respond to significant events that affect both employees and their families. For instance, last summer Hurricane Irene devastated communities throughout Western Massachusetts and Vermont. Through The Fund, dozens of Benchmark employees received funds to help pick up the pieces from damaged property and flooding.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Haiti was struck by an earthquake in the winter of 2010, it hit the Benchmark community hard. In New England, many senior care workers are of Haitian descent and still have family in Haiti. When the earthquake hit, these employees were understandably concerned about the well-being of their loved ones. Fund administrators quickly mobilized to create a special shortened application to make it easier for associates to access the fund, and blanket $500 grants were instantly approved to assure that money could quickly be made available to send to relatives in Haiti. Additionally, associates were given $50 calling cards so they could telephone loved ones to make sure they were alright. In the weeks following the earthquake, the Fund donated $40,000 to associates and their loved ones in Haiti.</p>

<title>Intended—and Unintended—Benefits</title>
<p>The One Company Fund was originally created by Benchmark Senior Living to provide a valuable resource to employees who found themselves in financial distress. On that level, the Fund has been a great success that has benefited more than 300 company associates.</p>
<p>However, Benchmark itself has gained just as much. The day-to-day benefits have been extraordinary, with staff noticeably less distracted and more team-oriented. In an industry that relies so heavily on customer services, this is a vital advantage. And it has not gone unnoticed by Benchmark’s residents and their families.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Fund has provided an unexpected human resources advantage by becoming an important recruiting tool in the search for experienced and qualified professionals. Similarly, it has also turned out to be valuable for networking with prospective strategic partners. Benchmark has found that companies that share our values are attracted by the Fund and are more interested in partnering with the company on other types of initiatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately, The One Company Fund has proven to be an unqualified success. It truly is the rare example of how a company can do well by doing right.</p>
