<p>In the recent subprime crisis, many individuals defaulted on their loans. Though the institutional sources of defaulting and delinquencies were much debated in the aftermath of the crisis, much less attention was given to individual differences in defaulting behavior. How do individuals decide whether to repay borrowed money? The decision to default can be viewed as an intertemporal choice, as defaulting provides monetary benefits in the near future and costs in the more distant future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611425931">Chatterjee, Corbae, Nakajima, &amp; Rios-Rull, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611425931">Fehr, 2002</xref>). Therefore, interpersonal differences in time discounting may influence defaulting. Psychological research shows substantial heterogeneity in time discounting and often large degrees of time discounting, especially if immediate rewards are available (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611425931">Frederick, Loewenstein, &amp; O’Donoghue, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611425931">Kirby &amp; Herrnstein, 1995</xref>). Measured time discounting is predictive of life outcomes such as scholastic achievement and health-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611425931">Chabris, Laibson, Morris, Schuldt, &amp; Taubinsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611425931">Chapman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611425931">Eigsti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611425931">Kirby, Petry, &amp; Bickel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611425931">Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Rodriguez, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In this report, we document that the degree of time discounting predicts repayment as measured using the standard U.S. metric of creditworthiness, an individual’s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score. The component of time discounting previously found to be associated with deliberate decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611425931">Figner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611425931">McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, &amp; Cohen, 2004</xref>) is more predictive of creditworthiness than is the immediacy-bias component associated with affective or impulsive decision making. The findings indicate that time discounting predicts creditworthiness and that repayment decisions may be associated with deliberative, rather than affective, processes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0956797611425931">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Four hundred thirty-seven low- to moderate-income participants were recruited at a Boston, Massachusetts, community center that was converted to a tax-preparation site during tax season. Participants consented to give us access to their credit report and their income-tax-return data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797611425931">
<title>Experimental measure of time discounting</title>
<p>We measured time discounting as a monthly discount factor using standard experimental methods (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611425931">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). Subjects were given a 22-item questionnaire that prompted them to choose between sooner, smaller (SS) payouts and later, larger (LL) ones. Subjects made choices for three time periods: For the first period, they chose between a smaller payout that day and a larger payout 1 month later; for the second period (<italic>0-6</italic>), they chose between a smaller payout that day and a larger payout 6 months later; and for the third period (<italic>6-7</italic>), they chose between a smaller payout in 6 months and a larger payout in 7 months (“6-7”). Within the choices for each time period, the LL payouts stayed the same, and the SS payouts decreased from choice to choice. For each period, we calculated a discount factor using the point at which individuals switched from preferring the SS choice to preferring the LL choice. For example, if an individual preferred $75 the day of the questionnaire over $80 in 1 month, but preferred $80 in 1 month over $70 the day of the questionnaire, we took $75 as the switching point, and 75/80 was the corresponding discount factor for the 0-1 time period. A lower average discount factor indicates a greater degree of time discounting. Ten percent of participants, randomly chosen, were paid one of their choices.</p>
<p>By comparing choices for the 0-1 and 6-7 periods (i.e., periods with and without an immediate SS payout), we were able to separate time discounting into two components: the degree of immediacy bias, β, and more long-run, deliberative, baseline time discounting, δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611425931">Laibson, 1997</xref>). We measured δ as the discount factor in the 6-7 time period and β as the ratio of the 0-1 discount factor to the 6-7 discount factor (i.e., how much individuals discounted the future more when SS payouts were paid immediately; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611425931">Figner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611425931">Johnson, Atlas, &amp; Payne, 2011</xref>). In general, individuals exhibited an immediacy bias, discounting more in the 0-1 period than in the 6-7 period, <italic>t</italic>(436) = 5.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. There was also substantial heterogeneity in both δ and β. Note that our measure of immediacy bias, which has also been used in other work, has test-retest reliability correlations in line with those obtained for baseline time discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611425931">Chapman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611425931">Meier &amp; Sprenger, 2010b</xref>).</p>

<title>Creditworthiness and income data</title>
<p>We used participants’ FICO scores as a summary measure of creditworthiness. FICO uses credit histories to calculate a number between 300 and 850. A lower number indicates lower creditworthiness (i.e., that an individual has a history of past default or delinquency; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611425931">Avery, Bostic, Calem, &amp; Canner, 2003</xref>). FICO scores are widely used in the United States by lenders, potential landlords, and employers. We also had a precise income measure, from participants’ tax returns.</p>
<p>The Supplemental Material (available online) contains a description of the study’s setup, summary statistics, exact wording of the questionnaire, detailed explanation of our time-discounting measure, and full regression results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Time discounting and FICO score were significantly correlated (Spearman’s ρ = .143, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .003), and this correlation was comparable to previously found correlations between time discounting and health behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611425931">Chabris et al., 2008</xref>). The solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611425931">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this correlation graphically, showing the average FICO score for each time-discounting quartile. Participants who were the most willing to delay (4th quartile) had FICO scores that were approximately 30 points higher than those of participants who were the least willing to delay (1st quartile). Participants who were the least willing to delay fell below the subprime lending cutoff of 620, below which individuals generally face substantially elevated borrowing rates. Time discounting also predicted FICO scores 1 year later for the subsample for which we had this information (ρ = .309, <italic>n</italic> = 110, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); for this subsample, the correlation (Spearman’s ρ) between time discounting and FICO score (if available) at the time of the survey was .218, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03 (<italic>n</italic> = 98). The correlation between time discounting and FICO score was not driven by income, education, age, gender, race, or total borrowing. Controlling for these critical variables in a regression framework did not affect the association between time discounting and FICO score (see Table S2 in the Supplemental Material). The dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611425931">Figure 1</xref> shows graphically that the association between time-discounting quartile and FICO score remained when these covariates were partialed out.</p>

<caption><p>Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score as a function of time-discounting quartile. Participants in the 1st quartile had the lowest discount factor (i.e., lowest willingness to delay), and those in the 4th quartile had the highest discount factor (i.e., highest willingness to delay). The graph shows both raw mean FICO scores and predicted FICO scores from an ordinary least squares regression controlling for (mean-adjusted) income, education, age, gender, race, and total borrowing. The model with these covariates partialed out had an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .135, and the model without the covariates had an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .024. The gray shading represents standard errors, which overlapped for the two models.</p></caption>

<p>To test the impact of immediacy bias, we analyzed the correlations between FICO score and β and between FICO score and δ. The correlation with β was not significant (ρ = −.002, <italic>p</italic> = .97), but the correlation with δ was (ρ = .126, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .009). When β, δ, and the covariates were included in a regression, only δ, and not β, was significantly correlated with FICO score (see Table S2 in the Supplemental Material). This result shows that the long-run component of time discounting drives the correlation between time discounting and FICO score.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The analysis presented in this report demonstrates that time discounting predicts creditworthiness: Individuals who are more willing to delay gratification have significantly higher FICO scores. This finding shows the importance of time discounting for financial decisions. Though the correlations we found were robust to many critical confounds, they should not be interpreted causally. It is possible that they were driven by a third factor, or the correlations may be a manifestation of a shared underlying construct. The correlations are, however, important grounds for future work analyzing the nature of the relationship between time discounting and financial behavior. Our results suggest that immediacy bias is less relevant for creditworthiness than is baseline time discounting. As past research has shown that baseline time discounting is more associated with deliberate than with affective decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611425931">Figner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611425931">McClure et al., 2004</xref>), our results indicate that the decision to repay may be more deliberate or strategic than affective. In contrast, immediacy bias has been shown to correlate with borrowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611425931">Meier &amp; Sprenger, 2010a</xref>). Thus, decisions to borrow and decisions to repay may be governed by different decision-making systems.</p>
