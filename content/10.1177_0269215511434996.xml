<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ageing-associated decline in sensorial functions and muscular weakness of the lower limbs in the elderly lead to a gait pattern that is associated with postural instability and could cause falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511434996">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511434996">2</xref></sup> Several authors have found that frail elderly fallers display a significantly slower walking speed than non-fallers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511434996">1</xref></sup> The inability to walk regularly reduces physical fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511434996">3</xref></sup> and imposes a sedentary lifestyle. Thus, an excessively sedentary lifestyle leads to serious pathophysiological consequences, including muscle atrophy, impaired balance, orthostatic hypotension and impaired cardiorespiratory function, as well as to psychological consequences such as apathy, depression and cognitive decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434996">4</xref></sup> The lack of physical stimulation in institutional care increases the probability of walking disorders in frail elderly subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434996">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511434996">5</xref></sup> and hence the number of people in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Prevention by training seems to be essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511434996">6</xref></sup> in order to decrease walking disorders and to maintain or increase muscular strength, reducing the factors involved in falling. Actually, it is well recognized that training implies a decrease of risk factors linked with falls in frail elderly or very old subjects, by improving static balance and walking speed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511434996">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511434996"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511434996">9</xref></sup> while also maintaining or increasing muscular strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511434996">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511434996"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511434996">11</xref></sup> Lazowski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511434996">12</xref></sup> demonstrated that general physical training has a positive influence on balance in institutionalized frail elderly subjects, while Rubenstein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511434996">13</xref></sup> showed that physical training based on strength, endurance and mobility improves the balance in fall-prone elderly subjects. Finally, Toulotte et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511434996">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511434996">15</xref></sup> demonstrated that physical activities based on balance reduce the number of falls and improve the static and dynamic balance in institutionalized frail elderly subjects and in healthy elderly subjects. Actually, many institutions are equipped with Nintendo Wii to stimulate their residents. Grojean et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511434996">16</xref></sup> evaluated the usefulness of this type of video game console among healthy elderly subjects who showed a significant improvement to the Tinetti score, unipedal balance, static balance and walking speed after six weeks of training on the video game console. In the same way, Nitz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511434996">17</xref></sup> showed a positive effect on balance and strength in healthy women aged to 30 and 60.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no study on the comparison of the effect of Adapted Physical Activities and Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training on the balance of elderly subjects has yet been carried out. We postulated that adapted physical training would improve the static and dynamic balance of these subjects (i.e. increasing their autonomy), in contrast to the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>, which would only stimulate static balance. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different physical training on the balance of independent senior subjects, in order to prevent or limit fall factors. The objective is to compare the effectiveness of three protocols (Adapted Physical Activities, Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>, Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) on the balance of independent senior subjects.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The population screened in this study was composed of elderly subjects living in independent community dwellings. Before the beginning of this study, the purpose was explained to the volunteers. Thirty-six volunteers (22 females, 14 males) participated in this study, which was reviewed and approved by the local university ethics committee (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511434996">Table 1</xref>). Before experimentation and after being informed of the entire protocol, each patient signed a written consent form. Inclusion criteria were to be at least 60 years old, either to have already fallen or not and to have a stable medical treatment (taken regularly and for at least three months). The exclusion criteria were lower limb fracture or surgery, the use of a walking aid or foot orthosis, auditory, ocular and/or vestibular problems, head trauma with or without loss of consciousness, strokes, disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome involving the upper limb, sores on lower limbs or feet or corns (placing the foot on the floor is modified by plantar hardness). Each subject had a personal clinical interview with two clinicians. The latter were in separate rooms permitting the determination of causes, the number and dates of falls as well as medications and physical activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511434996">18</xref></sup> Lastly, the subjects did not present any cognitive problems measured by the Mini Mental State.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511434996">19</xref></sup> All subjects obtained the maximal score in this test and were considered to have normal cognitive functions. Then, the 36 subjects were randomly divided into four groups of 9 subjects by drawing lots: Adapted Physical Training (G1), Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training (G2), Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training (G3) and the control group (G4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511434996">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>All the subjects performed the tests in the following order. First, the unipedal test with eyes open followed by eyes closed, second, the Tinetti test (static and dynamic balance) and third, the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> tests. All subjects performed the following tests before (T1) and after (T2) training in this order:</p>
<list id="list1-0269215511434996" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Unipedal test</italic>: The subjects stood on one foot with their eyes open for 30 seconds. We counted the number of times the subject’s suspended foot touched the floor during the 30-second test. The subjects had no support at the start of this test and were free to choose the foot to stand on. The chronometer was triggered as soon as the subject lifted one foot off the floor. If the subject placed his or her foot on the floor during the test, the chronometer was stopped then restarted again as soon as the subject’s suspended foot no longer touched the floor. The free leg was held free (90° knee flexion, 90° hip flexion). The number of times each subject placed the suspended foot on the floor was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511434996">20</xref></sup> The subjects then repeated the test with their eyes closed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Tinetti test</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511434996">20</xref></sup>: This test measures static balance, using 12 items (for 24 points) and dynamic balance (different parameters of walking: walking speed, step length, step height) using nine items (for 9 points). Subjects with a score above 20 points are dependent and have balance disorders.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> Test</italic>: The Nintendo video game console, called Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>, differs from the other video game consoles. This console proposes tests, games and exercises that involve all body parts. The Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> permits users to stimulate balance. One test measures the position of the centre of gravity. The videogame console gives two percentages (right and left) for the position of the centre of gravity. We calculated the percentage difference between right and left and concluded as to the position of the centre of gravity.</p></list-item></list>
<p>All subjects attended one supervised 1-hour exercise session per week for 20 weeks in a gymnasium. All the subjects in this study performed the 20 weeks of training. Two training methods were used in this protocol: Adapted Physical Activities for groups 1 and 3 and Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training for groups 2 and 3. Group 1 did 1 hour of Adapted Physical Activities training, group 2 did 1 hour of Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training and group 3 did 30 minutes of Adapted Physical Activities and 30 minutes of Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training.</p>
<sec id="section10-0269215511434996">
<title>Adapted Physical Activities (G1)</title>
<p>At each session, the subjects undertook exercises to increase step length, step height, the mobility of the cervical rachis and ocular mobility in order to develop muscular strength, proprioception, flexibility, static balance with eyes open and eyes closed and dynamic balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511434996">15</xref></sup> At each training, we increased the numbers of repetitions of the exercises and/or the difficulty of the exercises (the height and the distance between the barrier).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269215511434996">
<title>Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training (G2)</title>
<p>For the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training, we used the Nintendo standardized video games included with this console, such as heading soccer, ski jumping, yoga, downhill skiing, game balls and tightrope walker. For safety, we placed a chair in front of the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> in case the subjects lost their balance. The training was personalized because the progress in training was based on the different levels into each video game. At each session, the subjects noted the level in each video game with the backup software in order to progress between each session.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three protocols on balance in independent senior subjects. Significant differences were demonstrated between the four groups performing the Tinetti test, unipedal test and the position of the centre of gravity. After 20 training sessions, G1 (Adapted Physical Activities), G2 (Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) and G3 (Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) improved their balance. In addition, G1 and G3 increased their dynamic balance.</p>
<p>Before the interpretation of the results, some methodological points need to be discussed, however. The number of the subjects is small; thus, we must interpret the results with caution. In this sense, the analyses are just exploratory and would need to be confirmed in a definitive, more highly powered study in the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, we would measure the number of falls and on the different factors of falls (walking speed, strength of legs, flexibility) in order to conclude as to the effectiveness of the different protocols on fall prevention.</p>
<p>The subjects in the training groups (G1, G2 and G3) regularly took part in training and became enthusiastic during the training sessions. The physical activities were new in the institution. Moreover, the G2 and G3 were more motivated than the G1 because they played with the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> and compared their levels in the different games. In fact, the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> programme is motivating and interests people, which therefore would influence the results of the tests.</p>
<p>After training, G1 (Adapted Physical Activities), G2 (Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) and G3 (Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) significantly decreased the Tinetti score. This latter result is in agreement with a review of the literature, established by Haeur et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511434996">21</xref></sup> on a population of older frail women. We can hypothesize that the improvement in static balance could be partially due to the increase in muscular strength, thanks for example to the exercises with elastic bands or neural adaptation. In fact, Nashner and Cordo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511434996">22</xref></sup> demonstrated that postural instability was due to a decrease in muscular strength of the lower limbs. This reduction results in the centre of gravity lying in front of the ankle axis, which leads to balance problems and falls. Improved muscular strength could cause the displacement of the centre of gravity to the ankle axis, giving better static balance.</p>
<p>The centre of gravity moved significantly after training for G2 (Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) and G3 (Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>). Toulotte et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511434996">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511434996">15</xref></sup> also showed that physical training based on balance, flexibility and muscular strength has a positive effect on the static balance of elderly independent subjects and frail demented subjects. The present study demonstrates that Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> training can also improve the stability and the static balance of independent elderly subjects. We can hypothesize that the Nintendo Wii, with balance video games on balance, specifically teaches participants to keep a centred position.</p>
<p>When standing on one foot, G1 (Adapted Physical Activities) and G3 (Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) decreased the number of times the subject’s suspended foot touched the floor in the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Vellas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511434996">23</xref></sup> and Hurvitz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511434996">24</xref></sup> recorded that fallers touched the floor with their opposite foot more frequently than non-fallers and were unable to stand on one foot for 30 seconds with their eyes open. The single-leg balance test is a suitable test to identify balance disorders in healthy elderly subjects. Nevertheless, even if this test could be an indicator of balance disorders, it may not be totally pertinent, because falling is a dynamic problem, whereas standing on one foot is a static posture. Moreover, walking differs from standing balance in that the centre of gravity constantly moves beyond the base of support and the supporting leg can do little to alter this motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511434996">25</xref></sup> Thus, the daily task of dynamic balance could be usefully assessed to predict falls in healthy seniors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511434996">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>We found significant increases in mobility for G1 (Adapted Physical Activities) and G3 (Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>), but no change in G2 (Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) and G4 (control). The Tinetti test score in dynamic condition decreased significantly (G1 and G2). Adapted Physical Activities training is based on exercises to develop muscular strength, proprioception, flexibility, static balance with eyes open and eyes closed and dynamic balance. Ades et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511434996">27</xref></sup> showed that physical training based on muscle-building increases muscle strength in frail elderly non-fallers. Similarly, McMurdo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511434996">28</xref></sup> demonstrated that seated exercises increase the quadriceps strength and walking area in institutionalized elderly subjects. However, like McMurdo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511434996">28</xref></sup> and Ades et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511434996">27</xref></sup> we used exercises to develop muscle strength in legs. We can assume that the improvement of the dynamic balance was due to an Adapted Physical Activities training.</p>
<p>G2 (Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) and G3 (Adapted Physical Activities + Wii Fit<sup>®</sup>) trained with the Wii Fit<sup>®</sup> software, so the subjects stimulated static balance watching TV. Hence, they trained in dual task conditions. Moreover, it is assumed that performing a task requires a given portion of the capacity of the central nervous system, and that if two tasks are performed simultaneously, it requires more than the total capacity, the performance of one or both tasks will be affected negatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511434996">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511434996">30</xref></sup> While the nature of the second task was different (a memorizing task such as speaking or counting versus a motor task like walking or standing on one foot), it seems that it had a similar impact but with different mechanisms, modifying the walking pattern or stopping walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511434996">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511434996">30</xref></sup> Deficient structure and functioning of peripheral systems (vestibular and ocular system, proprioception) are certainly important factors, since balance is more affected for the elderly than for young adults when sensory, proprioceptive or both inputs are altered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511434996">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511434996"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511434996"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511434996">34</xref></sup> It would be very interesting to record the scores for the different games in order to identify which parameters are modified in developing a dual task.</p>
