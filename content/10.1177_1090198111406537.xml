<abstract>
<p>Young sexual minority males are among those at highest risk for HIV infection, yet we know relatively little about the impact of sexual identity development on HIV risk. This study used cross-sectional data to investigate factors associated with HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of sexual minority males (<italic>n</italic> = 156), ages 14 to 21 years, using an extended version of the information–motivation–behavioral skills (IMB) model tailored for this population. Path analysis results indicated that the extended model predicted a sizable amount of primary and secondary sexual risk (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .35 and .42). In addition to increasing HIV prevention information and motivation and decreasing substance use, study findings suggest that interventions with young sexual minority males should focus on sexual identity development factors including youths’ attitudes toward LBGT people, sex-centered versus identity-centered development, and with specific emphasis on youth with non–male exclusive sexual orientations.</p>

<p>Young sexual minority males are among those at greatest risk for HIV infection in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111406537">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006</xref>). Youth of color are disproportionately affected, with African American sexual minority males aged 13 to 29 years representing the highest risk group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111406537">CDC, 2010</xref>). Yet little is known about the pathways to HIV-related sexual risk specific to this population, particularly the impact of sexual identity development.</p>
<p>The term <italic>sexual minority youth</italic> refers to young people with sexual attractions, behaviors, relationships, and orientations that are nonheterosexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111406537">D’Augelli, Hershberger, &amp; Pilkington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198111406537">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>). Much of the research literature on sexual minority youth has conceptualized sexual identity development as either a set of developmental milestones (e.g., first same-sex attraction, first same-sex sexual experience, first self-label as a nonheterosexual, and first disclosure of nonheterosexual identity) or more broadly as the emotions, cognitions, and behaviors of youth as they develop their sexual identities.</p>
<p>Research on developmental milestones has primarily examined the timing and sequence of these events and their impact on a range of health and mental health outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111406537">Maguen, Floyd, Bakeman, and Armistead (2002)</xref> examined variations in the timing and sequence of three milestones (same-sex attraction, same-sex sexual contact, and disclosure), finding that the sequence of these events differed by orientation. Additionally, they found the context in which these milestone events occurred varied by orientation and ethnicity, whereas only disclosure to father affected self-esteem. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111406537">D’Augelli &amp; Hershberger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111406537">D’Augelli et al., 2001</xref>) found that all four milestones were related to youths’ suicidal thoughts and attempts.</p>
<p>The relationship between these important milestones and sexual risk has received less attention. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111406537">Dube (2000)</xref> investigated the sequence of milestone events among gay and bisexual young adult and adult males. Findings indicated that males with a same-sex sexual experience prior to self-labeling as nonheterosexual reported significantly more sex partners and sex with both male and female partners compared with males who self-labeled prior to having a same-sex sexual experience. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198111406537">Savin-Williams and Diamond (2000)</xref> found that young sexual minority males were more likely to report a sex-first developmental trajectory and first same-sex sexual experience with a stranger.</p>
<p>Research conceptualizing sexual identity development more broadly has investigated youths’ attitudes, perceptions, and experiences related to being a sexual minority person and their impact on health risk behaviors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198111406537">Rosario, Schrimshaw, and Hunter (2004a)</xref> found that sexual minority youth with more positive attitudes toward homosexuality were less likely to engage in unprotected anal sex. Stressful life events resulting from youths’ nonheterosexual identities—particularly those perceived as “undesirable” events by respondents—were related to substance use and sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111406537">Rosario, Rotheram-Borus, &amp; Reid, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1090198111406537">Rotheram-Borus, Rosario, Van Rossem, Reid, &amp; Gillis, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have explored sexual minority youths’ connections to other sexual minority people, including social support and involvement with the lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender (LBGT) community. One study found that having a social support network with more gay, lesbian, and bisexual people was associated with greater sexual risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1090198111406537">Wright &amp; Perry, 2006</xref>), whereas others found that involvement in gay and lesbian-related activities (e.g., gone to gay or lesbian dance clubs or bars) was a protective factor for sexual risk and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111406537">Rosario, Hunter, Maguen, Gwadz, &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111406537">Rosario, Schrimshaw, &amp; Hunter, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>Substance use patterns of sexual minority youth further increase their HIV risk. Higher rates of alcohol and drug use are associated with risky sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198111406537">Seal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198111406537">Stueve et al., 2002</xref>), and sexual minority youth have elevated substance use rates compared with their heterosexual peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111406537">Garofalo, Wolf, Kessel, Palfrey, &amp; DuRant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111406537">Lindley, Nicholson, Kerby, &amp; Lu, 2003</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111406537">Marshal, Friedman, Stall, and Thompson (2009)</xref> investigated these disparities across developmental trajectories, finding that sexual minority youth reported higher rates of substance use as well as greater increases in substance use over time than their heterosexual peers. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111406537">Talley, Sher, and Littlefield (2010)</xref> reported that sexual minority youth had unique substance use trajectories compared with heterosexual youth and were at significantly higher risk for alcohol and marijuana use. Research suggests that these high rates of substance use among young sexual minority males in particular may be influenced by factors directly related to youths’ sexual identities such as experiences with homophobia and racism in gay social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198111406537">Wong, Weiss, Ayala, &amp; Kipke, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this important work, this study investigated the ways in which sexual identity development experiences and substance use may directly and indirectly (via cognitive and behavioral mediators) influence the sexual risk behaviors of young sexual minority males. The conceptual framework for this study is the information–motivation–behavioral skills (IMB) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111406537">W. A. Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>), which suggests that individuals who are knowledgeable about HIV transmission and prevention, are motivated to prevent infection, and perceive themselves as capable of enacting preventive behaviors will act to reduce their HIV risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111406537">J. D. Fisher, Willcutts, Misovich, &amp; Weinstein, 1998</xref>). The IMB model has been used with other youth populations (Bryan, Fisher, &amp; Fisher, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111406537">J. D. Fisher &amp; Fisher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111406537">W. A. Fisher, Williams, Fisher, &amp; Malloy, 1999</xref>) as well as adult sexual minority males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111406537">Benotsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111406537">W. A. Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111406537">Kalichman, Picciano, &amp; Roffman, 2008</xref>). However, given the important developmental and behavioral differences that may exist between adolescents and adults including cognitive abilities, development of sexual identity, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111406537">Agwu &amp; Ellen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111406537">Harper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198111406537">Salomon, 2009</xref>), it is necessary to assess the fit of health behavior models for young sexual minority males specifically. A test of the original IMB model with this population has been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111406537">C. M. Fisher, 2011</xref>), but this is the first known study to empirically test an extension of this model tailored for sexual minority male youth.</p>
<p>This study proposed an extended version of the IMB model that was tailored to better fit this population by including two additional constructs—sexual identity development and substance use (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111406537">Figure 1</xref>). Both the research approaches described above (i.e., developmental milestones and youths’ attitudes, perceptions, and experiences) were included in this conceptualization of sexual identity development because little research has explicitly examined their impact on HIV risk for sexual minority males. The extended model builds on the original IMB model (indicated by solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111406537">Figure 1</xref>) by positing that both sexual identity development factors and substance use have a direct effect on sexual risk taking. Additionally, the model proposes that sexual identity development factors may indirectly influence sexual risk via substance use and HIV prevention information and motivation.</p>

<p>It was hypothesized that the sexual identity development and substance use variables added to the IMB model would have a unique and direct impact on HIV-related sexual risk for sexual minority male youth. This article addresses the following specific question: To what extent does the extended model predict sexual risk for young sexual minority males?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1090198111406537">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data were collected at an LBGT community center in a large Midwestern city from January to May 2006 as part of a larger study on HIV risk and sexual identity development. A convenience sample of 156 sexual minority males aged 14 to 21 years (<italic>X̄</italic> = 18.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.1) was recruited from youth in attendance at the center’s activities and drop-in programs. The racial/ethnic makeup of the sample was 67% African American, 19% Caucasian, 8% biracial, 4% Hispanic, and 2% American Indian. In terms of sexual orientation, most youth self-identified as gay (72%), followed by bisexual (19%) and other (9%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090198111406537">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants completed a written questionnaire in a private room at the community center. Participants were invited to complete the survey at the same time as their friends to increase comfort and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111406537">Elze, 2009</xref>). Therefore, respondents completed the survey in self-chosen groups of two to five youths. All respondents were able to complete the survey privately if they preferred, but none requested this. The room was large enough to allow respondents to be seated at least three to four seats apart from one another to ensure that survey responses would remain private. At the beginning of each interview, survey instructions were read aloud by the principal investigator, who then waited outside the door of the room while youth completed the instrument. Respondents took approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete the survey and were given $10 for their participation on completion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090198111406537">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Descriptions of the measures of model constructs can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111406537">Table 1</xref>. Individual sexual risk behaviors were grouped a priori as representing either primary or secondary risk in relation to HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111406537">Basen-Engquist et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111406537">J. D. Fisher, Fisher, Williams, &amp; Malloy, 1994</xref>). In this study, primary sexual risk behaviors were conceptualized as those behaviors that can directly result in HIV infection (e.g., unprotected intercourse). Secondary sexual risk behaviors were those that could lead to HIV infection indirectly by exacerbating one’s primary sexual risk (e.g., having sex while under the influence). Individual sexual risk variables were standardized to create a summative scale for primary and secondary sexual risk.</p>

<p>The primary sexual risk scale was made up of five items. Participants were asked if they <italic>ever had intercourse</italic> (vaginal and anal) using two yes/no items. <italic>Condom use</italic> was assessed using three Likert-type items that asked respondents how often condoms were used for vaginal and anal intercourse during the past 2 months and frequency of condom use with last sexual partner (response set of 1 = <italic>never</italic> to 5 = <italic>always</italic>).</p>
<p>The secondary sexual risk scale included four Likert-type items with response sets ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always</italic>). Two items assessed frequency of <italic>safer sex discussion</italic> with vaginal and anal sex partners during the past 2 months (e.g., “When you had anal intercourse, how often did you and your partner talk about having safer sex?”). Two additional items assessed <italic>sex while under the influence</italic> during the past 2 months (e.g., “How often have you or your partner had sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs?”).</p>

<p>Intercooled Stata, Version 9, was used for data cleaning, coding, and preliminary analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111406537">StataCorp, n.d.</xref>).

<p>Although there was very little missing data (less than 1%) in the data set, multivariate imputation by chained equations was used to allow for retention of full statistical power for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198111406537">Van Buuren, Boshuizen, &amp; Knook, 1999</xref>). This imputation method entails multiple regression procedures using all remaining variables in the data set to replace missing values based on distributions of the data and including random variation to reflect uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1090198111406537">von Hippel, 2005</xref>). Multivariate single imputation was conducted based on the small percentage of missing data in the data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1090198111406537">Saunders et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to analysis, factor analysis with promax rotation was used to examine each subscale of the motivation component (i.e., attitudes, friend norms, partner norms, and intentions) and the skills self-efficacy component (i.e., condom use self-efficacy and negotiation self-efficacy) to determine whether or not they each formed one dimension as suggested by the authors of the IMB model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111406537">W. A. Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>). Consistent with the theoretical model, factor analysis of the four motivation and two skills self-efficacy variables indicated one underlying factor for each of the five constructs.</p>
<p>Bivariate relationships among variables were assessed using Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests and Spearman’s rho due to variable skewness. Individual variables were then included in the path model based on the significance of bivariate relationships. Demographic characteristics (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, and gender identity) were examined as possible covariates, and the analysis indicated the need to control for race/ethnicity when examining relationships among model variables.</p>
<p>Path analysis was used to determine the fit of the extended IMB model for young sexual minority males and was conducted using maximum likelihood method. Path analysis involved the following steps, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198111406537">Schumaker and Lomax (2004)</xref>: (a) an initial model fitting, (b) model modification (i.e., adding parameters), and (c) model trimming or eliminating parameters. First, the extended model was specified, then a specification search was used to seek a better fitting model, and parameters were added to the initial model using modification indices. Modification indices, which represent the expected amount of change in chi-square if a given parameter were to be added to the model, indicate that an important path was not included in the initially fitted model. Finally, the model was trimmed by eliminating parameters based on statistical significance. Path analysis results were examined using the following fit statistics: chi-square, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), goodness-of-fit index, parsimonious goodness-of-fit index (PGFI), and the Tucker and Lewis index (TLI). Significant direct and indirect effects from the analysis of both primary and secondary sexual risk models are presented.</p>

<title>IMB Model Constructs</title>
<p>Descriptive results indicated that participants overall were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, had positive attitudes toward condoms, and had strong intentions to engage in condom-related preventive behaviors in the next 2 months. Caucasian males were more knowledgeable about HIV prevention than young men of color (<italic>z</italic> = 2.00; <italic>p</italic> = .05). Respondents reported that their friends and sexual partners were supportive regarding the three condom use behaviors assessed. Overall, respondents perceived themselves as highly capable of enacting the HIV prevention skills of using condoms and negotiating safer sex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090198111406537">
<title>Sexual Identity Development Variables</title>
<p>A majority (76.28% and 66.67%) of respondents reported having <italic>very positive, positive</italic>, or <italic>somewhat positive</italic> attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, respectively, whereas only half reported such positive attitudes toward people who were bisexual or transgender (59.62% and 55.77%, respectively). Respondents reported being predominantly oriented toward other males; approximately three fourths of these youth indicated that they were either <italic>somewhat</italic> or <italic>exclusively</italic> male oriented in terms of sexual attractions (77.57%) and sexual behaviors (79.49%). These sexual minority males reported moderate to high identification with the LBGT community but lower levels of involvement with the community. Youth reported experiencing few stressful life events as a result of their sexual identity in the past 2 months with an average of three events (<italic>X̄</italic> = 3.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.76) from a list of 12 possible events.</p>
<p>Respondents reported experiencing their first sexual identity milestone at approximately 9 years of age (<italic>X̄</italic> = 9.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.79). On average, they indicated that nearly 7 years elapsed between their earliest sexual identity development milestone and their most recent one (<italic>X̄</italic> = 6.76, SD = 3.63). More than one third of youths reported having a sex-centered (i.e., sex-first) sequence (39.74%) or an identity-centered sequence (37.18%), with approximately one fourth of youths (23.08%) reporting a concurrent developmental sequence (indicating that their first same-sex sexual contact and their first self-label as nonheterosexual happened at the same age). In terms of racial/ethnic differences, Caucasian males reported more gay-related stressful life events (<italic>z</italic> = 2.00, <italic>p</italic> = .05), more favorable attitudes toward LBGT people (<italic>z</italic> = 2.11, <italic>p</italic> = .03), and a shorter sexual identity development duration (<italic>z</italic> = −2.26, <italic>p</italic> = .02) than young men of color.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090198111406537">
<title>Substance Use</title>
<p>A majority of these sexual minority males had ever used alcohol (67.95%) or marijuana (52.56%), and nearly 15% of youths reported ever using ecstasy (13.46%). Use of alcohol differed significantly by race, with Caucasian males significantly more likely to report ever using alcohol (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.95, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .03) than youth of color. Approximately half (53.66%) of respondents who had ever used marijuana and nearly one third (29.24%) of those who had ever used alcohol reported their frequency of use as <italic>once a week or more</italic>. This frequency of use was reported by only 1.28% of those who had ever used ecstasy.</p>

<title>Sexual Risk Behaviors</title>
<sec id="section11-1090198111406537">
<title>Primary sexual risk</title>
<p>Very few youth (6%) indicated that they had abstained from both anal and vaginal sex during their lifetime. Anal sex with another male was reported by nearly all respondents (92.31%), and vaginal sex with a female was reported by nearly half (44.23%) of the sample. Most respondents (69.23%) reported having anal sex during the previous 2 months, with a smaller portion of the sample (15%) reporting vaginal sex in the past 2 months. About half of the respondents reported <italic>always using a condom</italic> for vaginal sex (54.2%) or <italic>always using a condom</italic> for anal sex (50.0%) during the past 2 months. Fewer youth (40.38%) reported always using a condom with their last sexual partner, however.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1090198111406537">
<title>Secondary sexual risk</title>
<p>Having sex while under the influence of drugs or alcohol <italic>sometimes, usually</italic>, or <italic>always</italic> during the past 2 months was reported by one quarter of the sample (25%). Fewer youth (14.10%) indicated that they had <italic>sometimes, usually</italic>, or <italic>always</italic> used alcohol or drugs to improve their sexual experience during the past 2 months. Less than one quarter (20%) of the sample indicated <italic>sometimes, rarely</italic>, or <italic>never</italic> having safer sex discussions with their sexual partner before having vaginal sex. However, more than half (58.34%) of respondents reported that safer sex discussions for anal sex during the past 2 months occurred <italic>sometimes, rarely</italic>, or <italic>never</italic>.</p>
<p>Primary and secondary sexual risk scales were computed by summing <italic>z</italic>-scored sexual risk variables. Males of color reported significantly more primary sexual risk behaviors (<italic>z</italic> = −4.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and secondary sexual risk behaviors (<italic>z</italic> = −4.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than Caucasian males. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111406537">Table 2</xref> displays the medians, interquartile range, and correlations for model variables.</p>

<title>Primary sexual risk behaviors</title>
<p>The model chi-square for the extended model for primary sexual risk behaviors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090198111406537">Figure 2</xref>) was not significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 37.75, <italic>df</italic> = 33, <italic>p</italic> = .26). A nonsignificant model chi-square indicates support for the fit between the model and the sample data. The RMSEA was .03, which, along with the narrow confidence interval of (0.00, 0.07), indicates that the model is well specified. Both the adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI; .91) and PGFI (.48) for this model indicated a good fit as does the value of .97 for the TLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198111406537">Schumaker &amp; Lomax, 2004</xref>). Results indicated that model variables accounted for 35% of the variance in primary sexual risk behaviors.</p>
<p>As stipulated by the extended model, both sexual identity development factors and substance use were directly related to primary and secondary sexual risk among this sample of young sexual minority males. Some but not all of the indirect effects of sexual identity development posited by the extended model were supported by the data.</p>
<p>More specifically, path analysis results indicated that a sex-centered developmental sequence, less favorable attitudes toward LBGT people, more frequent alcohol use, and lower levels of HIV prevention information and motivation predicted higher primary sexual risk behaviors (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .35). As hypothesized by the extended model, a significant path emerged between sexual identity development (age at first milestone) and HIV prevention information. Several significant indirect relationships were found linking HIV prevention motivation to primary sexual risk behaviors via HIV prevention information. In addition, significant path coefficients emerged between alcohol use and greater self-efficacy for prevention skills and between ecstasy use and HIV prevention motivation and skills self-efficacy.</p>

<p>Results of the path analysis for secondary sexual risk behaviors are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090198111406537">Figure 3</xref>. The model chi-square for the extended model for secondary sexual risk behaviors was not significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 55.80, <italic>df</italic> = 43, <italic>p</italic> = .09) with an RMSEA of .04 (confidence interval of [0.00, 0.07]), both indicating good model specification. The AGFI and PGFI also supported acceptable model fit, with values of .90 and .52, respectively. The TLI value of .93 provides additional support for the fit of the model with the data. For this model, 42% of the variance in youths’ secondary sexual risk behaviors was predicted by model variables.</p>
<p>Similar to the model for primary sexual risk behaviors, results indicated that a sex-centered developmental sequence, less favorable attitudes toward LBGT people, more frequent alcohol use, and lower levels of HIV prevention information and motivation predicted higher secondary sexual risk behaviors. Greater secondary sexual risk, however, was also predicted by a non–male exclusive sexual orientation. Consistent with the hypothesized model, a significant path emerged between age at first sexual identity development milestone and HIV prevention information. As with the model for primary sexual risk behaviors, several significant indirect effects were found among the original IMB model components that linked HIV prevention motivation to primary sexual risk behaviors via HIV prevention information. Significant path coefficients also emerged between more frequent alcohol use and greater self-efficacy for prevention skills and between ecstasy use and HIV prevention motivation and skills self-efficacy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings indicate that having a sex-centered developmental sequence predicted greater primary and secondary sexual risk. Sex-centered males may be engaging in sexual activity at a younger age than identity-centered males and therefore may be less adept at negotiating complex sexual situations or perhaps view sex as more of a core component of their identity than identity-centered youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111406537">Dube, 2000</xref>). High-risk behaviors among sex-centered males may also be the result of issues around behavior and identity self-label incongruence. This suggests that it may be particularly important to tailor HIV prevention messages for an adolescent who suspects but is still grappling with his sexual identity and may not benefit from safer sex messages aimed explicitly at the LBGT community.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, and consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111406537">Goodenow, Netherland, &amp; Szalacha, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198111406537">Rotheram-Borus, Marelich, &amp; Srinivasan, 1999</xref>), young men in the current study who indicated both male and female sexual attractions and behaviors reported more risky sexual behaviors. Also consistent with the hypothesized model, male youth with more positive attitudes toward LBGT people reported fewer sexual risk behaviors. This is consistent with previous study findings for youth with less internalized homophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111406537">Dube, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111406537">Rosario et al., 2001</xref>). Young men’s positive appraisals of members of the LBGT community may act as a protective factor against the stigma, rejection, ridicule, and violence that sexual minority youth can experience as a result of their sexual identities. Fostering positive attitudes and a general sense of pride toward the LBGT community could, therefore, be an important target for future preventive interventions.</p>
<p>Young men who experienced their first milestone event at a younger age possessed more HIV prevention information, which, in turn, predicted lower primary and secondary sexual risk behaviors. This indirect effect is likely a function of age. Youth who began developing their nonheterosexual identity earlier would have spent more years aware of and possibly part of the larger LBGT community, where HIV prevention messages are common and well advertised. This suggests that preventive interventions for young sexual minority males should start early and that organizations serving sexual minority youth will continue to play a crucial role in HIV prevention.</p>
<p>The finding that only alcohol use predicted primary and secondary sexual risk is interesting in light of previous findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111406537">Rotheram-Borus et al. (1994)</xref>, wherein marijuana, but not alcohol, was positively associated with more sexual risk for sexual minority youth. Among male youth in the current study, frequency of marijuana use was significantly associated with primary and secondary sexual risk behaviors at the bivariate level, but path findings suggest that this relationship became weaker after controlling for the contribution of alcohol use on marijuana use. Univariate results indicate that young men reported using marijuana more frequently than alcohol (e.g., daily marijuana use was reported by 23% of the sample compared with 1% for alcohol), which suggests that alcohol use may be more situational and thus coincide more consistently with specific sexual encounters. The stronger relationship found between alcohol use and secondary sexual risk is likely due to the inclusion of two items assessing sex while under the influence in the secondary sexual risk scale. Given these findings, it is important that future HIV preventive interventions for this population target alcohol use, particularly in relation to negotiating safer sexual behaviors while under the influence.</p>
<p>Significant paths also emerged between substance use and components of the original IMB model. Interestingly, respondents who used alcohol more frequently reported greater perceived self-efficacy for preventive skills, and more frequent ecstasy use predicted both higher prevention skills self-efficacy and lower HIV prevention motivation. It is possible that young men who use substances more frequently have had more opportunities to test their skills and to develop greater belief in their ability to enact skills such as negotiating safer sex and using condoms even when drunk or high. It is also possible that substance-using youth are risk takers in general and, therefore, tend to underrate their risk for HIV infection and overrate their skills for preventing infection.</p>
<p>There were also several unexpected findings relating to sexual identity development in the current study: gay-related stressful life events, involvement and identification with the LBGT community, and sexual identity developmental duration were not significant contributors in either path model. Previous research suggests that sexual minority youth experience stressful life events related to their perceived or real sexual identity, including harassment, rejection, and physical assault. Young sexual minority males in the current study, however, reported only three events (out of 12) on average, which were not related to sexual risk behaviors at the multivariate or bivariate level. The three most frequently reported stressful life events related to respondents’ sexual identity were trouble with classmates (49%), arguments with parents (38%), and arguments between parents (38%). However, the remaining events were reported at much lower rates: trouble with police (13%), trouble with teacher (13%), and trouble with a boss or supervisor (16%). Anecdotal evidence suggests that this inventory of stressful life events does not tap into the full universe of possible stressors since participants described many such events throughout the data collection process. For example, events such as being kicked out of parents’ homes, denied jobs because of their sexual identity, or trouble with school administrators were all described as stressful by youth yet were not assessed by the gay-related stressful life events measure.</p>
<p>Respondents’ levels of involvement and identification with the LBGT community were not significantly related to primary or secondary sexual risk behaviors at the multivariate or bivariate levels. However, these young men responded much less favorably to the involvement-related items than the identification-related items on this measure. Previous research on the impact of involvement in the gay and lesbian community on HIV-related sexual risk has been mixed. Findings from several studies suggest that greater involvement in gay and lesbian community activities may be a protective factor for sexual risk among sexual minority youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111406537">Rosario et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111406537">Rosario et al., 2004b</xref>) and adult men who have sex with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111406537">Seibt &amp; Ross, 1995</xref>). In other studies, greater integration and involvement with the gay community was associated with greater sexual risk among adolescent and adult men who have sex with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111406537">Flores, Mansergh, Marks, Guzman, &amp; Colfax, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111406537">Meyer &amp; Dean, 1995</xref>). One’s identification with or attachment to a gay community may have less of an impact on sexual risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111406537">Agronick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111406537">Flores et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that a floor effect veiled the potential role that involvement in the LBGT community could play for these young sexual minority males.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that respondents with a shorter sexual identity development duration would report more sexual risk behaviors due to having a more rushed developmental trajectory in which they were potentially experimenting with same-sex sexual activity and exploring their sexual identities at the same time. Although developmental duration did not predict sexual risk among this sample of young men who have sex with men, longer developmental duration was significantly associated with more HIV prevention information and greater skills self-efficacy at the bivariate level. This finding may reflect sexual minority male youths’ cumulative exposure to HIV prevention messages and programs in the LBGT community. A longer developmental duration could indicate a longer time period of same-sex sexual activity, and thus more time to practice and develop preventive skills.</p>
<p>In the extended IMB model, higher levels of HIV prevention information and motivation predicted lower primary and secondary sexual risk. Higher levels of HIV prevention information and motivation also predicted greater perceived skills self-efficacy; however, self-efficacy did not have a significant impact on sexual risk. This divergent finding for self-efficacy suggests that these young sexual minority males may be similar to previous samples of sexual minority adults for whom perceptions of their HIV prevention skills did not impact sexual risk. However, given respondents’ reports of being very confident in their ability to enact HIV preventive behaviors (e.g., using condoms and safer sex negotiations with partners), a ceiling effect may have masked an existing relationship between skills self-efficacy and sexual risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111406537">C. M. Fisher, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These study findings should be considered in light of the following limitations. First, the convenience sample of youth recruited from one LBGT community center limits the generalizability of findings to all young sexual minority males, particularly those who are not involved with such LBGT-focused organizations and groups. Yet comparisons between youth in this sample and those from two seminal studies in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111406537">Rosario, Meyer-Bahlburg, Hunter, Gwadz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111406537">Rotheram-Borus et al., 1994</xref>) suggest that the current study findings may be generalized to young sexual minority males who attend LBGT-focused organizations in U.S. metropolitan areas. Thus, study findings may be used to inform future HIV preventive interventions for male youth who participate in similar types of LBGT community organizations. Second, although the term <italic>predict</italic> is used in reference to path analysis, causality cannot be determined by nonexperimental designs such as the one used in this study. Third, reliance on youth’s self-reports may threaten data reliability and validity. However, strategies such as limiting recall periods to 2 months, emphasizing confidentiality, and reminding respondents that their answers would be used to improve programs for sexual minority youth were employed to facilitate accurate self-reports of respondents’ behaviors. Finally, the extended IMB model tested in this study focuses on individual-level factors influencing HIV risk. It is likely that social factors such as power differentials between sexual partners and exchange sex as well as structural factors such as heterosexism and racism also impact HIV risk for young sexual minority males.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite its limitations, this study builds knowledge about the HIV-related cognitive, behavioral, and developmental risk and protective factors for sexual minority male youth by proposing and testing an extended version of the IMB model with this population. This research is a step toward developing a culturally specific explanatory model of HIV risk, and findings have implications for research and practice.</p>
<p>Although the study results identify specific sexual identity development and substance use factors that may be important targets for HIV preventive interventions with young sexual minority males, cross-sectional methods are limited in their assessment of developmental processes and trajectories. Longitudinal studies and mixed method approaches would provide opportunities to assess these important developmental processes and experiences more precisely and investigate the complex developmental trajectories of these youth more fully.</p>
<p>Participants’ race/ethnicity was a significant covariate in the path models. Because subgroup analysis was not possible in this study, future research is needed to explore the predictive power of the extended IMB model with specific racial/ethnic groups of sexual minority youth. Similarly, the utility of the extended model should be explored with transgendered youth as the limited existing research suggests that transgender-identified youth are at extremely high risk for HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111406537">Garofalo, Deleon, Osmer, Doll, &amp; Harper, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Organizations such as LBGT community centers are increasingly developing or participating in community-based HIV prevention programs. Results suggest that intervention content tailored for young sexual minority males should focus on fostering positive attitudes toward LBGT people, decreasing substance use, and educating youth about sexual behaviors with both same- and opposite-sex partners. Furthermore, because young men with a sex-centered developmental sequence may be at higher risk for HIV infection than those with an identity-centered sequence, it is important to reach these adolescents with messages about safer sex—or delaying sex—before their first sexual experience. Youth programs at LBGT community centers and organizations should develop wellness programs that include content on addiction and the health and mental health implications of substance use. Because young sexual minority males may use substances to cope with stressful situations related to their sexual identity development such as rejection or victimization, it is important that wellness programs provide social support as well.</p>
<p>These findings enhance our understanding of the sexual risk behaviors of young sexual minority males and provide a theoretical foundation for the development of preventive interventions tailored for this population. The original IMB model incorporates constructs of other well-known and well-validated individual-level health behavior models used in HIV prevention research including social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111406537">Bandura, 1986</xref>), theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111406537">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>), and the AIDS risk reduction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111406537">Catania, Kegeles, &amp; Coates, 1990</xref>). Despite the proliferation of interventions based on the IMB and other individual-level models, HIV infection among adolescent and adult men who have sex with men is rising at an alarming rate. For this reason, research testing adapted models for this population, such as the present study, are urgently needed.</p>
<p>Effective prevention programs must address the unique cultural and contextual factors that affect sexual risk. The extended IMB model used in this study offers insight into sexual identity development and substance use as two pieces of the HIV risk puzzle for young sexual minority males. Knowledge gained from this investigation is a first step toward developing innovative and culturally relevant interventions for an underserved youth population at high risk for HIV infection.</p>
