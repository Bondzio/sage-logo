<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the associations among relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and the frequency and comfort of discussing religious topics in romantic relationships. Participants included 204 young adults currently involved in a romantic relationship. Results indicated that relational uncertainty was inversely associated with the frequency and comfort with which dating partners discuss religious (and/or spiritual) topics. Communication efficacy, however, was positively associated with both outcomes. Moreover, effects for uncertainty and efficacy were moderated by levels of intimacy and perceived similarity in religious affiliation. Consequently, the results provide meaningful extensions to emerging theories of relational uncertainty and information management in romantic relationships.</p>

<p>Religion, politics, and money – individuals are often socialized at an early age by their parents, peers, and culture to avoid these topics in polite company and in social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407512449402">Stafford, 2004</xref>). Due to potentially quarrelsome responses, conversations involving these sensitive topics are often challenging to the development of interpersonal relationships. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512449402">Baxter and Wilmot (1985</xref>) identified religion as one of several “taboo” topics that romantic partners often consider off-limits in romantic relationships. However, researchers studying religion within marital relationships have documented the importance of this topic to the everyday lives of spouses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512449402">Marks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512449402">Myers, 2006</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512449402">Lehrer and Chiswick (1993</xref>, p. 386) argued that a myriad of lifestyle choices are affected by religious preference, including “the education and upbringing of children, the allocation of time and money, the cultivation of social relationships, the development of business and professional networks, and even the choice of place of residence”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512449402">Myers (2006</xref>) found that a couple’s religious preference is as important in determining marital quality as are their attitudes toward gender, work, and family roles. Increased religious commitment and church attendance, in turn, is positively associated with marital fidelity and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512449402">Bahr &amp; Chadwick, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265407512449402">Wilson &amp; Musick, 1996</xref>), as well as a decreased risk of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407512449402">Blanchard, Bartkowski, Matthews, &amp; Kerley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although romantic partners are likely to discuss their religious viewpoints prior to marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512449402">Krain, 1975</xref>), researchers have yet to explore how romantic partners engage in religious conversations during the formative years of their relationship. This is critical, given the potential outcomes associated with such conversations and the fact that dating partners often negotiate similarities and differences in their religious viewpoints prior to marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512449402">Krain, 1975</xref>). In earlier research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512449402">Bailey and Garrou (1983</xref>) found that potential dating partners who were described as being highly involved in their religion were perceived by both males and females as being more intelligent, more physically attractive, less selfish, better adjusted, more trustworthy, and more attractive as a date than were those who were described as being nonreligious. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512449402">Lutz-Zois, Bradley, Mihalik, and Moorman-Eavers (2006</xref>) demonstrated that individuals’ perceived similarity in religious affiliation and attitude positively predicted relationship satisfaction with their dating partners.</p>
<p>Whether or not partners hold a particular set of religious beliefs, even the choice to eschew a spiritual way of life in favor of an atheistic worldview may influence the various ways in which romantic partners talk about religious and/or spiritual topics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265407512449402">1</xref>
</sup> In fact, discussions of religious topics are likely to vary as a function of both relational and individual characteristics. For example, dating partners who question their own involvement, their partner’s involvement, and/or the future of the relationship may be less likely to discuss their religious viewpoints, given how little they have invested in the relationship and/or because of the risks associated with such discussions. Decisions to refrain from discussing religious viewpoints, however, are also likely to depend on each individual’s level of confidence (or lack thereof) in discussing their own religious beliefs, as well as the degree of intimacy that both partners share in the relationship.</p>
<p>Consequently, in this study, we investigated the unique and combined contributions of relational uncertainty and communication efficacy to religious (and/or spiritual) conversations in dating relationships. Due to the potential risks involved in discussing religious beliefs with a romantic partner, such as discovering incompatibilities that may lead to further questions about the future of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512449402">Afifi &amp; Guerrero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512449402">Baxter &amp; Wilmot, 1985</xref>), we also explored the degree to which the associations among relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and religious conversations are moderated by levels of intimacy and perceived similarity in religious affiliation. In their relational turbulence model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Carpenter-Theune (2004</xref>) argued that moderate levels of intimacy often result in turbulent relationship conditions for romantic couples, as they transition from casual dating relationships to more established romantic partnerships. Therefore, we tested the degree to which intimacy and perceived similarity moderated the effects of relational uncertainty and communication efficacy on discussions of religious conversations (i.e., frequency and comfort level) in romantic relationships.</p>

<title>Religious conversations in romantic relationships</title>
<p>Most of the research on religion and romantic relationships has examined the impact of religious beliefs on the partnership, with a specific focus on marriage. For example, researchers have found that married couples experience increased satisfaction and commitment, and have enacted positive conflict-coping skills, as a result of mutually held religious beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512449402">Goodman &amp; Dollahite, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512449402">Khodabakhsh, Esfandiar, &amp; Ashrafi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407512449402">Lambert &amp; Dollahite, 2006</xref>). Interfaith couples, on the other hand, are less committed, more prone to divorce, and have reported higher frequencies of disagreement than same-faith couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512449402">Bahr, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512449402">Lehrer &amp; Chiswick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512449402">Reiter &amp; Gee, 2008</xref>). Individuals in an interfaith relationship are more likely to lead separate lifestyles, with differences including how they decide to spend time with family, select friends, and use free time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512449402">Kalmijn &amp; Bemasco, 2001</xref>). Given that married couples derive positive outcomes from shared religious beliefs, it stands to reason that dating partners may experience positive outcomes as well. Similarly, divergent religious values may serve as a source of conflict or disagreement for a dating couple – one that ultimately creates stress and/or threatens the future of the relationship.</p>
<p>Although scholars have examined the effects of shared religious beliefs on marital relationships, much less is known about the communicative process by which romantic partners discuss religious and spiritual ideologies, especially during the formative years of the relationship. In adolescent dating relationships, researchers have demonstrated that personal religiosity is predictive of both dating involvement and partner selection (i.e., number of interfaith versus same-faith dating relationships) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512449402">Bartkowski, Xiaohe, &amp; Fondren, 2011</xref>). With the exception of clinical research examining discussions of opposing religious viewpoints during premarital counseling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407512449402">Williams, 2002</xref>), however, researchers have generally neglected how often such conversations occur, as well as comfort levels associated with them, during the early stages of a dating relationship. Two such constructs that are likely to influence dating partners’ comfort levels and willingness to engage in religious conversations are relational uncertainty and communication efficacy.</p>

<title>Relational uncertainty and religious conversations</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Solomon (2002</xref>, p. 245) conceptualized <italic>relational uncertainty</italic> as “the degree of confidence people have in their perceptions of involvement within interpersonal relationships”. Specifically, there are three sources of uncertainty that contribute to relational uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Solomon, 1999</xref>). First, <italic>self uncertainty</italic> refers to individuals’ abilities to describe and predict their own behavior and attitudes within a romantic relationship. Individuals experiencing self uncertainty may doubt their commitment to the relationship and therefore lack a desire to discuss sensitive topics such as religious viewpoints. Second, <italic>partner uncertainty</italic> results from an individual’s perceptions of his or her partner’s involvement within the relationship. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512449402">Berger (1979</xref>), partner uncertainty often arises in situations characterized by a lack of information about a partner’s values and preferences. This lack of knowledge may lead individuals to avoid religious conversations in favor of discussing topics that are deemed safe or favorable, considering the partner’s known attitudes and values. Third, <italic>relationship uncertainty</italic> encompasses questions and doubts about the status, nature, or future of the relationship itself. A dating relationship that is characterized by high levels of relationship uncertainty may create a conversational environment less conducive to talks about deep-seated values and beliefs. It is important to note that relational uncertainty can occur at either global or episodic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>). Although individuals may experience different sources of uncertainty as a function of specific events, in the present study, we examined individuals’ global uncertainty in their romantic relationship.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Satterlee (2009</xref>) argued that relational uncertainty affects both message production and message processing in personal relationships. When producing messages, relational uncertainty can lead to greater face threats, as individuals may unintentionally damage the relationship and/or their personal image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Carpenter-Theune (2004</xref>) found that relational uncertainty affected conversations about sensitive topics (e.g., prior romantic relationships, conflict-inducing topics) and heightened the degree to which such topics were perceived as face-threatening. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Satterlee (2009</xref>) noted that individuals are more inclined to avoid direct communication about sensitive matters for fear of potential damage to the relationship, to their partner, or to themselves. Thus, individuals experiencing relational uncertainty may avoid the issue altogether or evade responding to questions about the topic should it come up in conversation with their romantic partner.</p>
<p>In addition to message production, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Satterlee (2009</xref>) also posited that relational uncertainty impacts message processing by affecting individuals’ perceptions of their communication abilities. They suggested that uncertainty decreases people’s confidence in their abilities to communicate with their partners. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512449402">Knobloch (2006</xref>) examined romantic partners’ date-request messages and determined that individuals who perceived high levels of relational uncertainty had a more negative view of their communication skills. Individuals who reported higher levels of relational uncertainty, in turn, communicated less effectively in their date-request messages and indicated that they believed they communicated poorly compared to third-party observers, who reported more favorable views of the date-request messages.</p>
<p>In general, then, researchers have demonstrated that relational uncertainty is positively associated with negative cognitive and emotional states in romantic relationships. Not only are individuals more likely to evaluate conversations with a partner more negatively when they are experiencing relational uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Solomon, 2005</xref>), but also, people experiencing doubts about their relationship often have difficulty communicating with their partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407512449402">Solomon &amp; Theiss, 2010</xref>). Given that religion is often considered a conflict-inducing topic within interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512449402">Baxter &amp; Wilmot, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>), dating partners may be more hesitant to discuss religion and spirituality because such discussions may lead to a discovery of differences in beliefs, which may in turn lead to arguments, further uncertainty about the status of the relationship, and/or relational dissolution. Consequently, it stands to reason that an inverse relationship exists between relational uncertainty in a dating relationship and an individual’s willingness to discuss sensitive topics, such as religion. The following hypotheses were advanced to test this line of reasoning:<disp-quote>
<p>H1: Relational uncertainty (i.e., self, partner, and relationship uncertainty) is inversely associated with an individual’s level of comfort in discussing religious (and/or spiritual) topics with a romantic partner.</p>
<p>H2: Relational uncertainty (i.e., self, partner, and relationship uncertainty) is inversely associated with the frequency with which an individual discusses religious (and/or spiritual) topics with a romantic partner.</p>

<title>Communication efficacy and religious conversations</title>
<p>Given that relational uncertainty often influences individuals’ perceptions of their own communication abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Satterlee, 2009</xref>), a second goal of this investigation was to examine the association between communication efficacy and the comfort and frequency with which individuals discuss religious topics in romantic relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512449402">Afifi and Weiner (2004</xref>) advanced the Theory of Motivated Information Management (TMIM) as a framework for understanding the process of information management in the face of uncertainty. According to the TMIM, the process of information management occurs when an individual (a) recognizes his or her desire for information, (b) makes a set of judgments based on predicted outcomes, and (c) enacts or refrains from an information-seeking strategy. Specifically, the TMIM proposes that when one experiences a discrepancy between the amount of information one has about an important topic and the amount of information one desires about the topic, such a gap in information may lead to feelings of anxiety.</p>
<p>At the point when individuals experience anxiety, they begin to evaluate their predicament and consider outcome assessments and communication efficacy associated with information seeking. Efficacy assessments include individuals’ belief in their ability to enact a particular behavior and/or their belief in the ability of a target person to successfully achieve the outcome in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512449402">Afifi &amp; Afifi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407512449402">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Within the TMIM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512449402">Afifi and Weiner (2004</xref>) advanced four efficacy assessments associated with information-seeking, including two that focused on the self (i.e., communication and coping efficacy) and two that focused on the target (i.e., access to the information and honesty). Pertinent to our present inquiry is the idea that individuals make self-related judgments about their communication and coping efficacy when it comes to discussing potentially sensitive topics with their romantic partner. <italic>Communication efficacy </italic>is the degree to which an individual believes that he or she can complete successfully the communication tasks involved in an information search, whereas <italic>coping efficacy</italic> is an individual’s perception that he or she has the ability to emotionally and instrumentally deal with the outcomes of the information seeking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512449402">Afifi &amp; Weiner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Efficacy judgments serve as a positive force in determining one’s course of action regarding uncertainty, particularly in situations where potential negative outcomes are anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512449402">Afifi &amp; Weiner, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Satterlee (2009</xref>) argued, relational uncertainty impacts an individual’s confidence in his or her ability to communicate with his or her partner, and individuals make efficacy judgments regarding their partner’s ability to respond to the information-seeking behavior. Previous researchers investigating taboo topics in romantic relationships have suggested that religion, spirituality, and/or other topics related to one’s values, morals, and worldviews represent a domain of conversation with potential to either unite and galvanize, or divide and polarize, relational partners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512449402">Baxter &amp; Wilmot, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>). Thus, in the case of religious conversations, we predicted that an individual’s communication efficacy about religious topics would positively predict his or her comfort levels and willingness to engage in religious conversations with a romantic partner.<disp-quote>
<p>H3: Communication (and coping) efficacy regarding religion (and/or spirituality) is positively associated with an individual’s level of comfort in discussing religious (and/or spiritual) topics with a romantic partner.</p>
<p>H4: Communication (and coping) efficacy regarding religion (and/or spirituality) is positively associated with an individual’s frequency of discussing religious (and/or spiritual) topics with a romantic partner.</p>

<title>Intimacy and perceived similarity of religious affiliation as moderators</title>
<p>Although scholars often focus on relational uncertainty and communication efficacy as distinct factors that influence information-seeking behaviors in romantic relationships, in reality, both factors are likely to interact with each other and with other dimensions of a romantic relationship to influence the discussion of religious (and/or spiritual) topics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407512449402">Solomon and Knobloch (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512449402">2004</xref>) suggested that partners in romantic relationships experience dramatic and reactive emotions as they transition from a casual dating relationship to a committed and exclusive relationship. Specifically, the relational turbulence model posits that such turbulence is most likely to occur at moderate levels of intimacy, as partners begin to coordinate shared activities and future plans for the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>). Intimacy describes “feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness in loving relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407512449402">Sternberg, 1997</xref>, p. 315), and in romantic relationships, it may include sexual intimacy, exchanging ideas, and sharing leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512449402">Patrick, Sells, Giordano, &amp; Tollerud, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the relational turbulence model, moderate levels of intimacy may heighten partners’ perceptions of uncertainty and their information-seeking behaviors. For example, irritating behaviors, such as a partner flirting with another member of the opposite sex or a partner’s indecisiveness, are perceived as more threatening and severe during periods of moderate intimacy, due in part to the experience of relational uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512449402">Solomon &amp; Knobloch, 2004</xref>). This heightened uncertainty, along with the inability to rationally appraise behaviors and rein in emotional responses, could also have an impact on one’s communication efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512449402">Afifi and Weiner (2004</xref>) suggested that efficacy assessments are more salient when individuals anticipate negative outcomes as a result of their information search. In other words, if a partner’s judgment about the outcome of seeking information is clouded by the experience of relational turbulence, his or her efficacy perceptions may be impacted as well. Thus, the relative contributions of relational uncertainty and communication efficacy to an individual’s comfort level and willingness to engage in religious conversations with a romantic partner are likely to vary as a function of intimacy in the relationship. To test this, we advanced the following hypothesis as depicted in a corresponding model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265407512449402">Figure 1</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>H5: Relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and intimacy will interact to predict the comfort level and frequency with which an individual discusses religious (and/or spiritual) topics with a romantic partner.</p>

</fig>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Finally, the degree to which individuals perceive that their partner shares a (dis)similar religious affiliation is also likely to alter the associations in our hypothesized model. In the context of marriage, for example, researchers have found distinct differences between same-faith and interfaith couples in relational commitment, satisfaction, and conflict frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512449402">Goodman &amp; Dollahite, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512449402">Khodabakhsh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512449402">Reiter &amp; Gee, 2008</xref>). Whereas romantic partners may derive positive relational outcomes from a shared religious belief system (or affiliation), divergent belief systems and religious values may serve as a source of tension and conflict – one that ultimately creates stress and threatens the future of the relationship. Consequently, we tested the degree to which perceived similarity in religious affiliation further altered the associations in our hypothesized model by testing the model for measurement and structural invariance across both groups (i.e., similar vs. dissimilar affiliations).</p>

The sample included 129 females and 75 males with an average age of 19.0 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.85). When asked to identify their religious affiliation (if they had one at all), 34% (<italic>n </italic>= 70) identified their partner as having an identical religious affiliation, whereas 66% (<italic>n </italic>= 134) identified their partner as having a different religious affiliation. Of those participants who identified their partners as having an identical religious affiliation, 24.3% were Catholic, 20.0% were non-denominational, 12.9% were Baptist, 8.6% were Disciples of Christ, 7.1% were Methodist, and 7.1% were agnostic, with the remaining participants identifying as Presbyterian (5.7%), Lutheran (4.3%), atheistic (1.4%), or “other” (8.6%). For relationships with dissimilar religious affiliations, most of the participants identified as being non-denominational (17.9%), Catholic (14.9%), Methodist (14.9%), Baptist (10.9%), or “other” (14.9%), whereas most of the partners were identified as being Catholic (17.9%), non-denominational (11.2%), Baptist (10.4%), Disciples of Christ (10.4%), or Mormon (8.2%), with an additional 15.7% identified as “unknown”.<sup>

</p>
<p>Most participants were Caucasian (<italic>n</italic> = 161), though 14 were African American, 14 were Hispanic American, and seven were Asian American. Length of the dating relationships ranged from one month to nine years, with a mean length of 12.66 months (<italic>SD </italic>= 15.99).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265407512449402">3</xref>
</sup> When asked to classify their relationship in terms of emotional attachment, 39.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 80) stated they were in love with their partner and had discussed marriage, 22.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 46) stated there was an emotional attachment but that they were not in love, and the remaining 38.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 78) classified their relationships as ranging from “romantic potential”, to “casual dating but little emotional attachment”, to “frequent dating but little emotional attachment”.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Upon securing human subjects approval, student volunteers who provided informed consent were invited to complete an online questionnaire using Qualtrics software. Surveys were completed anonymously, and in classes where instructors granted permission, students were awarded minimal class credit (less than 2%) for participation in the research. All participation took place outside of regular class time. Upon completion of the survey, students were thanked for their participation and debriefed.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0265407512449402">
<title>Relational uncertainty</title>
<p>Relational uncertainty was measured using Knobloch and Solomon’s (1999) relational uncertainty scale. The instrument consisted of three subscales measuring participants’ levels of <italic>self</italic> uncertainty (e.g., “How certain are you about your feelings for your partner?” “How certain are you about how much you are romantically interested in your partner?”), <italic>partner </italic>uncertainty (e.g., “How certain are you about whether or not your partner wants this relationship to work out in the long run?”), and <italic>relationship </italic>uncertainty (e.g., “How certain are you about the definition of this relationship?”). Responses were solicited using a five-point Likert scale that ranged from (1) <italic>Completely uncertain </italic>to (5) <italic>Completely certain</italic>. Previous reliabilities for the three subscales have ranged from .90 to .97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Donovan-Kicken, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Solomon, 2002</xref>). In this study, the relational uncertainty scale produced alpha coefficients of .97 for self uncertainty, .98 for partner uncertainty, and .97 for relationship uncertainty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0265407512449402">
<title>Communication efficacy</title>
<p>Participants’ perceptions of communication and coping efficacy regarding religion were measured using Afifi and Afifi’s (2009) communication efficacy scales. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512449402">Afifi and Afifi (2009</xref>) developed the original measures to assess efficacy in adolescents who were seeking information about their parents’ relationship. In this study, the <italic>communication efficacy</italic> measure (three items) asked respondents to evaluate their ability to talk with their partner about the issue of religion/spirituality (e.g., “Regarding the issue of religion/spirituality, I am able to ask my partner what s/he thinks about this issue”). <italic>Coping efficacy</italic> (using four items) assessed respondents’ perceptions of their ability to cope with or manage information about their partner’s religious beliefs (e.g., “Regarding the issue of religion/spirituality, I feel confident that I could cope with whatever I discover about my partner’s beliefs on these issues”). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512449402">Afifi and Afifi (2009</xref>) reported alpha coefficients ranging from .82 to .90 for the efficacy measures, and in this study, the scales produced alpha coefficients of .93 for communication efficacy and .72 for coping efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0265407512449402">
<title>Intimacy</title>
<p>Consistent with previous research on the relational turbulence model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Donovan-Kicken, 2006</xref>), we measured intimacy using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512449402">Rubin’s (1970)</xref> Love Scale. Despite its name, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Donovan-Kicken (2006</xref>) have argued that the items on Rubin’s scale actually assess intimacy more generally, because they address feelings of affiliative need (e.g., “It would be hard for me to get along without my partner”), willingness to help (e.g., “I feel responsible for my partner’s well-being”), and exclusivity (e.g., “I feel very possessive toward my partner”). Consequently, we used this 13-item measure to assess relational intimacy, with responses solicited using a nine-point Likert scale that ranged from (1) <italic>Strongly disagree</italic> to (9) <italic>Strongly agree</italic>. Previous alphas for the scale have ranged from .89 to .93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Donovan-Kicken, 2006</xref>), and in this study, the scale produced an alpha coefficient of .90.</p>

<sec id="section13-0265407512449402">
<title>Religious and/or spiritual conversations</title>
<p>In order to measure the frequency and comfort associated with discussing religious and/or spiritual topics, a list of such topics was generated. We recruited three young adults participating in romantic relationships to participate in a focus group. During the focus group, an exhaustive list of all possible terms used to describe different kinds of religious (and/or spiritual) topics was generated. Care was taken not to prioritize one particular religion or spiritual perspective over another, as the topics were intended to transcend specific religious denominations. Example topics included God, good and evil, fate, spirituality, life after death, right and wrong, church, eternity, faith, the supernatural, attending worship services, etc. The same topical list, which consisted of 24 topics in total, was used for both measures. Responses to the frequency measure were solicited using a five-point frequency scale that ranged from (1) <italic>Never</italic> to (5) <italic>Very often</italic>.</p>
<p>To measure respondents’ comfort with discussing religious topics with their romantic partners, the same list of topics was used and responses were solicited using a five-point Likert scale that ranged from (1) <italic>Very uncomfortable </italic>to (5) <italic>Very comfortable.</italic> In order to test the psychometric properties of both pilot inventories, a two-factor measurement model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedures. The results produced acceptable model fit, χ<sup>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To test the first four hypotheses, Pearson’s product-moment correlations were obtained. The fifth hypothesis was tested via multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) using the Lavaan package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512449402">Rosseel, 2011</xref>) for the R statistical computing environment. The confirmatory and structural model contained five first-order constructs: (a) relational uncertainty, (b) communication efficacy, (c) intimacy, (d) comfort, and (e) frequency of religious conversations. To facilitate just-identification, each construct was identified via three <italic>parcels</italic>, or “aggregate-level [indicators] comprised of the sum (or average) of two or more items, responses, or behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512449402">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002</xref>, p. 152). The model also contained four additional moderator constructs representing the three two-way and one three-way interactions among relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and intimacy. These constructs were identified via indicators created using the orthogonalization procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512449402">Little, Card, Bovaird, Preacher, and Crandall (2007</xref>). Four common fit indices assessed model fit: (a) model chi-square, (b) the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), (c) the non-normed fit index (NNFI), and (d) comparative fit index (CFI).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first four hypotheses addressed the extent to which relational uncertainty and communication efficacy are associated with an individual’s comfort levels and reported frequency of discussing religious topics in dating relationships. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265407512449402">Table 1</xref>, the results indicated that all three dimensions of relational uncertainty (i.e., self, partner, and relationship) were inversely associated with both conversation comfort (H1 supported) and frequency (H2 supported). Additionally, both dimensions of communication efficacy (i.e., personal and coping) were positively associated with comfort (H3 supported), though only personal efficacy was positively associated with frequency (H4 partially supported).</p>

<p>The fifth hypothesis predicted that intimacy and similarity of religious belief would moderate the extent to which relational uncertainty and communication efficacy are associated with the frequency and comfort of religious conversations in romantic relationships. Given that perceived similarity is a binary categorical variable, and following the standard two-step modeling procedure recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512449402">Kline (2005</xref>), we conducted a series of nested two-group (religiously similar versus dissimilar) confirmatory models prior to testing our structural model. The presence of orthogonalized interaction terms can inflate estimates of model fit; thus, we first ran a two-group confirmatory model with only the first-order constructs. This model achieved good fit, χ<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265407512449402">2</xref>
</sup>(160) = 244.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, RMSEA = .072, NNFI = 0.97, CFI = 0.98. Because H5 predicts structural differences involving the moderator constructs, all subsequent model tests included the interaction terms.</p>
<p>When analyzing data containing multiple groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512449402">Little (1997</xref>) recommends testing for <italic>measurement</italic> invariance, or the extent to which latent constructs measure the same construct across groups, and then <italic>structural</italic> invariance, or the extent to which construct covariances differ across groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0265407512449402">Table 2</xref> presents the results of these tests. Measurement invariance is established by demonstrating that indicator loadings and intercepts do not significantly differ across groups, and in the present study, these constraints were tenable. The initial omnibus test for structural invariance revealed a significant decline in model fit when constraining the latent covariance matrix to equality across groups, but a follow-up test revealed that cross-group variance differences may have confounded the results of the omnibus test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512449402">Little, 1997</xref>). We corrected for this by creating a series of <italic>phantom constructs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512449402">Rindskopf, 1984</xref>), or second-order constructs that correct for cross-group variance differences by (a) fixing the variance of the first-order construct to zero and the second-order ‘phantom’ construct to 1.0, (b) regressing the first-order construct onto the second-order construct, and (c) fixing this regression path to 1.0 in the first group and freely estimating it in the second group. This moves variance differences to the regression paths and permits a direct test of structural parameter equality. Even when attenuating for variance differences in this fashion, significant covariance differences remained, thus demonstrating that perceived similarity in religious affiliation moderates the associations among the constructs. The final confirmatory model demonstrated excellent model fit, χ<sup>

</sup>(1) = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, thus indicating that communication efficacy is an equivalent predictor across groups. What did differ across groups was the pattern of significant interaction effects. Among those in religiously dissimilar relationships, relational uncertainty significantly moderated the effect of communication efficacy on comfort with discussing religious topics, though this pattern did not change as a function of intimacy. For individuals who perceived that their dating partner shared a similar religious affiliation, however, the effect of efficacy on comfort was moderated by both uncertainty and intimacy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0265407512449402">Figure 2</xref> presents the decomposition of these interaction effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512449402">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>). In the dissimilar group, high levels of uncertainty strengthened the association between communication efficacy and comfort. Similar couples obtained a nearly identical pattern to dissimilar couples at high levels of intimacy, but uncertainty ceased to be a moderator at a mean level of intimacy. At low levels of intimacy, low uncertainty strengthened the association between communication efficacy and comfort, a pattern opposite to that of dissimilar couples.</p>

<p>A different pattern of results emerged for the frequency with which individuals discussed religious topics with their dating partner. Here, intimacy emerged as the only significant predictor, and this only in the religiously dissimilar group. Recall, however, that the test of structural invariance indicated that similarity serves as a cross-group moderating variable. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512449402">Little et al. (2007</xref>), regression parameters of opposite sign between two groups can indicate the presence of an interaction effect across the grouping variable, and indeed such was the case for the three-way interaction effect (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0265407512449402">Table 3</xref>). Constraining this parameter to equality across groups significantly worsened model fit, Δχ<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265407512449402">2</xref>
</sup>(1) = 4.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. This serves as evidence of a four-way interaction effect whereby, as hypothesized, both similarity and intimacy moderate both relational uncertainty and communication efficacy as predictors of religious conversation frequency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0265407512449402">Figure 3</xref> presents the interaction decomposed across both groups at three levels of intimacy. In the similar group, communication efficacy was a particularly strong predictor of conversational frequency when both intimacy and relational uncertainty were low; uncertainty ceased to serve as a moderator at a mean level of intimacy, with evidence for a weak crossover effect when intimacy was high. In contrast, individuals who perceived that their partner shared a dissimilar religious affiliation experienced the strongest effect for efficacy in the presence of high intimacy and low uncertainty, with uncertainty serving as only a weak moderator at levels of intimacy at or below the mean.</p>

<p>Several combinations of the independent variables are noteworthy. First, those in religiously dissimilar dating relationships never reported being simultaneously comfortable with discussing religious topics and having such conversations on a frequent basis. In contrast, for those with religiously similar partners, religious conversations were most comfortable and frequent when intimacy and uncertainty were low but communication efficacy was high. Second, similar and dissimilar couples differed regarding when they were least likely to have religious conversations (i.e., low comfort and low frequency). For similar couples, religious conversations were uncomfortable and infrequent only when intimacy, uncertainty, and efficacy were all low, whereas those in dissimilar relationships reported such avoidance only when high uncertainty occurred in the presence of low intimacy and efficacy. Third, both similar and dissimilar couples seemed to experience the greatest turbulence at high levels of intimacy and uncertainty alongside low communication efficacy; in such cases, both groups were uncomfortable, although similarity moderated whether conversations were frequent (dissimilar group) or of average frequency (similar group). In other words, this combination of variable levels may be especially turbulent for religiously dissimilar couples, because conversations are both uncomfortable and frequent. Overall, this pattern of results supports H5, in that religious similarity and intimacy moderate the extent to which relational uncertainty and communication efficacy predict frequency and comfort of religious conversations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The principal goal of this study was to examine factors that influence the frequency and comfort with which individuals discuss religious (and/or spiritual) topics with their romantic partner. Overall, the results generally confirmed our theoretical line of reasoning. Whereas relational uncertainty is associated with less comfort in discussing religious topics with a romantic partner and a reduction in the reported frequency of these conversations, the ability to seek out and cope with such information from one’s partner is positively associated with discussing religious topics. In fact, our results suggest that the association between communication efficacy and the frequency with which a person engages in religious conversations with a romantic partner depends on the level of relational uncertainty that person is experiencing within the relationship. Moreover, the unique and combined effects of communication efficacy and relational uncertainty depend on both intimacy and the perceived (dis)similarity in religious affiliation between partners. Consequently, our results extend emerging theories of relational uncertainty and information management in romantic relationships by providing at least three implications worth noting.</p>
<sec id="section18-0265407512449402">
<title>Relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and religious conversations</title>
<p>First, our results support the idea that relational uncertainty affects message production in romantic relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Carpenter-Theune, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Satterlee, 2009</xref>). When individuals question their own involvement in a dating relationship and/or their partner’s involvement, and/or doubt the future state of the relationship, such feelings of uncertainty are negatively associated with the comfort and frequency with which they discuss religious (or spiritual) topics with their romantic partner (H1 and H2). This result is meaningful given that religion is often considered to be a conflict-inducing, taboo topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512449402">Baxter &amp; Wilmot, 1985</xref>). In previous research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512449402">Knobloch and Carpenter-Theune (2004</xref>) found that relational uncertainty heightens the degree to which sensitive topics are perceived as face-threatening in romantic relationships. One explanation for our results, then, is that individuals who experience relational uncertainty may be more likely to perceive discussions of religion and faith as face-threatening to themselves, to their partners, or to the future state of the relationship itself. In fact, people are more inclined to avoid direct communication about sensitive matters for fear of potential damage to the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Satterlee, 2009</xref>). Given the centrality of religious preferences to the lifestyle choices of romantic partners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512449402">Lehrer &amp; Chiswick, 1993</xref>), relational uncertainty may constitute an important theoretical mechanism that further explicates how early conversations about religion and spirituality influence lifestyle choices at later stages of romantic relationship development (e.g., engagement and marriage).</p>
<p>Our results also support the notion that relational uncertainty affects message processing by altering individuals’ perceptions of their communication abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512449402">Knobloch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512449402">Knobloch &amp; Satterlee, 2009</xref>). Consistent with Afifi and Weiner’s (2004) TMIM, the more confident people are in their ability to ask their romantic partners what they believe about religion and spiritual matters and to cope with their partner’s responses, the more comfortable and more likely they are to have such conversations in the first place (H3 and H4). However, the positive effects of efficacy depend on levels of relational uncertainty. For instance, communication efficacy served primarily as a positive predictor of comfort with discussing religion and faith across various levels of intimacy when relational uncertainty was high, though this effect weakened as levels of relational uncertainty were reduced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0265407512449402">Figure 2</xref>). The only exception emerged in relation to individuals in the early stages of a religiously similar dating relationship, for whom the interaction pattern of relational uncertainty and efficacy was reversed. Consequently, this pattern tends to suggest that relational uncertainty may inhibit the discussion of a taboo topic (e.g., religion) in a romantic relationship unless a person possesses confidence in his or her own abilities to seek out information about said topic. When an individual possesses high levels of efficacy, the experience of relational uncertainty may, in fact, trigger a search for information and produce further conversations about the topic in question, rather than inhibiting such conversations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0265407512449402">
<title>The moderating roles of intimacy and perceived similarity in religious affiliation</title>
<p>The second set of implications to emerge from the present study pertains to relational intimacy and perceived similarity in religious affiliation. Consistent with our expectations (i.e., H5), intimacy and perceived similarity altered the unique and combined effects of relational uncertainty and communication efficacy on the comfort and frequency with which individuals discuss religious topics with their romantic partner. In the early stages of a dating relationship where partners share a similar religious affiliation, the degree to which partners discuss their religious beliefs and viewpoints may vary primarily as a function of whether or not they possess communication efficacy on the topic of religion and/or spiritual topics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0265407512449402">Table 4</xref>). That is, individuals who possess high levels of confidence in their ability to seek out their partner’s beliefs and cope with the information are more comfortable discussing religion than those who do not; thus, they may be more likely to engage in conversations about different religious (or spiritual) topics with their partner. The same pattern for comfort emerges for individuals in highly intimate dating relationships with partners who share a similar religious affiliation, though high levels of relational uncertainty may render an individual’s communication efficacy less effective in predicting the frequency with which such conversations occur. These results are meaningful given that they underscore the importance of communication efficacy to dating partners who share similar religious affiliations, particularly for individuals in the early stages of a dating relationship who have yet to experience high levels of relational uncertainty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individuals who perceived dissimilar religious affiliations with their partner were far more susceptible to the influence of relational uncertainty when it came to discussing religious (or spiritual) topics. Specifically, individuals who reported low levels of intimacy and communication efficacy, but high levels of relational uncertainty, were least comfortable discussing religious topics with their partners and reported doing so rather infrequently. Researchers have demonstrated that interfaith couples are less committed, are more prone to divorce, and experience higher frequencies of disagreement than same-faith couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512449402">Lehrer &amp; Chiswick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512449402">Reiter &amp; Gee, 2008</xref>). Based on the results of the present study, these trends in interfaith relationships may be explained by relational uncertainty and the degree to which uncertainty heightens perceived differences in religious beliefs between partners. Indeed, religion often becomes a focal point for determining other lifestyle choices between romantic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512449402">Lehrer &amp; Chiswick, 1993</xref>), and thus, questions about one’s involvement in a romantic relationship and/or a partner’s involvement may only undermine further discussions of other important topics within the relationship (e.g., allocation of time and money, upbringing of children, cultivation of social relationships). This explanation is consistent with the relational turbulence model, which predicts that interference from a partner disrupts the coordination and performance of everyday activities, leading in turn to more negative evaluations of the relationship (Solomon &amp; Theiss, 2011). Consequently, interfaith couples may experience interference and turbulence in their relationships as a function of either avoiding direct communication or engaging in fruitless conversations about a sensitive topic that is central to their interdependence as partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0265407512449402">
<title>Theoretical and practical implications</title>
<p>Finally, the results of this study provide implications for emerging theories of relational uncertainty and information management in romantic relationships. Using the relational turbulence model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407512449402">Solomon &amp; Knobloch, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512449402">2004</xref>; Solomon &amp; Theiss, 2011), we reasoned that intimacy would moderate the associations among the constructs in our model, such that relational uncertainty would perhaps produce the strongest effects at moderate levels of intimacy. The interaction effects for individuals in religiously dissimilar relationships provided some evidence in support of this reasoning, yet – contrary to our expectations – the results provided little evidence to suggest that the effects of uncertainty on efficacy, comfort, and frequency were strongest at moderate levels of intimacy. In fact, relational uncertainty was more likely to alter the associations among the other constructs in our model at either high or low levels of intimacy. It could be that the turbulence and uncertainty that couples often experience at moderate levels of intimacy are more likely to be evident when partners attempt to coordinate shared activities and negotiate shared understandings of the romantic relationship (Solomon &amp; Theiss, 2011). Discussions of specific religious (or spiritual) topics may be far less susceptible to relational turbulence because of their episodic rather than global nature. This would make sense given that the former set of circumstances (i.e., shared activities and mutual understanding) are far more central to the transition that partners make from casual dating to more committed relationships.</p>
<p>This study also suggests that the effects of communication efficacy on an individual’s willingness to seek out information about a potentially sensitive topic may depend on their level of relational uncertainty. According to Afifi and Weiner’s (2004) TMIM, the process of information management occurs when an individual recognizes his or her desire for information, makes a set of judgments based on predicted outcomes, and enacts or refrains from an information-seeking strategy. Thus, one fruitful extension of the present study would be to examine how an individual’s motivation for discovering information about their partner’s religion, the anticipated outcomes of a potential search for such information, and the specific strategies used to obtain it change as a function of relational uncertainty.</p>
<p>In a practical sense, our results hold implications for romantic partners who value and practice their religion (or spirituality) and for whom finding a partner who participates in the same faith is central to their idea of marriage. Indeed, there are a number of religions and/or systems of theology that emphasize (and, in some cases, require) that individuals marry someone who shares the same faith. Given that relational uncertainty undermines discussion of religious beliefs within dating relationships, and that the (in)congruence of such beliefs may strengthen (or inhibit) the romantic bond, partners may find that discussing the state of their relationship and re-affirming their own level of involvement with their partner encourages discussion of topics central to the relationship, such as religion and faith. Such conversations, in turn, are likely to enhance relationship satisfaction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512449402">Lutz-Zois et al., 2006</xref>) and provide information useful for negotiating other areas of relational life (e.g., social networks, places of residence, allocation of resources, etc.), particularly for those couples moving toward marriage (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512449402">Lehrer &amp; Chiswick, 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0265407512449402">
<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>Despite the contributions of this study, the results should be interpreted with caution given the inherent limitations of the research design. Key limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, the homogenous sample, and our reliance on individuals rather than dyads as the unit of analysis. Longitudinal research that tracks changes in patterns of relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and discussions of religion at different stages of romantic relationships is needed. Likewise, our use of a categorical indicator for religious (dis)similarity represents an important limitation, given the tremendous variability that exists between and within different religious affiliations and belief systems. Although we were less interested in the subtle nuances of different theological beliefs within the various religions represented in our sample, such differences may influence how comfortable dating partners feel in discussing religion and faith, and the frequency with which they do so over time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results of this study further our understanding of how relational uncertainty, communication efficacy, and intimacy influence discussion of a sensitive and taboo topic in romantic relationships. Future researchers should explore whether the results reported here are unique to discussions of religion as opposed to other taboo topics such as politics. Scholars might also consider the impact of one’s religiosity and dogmatism on discussions of faith and spirituality between romantic partners. For instance, intrinsically religious people are more tolerant of other people’s religious viewpoints, whereas extrinsically religious people are characterized as being less tolerant of other people’s beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407512449402">Allport &amp; Ross, 1967</xref>). Given the impact of religion and spirituality on personal attitudes and beliefs, lifestyle choices, and relational outcomes, scholars should continue to advance research that aims to understand how intimate partners discuss this potentially conflict-inducing topic.</p>
