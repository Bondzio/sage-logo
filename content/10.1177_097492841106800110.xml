<p>The definitive rise of China as a major power is one of the realities which India needs to deal with. In the coming years, China is going to further climb the ladder of hierarchy of the international order. China has been making consistent progress towards building itself as the next important player in the world, after the United States. Additionally, there is no more debate about China’s role in the global economy. The current financial crisis clearly highlighted the degree to which China is engaged in the international system, and it also shows the financial strength of China. It was not a surprise when surpassing Japan, China became the second-largest economy in the world after the US. China’s military modernisation also is well known. Beijing is developing a blue water navy, and is also making rapid progress in space and cyber warfare capabilities. These developments show that Beijing is clearly visualising itself as a leader and is not comfortable with the idea of being a regional player any more. Its international agenda and actions have dual causes; primarily, it is for the domestic needs and second, it is to assert its global presence.</p>
<p>These developments and their implications for India, is the subject discussed in Harsh Pant’s <italic>The China Syndrome: Grappling with an Uneasy Relationship</italic>. The author has argued that there is an urgent need for New Delhi to formulate and execute a coherent policy towards China. He argues that India needs to understand that it has to deal with China at every level and everywhere, and the half-hearted policies will only lead to further problems in this bilateral relationship. This book is only 150 pages long and is divided into five chapters. The author provides a good overview of the current situation of the India–China relations. In the chapters he talks about the Sino-Indian convergences as well as divergences at both bi-lateral and global level. In the third chapter the author provides the readers with his argument around the contrast of the global profile of India and China. He also provides the readers with a number of reasons and the causes for this difference in the global profile. He argues that ‘while China is the most likely challenger of the United States for global supremacy…India is being forced to respond to China’s influence in South Asia and beyond….due to lack of an overarching China policy…these tentative attempts are bound to fail’ (p. 119).</p>
<p>Pant states that Beijing has been consistent in defying the international opinion about its relationship with Pakistan. It has continued to help Pakistan and has made commitments to help Pakistan in the nuclear arena as well. This policy has been followed by China in order to keep India occupied with Pakistan. The author states that the ‘Pakistani nuclear programme is basically an extension of the Chinese one’ (p. 61). China has also been changing its stance on Kashmir, which has affected the Sino-Indian relations. In addition to this, China has been consistently investing in the Indian subcontinent. It is involved in significant infrastructure projects in all of India’s neighbouring countries. Although Beijing asserts that these are for commercial and economic use alone, infrastructure can also be used for strategic purposes. New Delhi needs to take note of this as it still has an unresolved border issue with China.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, China has been more assertive about its likes and dislikes with respect to not only India but also the United States, European Union, Japan, Russia and also the South-east Asian countries. Beijing has not left any stone unturned when it comes to conveying that it has not been happy with certain steps and behaviour of the international community. The author argues that ‘China of today is not the China of yore…it is ready and willing to push back the US on issues of vital national interest’ (p. 81).</p>
<p>In addition to this, globally India and China are interacting and competing at every juncture. The energy needs of both these economies are growing and there is an urgency to secure the constant flow of energy resources. With energy there is also need to have consistent access to raw materials and other resources. The author argues that in this arena also, New Delhi is lagging behind China, and Beijing has been more successful in securing energy resources in various parts of the world like Africa, Latin America, Russia and the Middle East. China has been undertaking a very assertive and forward-looking policy when it comes to energy requirements; on the other hand the policy adopted by New Delhi appears to be quite weak. The author states that ‘while the Indian government does not see its collision with China in every part of the world as competition the rest of the world does….and this competition is the most obvious in the realm of energy’ (p. 106). He further elaborates that ‘China India energy relationship….remains largely competitive if not conflictual’ (p. 107).</p>
<p>The author argues that as all other changes in the international hierarchy have been non-peaceful so will be the rise of China. He calls China ‘the emerging super-power’ (p. 72). He further states that ‘a superpower is a superpower, and it is time to shed the sophomore naivety that has surprisingly upheld the belief that China’s ascent to power will be any different: power is necessarily expansionist’ (p. 157). This argument is to assert the fact that the whole discourse around the ‘peaceful rise of China’ will undergo change once China becomes more confident about its position in the international system. With an increase in economic, military and diplomatic strength, China will be looking for more ways to assert itself.</p>
<p>Pant’s most important point of assertion is that the Indian foreign policy-making circle needs to take account of these developments and changes, and try and formulate policies which are coherent, and highlight the fact that India is also a rising power. He argues that the more we have non-coherent and reactionary policies, the more it will become apparent that New Delhi is not taking its role as a major power seriously. For the world to take India seriously, first, India will have to show that it is interested and serious about its rise and as an important international actor. To support his argument he states that ‘India suffers from a mini state syndrome’ (p. 135).</p>
<p>Pant states that the Indian foreign policy establishment needs to understand its role as a policy-making body more seriously. China is showcasing its strategy globally and India needs to understand this development. Economic integration of both these neighbours is good, but on the political and diplomatic arena there is an urgent need for India to try and counter Chinese ambitions. He argues that there is no need to try and match China force by force, but New Delhi needs to understand that there is a need to have a long-term strategy and planning when it comes to tackling and managing the rise of China. This change will have the maximum impact on India’s development and also the role which India wants to play regionally as well as globally. Beijing has been constantly making efforts to contain India in the South Asian region, and even on the issue of the Security Council membership, it has clearly indicated that it is not comfort-able with giving up its position as the only Asian with a permanent seat. To hope that China would ‘help’ India in this regard is totally futile (pp. 151–152).</p>
<p>The book beautifully highlights the contradictions which the Indian government and policy-makers face when it comes to dealing with China. It argues that the basic problem with the Indian policy-making, is that it lacks a culture of strategic thinking. It highlights both the positives and the negatives which are a part of this development for the future course of India. The book brings to the forefront the areas where we are losing vis-à-vis the Chinese diplomatic success. It argues that if India wants to have a global role and global agenda, there is a need for New Delhi to correct the existing problems and formulate long-term policies. India also needs to work towards nurturing a strategic culture. It also provides the reader with an overall perspective about the region, and what and where the Indian policy-making is not achieving its goal. A must read for people who are interested in the developments and the future outcome of the ongoing tussle between the ‘dragon and the elephant’.</p>
