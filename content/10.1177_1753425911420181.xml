        <p>Hepcidin has been found to be the key regulator of iron metabolism that leads to
          hypoferremia during inflammation. Recent work has shown that equine hepcidin is
          predominantly expressed in the liver of horses. In this study, hepcidin gene expression
          was determined in the liver and bone marrow of six healthy horses after <sc>iv</sc>
          infusion of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O55:B5 LPS. The <italic>IL-6</italic> gene
          expression was also determined in liver and bone marrow samples. Clinical and laboratory
          evaluations were measured at multiple time points between 0 and 240 h post-LPS infusion
          (PI). Liver and bone marrow biopsies were taken immediately before (baseline) and at 6 and
          18 h PI. In response to endotoxin infusion, all horses showed characteristic clinical
          signs of endotoxemia. Plasma iron concentration was decreased significantly from the
          pre-infusion level at 8 h PI. Hypoferremia peak was observed at 12 h and returned to
          normal levels at 30 h PI. Relative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that liver hepcidin
          and IL-6 mRNA expression was up-regulated at 6 h PI. Bone marrow hepcidin relative
          expression was not influenced by LPS infusion. In another experiment, equine monocyte
          cultures were stimulated with LPS (1 µg/ml). Monocyte hepcidin and IL-6 gene expression
          was significantly induced after 2 h of LPS stimulus and returned to baseline levels
          thereafter. The present study describes that, in horses, LPS infusion up-regulates hepatic
          hepcidin mRNA expression resulting in early observed hypoferremia and suggests that
          hepcidin may act as an acute-phase protein in horses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hepcidin is a 25-amino acid peptide synthesized mainly in mammalian, fish and bird liver in
        response to iron store and inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911420181">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911420181">4</xref></sup> It is also expressed in other tissues, e.g.
        cerebral cortex, spleen, kidney, heart, bone marrow, muscle and intestinal
            tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911420181">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911420181">7</xref></sup> Recently, hepcidin real-time PCR relative-quantification in healthy
        horses showed that hepcidin transcripts is highly abundant in liver, although lower level
        expression is present in other tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911420181">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Hepcidin was originally identified as a disulfide-rich peptide with activity against some
        Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911420181">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911420181">10</xref></sup> Further studies demonstrated the role of
        hepcidin in iron metabolism in mammalian species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911420181">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911420181">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911420181">3</xref></sup> Hepcidin
        binds to the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn), which is the only known iron exporter in
            vertebrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911420181">11</xref></sup>
        This association induced Fpn internalization and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911420181">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911420181">12</xref></sup> and inhibition of the iron influx into
        plasma from the ferroportin-rich tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911420181">3</xref></sup> The resulting hypoferremia, considered part
        of the innate immune system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911420181">9</xref></sup> is a common response to systemic infections or generalized inflammatory
            disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911420181">13</xref></sup>
        primarily serving as a host defense mechanism limiting iron availability to invading
            microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911420181">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911420181">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Many studies have focused on the role of hepcidin in innate immunity and control of iron
        metabolism mainly during experimental and/or clinical models of acute inflammation. The
        expression of hepcidin mRNA increased during systemic inflammation induced by LPS in several
            species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911420181">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911420181">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911420181">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911420181">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911420181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911420181">14</xref></sup> As endotoxins (LPS) play a
        pivotal role in many pathophysiologic states and diseases in horses, a series of studies has
        been performed using an inflammation-model with LPS infusion in horses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425911420181">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911420181">20</xref></sup> Therefore, in the current
        study we documented the expression of hepcidin mRNA in the equine liver and bone marrow
        during an experimental model of endotoxemia in horses and, to our knowledge, this is the
        first report to describe the expression of hepcidin in horses with inflammation
        experimentally induced by LPS infusion.</p>

          The relative purity and quality of the isolated RNA was determined by Nanodrop® 2000
          Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific<sup>TM</sup>, Wilmington, DE, USA) and the ratio of
          A260–A280 nm exceeded 1.8 for all preparations. To ensure the complete removal of traces
          of genomic DNA, 1 µg of total RNA was incubated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase. First-strand
          cDNA synthesis was performed with 500 ng of total RNA per 60 µl of reaction using random
          hexamers and ImProm-II<sup>TM</sup> Reverse Transcription System, following the

        <p>Primer sets used in the qRT-PCR amplifying an 81 bp (base pair) fragment of the equine
          hepcidin mRNA (GQ_253624) were an 81 bp fragment of the equine IL-6 mRNA (ECU_64794) and
          an 86 bp fragment of the <italic>Equus caballus</italic> β-actin mRNA (AF_035774.1) as a
          reference gene. Relative quantification of hepcidin and of IL-6 mRNA was performed using
          the comparative Ct method with a 7300 Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) and Power
          SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix. Each quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) reaction was set in
          triplicate in a total of 20 µl each, which contained 0.3 mm of each forward and reverse
          primer, 2 µl of template cDNA, 10 µl q-PCR master mix and 6.8 µl nuclease-free water. In
          addition, a ‘no template’ control was included in duplicate on each plate to show that
          amplicon contamination was absent. The PCR conditions were set as follows: initial
          denaturation at 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s, followed
          by a melting curve. Amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed by melting curve
          profiles generated at the end of each run. Expression of basal equine hepcidin and IL-6
          gene was normalized with <italic>E. caballus β</italic>-actin mRNA. In each plate, a
          standard curve was made using serial 10-fold dilution of both cDNAs used as template in
          the q-PCR reactions. The quantities of the target gene in liver and bone marrow samples
          were calculated relative to the calibrator sample (time: 0 h).</p>

        of LPS in horses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425911420181">30</xref></sup>
        Peritoneal fibrinogen also increased significantly after intra-peritoneal infusion of LPS in
            horses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911420181">20</xref></sup>
        indicating an increased inflammatory response to LPS; however, in the current study, no
        significant increase in plasma fibrinogen concentration was seen at any of the time- points
        measured. On the other hand, the hypoferremia peak (12 h PI) was a sensitive indicator of
        acute inflammation compared with the fibrinogen concentration in horses with endotoxemia
        induced by LPS. A previous, retrospective study comparing serum iron and plasma fibrinogen
        in horses with naturally acquired inflammation demonstrated that hypoferremia was a better
        indicator of acute, sub-acute and chronic systemic inflammation than fibrinogen
        concentration and that iron concentration may be preferable for detecting natural acute
        inflammation in horses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425911420181">28</xref></sup> Hypoferremia has also been observed in other inflammation models using an
        injection of Freund’s complete adjuvant or turpentine oil in horses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425911420181">32</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425911420181">34</xref></sup> Horses submitted to
        experimental inflammation in a model using <italic>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</italic>
        showed a marked drop in iron concentration that remained low until the day 13
            post-infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753425911420181">35</xref></sup>
        In the present study, iron levels returned to similar baseline values at 30 h after the end
        of LPS infusion; at this time all clinical and laboratory findings were already within the
        normal range. These findings agree with those previously described suggesting that iron
        would not return to normal levels until the inflammatory process was resolved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425911420181">28</xref></sup> The rapid return of serum
        iron to pre-infusion concentrations in our study demonstrates the efficiency and safety of
        the inflammation model adopted here which caused an acute systemic inflammation without
        prolonged inflammatory effects.</p>
      <p>Persistent hypoferremia has been observed during inflammatory processes and is a cause of
        anemia of chronic disease in mammalian species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911420181">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911420181">14</xref></sup> In the present study, hypoferremia was
        rapid and transitory and did not cause anemia of inflammation in horses. In one previous
        report, no changes were observed in the PCV values of horses given LPS (30 ng/kg BW of LPS,
        IV) when compared with controls during the 8 h measured after LPS infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911420181">16</xref></sup> These findings were
        similar to those reported herein, but are not in agreement with a study in horses where the
        mean PCV value increased significantly 1 h after LPS infusion (200 ng/kg BW diluted in 1 l
        of 0.9% NaCl administered over 30 min) and remained elevated throughout the experiment
        period (6 h),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911420181">18</xref></sup> or
        other studies of equine endotoxemia that verified that PCV increased above baseline values
        during endotoxemia in horses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425911420181">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753425911420181">36</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Cytokines are an integral component of the adaptive and innate immune responses. Three of
        the most intensively studied cytokines, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α share common actions in the
        host defense against invading pathogens. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study has shown that
        TNF-α plays a significant role in determining lymphocyte hepcidin expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911420181">12</xref></sup> However,
          <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice and human volunteers indicate that IL-6 itself is
        necessary for the induction of hepcidin during inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911420181">13</xref></sup> and that IL-6-hepcidin axis is responsible
        for hypoferremia during human endotoxemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911420181">6</xref></sup> and during repeated psychologic stress
        exposures in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425911420181">37</xref></sup>
        Although plasmatic cytokine concentrations were not measured in this study, it is known that
        TNF-α induces IL-6 release in horses given LPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425911420181">38</xref></sup> and that the peak in serum TNF-α activity
        has been observed about 1–1.5 h after IV LPS infusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911420181">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911420181">18</xref></sup> while the peak in serum IL-6 activity was
        observed 3–4 h after endotoxin was administered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911420181">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425911420181">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425911420181">38</xref></sup> Considering that gene expression of TNF-α
        and IL-6 was also up-regulated in blood cells following administration of LPS in
            horses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911420181">19</xref></sup> and
        considering the increased IL-6 liver expression in the horses used in our experiment,
        thereby confirming that LPS infusion stimulated cells to produce IL-6, it is possible that
        both cytokines may be involved in the increase in equine hepcidin expression in this
        study.</p>
      <p>In addition, IL-6 release was dramatically induced within 3 h after LPS injection and
        urinary hepcidin peaked within 6 h, followed by a significant decrease in serum iron in
            humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911420181">5</xref></sup> Therefore,
        the increase of the hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression observed in horses 6 h after LPS
        infusion may have been stimulated by IL-6, as describe in other species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911420181">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911420181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911420181">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425911420181">37</xref></sup> In rats, the marked increase (9.5-fold) in
        the expression of liver hepcidin mRNA occurred 4 h after LPS injection, while the
        hypoferremia peak was observed 2 h later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911420181">7</xref></sup> The decrease in hepcidin mRNA to levels
        lower than in controls at 24 h after LPS administration in the horses is similar to what has
        previously been reported in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911420181">7</xref></sup> The expression of hepcidin mRNA increased significantly in the bone
        marrow of swine challenged with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> from 8 to 24 h after
            challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911420181">6</xref></sup>
        However, bone marrow hepcidin relative expression performed at 6 and 18 h PI was not
        influenced by LPS infusion in horses. The <italic>in vitro</italic> study confirmed that
        LPS-stimulated monocytes had a rapid and significant increase in hepcidin expression at 2 h
        LPS incubation and thereafter these values returned to basal levels. These results are
        similar to those previously obtained with human LPS-stimulated monocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425911420181">39</xref></sup> These data indicate that
        although monocytes produce IL-6 and hepcidin after LPS exposure, the bone marrow examination
        was performed too late to evaluate hepcidin expression in this experimental protocol.</p>
      <p>In summary, to our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the effects of LPS
        infusion on the expression of hepcidin mRNA in horses. We conclude that LPS infusion
        up-regulated hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression causing rapid hypoferremia. This suggests that
        hepcidin plays a key role in iron metabolism and the innate immune system of horses. In
        addition, plasma iron concentration was a sensitive indicator of clinically apparent
        endotoxemia in the horses. Studies have shown that LPS infusion up-regulates gene expression
        of IL-6 in horses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911420181">19</xref></sup>
        and that hepcidin mRNA is induced by IL-6 in humans and rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911420181">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911420181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911420181">14</xref></sup> Therefore,
        we speculate that similar to those species, hepcidin could act as a type II acute-phase
        protein in horses. Further studies are required to fully understand the effects of
        endotoxins on the expression of hepcidin and to confirm the role of cytokines in the
        up-regulation of hepcidin expression in horses.</p>
