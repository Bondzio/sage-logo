<p>One of the exciting things that a scholar gets to do is nominate colleagues to become new scholars. I recently had that opportunity before the last TCNS meeting in Las Vegas. When she was selected I was as thrilled as when I was chosen several years ago. I owe that to the guidance and belief in me shown by Marilyn McFarland after my work with her on the Certification Review Committee, and her request that I chair the Curriculum Committee for the Core Curriculum for Certification. After a work-intensive weekend at Marge Andrews’s home in Flint, Michigan, we had an outline from which questions for a certification exam could be generated, and the outstanding and successful Core Curriculum for Transcultural Nursing was later written. This is a valuable publication, especially if you are considering applying to take either the basic or advanced exam for certification. It was published as a supplement to the <italic>Journal of Transcultural Nursing</italic> (Volume 22, Suppl. 1) and is available by chapters or as a complete document.</p>
<p>But back to new scholars, and the induction at the Las Vegas meeting. Not only was my friend inducted but also several other TCNS members. The criteria for selection are rigorous as the application states: The purpose of the Transcultural Scholars is to recognize persons who have demonstrated and documented exemplary leadership by advancing transcultural nursing and health care research, education, practice, and/or administration within regional, national, or global contexts. The application (from two scholars) must include documented evidence of exemplary and creative leadership in transcultural nursing and/or health care through research and subsequent publications, expert clinical practice and/or administration abilities, implementation of culturally congruent and competent care, presentations of transcultural nursing and/or health care knowledge, contributions made to health policy development, and any other activities that contribute to the advancement and expansion of transcultural nursing. The selection as a Transcultural Scholar is a hard-earned and well-deserved honor for all the new, current, and past scholars, and I am pleased to be counted among them.</p>
<p>Another event at the annual meeting is a Scholars’ Lunch, at which we can all meet face to face rather than hearing a disembodied voice over the phone during our conference calls. At this meeting, it was announced that there would be a new director of this group: Me! I was honored to be asked, and sincerely hope I can live up to and continue the leadership that has been conducted by my predecessor, June Miller, and those before her.</p>
