<p>Religious experience can scarcely exist without communication. Study of one of these entities seemingly requires study of the other. Yet religion and communication scholars seldom develop theory or do research based on insights from both fields.</p>
<p>Daniel Stout, a professor of journalism and media studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has written this book to promote a subdiscipline drawing on the two realms. He likens this project to the discovery that sociology and psychology could not study all relevant phenomena by theorizing and researching separately, so they created a new field called social psychology.</p>
<p>Stout has coauthored books with religion and media scholar Judith Buddenbaum, formerly of Colorado State, to further this collaborative effort. He also served as founding coeditor of the <italic>Journal of Media and Religion</italic>.</p>
<p>This compact, tightly edited volume makes a strong case. It covers symbols <italic>within</italic> religion (e.g., the pyramids in Egypt and the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California). But it devotes more emphasis to communication <italic>external</italic> to religion that may affect it. For example, the TV program <italic>The 700 Club</italic> promotes a particular brand of Christianity. More than a century ago, evangelist Dwight L. Moody was called a rival of P. T. Barnum as mastermind of “the Greatest Show on Earth.” And, of particular concern to Stout, Andrew Comstock hampered intellectual inquiry by confiscating, burning, and censoring racy books and images to “protect” people from smut.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes that, in this postmodern era, scholars and journalists need to define religion broadly. Until fairly recently, the field focused primarily on traditional faiths—particularly Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Also of interest were denominations and sects within faiths. Now, however, new denominations, and even new religions, crop up quite often, and serve many traditional functions, albeit in new and different ways. Results include creating a sense of awe, real meaning in life, and often (not always) a comforting or disconcerting concept of life after death.</p>
<p>Stout seeks to add clarity and coherence to this analysis by emphasizing a concept called the <italic>Numinous</italic>, which has at least four elements. These include</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012472021" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Ritual</italic>. Elvis Presley fans come to Graceland, Elvis’s home in Memphis, each year to celebrate the King. They dress and fix their hair much as he did.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Core beliefs that help bind fans to each other</italic>. Star Trek fans—Trekkies—share a positive vision of the world and how it can be improved through innovation, technology, and science. Egalitarian values also are stressed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Community.</italic> Participants meet regularly to share ideas, develop a sense of common purpose, and enjoy camaraderie. Elvis fans meet annually at Graceland. And a Trekkie convention occurs somewhere in the world almost every week.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Deep emotion</italic>. “Elvi’s,” Trekkies, and Notre Dame football fans identify strongly with their heroes and feel intense happiness or sadness depending on the characters’ fates.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Stout briefly explores physiological and psychological correlates of such faith, emphasizing the notions of <italic>flow</italic> (feeling satisfied with progress and forward movement), <italic>meditation</italic> (relaxation and loss of self-identity), and <italic>trance</italic> (an intense, deep state of consciousness and mental absorption in these developments).</p>
<p>One chapter is devoted to media criticism using these and related concepts to help understand interpretation by various audiences. The book also looks at ideas about the media versus the message—for example, Marshall McLuhan’s notion that a “hot” personality may not do well in the television age. And Stout presents the script of a play involving the plight of a PhD student at a fictitious Comstock University. The student uncovers evidence that Andrew Comstock, the famed censor and founder of the university, had been involved in a murder. The examining committee fails the student to further a cover-up. And, predictably, the failure is reversed with dire consequences for the professors who did the concealing.</p>
<p>The book also has two rather glaring, related omissions.</p>
<p>First, it says little about <italic>religious extremism</italic>. Surely, in this age that includes both al-Qaeda and the Aryan Nation, extremism and related intolerance are major aspects of any broad-ranging inquiry about the Numinous. These organizations appear to offer members many of the four elements noted earlier.</p>
<p>Second, the author does not discuss research linking extremism to communication-related processes. For example, psychologist Milton Rokeach focused on closed-mindedness largely as a by-product of anxiety—of a deep-seated feeling that the world is a hostile place.</p>
<p>Any book covering such a broad array of topics in fewer than two hundred pages is bound to be superficial. The volume lacks depth needed in a text for a course on religious communication. However, it surely would serve as a worthwhile supplementary reading in such a course, or in one dealing with specialized journalism or media ethics. Any offering of these types might well include a section on religious communication. Stout’s book is a “should read,” though perhaps not a “must read,” for such courses.</p>
