<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813j"><title>Abbott Gleason, ed., <italic>A Companion to Russian History</italic>, Wiley-Blackwell: Chichester, 2009; xi + 554 pp.; 9781405135603, £110.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This volume is one of the latest additions to Blackwell’s burgeoning series of companions to various historical periods and themes. Designed to provide an authoritative overview of scholarship, synthesizing existing debates whilst providing an indication of where the field is heading, these companions target scholars, students and general readers. Ultimately, though, Gleason is realistic in his foreword, seeing students as the main market and aiming to create a volume that will be a ‘stimulating supplement’ to textbooks or specialized monographs. It has to be said at the outset that this particular volume amply fulfils these ambitions. The <italic>Companion to Russian History</italic> consists of 28 essays: one on the current state of Russian historiography; four on the early Slavic world; four on Muscovy; ten on the Russian Empire; seven on the Soviet Union; and a final two on contemporary Russia. Gleason has assembled a stellar cast of contributors with many of the authors recognized as the foremost scholars in their field. The vast majority are based in North America with a few from Europe, including two Russian scholars. It is impossible to do justice to all of these contributions in a short review, but all are valuable and interesting to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p>The essays do vary in their approach. Broadly speaking, they are divided between those summarizing a distinct chronological period in Russian history and those tracing themes across one or more periods. Similarly, some take a consciously historiographical approach, being constructed around major debates, whilst others are purely descriptive, with a few falling somewhere in between. This lack of consistency is not necessarily a problem, but it does mean that the essays can be utilized in different ways. Whereas, to take a few examples, Lindsey Hughes on Petrine Russia and David Engerman on the Cold War are useful as informed and succinct introductions for students, Nancy Shields Kollman on Muscovite political culture and Richard Hellie on slavery and serfdom are much more effective with a prior knowledge of the major developments during these periods.</p>
<p>From this reviewer’s perspective, some of essays are, inevitably, more thought-provoking than others. Christopher Ely provides a nuanced and intriguing discussion of the ongoing debate into the nature of civil society in late Imperial Russia, questioning the assumption that civil societies should be seen as inseparable from liberal-democratic governments. Instead, he argues that accepting that Russia possessed a different, yet vibrant, form of civil society enables a better appreciation of the complex nature of Russian society by 1914. Melissa Stockdale summarizes Russia’s experiences of the First World War, an area that has been relatively neglected until recently in comparison with the vast amount of research on other countries during this period. She emphasizes the huge impact of a ‘totalizing war’ in areas such as citizenship and national identity, as well as increasing state power and attempts at mass mobilization. Robert English explores the changing patterns of thinking under Khrushchev and Gorbachev, providing a sense of the changing mentalities fostered by Khrushchev’s ‘thaw’ and its impact on society and culture. He draws valuable links between these changes and the emergence of a post-Stalinist generation of reform-minded party figures, as epitomized by Gorbachev. Other intriguing essays see Nadieszda Kizenko discuss old belief, Gary Marker chronicle the westernization of the elite, Gary Saul Morson focus on the intelligentsia and Robert Geraci examine ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, plenty of material in this book for the student and, to a lesser extent, the specialist, as is to be expected from such a strong group of contributors. There should even be, as Gleason hopes, something in here for the elusive general reader. Having said that, it is very much a volume that should be used as Gleason suggests; namely, as an addition to other reading, and there are certainly a number of essays here that will slot very easily into existing module reading lists. The volume is, however, extremely expensive. The publisher cannot be targeting students directly, for few can afford to pay this price. But even hoping that this volume will become an indispensible addition to university libraries might be misplaced in the current climate (in the UK at least). Is this book a worthy equivalent to the three or four other studies that could be purchased for the same amount? Possibly, but it is not a clear-cut case.</p>
