<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An 86-year-old Afro-Caribbean parkinsonian gentleman with intermittent Mobitz II heart block and syncope received a DDD pacemaker (Medtronic AT500™ Minneapolis, MN, USA). The pacemaker was programmed to DDD pacing at 60-110 beats per minute. The chest radiograph immediately post-pacemaker insertion confirmed satisfactory lead positions and initial pacing checks after implantation were all within normal limits</p>
<p>Two weeks after implantation, the patient complained of intermittent abdominal muscle twitching. A repeat chest radiograph confirmed displacement of the atrial pacing lead into the left brachiocephalic vein, without lead fracture. Eight days later, the patient had a repeat chest radiograph which confirmed the complete displacement of the atrial pacing lead into the subclavian vein and, subsequently, back into the pacemaker pocket (Twiddler’s syndrome). Instead of lead repositioning, it was decided to change the setting of the pacemaker to VVIR pacing. The patient was clinically well post VVIR pacing.</p>
<p>Displacement of the pacing leads due to twisting of the box on the part of the patient was first described in 1968 by Bayliss et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112461161">1</xref></sup> who coined the phrase, ‘Twiddler’s syndrome’. This condition occurs when the patient either consciously or unconsciously rotates or “twiddles” the pacemaker in its pocket, causing torsion, dislodgement or even fracture of the pacing lead. Indeed, the patient had been observed touching the pacemaker area and moving the pacing box due to his Parkinson’s disease. When the pulse generator is rotated along the transverse axis, it is referred to as the Reel syndrome; a variant of Twiddler’s syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112461161">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112461161">3</xref></sup> The diagnosis is made by the chest radiograph which reveals the displaced, twisted lead around the pacemaker.

<title>Clinical presentation</title>
<sec id="section3-0267659112461161">
<title>History</title>
<p>An 86-year-old Afro-Caribbean gentleman presented with recurrent syncope. Initially, he was investigated for cerebrovascular disease, but computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans demonstrated only small vessel ischaemic changes. He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. From his past medical history, he had Parkinson’s disease, controlled on rasagiline, sinimet and entacapone tablets. He also had osteoarthritis, glaucoma and a previous hernia repair. He did not have any relevant past cardiac history.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section4-0267659112461161">
<title>Examination</title>
<p>On examination, he was well perfused. He was normotensive, with a heart rate of 61 beats per minutes and finger oxygen saturation on room air of 96%. On auscultation, his heart sounds were normal and the chest was clear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267659112461161">
<title>Investigations</title>
<p>Admission blood tests were unremarkable. The electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with first degree heart block. A chest radiograph did not demonstrate any sign of abnormality. The patient was monitored and, during the syncopal episodes, Mobitz block type II was recorded. He was referred for pacemaker insertion (Ic recommendation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112461161">5</xref></sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267659112461161">
<title>Management</title>
<p>During pacemaker implantation, a left subclavicular incision and cephalic approach were used. A passive ventricular pacing lead was inserted in the right ventricular apex and a passive atrial lead positioned in the right atrium. The two pacing leads had good radiographic positions with no diaphragmatic pacing at 10V on each and continuous pacing was demonstrated on each lead during standard stability tests.</p>
<p>The pacemaker was programmed to DDD pacing at 60-110 beats per minute. The chest radiograph immediately post pacemaker insertion confirmed satisfactory lead positions and initial pacing checks after implantation were all within normal limits.

<title>Outcome</title>
<p>Two weeks later, the patient complained of intermittent left rectus abdominis muscle twitching, which was following the pacing heart rate. A chest radiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112461161">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrated that the atrial pacing lead was displaced into the left brachiocephalic vein while the ventricular lead was still in the right ventricle.</p>

</fig>
<p>The next day, the patient desaturated to 89% on room air and further investigation demonstrated multiple peripheral pulmonary emboli. Anticoagulation was initiated. The muscle twitching persisted and, eight days later, the patient had another chest radiograph which demonstrated that the atrial lead was further displaced into the left subclavian vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659112461161">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267659112461161">4</xref>) near to the pacemaker pocket. The ventricular lead had remained in position and functioned normally. It was decided to switch the pacemaker to VVIR-mode pacing. On reprogramming of the device, the muscle twitching stopped, associated with relief of symptoms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Displacement of the pacing leads due to twisting of the box on the part of the patient was first described in 1968 by Bayliss et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112461161">1</xref></sup> who coined the phrase Twiddler’s syndrome.

When the pulse generator is rotated along the transverse axis it is referred as the Reel syndrome; a variant of Twiddler’s syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112461161">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112461161">3</xref></sup> The diagnosis is made by the chest radiograph which reveals the displaced, twisted lead around the pacemaker.

<p>This case report describes Twiddler’s syndrome in a patient who may have been at higher risk of lead displacement on account of his Parkinsonism and ongoing rehabilitation and highlights the usefulness of chest radiography as well as the value of VVIR pacing instead of DDD pacing to patients in whom lead positioning is felt to be unsuitable.</p>
