<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To synthesize evidence of family members recognizing that their relative is likely to die within the year, and identifying the need for palliative care.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: A meta-ethnography of studies of family members in multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<p><bold>Review methods</bold>: Systematic search in electronic databases; thematic synthesis guided by the principles of meta-ethnography, which is a method for thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Nine articles were included. The results of the synthesis identified two key themes. First, family members are intimately aware of changes in their relative’s health and well-being. Sub-themes include family member awareness of different and progressive stages of the disease, noticing deterioration, noticing decline in functional abilities and recognizing that their relative will die. The second key theme is dilemmas of being involved in prognostication. Sub-themes include family member ambivalence toward hearing about prognostication, health professionals not being knowledgeable of the disease and family reluctance to receive palliative care.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Family members monitor and recognize changes in their relative with PD, MND and MS and in themselves. Thus, drawing on the expertise of family members may be a useful tool for prognostication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Historically, palliative care has been provided for patients with malignant rather than non-malignant conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311402712">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311402712">2</xref></sup> However, extending palliative care to people with conditions other than cancer is a growing concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311402712">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311402712">4</xref></sup> There is relatively little research about the palliative care experiences and needs of people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD), motor neuron disease (MND) and multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p>The majority of research in prognostication has been conducted in oncology focusing on clinicians’ views, with growing evidence accumulating in predicting the terminal phase in organ failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311402712">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311402712">6</xref></sup> By contrast, illness trajectories in non-malignant diseases are frequently long and uncertain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311402712">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311402712">8</xref></sup> for example, the average length of disease from diagnosis in MS is 25 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311402712">9</xref></sup> Identifying end of life (EoL) is difficult to predict with precision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311402712">10</xref></sup> Advance care planning and decision-making around end-of-life care, and achieving a good death, are therefore compromised. One recommendation is to offer a dual approach: active management alongside an acknowledgement of the possibility of death so that patients and their unpaid carers can hope for the best and plan for the worst.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311402712">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Owing to the chronicity of these neurodegenerative conditions, supportive care may be required for many years, which is often provided by family members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311402712">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311402712">14</xref></sup> Informal carers spend considerable amounts of time with the person with the diagnosis, and have intimate knowledge of them as a person and of their disease progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311402712">15</xref></sup> With increasing recognition that patients should be offered choice over their place of death and evidence that many patients, if they express a preference, wish to die at home,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311402712">16</xref></sup> as well as a shift toward non-hospital services, family members will increasingly be involved in, and witness, end-of-life care and subsequently may exert considerable influence at end of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311402712">17</xref></sup> Studies have suggested that family members should be considered a resource for EoL care and integrated into medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311402712">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Papers exploring the complexities of prognostication have tended to frame their approach within a traditional biomedical paradigm. Glare et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311402712">19</xref></sup> for example, describe the measurement of physical markers (noted as poor performance status, weight loss, symptoms such as anorexia, breathlessness or confusion and abnormalities on laboratory parameters) before indicating that such information is then relayed in the form of a prognostication to patient and family.</p>
<p>However, other studies report findings that suggest that involving both patients and family members in assessing palliative care outcomes and needs has the potential to strengthen prognostication. Higginson and McCarthy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311402712">20</xref></sup> assessed the validity of their Support Team Assessment Schedule (STAS) tool by comparing responses from clinicians, family members and patients, indicating strong validity for the tool for use by non-clinicians drawing on experiential knowledge. Although the STAS is not a prognostic tool, reported changes in functioning on the measure may be used as proxies for decline.</p>
<p>Professional-led approaches to recognizing the dying phase potentially ignore the expertise of the family, which is built up over years of caregiving. Although the vital role of family members as unpaid carers has repeatedly been acknowledged,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311402712">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311402712">22</xref></sup> and general practitioners see the role of the caregiver as positive, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311402712">23</xref></sup> some studies suggest that their views on whether their relative is approaching death are not necessarily taken into account,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311402712">24</xref></sup> despite guidelines recommending their involvement in this process. For example, European Guidelines for the care of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their relatives recommend that clinicians include the patient and family in addressing, for example, symptom management, treatment choices and the initiation of palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311402712">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Identifying ways of refining prognostic estimates is particularly warranted in non-malignant conditions in which making predictions is particularly problematic. This leads to significant challenges for advance care planning in these disease groups, including neurodegenerative conditions. Relatives’ views on prognosticating may be one method of augmenting the clinical judgements of experienced physicians and nurses and thereby improving prognostication. However, there are no published systematic reviews that have reported on the existing evidence in this important area and there appear to be few studies that have addressed it.</p>
<p>The aim of the review was therefore to improve understanding of experiences of family members by systematically searching for papers that report experiences of family members of people with PD, MND and MS recognizing that their relative was ‘likely to die within the year’.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269216311402712">
<title>Type of literature review</title>
<p>Addressing this aim, the review addressed questions such as: what were family members noticing about their relative that made them think that they were likely to die within the year; what changes in their own lives were they having to make once they knew that their relative was likely to die within the year and did the family’s relationship with health services change once their relative was in the last year of life? Focusing on qualitative literature in its own right is particularly important because it draws attention to subjugated, experiential knowledge.</p>
<p>The review was guided by the principles of meta-ethnography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311402712">26</xref></sup> A meta-ethnography is ‘the synthesis of interpretive research’ (Noblit and Hare:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311402712">26</xref></sup> p. 10) and aims to preserve the unique character of qualitative studies through the selection of key metaphors (metaphor is the term that the originators of meta-ethnography use instead of theme) from the original texts; but also to provide a new interpretation of these studies, rather than a simple aggregation. To achieve these aims, it uses a rigorous set of procedures. We adopted a ‘reciprocal translation’ involving seven phases (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-0269216311402712">Box 1</xref>). The lead author has used this method of synthesizing qualitative studies previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311402712">27</xref></sup> and it is a method that has been used successfully to understand other health-related subjectivities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311402712">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311402712">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Phases of the meta-ethnography</title>
<p>Phase 1: Identification of family members recognising when their relative is likely to die within the year as an intellectual interest.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Conducting a systematic search for relevant qualitative studies.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Reading the articles, paying particular attention to metaphors/themes used by the authors to describe and/or explain family members’ experiences of their relative’s last year of life.</p>
<p>Phase 4: Developing a tabular format to compare studies; listing key metaphors/themes in each study.</p>
<p>Phase 5: Translating studies into one another; examining relations between metaphors/themes within a study and between studies.</p>
<p>Phase 6: Synthesising these translations by determining if some metaphors/themes could encompass other metaphors, thus translating them into each other. The synthesis took the form of a ‘reciprocal translation’. That is, similar studies made it possible for each study to be translated into the metaphors/themes of others and vice versa.</p>

<title>Selection criteria</title>
<p>The following selection criteria were used for including studies in the review. A rationale for these criteria is provided so that it is clear why studies were included:</p>
<list id="list1-0269216311402712" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Studies that used a qualitative design; this is so that studies that explore as opposed to quantify experiences were included. Mixed methods papers were included if the qualitative component was based on the family member’s perspective. Commentaries, letters and quantitative studies were excluded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Studies that included data that would aid our understanding about family members’ experiences of recognizing that their relative was likely to die within the year; this is the subject of the review. We included papers that gathered the perspectives of people diagnosed with the illness, healthcare professionals and family members, but data were extracted only from quotations of family members.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-malignant conditions included in the review were PD, MND and MS. These were chosen because they are common neurodegenerative illnesses. We excluded papers focusing exclusively on cancer, but included studies about cancer and at least one other of the neurodegenerative conditions. We also included studies that included other non-malignant conditions, such as cardiac failure or COPD, but only if they also included PD, MND and/or MS. However, only quotations from family members of relatives with PD, MND or MS were extracted for the thematic synthesis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-English articles were excluded to avoid translation bias.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Studies about children were excluded because these diseases are extremely rare in children and the relationship of family members to children is different to that between parent and adult offspring or between spouses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311402712">30</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All titles and abstracts were read for relevance by two reviewers (GH, KM) and those that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria were obtained in full. Then, the full text was read by the two reviewers and those that met the inclusion criteria were included.</p>

<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>Cochrane Pain, Palliative Care and Support Group suggest that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘To protect against bias and ensure that all relevant data are included in a review, it is important to use a variety of sources to identify studies that could be included. These sources must be reported… so that readers know: a) the databases and information sources that have been searched, b) the years searched, b) the search terms used. Ideally, enough detail should be provided so that others can replicate the search’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311402712">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For phase 2 of the meta-ethnography the following search strategy was used:</p>
<list id="list2-0269216311402712" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>The following electronic databases were searched: CINAHL, Health Source, Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane library and Index to theses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We searched for papers published between January 2000 and April 2010.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The following search teams were used because we believed that they would identify publications that contained data about experiences of family members recognizing that their relative was likely to die within the year. We combined Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and text words so that keywords defining care (for example, palliative care) were combined with non-malignant conditions (for example, MS) and with keywords relating to families. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311402712">Table 1</xref> shows the text word combinations used for the searches.

<title>Inclusion of studies</title>
<p>The search found no studies that were specifically designed to investigate family members’ experiences of people with PD, MND and MS recognizing that their relative is likely to die within the year. However, studies designed to explore the palliative care experiences and needs of people living with non-malignant conditions did offer some, albeit limited and partial, insight on this subject. Thus, papers were included if they informed understandings of the role of family members recognizing that their relative is likely to die within the year. Nine of these articles were included and the findings synthesized. The relevant data often only consisted of one or two quotations from family members. The quotation was used by the original authors of the paper to highlight a particular theme that addressed the main focus of their paper, which was not about prognostication. However, the quotations were selected for the purposes of this paper because they offered some understanding of the role of family members during the last year of the relative’s life. These data provide insight and understanding, albeit limited and partial, of the potential involvement of family members in decision-making about prognostication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311402712">
<title>Synthesis of findings</title>
<p>Two reviewers (GH; KM) agreed that the data within these nine papers could be synthesized, which would make a small contribution in understanding family members’ experiences that their relative was likely to die within the year. The procedure for the synthesis, which was conducted by the two reviewers reaching agreement at each stage of the process, was as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0269216311402712" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Quotations of family members talking about their experiences, which the reviewers believed informed understandings of them recognizing that their relative was likely to die within the year, were highlighted in the paper with a marker pen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Phase 3 of a meta-ethnography involves reading the articles, paying particular attention to metaphors/themes used by the authors. Phase 4 entails developing a tabular format to compare studies; listing key metaphors/themes in each study. Thus, themes that the original paper had generated from the author’s interpretations of data were recorded and are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311402712">Table 2</xref>. This is so that the quotations of family members can be understood in the context of the original study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>However, the purpose of the review was to move beyond describing and presenting quotations and themes found in each individual paper. Phase 5 involves translating studies into one another; examining relations between metaphors/themes within a study and between studies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The translation was achieved by the reviewers (re-) reading the quotations and themes and then categorizing them into two key themes: i) intimate awareness of changes in the relative, and ii) dilemmas in involving family members in prognostication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Phase 6 of a meta-ethnography involves synthesizing these translations by determining if some metaphors/themes could encompass other metaphors/themes, thus translating them into each other.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The synthesis was achieved by introducing several sub-themes. Sub-themes under the key theme, ‘Intimate awareness of changes in the relative’ included: i) family member awareness of the different and progressive stages of the disease, ii) noticing deterioration (e.g. noticing decline in functional abilities), and iii) recognizing that their relative will die. Sub-themes under the key theme, ‘Dilemmas in involving relatives in prognostication’, include i) family members wanting information on prognosis, ii) ambivalence towards hearing about prognosis, iii) health professionals not being knowledgeable of the illness, and iv) family member reluctance in receiving palliative care. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311402712">Table 3</xref> lists the two key themes and sub-themes.</p></list-item>

<title>Intimate awareness of changes in the relative</title>
<p>Quotations from papers showed family members noticing changes in their relative’s health and well-being, particularly progressive deterioration in functional ability. Although it is perhaps not surprising that relatives notice these changes, it is striking that there is so little empirical evidence that has synthesized exactly what they are noticing and monitoring.</p>
<p>Family members talk in detail about the changes in their relative’s condition and describe the impact on them as the main informal caregiver. Hudson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311402712">34</xref></sup> found that the most overwhelming challenge faced by people with PD and their family was the prospect of deterioration and complications associated with the disease, leading to eventual death. They provide the following quotation from a family member:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I think he’s going to start choking on his food a lot more… I worry about him choking to death, if I’m not there.’ (Hudson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311402712">34</xref></sup> p. 90)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The quotation marks out the relative’s role in monitoring the person’s ability to swallow food and consequent concern about him choking. Deterioration is evidenced through lack of ability to swallow. The impression given is that the relative worries more as a consequence. Thus, changes, which may act as indicators of increasing likelihood of death include decline in the patient’s functional abilities but also emotional change within the family member.</p>
<p>One study suggests that family members of people with MND are aware of the different stages of living with the illness and the impact on the family. Dawson and Kristjanson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311402712">35</xref></sup> describe the experiences of family members providing ‘end-stage care’ to people with MND. A theme they identified relates to family members’ reactions and responses to the illness situation and changes in the disease trajectory. Family members describe the grief that accompanies recognition of loss of function. They quote a family member who says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘…Every day (the grief) is with you…the whole time it never leaves you. Then you go through the different stages, when they stop walking, when they’re in chairs. You get used to a new stage and then you carry on, then the next one comes.’ (Dawson and Kristjanson:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311402712">35</xref></sup> p. 39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quotation suggests that family members have a sense of moving through different stages as the disease progresses. It highlights that they notice changes in their relative but also can reflect on the ways in which these changes impact on them. These changes in the person with the illness but also in family members are potential indicators that can be used by primary care clinicians in the process of prognostication. A quotation in the study by Hudson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311402712">34</xref></sup> also indicates that family members are aware of the different stages of PD and know what final stages look like:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘… I couldn’t help observing all the ones in the last and final stages of Parkinson’s which is quite unbearable. Some of them were like zombies and not only had they lost their physical capabilities but mentally they seemed to be on another planet.’ (Hudson et al.:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311402712">34</xref></sup> p. 90)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The authors use the quotation to make a point that some family members find support groups confronting and unnecessary, but we use it here to show that family members can be intimately aware of their relative’s deterioration.</p>
<p>Ray and Street<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311402712">36</xref></sup> quote a family member of someone living with MND to make the point that caregivers lose control over their daily activities. Yet, the quotation also gives the impression that the family member is constantly observing their relative disintegrating before their eyes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘The right hand has gone nearly completely and I have noticed the last couple of months I seem to be doing more and more of the feeding and more and more of the just picking things up ‘cause he just can’t do anything at all, can’t comb his own hair, he has not dressed himself for 18 months. It’s horrific really, just watching a person disintegrate. You tend to sort of shut off a lot as a means of coping… It’s just awful (cries). You get angry sometimes, you do get irritated and annoyed because it’s your life too.’ (Ray and Street:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311402712">36</xref></sup> p. 39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The family member reports that her husband has not been able to dress himself for 18 months. She also notices that over the past couple of months she has been feeding him more and picking things up for him. She gives a clear impression of noticing changes in her husband’s abilities as affected by his condition and is able to pinpoint these changes in months. She also notices changes in herself; she is angry, irritable and gets annoyed.</p>
<p>Another family member reaction to their relative’s condition identified by Dawson and Kristjanson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311402712">35</xref></sup> was the feeling of watching life in reverse. They state:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘All carers described the pain of watching the deterioration of their family member… The developmental stage of the family was important. The future usually involved caring for an increasingly dependent relative and facing an uncertain future, instead of moving forward in life.’ (Dawson and Kristjanson:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311402712">35</xref></sup> p. 39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, studies present evidence showing that family members are aware of their relative’s deterioration and can reflect on the impact on them. Key markers include noticing progressive physical weakness and also greater dependence on them for carrying out daily tasks, which augments personal emotional change.</p>
<p>Noticing physical deterioration and loss of daily living activities, however, is different to being able to recognize that their relative is likely to die within the next year. One study suggests that family members do recognize this phase. Wollin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311402712">37</xref></sup> quote a family member who describes feelings of sadness and relief during the last two years of their relative’s life who was diagnosed with MS:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘See when it’s a progressive thing… You really know… she going to die. Whether it’s going to be today or tomorrow… it was one of those things she got progressively worse and worse… the last 2 years were hell… so it’s sad to lose them but it was a relief because she had… no quality of life in the end, none whatsoever.’ (Wollin et al.:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311402712">37</xref></sup> p. 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The quotation suggests that the family member was aware of her relative’s deterioration two years before her death. The change in quality of life leads her to describe these last two years as hell, and some relief when the person died. Further, the quotation highlights that palliation for some people with MS may be required for several years and that attending to the relative’s sense of sadness and loss is a requisite element of palliative care.</p>
<p>However, some of the studies suggest that pinpointing the time when a relative is likely to die is complex. Even acute exacerbations are not necessarily indicative of imminent death. Although family members may be able to describe in detail their relative’s health and well-being, accurately interpreting such changes as indicative of the terminal phase is not straightforward.</p>
<p>In a study of family experiences of living with MND, Ray and Street <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311402712">36</xref></sup> identify how families live in a constant state of uncertainty. A family member says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I really don’t know what to expect. This is probably my biggest point, what’s going to happen. I would like to have someone tell me that this, this and this is going to happen but it doesn’t. Because everybody is so different’ (Ray and Street:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311402712">36</xref></sup> p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One reading of this is that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to identify a symptom or cluster of symptoms that are indicative of a likelihood that the person will die within the year. This reinforces other authors’ position that prognostication is complex for non-malignant conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311402712">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311402712">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311402712">38</xref></sup> Another reading, however, is that family members are not provided with sufficient information about disease progression to make an informed judgement about what a change in the relative’s condition signifies.</p>
<p>In a study of breathlessness, Gysels and Higginson <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311402712">15</xref></sup> highlight that uncertainty, due to an unpredictable disease trajectory, is one of the main issues facing family members. A quotation from a family member with MND leads them to conclude that family members learn how to manage acute exacerbations and after the first incident, know better what to expect and how to respond:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘But I couldn’t, the hardest thing was coping with Roland about two or three times when he got into a panic situation and I didn’t really know what to do and I hadn’t got a Lorazepam which will calm him down initially. [It] gives you time to then deal with the situation and gives him time. So I think dealing with him in a panic was [the worst], because that’s totally out of character. The third time it happened earlier on this year, we did not waste time, we go straight, everybody says, go straight to A&amp;E. So don’t use up your own emotional energy and get into such a situation where things are seriously bad.’ (Gysels and Higginson:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311402712">15</xref></sup> p. 159)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The family member is providing medication, making key decisions during acute illness episodes and monitoring her relative’s and her own emotional state. Thus, family members often learn quickly about the disease and can make informed judgements about necessary care. This illustrates how family members develop intimate knowledge of their relative’s condition, which enables them to respond appropriately with symptom control measures. Arguably, such intuitive knowledge could make a contribution to prognostication.</p>

<title>Dilemmas in involving family members in prognostication</title>
<p>The above section suggests that family members have knowledge about changes in their relative and in themselves that could potentially be used by clinicians in the process of recognizing that their relative is likely to die within the next year and identifying the need for palliative care. Yet, the review also shows dilemmas in involving family members in prognostication.</p>
<p>Under the theme, ‘Experience of services’, Hughes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311402712">39</xref></sup> conclude that some professionals’ lack of understanding and knowledge about MND or their attitudes and approach to family members of people living with MND created reluctance among family members to ask professionals questions. They use the following quotation of a wife of a man with MND as an example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I never hear anybody say, well, how long it would take or how long he could live, or anything like that. I suppose that’s a question at the back of my mind. I’m not too scared, but I don’t want to ask… I don’t really want to’ (Hughes et al.:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311402712">40</xref></sup> p. 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the authors point out, the family member indicates that she is not scared to find out about prognosis but that she did not feel able to ask because she felt that professionals could not provide an answer or were not approachable. Conversely, a family member in another study gives the impression that he wanted to know about prognosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Is she near the end? That’s the question I keep asking myself over and over; how near the end are we? Where on the scale are we right now? It’s very frustrating not to know things like that’ (Bolmsjo and Hermern:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311402712">40</xref></sup> p. 189)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet, Giles and Miyasaki <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311402712">41</xref></sup> found that family members were ambivalent about how much information they wanted about prognosis. Under the theme, ‘Wanting and not wanting’, they include the following quotation of a daughter of an individual with PD:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Well maybe or maybe better not to know, I don’t know (laughs) but I don’t know, I think she’s [mother] doing OK’ (Giles and Miyasaki:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311402712">41</xref></sup> p. 123)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, a study of the experiences of people living with MND suggests that not all family members are willing to hear about their relative’s prognosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I’ve not been very good in that I haven’t found out much about MND because I can’t bear to face, I’d rather just take it one day at a time and then deal with it on that day. I don’t want to know what his prognosis is, I think to read the grimmest facts are too much, I couldn’t’ (Hughes et al.:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311402712">39</xref></sup> p. 69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These latter two studies suggest that engaging family members in the process of identifying whether or not the individual is likely to die within the year may be difficult if it means that family members must know about prognosis, which is not always desired.</p>
<p>A study of South Asian Sikh and Muslim patients and family carers, including those with neurodegenerative disease found that some family members were reluctant to seek help because of a concern about what others in their community would say.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216311402712">42</xref></sup> The authors quote the daughter-in-law of a Sikh man with a non-malignant illness, ‘If we ask for help from outside, what would others say? They would say that she could not take care of her father in law’ (Murray et al.:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311402712">4</xref></sup> p. 6). Although based on a sample of minoritized ethnic families, this reluctance to identify the need for palliative care may well be a shared concern across the UK about how palliative care is understood by others. Multiple layers of stigmatization, such as living with a neurodegenerative diagnosis and having a palliative prognosis combine to make family prognostication difficult territory.</p>

<sec id="section13-0269216311402712" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The review identified no studies that have been specifically designed to investigate the role of family members in recognizing that their relative it likely to die within the year or identifying the need for palliative care. However, studies designed to explore the palliative care experiences and needs of people living with non-malignant conditions did offer some insight on this subject.</p>
<p>Family members’ intimate awareness of subtle changes in their relative’s health and well-being may be amenable to being harnessed to assist in recognizing when a patient is likely to die within the next year and consequent need for palliative care. Awareness of changes in their relative, and their own increasing worry, could act as triggers for requesting palliative care. Recognizing such shifts is likely to be subtle, based on a long historical relationship with the person with the diagnosis, and contextualized by their role in supporting the person (and witnessing others) through functional decline.</p>
<p>Skilled clinicians often build reflections from relatives into their assessments, and formal assessment tools such as the STAS (Support team Assessment Schedule) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269216311402712">43</xref></sup> can be formally completed with family members, to garner and draw on their experiential knowledge. However, despite such best practice in both assessment and communication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216311402712">44</xref></sup> systematic reviews of evidence highlight that patients and family members receive inadequate information on prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311402712">36</xref></sup> and identify discrepancies on healthcare professional, patient and family views on what information has been communicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216311402712">45</xref></sup> Consequently, communication with families at end of life is suboptimal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311402712">46</xref></sup> despite their critical role in caregiving. This review points to a need for greater transparency in communication, both to address the clear deficit of information exchange, but also to enable greater support to family members who are noticing change in both themselves and their relative.</p>
<p>The emphasis of drawing on family member experiential knowledge would be to augment clinicians’ understandings rather than to suggest that the onus should be placed on relatives. This approach is suggested to sit alongside medical agendas of identifying novel objective measures, complimenting the need for subjective clinician judgement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216311402712">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further research is needed to explore the extent to which family members may feel as though they are able to contribute to prognosticating.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269216311402712">
<title>Strengths and limitations of the review</title>
<p>A rigorous meta-ethnography was carried out, that included a comprehensive search of the literature using predetermined selection criteria and a thematic synthesis, following carefully planned procedures. Yet, there are general concerns regarding the ability to synthesize qualitative research, which often have differing philosophical assumptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269216311402712">47</xref></sup> Criticisms have been levelled at a synthesis where the original theoretical orientation, context and themes of each study included in the synthesis are lost. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311402712">29</xref></sup> Thus, when we deviated from the original themes and use of a quotation, we made this explicit. Nevertheless, loss of context and original themes remains an important dilemma for qualitative synthesis approaches. Thus, the findings of this review should be treated as prompts to further enquiry, rather than an end in itself.</p>
<p>A weakness of the review is that no studies included in the synthesis were specifically designed to investigate the role of family members in recognizing that their relative is likely to die within the year and identifying the need for palliative care. Thus, the synthesis points to further research rather than being solid evidence in and of itself.</p>
<sec id="section15-0269216311402712">
<title>Implications of the review</title>
<p>Palliative care should be available to people with neurodegenerative conditions, but referral to appropriate teams depends on recognizing when it is required. At present, the onus and responsibility for identifying people for palliative care is on the GP and the multidisciplinary team. This review suggests that primary care clinicians could use the knowledge of family members to inform their decision-making and may benefit from the input of the family member.</p>
<p>Prognostication is complex. Assessment tools that measure biological,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311402712">24</xref></sup> functional and symptom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269216311402712">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269216311402712">49</xref></sup> scores have been shown to have some value in estimating prognosis. However, these tools are completed by clinicians and may not fully utilize the expertise of family members. The review suggests that family members of people with neurodegenerative conditions recognize signs of deterioration, especially changes in functional ability. This knowledge could be used by clinicians to improve prognostication. The review also suggests that changes in the relative, particularly shifts in emotion, are indicative of deterioration of the person with neurodegenerative disease. Thus, assessment of family members’ emotional well-being, as a marker of their relative’s deterioration, could also improve prognostication.</p>
<p>Family members have a type of knowledge of the illness that could be harnessed by primary care clinicians. Experiential knowledge is learned by personal experience of the illness, which is different to that learnt from, for instance, medical training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269216311402712">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269216311402712">51</xref></sup> If experiential knowledge about their relative is given authority and credibility, this could be used in conjunction with the knowledge of the disease that the health professional possesses. Together, they would be able to perhaps more accurately predict prognosis.</p>
<p>The review highlights dilemmas for the involvement of family members in prognostication. Health professionals may be reluctant to communicate with patients that they may die within the year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269216311402712">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269216311402712">53</xref></sup> This review suggests that family members may have mixed views regarding conversations about the likelihood that their relative will die. It is one thing to closely monitor a relative’s deterioration, and quite another to know of, and play a role in predicting, approaching death. This reflects a more generic cultural issue of a paucity of open discussion about death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311402712">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216311402712">44</xref></sup> Previous work demonstrates that clinicians do not effectively communicate about end-of-life issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269216311402712">54</xref></sup> Further, discussing when the principal focus of a relative’s clinical management needs to change from actively managing the disease process to palliation of symptoms is difficult. Studies about the last days of life show that although some family members want to know if their relative in the final days of life, others do not welcome it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269216311402712">55</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Family members monitor and recognize changes in their relative with PD, MND and MS and in themselves. These changes could act as markers for the need for palliative care and possibly as part of identifying that the person is likely to die within the year. Further research is needed to address this issue directly and to investigate whether including family insights might facilitate predicting prognosis.</p>
<p>This leads to a question regarding the ways in which relatives can be involved in helping to recognize that death is approaching. Harnessing carer insights in to how their relative appears compared to how they were, what might be expected from their relative taking in to consideration their age, general physical health and mental status, together with the relative’s specific experience of the dying person are all arguably very important for a proper assessment including prognosis, but the challenge must be doing it in the context of the sensitivities of such discussions.</p>
