<p><italic>Background</italic>: Accurate measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) using indirect calorimetry (IC) facilitates optimal energy prescription. Steady-state (SS) REE obtained using a 5-minute protocol (SS5) has been used as a surrogate for 24-hour REE measurement. However, SS5 conditions are difficult to achieve in critically ill children on mechanical ventilatory support. <italic>Methods</italic>: The authors prospectively examined factors associated with successful IC testing using the standard SS5 protocol in mechanically ventilated children. They examined the agreement of REE between SS5 and 2 abbreviated SS protocols: 4-minute (SS4) and 3-minute (SS3) protocols as well as the Schofield prediction equation, using Bland-Altman analysis. <italic>Results</italic>: IC testing (n = 45) was completed in 34 children. SS was achieved during 25 (56%), 31 (69%), and 42 (93%) tests, using the SS5, SS4, and SS3 protocols, respectively. Intratest variability in respiratory rate, endotracheal tube leak, and inspiratory time was associated with failed IC by the SS5 protocol. The mean bias (limits of agreement) for REE was 2.8 (–47 to 65), 5.8 (–71 to 72), and −127 (–418 to 1176) kcal/d using SS4, SS3, and Schofield, respectively. A stronger agreement was observed when means of all abbreviated SS REE values during a 30-minute test were used. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: In mechanically ventilated children, 4-minute and 3-minute SS protocols allowed REE measurements to be obtained in most patients with reasonable accuracy. Abbreviated protocols may decrease the need to rely on inaccurate equations when assessing energy expenditure in children who fail IC testing by standard SS criteria.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Providing optimized nutrition to patients during critical illness is an important goal of contemporary critical care medicine. Increasing evidence indicates that energy imbalances that occur as a result of inaccurate resting energy prediction equations put patients at risk for underfeeding and overfeeding and can lead to unnecessary morbidity and length of hospital stay. Although indirect calorimetry (IC) provides accurate measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE), it is often not feasible due to failure to reach steady state (SS) in critically ill children. In our current study, we have shown the feasibility of abbreviated protocols, which increase the proportion of patients who meet steady-state criteria during IC. The abbreviated protocol provides REE measurements that are within clinically accepted limits of agreement and are superior to a commonly used prediction equation. Hence, these protocols may allow optimal energy prescription in a group that would otherwise fail SS using existing protocols and prevent underfeeding or overfeeding due to reliance on inaccurate equation estimates of REE.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard for accurate bedside measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) in critically ill children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112441948">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112441948"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112441948">3</xref></sup> Because 24-hour testing is typically not feasible, REE measured during a shorter stable measurement period (steady state [SS]) has been used as a surrogate for daily energy expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112441948">4</xref></sup> REE during a shortened period is optimally correlated with 24-hour REE measurements only if SS criteria are met, that is, when minute-to-minute oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide elimination (VCO<sub>2</sub>) vary by ≤10% for 5 consecutive minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112441948">4</xref></sup> However, a number of patients fail to achieve SS by these criteria, and a reliable measurement of REE cannot be obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112441948">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112441948">5</xref></sup> The ability to achieve SS is particularly challenging during critical illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112441948">6</xref></sup> An abbreviated (less than 5-minute) IC protocol may increase the likelihood of achieving SS conditions and a reliable REE measurement in patients who fail the 5-minute protocol. In the adult population, a reduction in the time period for SS from 5 to 4 minutes or 3 minutes greatly increased the proportion of patients meeting steady-state requirements while still achieving measurements of REE within a clinically acceptable range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112441948">5</xref></sup> However, the accuracy of such modified SS criteria has not been tested in the pediatric population. In this study, we aimed to identify demographic, metabolic, and ventilatory parameters that are associated with achievement of 5-minute SS in this group and examine the agreement between standard (5-minute) and abbreviated (4-minute and 3-minute) IC protocols for REE in mechanically ventilated children.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Children who met institutional criteria for metabolic assessment in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from September 2010 to August 2011 were included in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112441948">7</xref></sup> These criteria were developed to identify children at high risk of metabolic instability and are recommended by the most recent American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) guidelines for IC testing in critically ill children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112441948">8</xref></sup> Criteria for exclusion from the study were (1) presence of an uncuffed endotracheal tube; (2) large leak in the ventilator circuit, defined as a difference of ≥15% between measured inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes; (3) presence of a chest tube for air leak or bronchopleural fistula; (4) fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) ≥60%; (5) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support; and (6) clinical deterioration requiring ongoing resuscitation or procedures at the bedside.</p>

<title>Measurements</title>
<p>REE was estimated by the Schofield equation using height, weight, age, and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112441948">9</xref></sup> All patients received optimal sedation and analgesia according to institutional practice for mechanically ventilated children. Ventilatory parameters were recorded using the Datex S5 portable monitor with patient spirometry unit (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The procedures for measuring REE using the metabolic monitor have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112441948">10</xref></sup> In brief, patients were fasted for 4 hours preceding IC. VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> were measured using the VMax Encore Metabolic Cart (Carefusion, San Diego, CA), which employs breath-by-breath respiratory gas exchange monitoring with a mass-flow sensor. Flow sensor calibration (to ±3% using a 3-L calibration syringe) and gas calibration were performed before each measurement as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Inspired and expired oxygen concentrations were analyzed using an electrochemical cell, which was calibrated to 3 known standard concentrations (16%, 20.94%, and 26% O<sub>2</sub>). Carbon dioxide concentrations were measured using a nondispersive infrared analyzer that was calibrated to 3 known standard gas concentrations (4%, 0.05%, and 0% CO<sub>2</sub>). Inspired gas concentrations were measured immediately after the humidifier on the inspiratory limb of the ventilation circuit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112441948">Figure 1</xref>). The mass-flow sensor and expiratory gas analyzer were connected at the ventilator exhaust to measure exhaled gas concentrations and flow. VMax data was recorded using a laptop computer and the VMax Vision software for Windows (Carefusion). The modified Weir equation was used to calculate REE (expressed in kcal/d)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112441948">11</xref></sup>:</p>

<p>Measured energy expenditure (MEE) was compared with energy expenditure estimated by the Schofield equation (EEE), and the metabolic state of individual patients was defined as normometabolic (MEE:EEE 90%−110%), hypermetabolic (MEE:EEE &gt;110%), or hypometabolic (MEE:EEE &lt;90%).</p>

<title>Steady State</title>
<p>IC was performed for up to 30 minutes in each patient. SS was reached as soon as consecutive 1-minute measurements of VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> varied by ≤10% for each of the specified time periods. For the purposes of this study, we defined the time periods required for SS achievement as <italic>standard</italic> using a 5-minute protocol (SS5) or <italic>abbreviated</italic> using 4-minute (SS4) and 3-minute (SS3) protocols. Because the duration of the IC test permitted multiple intervals during which SS criteria could be satisfied, a <italic>mean</italic> steady-state REE was calculated for the abbreviated 4-minute (SS4′) and 3-minute (SS3′) protocols. For example, a 4-minute SS interval may be observed more than once during a 30-minute testing period. All such 4-minute periods for SS were included in the calculation of the mean 4-minute SS (SS4′). The measured REE values for each abbreviated protocol were compared with the REE from the standard 5-minute protocol. Computations were done offline using MS Excel (version 11.8.8, SP3; Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Prism (version 5.01, 2007; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to conduct statistical analyses. Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD. Coefficient of variation was computed for respiratory parameters during individual patient IC testing. The independent sample <italic>t</italic> test and Fisher exact test were used to compare the characteristics of those patients who achieved standard 5-minute SS and those who did not. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the specific strength of the relationship between REE obtained by the following protocols: (a) SS5 and SS4, (b) SS5 and SS3, (c) SS5 and SS4′, and (d) SS5 and SS3′. Differences in measured REE in the 5 different periods were assessed by Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs test. Agreement (mean bias and limits) between REE from each protocol was assessed at the individual level using the Bland-Altman method. In an effort to compare our findings with a previous adult study, we also reported the agreement at the ±10% level between the protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112441948">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-four mechanically ventilated patients (12/34 male) in the PICU met institutional criteria for targeted metabolic measurement and were enrolled in the trial. A total of 46 IC tests for REE measurements were successfully conducted in this cohort. Seven patients underwent repeat measurements during their PICU course either due to change in clinical condition and assessment of basal needs (n = 6) or to rule out overfeeding (n = 1). One patient was excluded due to technical problems leading to a corrupted file and loss of data. Of the 45 tests included in the analyses, SS was achieved during 25 tests (56%) using SS5, 31 (69%) using SS4, and 42 (93%) using SS3 protocols. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112441948">Table 1</xref> shows the clinical, metabolic, and ventilatory characteristics associated with the tests, which are categorized into 2 groups, based on achievement of SS using the standard protocol. There were no statistically significant differences in age, height, weight, and gender between the 2 groups. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the absolute values of respiratory parameters (with the exception of peak inspiratory pressure), intratest variability (quantified by coefficient of variation) of respiratory rate, endotracheal tube leak, and inspiratory time was significantly associated with failure to meet SS using the 5-minute protocol.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IC is an important tool for optimizing energy intake and minimizing the complications associated with underfeeding or overfeeding during critical illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112441948">7</xref></sup> In the present study, 20 (44%) tests failed to achieve SS during IC when using the standard 5-minute protocol. This precludes metabolic assessment in a significant proportion of critically ill children. The failure to reach SS was associated with intratest variability in respiratory rate, inspiratory time, and leak at the endotracheal tube. Abbreviated protocols resulted in an increased likelihood of achieving SS, 31 (69%) with 4-minute and 42 (93%) with 3-minute protocols. Indeed, the number of patients who were able to reach SS was nearly doubled when using the 3-minute protocol. We observed a strong correlation between REE obtained by the standard and abbreviated protocols, within a clinically acceptable range for limits of agreement. The mean of all abbreviated SS REE values during the 30-minute test further improved agreement with the standard IC test. The REE measurements from abbreviated protocols were more accurate than estimates obtained from a routinely used prediction equation. The results of our study suggest that abbreviated protocols for IC are feasible in critically ill children who fail to reach 5-minute SS and are a superior alternative to estimates from the inaccurate standard equations. A software solution to obtain the mean of all SS values of REE during a 30-minute IC has the potential for increasing the accuracy of the test at the bedside. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the role of abbreviated protocols for IC and their accuracy in critically ill children. In addition, the utility and agreement of mean abbreviated protocols in this context have not been described previously.</p>
<p>Abbreviated IC protocols have been previously explored in critically ill adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112441948">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112441948">12</xref></sup> The typical IC test performed in most centers is considered complete once a 5-minute period with minimal variation in the minute-to-minute data points has been reached. This period of SS is necessary to ensure that the volumetric respiratory gas data obtained during this time is a true indicator of metabolic state. Daily energy expenditure derived from these data has been used as a surrogate for 24-hour measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112441948">4</xref></sup> The goal of IC protocols for SS is to avoid sampling of metabolic data during periods with large fluctuations in VCO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub> values, often seen following interventions such as ventilator changes, suctioning, and other invasive procedures. However, the complexity of care in the intensive care unit and minute-to-minute variations in physiology often preclude the stringent criteria for SS in this group. Reeves et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112441948">5</xref></sup> demonstrated that reducing the time period for SS greatly increased the proportion of patients achieving SS. In their study, 54%, 69%, and 97% achieved SS using 5-minute, 4-minute, and 3-minute protocol, respectively. The 4-minute protocol allowed an increased number of patients to achieve SS and obtain reliable REE. Their observations in spontaneously breathing adults in the outpatient setting are very similar to our findings in critically ill, mechanically ventilated children in the PICU. McEvoy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112441948">12</xref></sup> investigated the difference between a 5-minute SS protocol and shorter protocols ranging from 2–4 minutes in critically ill adult patients with brain injury. An agreement within ±10% was observed in 100%, 96%, and 90% of patients using 4-minute, 3-minute, and 2-minute protocols, respectively. Once again, the results of our present study mimic those in the adult study, with the level of agreement that is deemed acceptable in critically ill patients. On the basis of our results, IC measurements may be continued until a 5-minute SS is reached. If 5-minute SS cannot be achieved after 30 minutes, abbreviated protocols may then be used to identify shorter SS periods from the data set. In patients who continue to fail SS criteria, a 24-hour measurement may be the only method for obtaining accurate daily energy expenditure.</p>
<p>Determination of patient characteristics that predict the likelihood of achieving SS conditions is desirable. We did not find any association between age, height, weight, or measured energy expenditure and SS achievement. Peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) was the only absolute mechanical ventilatory variable associated with achievement of SS. High ventilator pressures are known to be associated with a higher severity of illness and the likelihood of increased levels of sedation and/or neuromuscular blocking agents to prevent patient dysynchrony with the ventilator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112441948">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112441948">14</xref></sup> However, this study was not powered to detect any meaningful associations between SS achievement and muscle relaxant or sedative usage.</p>
<p>Manipulation of mechanical ventilator settings has been shown to influence VCO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub> up to 2 hours after the intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112441948">15</xref></sup> Patients are tested at least 4 hours after any change in mechanical ventilator settings or interventions such as tracheal suctioning, so that variations in respiratory parameters during the metabolic measurements are minimized. Despite these precautions, spontaneous intratest variability of several respiratory parameters is unavoidable. Variability (coefficient of variation [CV]) in respiratory rate (RR), inspiratory time (Ti), and leak reflects instability and is associated with failure to achieve SS using the 5-minute protocol. Failure to achieve SS is associated with higher inspired oxygen and more variable FiO<sub>2</sub>, although these findings are not statistically significant. The currently used exclusion criteria for FiO<sub>2</sub> (≥60%) and leak (≥15%) are likely prudent when selecting eligible patients for IC. On the basis of the results of our study, patients with significant variability in ventilatory parameters may be candidates for an abbreviated SS protocol.</p>
<p>IC measurement is recommended for accurate assessment of energy requirement in critically ill children and adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112441948">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112441948">16</xref></sup> However, in the subset of patients in whom IC is unavailable or technically not feasible or in those who fail to reach SS, energy intake is routinely based on an estimate of REE by prediction equations. Prediction equations in critically ill children are known to be inaccurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112441948">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112441948">18</xref></sup> As a result, critically ill children are at risk of cumulative underfeeding as well as overfeeding when energy prescriptions are based on equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112441948">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112441948">10</xref></sup> In our study, the Schofield equation overestimated the measured REE by an average of 25%, with wide limits of agreement (–85% to 142%). Its use as an optimal assessment of energy expenditure cannot be recommended. On the other hand, mean SS REE measurements from both 4-minute and 3-minute protocols were much more accurate with limits of agreement (–2.6% to 1.6% and −8.7% to 2.8%, respectively). Although an abbreviated protocol is not a replacement for standard IC testing, it may be a significant improvement over prediction equations for energy expenditure assessment in critically ill children.</p>
<p>We have reported observations from a single center. Although our study cohort represents the classic assortment of patients in a multidisciplinary PICU, these results need to be confirmed in other centers. We did not explore the effect of other variables such as temperature, specific clinical conditions, body mass index, timing of the test, or use of muscle relaxants and sedatives on the accuracy of the shortened IC protocols. Larger studies examining specific diseases and including patients with wider age and anthropometric characteristics (such as body mass index) will enhance our understanding of metabolic state and accuracy of abbreviated SS protocols in these populations. In patients who fail to achieve SS by standard protocols, future studies are needed to prospectively examine the role of SS3 and SS4 against a more firm reference value (such as a 24-hour REE). Finally, the recent interest in IC has resulted in a number of new metabolic monitoring devices available on the market. Shortened protocols may not be applicable to these devices until the results of our study have been replicated and their accuracy verified.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Failure to meet standard SS criteria during IC limits the availability of metabolic monitoring in a subgroup of critically ill children. This subgroup of mechanically ventilated patients is at risk of energy imbalance due to reliance on inaccurate equations for estimating energy requirements and can be identified by the variability in their ventilator parameters. If 5-minute SS criteria cannot be achieved after 30 minutes, accurate REE values within clinically acceptable limits can be obtained in this group by using abbreviated (3-minute or 4-minute) protocols. The mean of all SS values for REE during a 30-minute test further increases the accuracy of the abbreviated protocols. REE obtained by abbreviated SS protocols during IC, interpreted in conjunction with clinical assessment, may decrease the need to rely on inaccurate equations when assessing energy expenditure in critically ill children.</p>
