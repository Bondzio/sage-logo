<italic>The Future of Batterer Programs: Reassessing Evidenced-Based Practice</italic> takes a step back from the findings of individual evaluations and analyses of programs to present a higher level view of the overall state of batterer interventions and research. Edward Gondolf, emeritus professor of sociology and researcher, has authored nine books on battering as well as numerous journal articles on battering and mental health and substance abuse. He was the principal investigator in a multiyear study of batterer programs ending in 2001 that was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>This book broadly describes batterer programs and discusses program effectiveness, reviews program approaches, summarizes the literature on individualized treatment, examines directions for program improvement, and highlights promising new developments and treatments. Differences and controversies in each area are clarified as well. The book is divided into three sections, each independent of the other two. As such, information in each section is repeated as needed. Unless noted, the following is a summary of the book’s contents.</p>
<p>Section 1, “Sorting out Batterer Programs” (Chapters 1 and 2), summarizes the primary batterer treatment approaches and philosophies, notes their differences, and sorts out the research findings related to batterer program effectiveness. Batterer programs face a number of issues both philosophical and practical: should programs emphasize treatment to stop future battering or serve only as a consequence for abuse; to what extent programs should address the individual psychological problems of batterers; coordination and collaboration with courts and law enforcement; whether programs should teach parenting skills, especially where children have witnessed battering or have been battered; funding limitations; and the growing need for program standards.</p>
<p>One of Gondolf’s major themes is program effectiveness, which is tied to problems that plague batterer program evaluations: high drop-out rates, accurately measuring reoffending, program staff turnover, failure to follow agreed upon program protocols, and other issues. He emphasizes that evaluations should give more consideration to practitioners’ thoughts and ideas. Practitioners express frustration that evidence-based practices too often cannot be implemented in the actual program setting. Despite these issues, several reasons for optimism are highlighted. This section concludes with the assessment that major changes in batterer programs would not be warranted at this time because too much is still unknown.</p>
<p>Section 2, “The New Psychology” (Chapters 3 and 4) begins with a review of the targets of batterer treatment as addressed by batterer program types. The prominent program type is the Duluth model, employed by 50% of all programs. A cognitive behavioral approach seems to be the norm but even within this major type and approach, programs still vary widely based on local needs, the beliefs of those running the programs, and other factors.</p>
<p>A desire to improve outcomes has led to the development of new approaches that address individual psychological problems, the criticism being that existing programs have a “one-size-fits-all” approach to treatment. Dual diagnosis, attachment theory causes, and the dynamics of each couple are some of the specific male problems discussed. The increasing involvement of psychotherapists in treating batterers is driving these questions and new research. Gondolf includes a review of the research evidence for and contributions of neuroscience, gendered cognitive behavioral approaches, and the Duluth program. As for batterer programs in general, he notes that there is little evidence to support one over another and scant evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioral approaches do not work or that new psychological approaches are significantly better.</p>
<p>The new psychology is concerned with improving the ability to identify batterers, accurately assessing their likelihood for violence, and improving treatment placement. Gondolf discusses unanswered questions about the accuracy of batterer typologies. Programs struggle to train and administer complex assessments and then to modify and differentiate programs to address what the assessments reveal. This section includes a review of recent research, developments, and evaluations in batterer programs related to assessing and managing the stages of change of batterers in treatment; program retention through the use of motivational interviewing; and the use of couples counseling, especially given the potential for increased violence as a result. Experiments with racially/culturally focused batterer groups show promise and should be implemented more widely.</p>
<p>Section 3, “The System Matters” (Chapters 5 and 6) turns to batterer risk assessment; program operations; and collaboration and coordination among treatment providers, the courts, law enforcement officials, and others. Finally, the reader is reminded of the systemic approach required to best ensure the safety of those who are battered.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most perplexing problem testing the effectiveness of batterer interventions is the subset of men who drop out of or never attend treatment—the same men who persist in their battering. This section reviews the development of risk assessments to identify the likelihood of future battering and the weaknesses and benefits of these instruments as well as the challenges of implementation. Finally, Chapter 6 describes a systems view for understanding and addressing battering that leads to a coordinated community response. Batterer programs have developed tools to monitor the effectiveness of their service delivery and assess systems coordination.</p>
<p>While providing an objective review of the batterer literature, this book paints an optimistic and hopeful picture of the future of batterer programs. The author notes that evaluations are steadily contributing to program improvements but researchers must listen more carefully to what is important to practitioners. New strategies borrowed from other treatment domains hold promise for improving future outcomes. The biggest challenge is engaging resistant men and keeping them in treatment.</p>
<p>The book is a good summation of what the relevant literature has found, of unanswered questions that must be addressed, and directions for the future. It explains in easy-to-understand language the major issues and challenges facing the field of batterer intervention. As such, it is a good reference for practitioners and managers in domestic violence programs as well as political officials searching for better ways to enhance protections for women. The text is well cited while not getting bogged down in the details of research.</p>
