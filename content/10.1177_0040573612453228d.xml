<p><italic>Is God Still at the Bedside? The Medical, Ethical, and Pastoral Issues of Death and Dying</italic></p>
<p>Abigail Rian Evans</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011. 484 pp. $29.99</p>
<p>This book’s author is the Charlotte W. Newcombe Professor Emerita of Practical Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and scholar-in-residence at the Center for Clinical Bioethics, Georgetown University Medical Center. As an experienced scholar and teacher, she undertakes the ambitious goal of surveying the “medical, ethical, theological, pastoral, and legal landscape that relates to end-of-life issues” in a manner that is accessible to a “diverse readership” (xi). The goal is accomplished.</p>
<p>Part I examines a variety of perspectives on the moral value of human life and corresponding attitudes toward death. Part II focuses on a range of contentious ethical issues such as euthanasia, assisted suicide, and organ donation in addition to an in-depth analysis of pertinent legal questions and cases. In Part III, Evans explores the experience of dying, particularly the ubiquity of pain and suffering, the need for good hospice care, and the importance of grieving following the loss of friends and loved ones. Part IV consists of practical advice for clergy, health-care professionals, and congregations in caring for the dying and their families. Fittingly, the concluding chapter is on how funerals should reflect Christian faith and practice. The numerous appendices and bibliography offer a small treasure trove of useful resources.</p>
<p>Given the ambitious scope of this book, it could easily fall into the traps of dilettantism or a hurried and wooden overview. Evans, however, avoids both of these snares. In crafting her critical and constructive arguments, she engages the leading writers on the topic at hand. The resulting analyses are concise, but highly informed. Moreover, although Evans makes no attempt to hide her own preferences and convictions in many instances, neither does she allow them to degenerate into self-indulgent diatribes. Consequently, the reader is usually not told what to think, but invited to pursue further deliberation.</p>
<p>The book is also written in a style that assumes an intelligent, but not expert, readership. A number of highly complex topics, for instance, are explained in an accessible manner, while avoiding simplistic reduction. In addition, although the book covers a lot of ground, it does not do so in a hurried or rushed manner. Rather, the author pauses at the most important landmarks of the extensive landscape she is surveying long enough to inform the reader of their significance, but not in an exhausting way. Furthermore, Evans draws upon a variety of disciplines in a manner that honors their respective purposes while also transgressing their customary borders. She skillfully weaves together seemingly disparate concepts into a narrative that is both knowledgeable and engaging. In short, Evans demonstrates how a moral or practical theologian should draw upon various disciplines in pursuing the work of moral or practical theology.</p>
<p><italic>Is God Still at the Bedside?</italic> could be used as a text in seminary courses on ethics or pastoral theology. It would also make a valuable contribution to the library of a student, minister, or health-care professional.</p>
