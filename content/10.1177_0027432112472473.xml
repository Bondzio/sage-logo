<p>Advocacy is a process by which individuals or groups attempt to influence decisions about such things as resource allocation and public policy. In the music education profession, this frequently manifests itself through teachers, students, parents, and community members talking with legislators, school board members, and other policymakers about the importance of music as a core subject in school curricula. Advocacy has become an important and necessary part of what music educators must understand and be able to do.</p>
<p>In the December 2012 <italic>Music Educators Journal</italic>, I wrote about the recent development of a new core message that we as a national association are asking you as individuals and state MEAs to implement <bold>Music Education • Orchestrating Success.</bold> As we continue to stand united in fighting budget cuts and other threats to music and arts in our schools, it is useful to expand on some of our four key message points about music education and our organization:</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112472473" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Demonstrable Positive Impact on Learning;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Benefits Go Beyond School;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students/Administrators/Parents/Others Won’t Take It Seriously if We Don’t; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>NAfME/MEAs/Societies/Councils Work Together for Music Education.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Several proof points (evidence to back up your claims) and an almost infinite number of stories and specific illustrations are available to support these key message points. Using the first idea, for example, it’s easy to talk about the various ways that music affects student learning. The study of music elevates and energizes students, enables better education, makes schools better places for learning, and helps keep the whole student engaged in the learning process. Once the advocate has articulated these or similar proof points, it is possible to really “seal the deal” with a personal story about a student whose life was changed in a positive way through his or her participation in a music program.</p>
<p>Michael Sheehan, the communications expert who helped NAfME leaders and staff members develop our message, shared numerous video examples of effective and ineffective attempts at messaging, some of which were rather humorous and entertaining. The technique that resonates most with me is represented by the acronym <bold>ATM</bold>: when responding to a statement or question, it is important to <bold>Answer</bold> or address the question first, then make a <bold>Transition</bold> to the most appropriate key <bold>Message</bold> point, finally expanding on the idea using proof points and personal stories.</p>
<p>To illustrate how the ATM model might work, imagine attending a local school board meeting to discuss proposed budget cuts, some of which will significantly affect the music program. You have already had the opportunity to talk about music’s demonstrable impact on student learning and about the importance of music as a core subject in the school curriculum, using such proof points as the need for full-time licensed teachers to provide a standards-based, sequential curriculum at all levels of instruction. A board member mentions that he or she likes music and thinks it is a great activity for students, but that it seems frivolous compared with language arts, math, and science. As an astute advocate, you might respond by acknowledging the importance of the other subjects mentioned before making a transition to the ways in which the benefits of music go beyond school, especially in preparing students for lifelong achievement. The study of music teaches cooperation, discipline, teamwork, creativity, and innovation, all skills that will help ensure success in the 21st-century workplace. As such, it helps to create better employees and better global citizens. In other words, <bold><italic>music education orchestrates success.</italic></bold></p>
<p>Music educators and advocates can use the tools provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nafme.org">www.nafme.org</ext-link> (click on “For Advocates” on the top banner) to amass a wide variety of advocacy data, ideas, and anecdotes in support of music education at all levels. We can share our belief in the value of music study to every student via content that is consistent and repeatable without being redundant. I like to think of this as <bold><italic>One Message—Many Voices</italic></bold>. With a little practice (as we expect of our students!), we can become promoters of the idea that music education promotes success.</p>
<p>Your voice is critical—use it to make a difference in your school, your community, and your nation. And thank you for all you do every day.</p>
