<abstract>
<p>The authors of this current study compared the memory performance of adolescent students with specific reading disabilities (RD) with that of typical adolescent readers on a newly developed verbal learning test, the <italic>Bergen-Tucson Verbal Learning Test</italic> (BTVLT). This multiple trial test was designed to measure memory acquisition, retention, retrieval, and forgetting rates, as well as the ability to organize and retrieve the information from memory according to the phonological (surface) and semantic (lexical) features of words. A total of 20 participants with RD and 20 control participants (mean age = 15.2 years) were matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Results indicated that the RD group learned significantly fewer list items and did so at a slower rate than the control group. Although the participants with RD were equally able to retain information once learned, they did demonstrate inefficient elaborative rehearsal strategies. They also recalled fewer words in both the semantic and phonetic cued-recall conditions, but the effect size was significantly greater in the latter. Taken together, the data suggest that students with RD have less efficient rehearsal and encoding mechanisms but typical retention. Retrieval also appears typical except under conditions that require information to be recalled based on phonetic codes.</p>

<p>The main academic challenges children with reading disabilities (RD) face are accurate word recognition and decoding, reading fluency, and spelling. They have also been shown to have significant memory difficulties, performing more poorly than typically achieving peers on tasks that require the memorization and retrieval of letters, words, digits, and sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948712436815">O’Shaughnessy &amp; Swanson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948712436815">Swanson, Cooney, &amp; McNamara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948712436815">Swanson, Kehler, &amp; Jerman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948712436815">Swanson, Zheng, &amp; Jerman, 2009</xref>). Although there is evidence that orthographic problems are characteristic of some students with RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948712436815">Bell &amp; Worthington, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948712436815">Mather, 1999</xref>), poor performance on memory tasks is more evident when the stimulus is auditory rather than visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948712436815">Kibby, Marks, Morgan, &amp; Long, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although children with RD perform more poorly than typically achieving peers on memory and verbal learning tests, the specific mechanisms underlying these impairments are not fully understood. One area of debate is whether verbal memory impairments are the result of problems related to the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of information. Several studies have provided evidence that verbal memory impairments in populations with RD are due to difficulties in retrieving information once it has been stored. Using a selective reminding paradigm in a study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712436815">Fletcher (1985)</xref> reported that students with combined reading and spelling deficits were able to acquire and store information to a typical degree but failed to retrieve the information relative to the control group. Other studies using a cued-recall paradigm have also reported typical acquisition of new information but deficits at the retrieval phase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948712436815">Swanson, Reffel, and Trahan (1991)</xref> used naturalistic and everyday memory tasks to assess the acquisition and retrieval of new information in younger and older children with RD. The performance of the children with RD on all measures was significantly lower than those without RD at both age levels. However, both RD age groups were able to improve memory recall performance to almost a typical degree under conditions that were designed to facilitate item accessibility. The authors concluded that because retrieval improved with cues, the poor memory performance was the result of difficulties accessing information, not of initial encoding of information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712436815">McNamara and Wong (2003)</xref>, who used similar memory tasks, replicated these results. Although free-recall performance of the RD group fell well below that of the control group, group differences disappeared in the cued-recall conditions.</p>
<p>Although there is support for the hypothesis that memory problems in children with RD occur at the retrieval phase, other studies have suggested that verbal memory difficulties are the result of poor acquisition and storage of new information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948712436815">Nelson and Warrington (1980)</xref> reported that children with RD had significantly poorer performance than the typical readers on recognition tasks used to measure long-term, short-term, and semantic memory processes. Because recognition paradigms are believed to aid memory retrieval, deficits on the recognition tasks were thought to be evidence of an encoding problem rather than retrieval problems. In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948712436815">Kramer, Knee, and Delis (2000)</xref> used the <italic>California Verbal Learning Test–Children’s Version</italic> (CVLT-C) to examine verbal learning in typical readers and children with dyslexia. Their results indicated that the children with dyslexia had impairments in their ability to learn new information but were able to retrieve information to a typical degree and retain it over time.</p>
<p>The reasons for poor acquisition have been explained by some research as a lack of efficient encoding strategies, most notably active rehearsal, which is believed to aid in acquiring and retaining new information in memory. Earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948712436815">Tarver, Hallahan, Kauffman, and Ball (1976)</xref> examined the serial position curves of students with and without RD. Whereas the results for the control group revealed the common primacy–recency effect, the students with RD demonstrated a recency effect only, indicating that they were less likely to use rehearsal strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948712436815">Bauer (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436815">Cermak (1983)</xref> also reported similar findings. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948712436815">Kramer et al. (2000)</xref> used the CVLT-C to examine serial position effects for children with dyslexia and a control group. The control group recalled significantly more words from the middle portion of the list, indicating a higher rate of active rehearsal than the children with dyslexia.</p>
<p>In addition to encoding, storage, and retrieval problems in children with RD, researchers have posited that memory impairments may be due to an inability to access verbal codes, such as the semantic (a word read as a word with a similar meaning, that is, stimulus word = <italic>leather</italic>, response = <italic>velvet</italic>) and phonetic (inability to read nonwords; that is, <italic>dower</italic> or <italic>bower</italic>) features of words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712436815">Shankweiler &amp; Crain, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948712436815">Vellutino &amp; Scanlon, 1987</xref>). Because studies have shown that reading requires the use of semantic and phonologic processes for word identification, memory deficits in these areas may lead to impaired reading performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948712436815">Stringer &amp; Stanovich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948712436815">Vellutino, Scanlon, &amp; Spearing, 1995</xref>). However, the interaction between semantic and phonetic processes is unclear, although some have argued that there are separate phonological and lexical/semantic memory stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948712436815">Martin, Shelton, &amp; Yaffee, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, a large body of research has shown poor performance by students with RD on tasks that involve phonological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948712436815">Catts, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948712436815">Fletcher et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948712436815">Stanovich &amp; Siegel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948712436815">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>). Such difficulties related to generating and accessing phonological representations are believed to disrupt the ability to retrieve verbal information from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948712436815">Swanson et al., 2009</xref>). This can be explained by considering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948712436815">Baddeley’s (1986)</xref> working memory model. In this model, the phonological loop is responsible for maintaining verbal information and consists of two parts: (a) the phonological store, which is responsible for holding verbally coded information in immediate awareness, and (b) the articulatory control, which helps to maintain verbal information by means of rehearsal. The functioning of the phonological loop in children with RD has been shown to be impaired, perhaps due to inefficient elaborative rehearsal, especially for verbal memory span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948712436815">Baddeley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948712436815">Snowling, 1991</xref>) and word storage based on sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436815">Berninger et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Several early studies indicated that students with RD have difficulty accessing phonological codes in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712436815">Byrne &amp; Shea, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948712436815">Shankweiler, Liberman, Mark, Fowler, &amp; Fischer, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712436815">Siegel &amp; Linder, 1985</xref>). Many of these studies investigated the extent to which good and poor readers were able to recall similar and dissimilar sounding words. More recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948712436815">Desroches, Joanisse, &amp; Robertson, 2006</xref>) also demonstrated poor performance on memory rhyme tasks in children with RD, indicating that they are unable to access phonological codes. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948712436815">Waterman and Lewandowski (1993)</xref> reported that whereas phonological coding impairments are certainly characteristic of younger poor readers, older poor readers have the ability to use a phonological code but use it inefficiently.</p>
<p>In addition to the coding of information in memory by sound, there is coding by meaning. <italic>Semantic coding</italic> has been defined as “the use of word meanings, and semantic attributes in general, to facilitate storage and retrieval of spoken and printed words from lexical memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948712436815">Vellutino et al., 1995</xref>, p. 77). However, the research findings exploring semantic memory coding in the RD population have been mixed. Although some studies have shown significant differences between children with RD and typical controls on memory tasks requiring the recall of semantically related/unrelated words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948712436815">Dallago &amp; Moely, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436815">Jorm, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948712436815">Waller, 1976</xref>), other studies have shown that children with RD can recall at the same level as control participants under certain circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948712436815">Ceci, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436815">Cermak, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948712436815">Lee &amp; Obrzut, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948712436815">Swanson, 1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948712436815">1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948712436815">Vellutino &amp; Scanlon, 1985</xref>). There is also evidence that semantic memory impairments are not inherently a characteristic of children with RD but rather are the result of prolonged reading difficulties that become more pronounced with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948712436815">Vellutino et al., 1995</xref>). For example, based on results from the <italic>Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test</italic> (FCAT), Schatschneider et al. reported that whereas text fluency accounted for substantially more variance than text reasoning and verbal knowledge with 3rd graders, students in the upper grades (7th and 10th) not only had to demonstrate strong reading fluency ability but also had to be proficient in text knowledge and verbal reasoning skills because the text becomes more complicated.</p>
<p>Based on the research reviewed, children who have RD have significant memory impairments for verbal information, but the reasons for this are not well understood. One possibility is that verbal memory impairments are the result of problems in the acquisition, retention, or retrieval of information from memory. Whereas some studies have demonstrated retrieval deficits in these students, other studies have provided evidence for acquisition and storage problems. Alternatively, memory problems may be the result of the inability to use memory organizational skills with regard to specific linguistic components of verbal information, such as phonetic and semantic features. Although there is ample evidence of phonological-based memory problems in students with RD, the results are mixed in regard to their ability to use semantic features to facilitate memory recall. In addition, much of the memory research with these students has used preadolescents, with few studies examining adolescent populations.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine the learning and memory performance of adolescents with and without RD on a newly developed verbal learning task, the <italic>Bergen-Tucson Verbal Learning Tests–English Version</italic> (BTVLT). The test is modeled after the CVLT and developed for future use in cross-cultural assessment of learning and memory performance. Several aspects of learning and memory are measured, including the (a) acquisition, retention, and retrieval of information and (b) ability to organize and retrieve the information from memory according to phonological (surface) and semantic (lexical) features. Studying an adolescent sample is important for providing data on the possible role that development, experience, and/or compensatory strategies may play in verbal learning and memory functions in a postlatency age group.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In all, 40 adolescent students, 20 with RD and 20 without RD (nonreading disordered [NRD]), participated in the study. The students were selected from a school district in Arizona and ranged in age from 13 to 16 years. The groups were matched on age, gender, ethnicity, and overall IQ. Each group consisted of 13 boys and 7 girls, and 17 Caucasian and 3 Hispanic students.</p>
<p>Several individual characteristics served as exclusionary criteria for participation in the study. First, because many schools in this district serve students of diverse cultural, ethnic, and language backgrounds, care was taken to include only students whose first language was English. Thus, students with a history of second language acquisition or bilingual services were excluded from study participation. Second, due to the verbal and attention demands of the test procedures, students who had documented speech and language disorders or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) were also excluded from participation, as well as those students who had physical disabilities, sensory/motor impairments, or emotional/psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>The students with RD had been previously identified as having learning disabilities (LD) by the homeschool district and were currently receiving special education services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). For this group, the <italic>Weschler Intelligence for Children–III</italic> (WISC-III) was used as a standardized measure of intelligence. Determination of special education eligibility for the students was based on a discrepancy model using a regression formula as opposed to using the response-to-intervention (RTI) model, which is currently being debated as a means for defining poor readers. The examiner also noted that the members of the RD group were confident and motivated in their test-taking behavior.</p>
<p>Because of serious limitations with using the IQ–achievement discrepancy model in the identification of LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948712436815">Fletcher, Coulter, Reschly, &amp; Vaughn, 2004</xref>), a skill deficit criterion was also used in the selection of students with RD to validate deficiencies in sight word identification and phonological processing. The criterion for inclusion was a standard score of 80 or lower on both the Letter-Word Identification and Word Attack subtests of the <italic>Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement–Third Edition</italic> (WJ III ACH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948712436815">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Students in the NRD group were found by asking general education English teachers to identify average achieving students who did not evidence academic or behavioral problems. Because standardized IQ scores were not readily available for the students in this group, the <italic>Reynolds Intellectual Screening Test</italic> (RIST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948712436815">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2003</xref>) was administered to each student. Students with RIST Composite standard scores in the average range (standard scores of 90–110) were included in this group. In addition, each student in the NRD group was administered both the <italic>Letter-Word Identification</italic> and <italic>Word Attack</italic> subtests of the WJ III ACH. Students whose standard scores were in the average range (90–110) were included in the study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948712436815">Table 1</xref> presents the mean age, Full Scale IQ and WJ III ACH <italic>Letter-Word Identification</italic> and <italic>Word Attack</italic> subtest scores.</p>

<title>Materials and Procedures</title>
<p>The BTVLT−English version, modeled after the CVLT, is a multiple trial test designed to measure memory acquisition, retention, retrieval, forgetting rates, and the ability to organize and retrieve information from memory according to the phonological (surface) and semantic (lexical) features of words. The test was originally designed for cross-cultural purposes allowing for performance comparisons between English- and Norwegian-speaking individuals. Thus, the words on the BTVLT retain the exact meaning in English and Norwegian languages. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0731948712436815">Appendix A</xref> presents the target word list (List A) and a distractor word list (List B) by trial used in the study.</p>
<p>This test consists of three separate word lists. The first word list, the target list (List A), comprises 16 words that are balanced with regard to both initial consonant sound and semantic content, thus allowing for either phonological or semantic clustering of items. The 16 items can be clustered into four semantic categories: body parts, utensils/tools, animals, and food. Phonetically, items can be clustered into four categories based on initial consonant sounds: c/k, f, s, and h. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0731948712436815">Appendix B</xref> presents the target list word items by semantic and phonetic groupings.</p>
<p>The second word list is a distractor or foil list (see List B, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0731948712436815">Appendix A</xref>) that consists of 16 new items that are related either semantically or phonetically (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0731948712436815">Appendix C</xref>) to items on the target list. Students were exposed to this list for one trial only.</p>
<p>The final list on the BTVLT consists of all of the words on the target list and the foil list, plus new words. This list is presented in a recognition format in which participants are asked to say “Yes” if the word was on the target list or “No” if it was not. Individual word items from the foil list and the recognition list are presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0731948712436815">Appendix D</xref>.</p>
<p>The BTVLT begins with a learning trial of the 16 words of List A read aloud by the examiner at the rate of 1 s per word. After each list presentation, the participant is asked to free recall as many words as possible. This procedure is repeated over five trials (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0731948712436815">Appendix A</xref>). Following this, the distractor list (List B) is presented once (Trial B), followed by a brief free-recall trial in which the participants are asked to remember words from the original list (Trial A6). This is followed by a cued-recall condition in which participants are asked to recall the words by a given category (e.g., animals) and by an initial consonant sounds (e.g., c/k; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0731948712436815">Appendix C</xref>). After a 30-min interval, long-delay free recall (List A, Trial A1, cued recall, and recognition) is assessed. The recognition condition is a yes–no paradigm in which target words are mixed with distractor words, as displayed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0731948712436815">Appendix D</xref>.</p>

<title>Technical Adequacy of the BTVLT</title>
<p>The BTVLT is a newly developed instrument designed to measure various aspects of learning and memory. As yet, no studies have explored the technical properties of the instrument. Although the BTVLT is not a standardized instrument, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated as a measure of internal consistency of the BTVLT, along with Pearson product–moment correlations between the learning trials. Validity was established by correlating the BTVLT scores with the control variables of age, IQ, letter-word identification, and word attack skills because no alternative or established memory test was administered.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948712436815">Figure 1</xref> presents the mean number of words recalled by group on Trials 1 through 7 of the BTVLT. The mean correlation between the recalled lists of items was .59 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). When learning Trials 1 through 5 were entered as items, Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale was found to be .87, which suggests good internal consistency of the measure. The alpha value would have been .90 if not for the lower score on Trial 1. However, this is a reflection of how Cronbach’s alpha works in relation to a list learning procedure. On average, the learning trials correlated approximately .80 with the sum of all trials (total learning score), with the lowest correlations for the first two trials (<italic>r</italic> = .43 and .68, respectively) and the highest correlations for the last three trials (<italic>r</italic> = .81, .79, and .83, respectively).</p>

<p>Pearson product–moment correlations between the trials yielded an overall significant interitem correlation of .59 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948712436815">Table 2</xref>).

<p>In terms of validity, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948712436815">Table 3</xref> shows the correlations of the scores on the BTVLT with the control variables of age, IQ, letter-word identification, and word attack skills. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948712436815">Table 3</xref>, there was an increasing influence of verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) on memory performance over trials (increasing to approximately 30% of the shared variance). As well, the influence of IQ was very strong on phonetic cued recall (50% shared variance) but weaker for semantic cued recall (12% shared variance). Both letter-word identification and word attack skills showed a similar pattern but with a slightly stronger effect on the semantic cued-recall measures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are significant differences in the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of information between adolescents with RD and those without RD. Also of interest was examining whether there are differences between the groups in their ability to use the semantic and phonetic features of words to facilitate recall. Because most research on memory problems in students with RDs has been done on Preadolescent-age students, these results may enhance our understanding regarding what role development, experience, and/or compensatory strategies play in memory performance for adolescent students.</p>
<sec id="section6-0731948712436815">
<title>Recall Acquisition</title>
<p>The total number of words recalled and the rate of acquisition over the initial five trials of the BTVLT were analyzed with a repeated-measures ANOVA with Trial (Trials 1–5) as the within-participants variable and Group (RD vs. NRD) as the between-groups variable.</p>
<p>Based on using an a priori alpha level of .05, the main effects for Group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 14.33, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .275, and Trial, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 16.25, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, η<sup>2</sup> = .808, were significant. The Group × Trial interaction was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 3.53, <italic>p</italic> =.017, η<sup>2</sup> = .085. These results indicate a difference between the groups, with the RD group recalling significantly fewer words than the NRD group across trials. Univariate analysis of individual trials indicated no significant difference between the groups on Trial 1, <italic>t</italic>(39) = 2.01, <italic>p</italic> = .051. However, the NRD group recalled significantly more words on Trial 2, <italic>t</italic>(39) = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> = .023; Trial 3, <italic>t</italic>(38) = 3.34, <italic>p</italic> = .002; Trial 4, <italic>t</italic>(38) = 2.75, <italic>p</italic> = .009; and Trial 5, <italic>t</italic>(38) = 4.25, <italic>p</italic> = .0001. These results show that the students with RD learned fewer words and did so at a slower rate than did the NRD students. In addition, the disparity between the groups became more apparent with each learning trial.</p>

<p>The proportion of words recalled by region was analyzed with a repeated-measures ANOVA with Region (primacy vs. middle vs. recency) as the within-groups variable and Group (RD vs. NRD) as the between-groups variable. The main effect for Group was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = .895, <italic>p</italic> = .350, η<sup>2</sup> = .023, but the main effect for Region was, <italic>F</italic>(2, 38) = 10.52, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, η<sup>2</sup> = .429. The Group × Region interaction was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 10.52, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, η<sup>2</sup> = .217. Post hoc univariate analyses indicated that although the students with RD recalled more words from the primacy, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 5.32, <italic>p</italic> = .027, η<sup>2</sup> = .123, and recency regions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 5.57, <italic>p</italic> = .024, η<sup>2</sup> = .128, the NRD group recalled significantly more words from the middle region, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 19.17, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .335. Because words in the middle region are assumed to require more elaborative rehearsal to be encoded into memory, the RD group’s lower recall rates from this region indicate that the group with RD was less efficient or used such strategies to a lesser degree than the NRD group.</p>

<p>The first analysis was a repeated-measures ANOVA to determine if there was a difference between the number of words recalled on Trial 5 (the last learning trial) from that on Trial 6 (the brief delay). The main effects for Trial, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 30.04, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, and Group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 6.785, <italic>p</italic> = .013, were significant indicating that the NRD group recalled more words on Trial 5 than did the RD group. The Group × Trial interaction was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 12.94, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and appears to be accounted for by the NRD group’s recall rate being significantly lower from Trial 5 to Trial 6, whereas the RD group’s recall did not change as much. Thus, although the NRD group recalled significantly more words on Trial 5 than did the RD group, there was no significant difference between the groups on the number of words recalled on the brief-delay Trial 6, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 0.564, <italic>p</italic> = .457. These results indicate that the RD group was able to retain the information over a brief delay.</p>
<p>The second analysis was a repeated-measures ANOVA to determine if there was a difference between the mean number of words recalled on Trial 5 (last learning trial) and Trial 7 (long 30-min delay). Main effects for Trial, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 11.83, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and Group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 7.75, <italic>p</italic> = .008, were significant. The Group × Trial interaction was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 13.11, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and again appears to be accounted for by the NRD group’s recall rate being significantly lower from Trial 5 to Trial 7, whereas the RD group’s recall did not change as much. A univariate analysis of Trial 7 showed that there was no significant difference between the groups on the number of words recalled on the long-delay trial, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 0.906, <italic>p</italic> = .347. Because the RD group did not demonstrate a significant difference in the number of words recalled from Trial 5 to Trial 7, this may suggest that they were able to retain the information over a 30-min delay.</p>
<p>The third analysis was a repeated-measures ANOVA to determine if the two groups differed on the mean number of words recalled on Trial 6 (brief delay) and Trial 7 (long delay). The main effect for Trial, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 5.786, <italic>p</italic> = .021, was significant, but not for Group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.840, <italic>p</italic> = .356. The Group × Trial interaction was also not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.034, <italic>p</italic> = .854. These results indicate that both groups were equally able to retain what they had originally learned.</p>

<p>Although the NRD group recognized more target words than did the RD group, it failed to reach statistical significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.925, <italic>p</italic> = .342. Although the mean number of false positives was higher for the RD group than the NRD group, this difference also failed to reach statistical significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 1.63, <italic>p</italic> = .110. These results indicate that the RD group was as equally able as the NRD group to retrieve words from memory and that the RD group was not impaired by interference effects.

<title>Recall by Semantic and Phonetic Features of Words</title>
<p>The ability to use the semantic and phonetic features of words to facilitate recall was assessed by a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA computed to compare the total number of words recalled from the semantic and phonetic cued-recall conditions by group. Results of this analysis yielded a nonsignificant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,38) = 0.673, <italic>p</italic> = .417. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731948712436815">Figure 2</xref> shows the mean number of cued words recalled in the semantic and phonetic conditions (Trials) for both the brief- and long-delay recall by group.</p>

<p>Thus, a repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with Trial (semantic and phonetic) as the within-participants variable and Group (RD vs. NRD) the between-groups variable. The main effect for Trial approached, but did not reach, significance, <italic>F</italic>(1,38) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> = .064, η<sup>2</sup> = .087. The main effect for Group, <italic>F</italic>(1,38) = 34.92, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, η<sup>2</sup> = .479, and the Group × Trial interaction were significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 9.88, <italic>p</italic> = .003, η<sup>2</sup> = .206. Post hoc analysis of total number of semantic words, <italic>F</italic>(1,39) = 5.84, <italic>p</italic> = .021, η<sup>2</sup> = .133, and the total number of phonetic words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 42.81, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, η<sup>2</sup> = .530, were significant. These results indicate that the students with RD were at a clear disadvantage when attempting to recall words based on phonetic features.</p>
<p>Next, two repeated-measures ANOVAs were then computed to contrast cued recall for semantic and phonetic trials in both the brief and delayed conditions. In the analysis of the brief-delayed condition, Cue (semantic vs. phonetic) was the within-participants variable and Group (RD vs. NRD) was the between-participants variable. The main effects for Trial failed to reach significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 2.13, <italic>p</italic> = .147, η<sup>2</sup> = .054, but the main effects for Group was found to be significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 23.26, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .380. The Group × Trial interaction was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 5.51, <italic>p</italic> = .024, η<sup>2</sup> = .127. These results indicate that the RD group recalled significantly fewer words than did the NRD group by semantic and phonetic cues and that this difference was greater in the phonetic condition. In the analysis of the 30-min-delayed condition, the main effects for Trial approached, but did not reach, significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 3.29, <italic>p</italic> = .078, η<sup>2</sup> = .080, whereas the main effects for Group did, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 32.90, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .464. The Group × Trial interaction was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 13.16, <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .257. These results show that the RD group recalled fewer semantic and phonetic words when cued in the long-delay condition than did the NRD group, and this difference was greater in the phonetic condition.</p>
<p>Separate repeated-measures ANOVAs of the semantic brief- and 30-min-delay conditions did not result in a significant Group × Trial interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.040, <italic>p</italic> = .843, η<sup>2</sup> = .001, nor did the phonetic brief- and 30-min-delay interaction yield significant differences, <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 1.02, <italic>p</italic> = .318, η<sup>2</sup> = .026. These results indicate that although the NRD group recalled significantly more words by semantic and phonetic cues in both the brief- and 30-min-delay conditions, there was no significant difference within each group on the number of words recalled in either of these conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results of the current study indicate that when compared with typical readers matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and IQ, adolescents with RD have significant verbal learning impairments. Their performance on the BTVLT in this study indicates that they were deficient in the ability to learn new information as demonstrated by lower levels of free recall across multiple learning trials. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have suggested the locus of memory problems in RD populations to be at the acquisition or initial learning stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948712436815">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948712436815">Swanson, Ashbaker, &amp; Lee, 1996</xref>). In addition, the results show that as the learning trials progressed, the students with RD fell further behind. This result, also consistent with previous studies, indicates that students with RD become more disadvantaged as learning progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948712436815">Brainerd &amp; Reyna, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of serial positions demonstrated that the adolescents with RD recalled significantly fewer words from the middle region of the word list, a finding that is consistent with the inefficient elaborative rehearsal hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948712436815">Bauer, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948712436815">Wong, 1982</xref>). Because words in the middle region compete with preceding and succeeding items, they are the least likely to be rehearsed. The control group’s superior recall of middle region words indicates that they used more efficient rehearsal and encoding mechanisms than did the adolescent’s with RD.</p>
<p>It can be argued that poor recall performance may be the result of either an inability to maintain the information in memory or a problem with retrieving when the task demands it. The results of this study, however, do not support either view. Because there was no significant difference between the groups on the brief- and 30-min-delayed free-recall trials, it can be argued that the students with RD were equally able to retain and retrieve the information that they had originally learned. These findings seem to differentiate results based on latency-age participants used in previous studies from the adolescent age group used in this study.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the role of specific mechanisms in memory functioning of students with RD, another objective of this study was to investigate the ability of these students to use semantic and phonetic features of words to facilitate recall of word list items on the BTVLT. Findings from this study are consistent with those from previous research demonstrating significant deficits in the ability to use phonetic features of words to facilitate recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712436815">Siegel &amp; Linder, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948712436815">Waterman &amp; Lewandowski, 1993</xref>). The adolescents with RD recalled significantly fewer words when given phonetic cues than when given semantic cues. Historically, cued-recall paradigms are believed to improve recall if information has already been encoded into memory. As demonstrated on the first five learning trials, the students with RD had a more difficult time learning list items, presumably because of inefficient rehearsal strategies. However, once learned, the group was able to retain and retrieve the words to a normal degree in the delayed free-recall conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948712436815">Figure 1</xref>). In the cued-recall conditions, however, the adolescents with RD showed significant impairment in the ability to recall words from memory based on phonetic features. However, their performance in the brief and delayed cued-recall conditions did not differ, indicating that they were able to retain and retrieve the information, although to a lesser degree than the control group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731948712436815">Figure 2</xref>). Based on current theories of working memory, it can be hypothesized that the impairment in the adolescents with RD in this study was related to the phonological loop. Because the students with RD were less efficient at elaborative rehearsal, it is possible that their poor performance in the phonetic cued recall was partially the result of impaired articulatory control. Also, poor performance in the cued-recall condition indicates that they had difficulty with aspects of the phonological loop that are related to the coding of speech sounds. This is consistent with their low scores on the measures of phonological awareness and structural analysis, indicating phonological-based problems.</p>
<p>Much of the research on phonological and memory problems in students with RD has used elementary-age or younger schoolchildren. The current study adds to the existing literature by exploring these processes in adolescent students. In a previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712436815">Siegel and Linder (1985)</xref> concluded that difficulty accessing phonological codes are more characteristic of younger readers, but as they reach adolescence, they can use a phonetic-based coding system, although less efficiently than typical readers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948712436815">Waterman and Lewandowski (1993)</xref> reported similar results, demonstrating that older poor readers used a phonological code to facilitate recall but did so inefficiently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948712436815">Vellutino et al. (1995)</xref> argued that phonological coding errors are a probable cause of reading difficulties, but as children with RD age they are able to take advantage, to some degree, of phonological cues. Semantic coding errors, however, become more apparent as children get older, most likely the result of prolonged reading difficulties. In the current study, the adolescents with RD were better able to use semantic codes to recall information than they were phonetic codes. The current results indicate that adolescents, at least the ones in this sample, were impaired when it came to accessing phonological codes, as evidenced by the effect size regarding phonetic use.</p>
<sec id="section12-0731948712436815">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Several limitations of this study need to be noted. First, the sample size was small. Many studies of learning and memory processes in LD populations have frequently used larger sample sizes than the present study. It is commonly assumed that the statistical power of a test increases with sample size. Thus, this study might be viewed as less powerful than studies with more abundant sample sizes. However, it has also been argued that increased observations, or data points, also increase power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948712436815">Keppel, 1991</xref>). Although only 40 students participated in the study (20 in each group), the multiple trial learning task allowed for multiple observations, or data points, thereby increasing the power of the study. In addition, larger samples would increase the probability for yielding significance to smaller effects that may be of theoretical but not of clinical significance. Although the results of the present study are derived from a smaller sample, they are based on larger and systematic between-group differences.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the students who participated in the study were selected from a middle-class, suburban school district, making generalization of the results difficult. Future research with the BTVLT should use a more diverse sample from various ethnic and socioeconomic areas to confirm the results found in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0731948712436815">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that not all components of verbal learning are impaired in students with RD. For example, although they have difficulty acquiring new information, they are able to retain and retrieve what they have already learned. They can use semantic features of words to facilitate recall to some degree but cannot do so with phonetic features. It must also be noted that the students with RD who participated in this study were selected based on a specific skills deficit profile, that is, poor word identification and nonsense word decoding skills. Other researchers have demonstrated that although dyslexic readers have impaired memory functions, they do not all exhibit the same types of learning patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948712436815">Howes, Bigler, Lawson, &amp; Burlingame, 1999</xref>). With these considerations in mind, future research should examine how patterns of verbal learning and memory vary across different subtypes of RD, as well as other types of LD and neurological conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0731948712436815">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Interventions for use with students with LD currently exist in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948712436815">Wanzek &amp; Vaughn, 2007</xref>). However, the current study yields findings that may contribute to intervention strategies for use with students who experience RD and demonstrate significant phonological processing deficits. Researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712436815">Kappers (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948712436815">1997</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948712436815">Kappers and Hamburger (1994)</xref> suggested that a multimodal learning approach may help students who have impaired verbal learning. However, our finding—that students with RD were able to use semantic clues to recall information—may have greater implications for instruction. Because students with RD are less efficient at rehearsing to-be-learned information, teaching them specific strategies or ways of remembering information would improve their ability to recall the information at a later date. Finally, because students with RD have impaired phonological processes, they can be instructed in orthographic techniques, such as memorizing common words in text, which would emphasize their strengths and reduce the need for decoding.</p>
