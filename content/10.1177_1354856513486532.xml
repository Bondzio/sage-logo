<abstract>
<p>On November 27, 2011, a flash mob took place in the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) train station in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, as a group of mostly young people performed a dance set to a Bollywood song. Soon, videos of the event appeared online sparking lively debates and media coverage. Here, I engage the ‘CST flash mob’ and its use of Bollywood dance to grapple with the democratic potential that lies at the intersection of live performance, popular culture, and new media. Situating the flash mob within Bollywood dance scholarship, I explore the global proliferation and online circulation of Bollywood flash mobs as fandom in performance. I am particularly interested in the implicit political dimensions of these performances and how these play out in local and new media contexts.</p>

<p>The <italic>Flash Mob Mumbai – CST Official Video</italic> on YouTube opens on an everyday scene at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) train station in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. A young woman hurries along. An elderly Muslim man watches people pass by. We see families and children en route to their destination. The clock tells us it is almost 5 p.m. The camera cuts to a young woman as she starts to dance, apparently inviting others to join her. These are the first seconds of the film documenting the CST flash mob that took place on November 27, 2011. Set to a Bollywood song, the flash mob was planned and created by a self-identified ‘citizens' initiative’, a group of young Mumbai residents who wanted to make this event ‘pure and fun’. The news of the flash mob spread quickly, garnering significant, largely enthusiastic coverage in both news and social media. Here, I build on this coverage and examine the CST flash mob as an event that helps us to understand when and how popular culture, specifically Bollywood dance, fandom may support political action through performance in both local and new media spaces.</p>
<sec id="section1-1354856513486532">
<title>About Bollywood dance and flash mobs</title>
<p>Bollywood dance refers to dances set to Hindi film songs. These dances may appear in the films themselves; they may also be live performances inspired by these films. As many scholars (like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856513486532">Mehta and Pandharipande, 2010</xref>) suggest, Indian cinema generally, and Hindi cinema specifically, is a definitive part of India’s popular culture. The term Bollywood – likely coined outside India – is closely tied to the economic, aesthetic, and technological changes the Hindi film industry faced in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856513486532">Rajadhyaksha, 2003</xref>). This decade also witnessed the rise of Bollywood dance as a distinct style. Bollywood dance became a common occurrence at South Asian get-togethers and parties. Dance schools that teach the hippest Bollywood dances soon opened in many cities. Today, Bollywood dance thrives as a popular and largely participatory dance, which invites fans to perform their love for Bollywood films. With an increasingly tight-knit connection between live and filmed Bollywood dances, we can speak about what I have called a ‘symbiotic relationship’ between dances in Hindi films and live Bollywood dance choreography, where Hindi film choreographers simultaneously follow and influence live Bollywood dance trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856513486532">Shresthova, 2011</xref>: 151).</p>
<p>The affordances of new media further reinforce this symbiotic relationship. Not only do dances in Hindi films become even more accessible to Bollywood dance fans, videos of the live performances they stage also circulate online, where they may be watched by other fans and choreographers. These affinities between filmed and live Bollywood dance are crucial to the meanings these dances create. For one, local choreographers do not always simply ‘copy’ movements. Many of them take great pride in appropriating, adjusting, and at times completely changing, existing Bollywood choreography to reflect local aesthetics and contexts. For example, a choreographer may deem a sexually explicit dance too <italic>risqué </italic>for more conservative audiences and may rechoreograph it to be more demure and acceptable. They may also update dances that appear old fashioned by adding more trendy movements. With such changes, dances that had little or no political meaning in the film may become more or less politically explicit when they are performed in other cultural and geographical contexts.</p>
<p>With social media, Bollywood dancers and choreographers (with Internet access) also connect to each other through a burgeoning global network of dancers, critics, and fans. Several bloggers now provide extensive, and debated, reviews on specific song and dance sequences and performances. New dances, performances, and classes spread through social media. Bollywood dance online has also been significant for choreographers in the industry who come into more direct contact with live fan-driven interpretations of their choreography. Recent copyright enforcements notwithstanding new media have clearly supported the growth of Bollywood dance as a performative site of cultural appropriation that bridges between local and online spaces.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago, almost more than 300,000 Bollywood dance-themed videos uploaded to YouTube were either the already discussed song and dance sequences from films (circulated both by film distributors and fans) or videos documenting live performances of Bollywood dance. Then, a new subgenre of this dancer-generated category emerged, namely, live performances of Bollywood dance staged for camera and intended for online circulation. Part of this subgenre, Bollywood flash mobs have now become the newest, and possibly the most civically significant and politically charged, development for Bollywood dance.</p>
<p>Flash mobs are carefully planned – but staged to appear unexpected – performative events often organized using new media and documented to circulate online. Georgiana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856513486532">Gore (2010</xref>) traces the history of flash mobs to the now well-known 2003 flash mob in New York City’s Macy’s. Since then, flash mobs have taken place in cities like Beirut, Rio de Janeiro, and Moscow. The Silent Disco in London in 2006, which took place in several tube stations, and the International Pillow Fight Day flash mob, which took place across 25 cities simultaneously, are two of the most famous events in flash mob history. Though Bill Wasik officially ended the New York City flash mobs at their peak, they continue to thrive in many geographies and contexts (Wasik in interview with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856513486532">Heaney, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Related to more politically oriented smart mobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856513486532">Rheingold, 2003a</xref>), flash mobs generally involve careful planning, assembling, performing, and dissipating. Documenting and sharing the event using social or mobile media is often a part of the process. The careful planning results in what appears to be a spontaneous event. In 2003, Howard Rheingold defined flash mobs as ‘a group of people who organize through the Net to stage a public event for the fun of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856513486532">Rheingold, 2003b</xref>). As such, flash mobs bridge between digital media and live performance. They also take on various meanings. They may be explicitly apolitical (performance art). They may be commercially motivated. I suggest they may also create political meaning.</p>

<sec id="section2-1354856513486532">
<title>Bollywood flash mobs</title>
<p>In the past few years, there have been quite a few Bollywood dance flash mobs. In India, initial flash mobs happened in urban malls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856513486532">Shah, 2007</xref>). Outside India, flash mobs occurred in a wide range of settings, reflecting the broad appeal of Bollywood dance. In Australia, students staged a flash mob in the middle of their anthropology lecture. Raas, Cornell University’s Bollywood dance team, managed to pull off a flash mob on board in a Virgin America plane (quite a feat considering post 9/11 in flight mobility restrictions). Of the several Bollywood flash mobs that have been staged in New York City, most have taken place in Times Square. Though clearly diverse in scope and nature, all Bollywood dance flash mobs generally require that a large group learn a choreographed dance. As such, they tend to be organized using a combination of mobile and new media technologies and in-person rehearsal. The organizers sometimes make no advance announcement and keep the details of the event unknown to the general public. Significantly, the filmed version of a Bollywood flash mob is often just as, if not more, important as the live event itself. As such, it is really the filming and documenting of the Bollywood flash mob that encourages what Lissa Soep has called a ‘digital afterlife’ with significant ‘potential for a reaction and recontextualization by other users’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856513486532">Soep, 2012</xref>: 94). In fact, the space between live and mediated performance may well be where the political potential of Bollywood flash mobs is fully realized.</p>
<p>Like other flash mobs, the CST flash mob in Mumbai was planned in advance, choreographed, staged at a particular location, documented and circulated using new media. Organizer Shonan Kothari, a young woman inspired by groups like improveeverywhere.com explains (in interview with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856513486532">Bubber, 2011</xref>): ‘I had talked to my friends about it. I emailed about 20 people and asked them to enroll 10 to 20 people more each. Within two days, we had 325 people on board. However, we decided to avoid using social media to keep it relatively quiet so that no one got wind of what was going on.’ The CST flashmob participants learned the dances in person. Kothari also secured permission to stage the event. She explains ‘I made a presentation to the CST authorities, and ended up talking a lot about flash mobs in general. They probably gave me permission just to shut me up! But the truth is they were very nice and cooperative. … Perhaps the only reason they were so receptive to this idea was because this was a completely non-commercial endeavor.’ Like earlier Indian flash mobs analyzed by Nishant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856513486532">Shah (2007</xref>), the organizers stressed the CST flash mob was not a political event. For them, the objective was ‘to have fun’ and ‘make the commuters’ day.’ In fact, Kothari (in interview with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856513486532">Bubber, 2011</xref>) narrated how her experience of the event itself fulfilled this goal for her as she recalled how ‘random people joined in and started dancing.’</p>
<p>However, as the CST flash mob video spread (mostly online), it took on other, distinctly political, meanings. The official YouTube video of the event provides insights into how the flash mob encouraged these interpretations, despite the organizers’ disavowal of the political. As the Bollywood song ‘Rang De Basanti’ starts up, a young woman, dressed in jeans and T-shirt, starts to move to the music. Gradually other dancers join her and move in unison. Splitting into groups, they crouch, jump, shout, and clap. They end with a final pose, their gaze upward and arms outstretched. They then disperse and fade into the crowd. Drilling deeper into these CST flash mob details reveals the civic and political possibilities it created. Specifically, the organizers’ choice of music, choreography, and location became crucial to how this event was later interpreted.</p>
<sec id="section3-1354856513486532">
<title>Music</title>
<p>The organizers’ use of a song from <italic>Rang De Basanti </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856513486532">Dilip, 2008</xref>) – a Bollywood film about group of young friends who battle corruption in Indian government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856513486532">Mehta, 2012</xref>) – amplified the understated civic potential of the CST flash mob. In her analysis of the film and the responses it elicited, Meghana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856513486532">Dilip (2008</xref>) argues, ‘… that viewing [<italic>Rang De Basanti</italic>] RDB influenced people to exercise their rights as citizens and that this resulted in active citizenship both in public life as well as on the Internet and also led to an expansion of the public sphere in India.’ Dilip’s observations were reinforced by an actual protest inspired by a candlelight vigil scene in the film.</p>
<p>
<italic>Rang De Basanti</italic>’s theatrical release coincided with the acquittal of a man who shot a young woman in a New Delhi nightclub. Widely seen as a result of bribery and witness intimidation, the acquittal resulted in a protest in which the film became a rallying cry for a real-world protest. These protests eventually resulted in a reopening of the case and a guilty verdict. As the CST flash mob organizers chose the title song from <italic>Rang De Basanti</italic>, they created many possibilities for interpretations that connected to this series of real-world and filmic events, each in its own way underscoring the possible connections between popular culture and political action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354856513486532">
<title>Dance</title>
<p>Drilling down further, the <italic>Rang De Basanti</italic> song and dance sequence the organizers chose, and the choreography they created, supported a symbiotic relationship between the film and the CST flash mob. The song lyrics celebrate diversity and love for homeland. In the film, the song follows the young protagonists as they travel through the Indian state of Punjab, strengthen their friendship, and engage with local communities through dance, food, and other activities. These moments are intercut with brief dialogues reenacting the story of several Indian freedom fighters. This juxtaposition of the celebratory, with the historical creates significant layers of meaning that bridge between celebration (through dance), friendship, and politically charged history.</p>
<p>The choreography of the CST flash mob connects to these layers of meaning. As the creators appropriated some basic steps from the original film dance, they also successfully recreated the sense of spontaneous celebration and deeply rooted camaraderie that defined the sequence in the film. They achieved this by maintaining a balance between a rehearsed and impromptu aesthetics in their performance.</p>
<p>While CST choreography stressed unison movement, it also allowed for embellishments that encouraged a sentiment of participation and expression. For one, the dancers were not perfectly in sync. There were moments when someone waved a wrong hand in the air or took an offbeat step during a turn, underscoring the spontaneity of the event. At the same time, the dance was clearly prepared and rehearsed in advance. The unison movements helped communicate a sense of community between the participants as they clapped and waved their arms (as if inviting others to join them). Potently, the dance ended with a final pose in which all the dancers faced the same direction, with their arms out. This pose left their bodies united, open, and potentially vulnerable to their surroundings, thereby once more underscoring the sense of participation in the performance, filtered through Bollywood dance as a familiar and participatory movement genre.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1354856513486532">
<title>Location</title>
<p>The CST flash mob took place at one of the sites of the terrorist attacks that shook Mumbai in 2008, an event that is now sometimes referred to as 26/11. While news coverage of the flash mob immediately made this connection explicit, the flash mob organizers argued that this was not why they chose this site for the event. Shonan Kothari stressed that ‘CST was always a dream location’ and the ‘27/11’ date was ‘just a big coincidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856513486532">Bubber, 2011</xref>). Downplaying the political significance of the flash mob location, the organizers inadvertently highlighted its importance as an ‘ordinary’ site of participatory culture. Elaborating on the significance of the ‘ordinary,’ Aswin Punathambekar observes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Spaces of everyday interaction… are, as Kumar points out, ‘spaces of sociability that are neither public nor private in the liberal-economic sense of state versus market forces, or in the civic sense of communitarian responsibilities and citizenship, but constitute the heart of public life in colonial and postcolonial India’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856513486532">Punathambekar 2010</xref>: 23, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856513486532">2012</xref>: online)</p>
</disp-quote> Thus read, staging the flash mob at the CST station, which is at once ordinary and politically charged, became crucial to the meanings its subsequent circulation inspired.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1354856513486532">
<title>Dancing toward political significance?</title>
<p>Skeptics question whether flash mobs like the one staged at CST are anything more than a frivolous pastime, with little or no political significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856513486532">Karthik, 2011</xref>: online). While they ask important questions, these critics overlook that flash mobs serve a very important ‘anchoring’ function as they root geographically located performances in specific locations to meanings created as these performances spread through new and social media. As Nishant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856513486532">Shah (2007</xref>: 3) points out, ‘this anchoring of the digital aesthetics and spaces into physical spaces opens a set of political formulations of technoscapes (Appadurai, 1996) that need to be considered.’ Furthermore, as this analysis of the CST flash mob reveals, these criticisms also underestimate the important ways in which Bollywood generally, and <italic>Rang De Basanti</italic> specifically, contribute to popular culture and expression in India, and beyond. Read through this lens, the CST flash mob organizers’ disavowal of political action, in fact, helped create the participatory and open-ended conditions in which performance could connect to political action.</p>
<p>The political potential of the CST flash mob was reinforced by the reactions it elicited as it spread through news and other media channels. Leading news channels like the Times of India and NDTV covered it as news. Abhishek Bachchan and other Bollywood celebrities tweeted their enthusiastic support. Supported by Twitter (#CST #flash mob), the CST official video garnered over 2 million views on YouTube (a large number by Indian standards). Blogger Anuva Kulkarni rendered the political significance of the event visible through her commentary:
<disp-quote>
<p>As I watched the video, the traumatic pictures flashed before my eyes. On TV that day, as I watched smoke rise from the Taj, and all that had happened during the night in that great city, I had known what trauma was. For three days, I watched the news, scared, numb, and feeling so damned helpless as people like us were being killed. … And here were these people, alive, happy, dancing to Rang de Basanti, wanting to rekindle hope into all those who were present around and all those who would watch the video. They’re sending out a message. They’re telling us to fight back, and take what is our own – our lives. The right to live without fear in this city, and in every other place in the country. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856513486532">Kulkarni, 2011</xref>: online)</p>
</disp-quote> This and other similar comments point to the civic significance of the CST flash mob.</p>
<p>Clearly not all flash mobs have political potential. But, as my analysis here suggests, the CST flash mob, and possibly other Bollywood flash mobs as well, point to crucial intersections between popular culture, politics, performance, and new media. For one, they draw attention to the importance of the performative in contemporary cultural and political expressions. They also reveal a complex relationship between popular culture, place, and audience in events staged for online circulation that may surface the politics in unexpected places. In other words, the local significance and online circulation of the CST flash mob point to Bollywood dance as a site of fan activism, which in turn, has much to teach us about the civic potential of popular cultures, in particular those that lie outside the Euro-American axis.</p>
