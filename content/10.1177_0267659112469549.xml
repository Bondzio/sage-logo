<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Thoracentesis with chest tube placement is often needed to decompress a clinically significant pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The risks of such a procedure may be considered too great to perform on a systemically anticoagulated patient supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</p>

<sec id="section2-0267659112469549">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>An 8-year-old child with respiratory failure due to necrotizing pneumonia and autoimmune vasculitis, on veno-venous ECMO, developed a severe tension pneumothorax that required emergent decompression with a chest tube. Post-procedure, the patient developed a hemothorax that was approaching non-sustainability. We developed a strategy based on Virchow’s triad to favor homeostasis in the patient while avoiding thrombosis in the ECMO circuit. We employed selective lung ventilation, passive pleural drainage, high flow ECMO, and aggressive coagulation cascade control, including the use of aminocaproic acid and activated factor VIIa. Following this strategy, the hemorrhage was controlled and, later, the patient was able to successfully come off ECMO.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>With careful coagulation cascade manipulation, complete lung rest for the affected lung, control of ECMO blood flow, and prudent hemothorax drainage, we were able to facilitate hemostasis that was required for the successful recovery of our patient while avoiding critical ECMO circuit thrombosis. Even with today’s highly advanced medical technologies, centuries-old basic medical principles can still assist in the care of our sickest and most complex patients. Chest tube placement while on ECMO is rare and, although necessary, may be a risky procedure. With precise coagulation control, it can be a successful procedure on ECMO.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic anticoagulation using a heparin infusion is used to prevent overwhelming thrombosis of the life-supporting ECMO circuit due to clotting in the tubing, cannulae or oxygenator. In spite of profound anticoagulation, it is not uncommon for thrombi to form in the circuit and, at times, this requires life-risking replacement of the entire circuit or its components. Due to the risks of uncontrollable bleeding, centers may have a relative, if not absolute, embargo on conducting even minor invasive procedures while patients are on ECMO. However, occasionally patients on ECMO may develop a condition that requires de novo invasive procedures while anticoagulated. Examples may include pericardial tamponade, large pleural effusions/empyema, deep abscesses and tension pneumothorax. Since January 2006, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Emory University at Egleston has performed approximately 100 cases of pediatric (non-cardiac, non-neonatal) veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO where 12 have had a chest tube placed while on ECMO. This is an ominous sign as, prior to the patient in this report, survival was ~17% (2 of 12) in these patients versus ~72% (63 of 88) in those who had not receive chest tubes while on ECMO. It is unclear if the increased mortality in patients requiring de novo chest tubes is causal or associative.</p>
<p>The source of bleeding occurring after the placement of a chest tube may be difficult to pinpoint and may be from intercostal vessels or from the pleura or parenchyma. Because traditional measures (manual compression, further operative exploration and coagulopathy correction) may be limited while on ECMO, an alternative strategy to achieve hemostasis may need to be considered if a hemothorax develops and becomes uncontrollable.</p>

<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A previously healthy 8-year-old, 24.6 kg male was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory distress following 3 weeks of a clinically diagnosed upper and lower airway infection treated with oral and parenteral antibiotics. On admission, radiography (chest X-ray [CXR] and computed tomography [CT] scan) demonstrated a round lucent area in his right hemithorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1A</xref>) and he was given the provisional diagnosis of “necrotizing pneumonia”. Three days later, the patient was intubated for hypoxemia and quickly transitioned to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1B</xref>). A bronchoscopy showed large amounts of fresh, partially coagulated blood in the right mainstem bronchus and a relatively clear left mainstem. That same day, the hypoxemia worsened (i.e. oxygenation indices of 54-63 and P/F ratios of 48-56) and the patient was transitioned to veno-venous ECMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1C</xref>), using a Sorin Stöckert SIII pump (Sorin, Arvada, CO, USA), a Quadrox D oxygenator (Jostra, Newark, DE, USA) and uncoated tubing (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Drainage was by right femoral and cephalad cannulae (Bio-Medicus, Medtronic), and blood was returned to the right superior vena cava/atrium. The patient was maintained on low HFOV “rest” settings with the hope that a sustained mean airway pressure would assist in tamponading the pulmonary bleeding.</p>

<p>Although the patient had no other history or systemic symptoms (i.e. renal), the pulmonary hemorrhage prompted serologic assessment for autoimmune vasculitis. The patient was c-ANCA positive and, thus, also given a provisional diagnosis of Wegener’s Vasculitis and high dose solumedrol was initiated. A bronchoscopy 3 days later demonstrated large bloody clots intermixed with purulent material occluding both mainstem bronchi and a further bronchoscopy two days later showed generalized mucosal erythema and no active bleeding. Chest radiographs began to show some bilateral clearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1D</xref>). Two days later (ECMO day 9), the patient was switched to a conventional ventilator (our center’s standard ECMO ventilation strategy) at a peak inspiratory pressure of 20, PEEP of 10, rate of 10, inspiratory time of 2 seconds, and an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.30. About five hours later, the ECMO pump began to intermittently pause and a radiograph showed a moderate right-sided pneumothorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1E</xref>). The patient was transitioned back to HFOV. Approximately eight hours later, there were severe pauses in the ECMO pump due to poor drainage, with severe patient oxygen desaturations. Radiography showed a large tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1F</xref>). Even with multiple fluid boluses and repositioning of the ECMO cannula, ECMO flow could not be satisfactorily maintained. Because the pneumothorax was purported as the culprit, on the morning of ECMO day 10, our pediatric surgeon placed a 28 Fr chest tube between the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> ribs on the right. Electrocautery was used robustly for the intercostal incision and tract in an attempt to minimize surgical bleeding. The chest tube was placed to 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 of suction. A repeat radiograph showed resolution of the pneumothorax and the ECMO flow and patient saturations improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>In the eight hours after placement, the chest tube put out &gt;2 L (85 ml/kg) of sanguineous drainage. To bolster endogenous coagulation and thrombogenic pathways, the international normalization ratio (INR) was maintained &lt;1.2, fibrinogen at &gt;80 mg/dL, and platelets at &gt;100x10<sup>3</sup>/ml, with fresh frozen platelets (FFP), cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions, respectively. Aminocaproic acid (Amicar®), which inhibits the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, was started with a bolus (100mg/kg) and maintained at an infusion of ~30 mg/kg/hr. In an attempt to counter the potential for ECMO circuit clotting, the ECMO pump flow was increased from 77 ml/kg/min (1890 ml/min) to 100 ml/kg/min (2500 ml/min). In addition, the systemic anticoagulation parameters were relaxed. The target activated clotting time (ACT) was decreased from 140-170 sec to 120-140 sec. Heparin infusion was decreased from 42 U/kg/hr ultimately to 15 U/kg/hr within about a day.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that the continued mechanical pleural and/or parenchymal irritation of the HFOV positive pressure and chest tube suction might be interfering with intrathoracic clot formation. To counter the sustained putative mechanical irritation to the damaged lung, we directed the endotracheal tube into the distal left mainstem bronchus using bronchoscopy, effectively “dropping” the right lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1H</xref>). The chest tube (which had been on active suction) was placed to water seal for passive drainage and intermittently distally clamped to slow the flow of bleeding. To facilitate drainage, when possible, the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. If blood drainage “built up” in the tube, the chest tube was unclamped to allow the tube to temporarily clear.</p>
<p>The chest tube was unclamped intermittently (i.e. every 1-3 hours) to assess for continued drainage or to release sanguineous build-up in the chest tube. At these intervals, the tube was allowed to drain and ongoing drainage was assessed. At one point during this process, a routine CXR was obtained and a slight mediastinal shift was noted, but without impacting on pump flow. The chest tube was unclamped to allow drainage of pleural blood, remedying the shift.</p>
<p>In spite of these efforts, chest tube output continued to increase, from 180 ml/hr (7.3 ml/kg/hr) to 460 ml/hr (18.7 ml/kg/hr). As the patient was requiring substantial and increasing blood product support (i.e. &gt;2.5 L (&gt;100 ml/kg)) in the first eight hours after chest tube placement), the concern was that that it might not be possible to sustain such a transfusion requirement and maintain blood and circulating volume.</p>
<p>Because of this, recombinant human Factor VIIa (rFVIIa; NovoSeven®) was given. rFVIIa activates the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade and has been efficacious in episodes of post-operative hemorrhage. Three doses of 40 μg/kg/dose (1 mg/dose) were given to the patient (vs. the ECMO circuit) over approximately 18 hours. A priori, we had defined the “efficacy” of this therapy as a stabilization or decrease of chest tube output in the subsequent hours following administration. Factor VIIa was re-dosed when the chest tube output was increasing or after about six hours if it was not continuing to decrease. During this time, enhanced observation of the ECMO circuit status for in-circuit thrombi took place and a replacement ECMO circuit was prepared in case of life-threatening circuit clotting.</p>
<p>During the first 24 hours after chest tube insertion while attempts to offset the intrathoracic hemorrhage were instituted, there was ~4.5 L/day (183 ml/kg/day) of sanguineous chest tube output, which decreased to ~1.9 L/day (77 ml/kg/day) in the next 24 hours, then to an average of 111 ml/day (4.5 ml/kg/day) over the next four days, and negligible the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112469549">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, the blood product requirement decreased by nearly 40% from &gt;6 L/day (245 ml/kg/day) to ~3.7 L/day (150 ml/kg/day) the next day. It continued to decrease progressively over the next four days, such that the average blood product transfusion reduced from ~1.6 L/day (67 ml/kg/day) to less than 600 ml/day (24 ml/kg/day) and, on day six day post chest tube placement, it was back to within the pre-pneumothorax blood requirement range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112469549">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to the achieved hematologic stability three days later (ECMO day 13), the endotracheal tube was repositioned to the mid trachea with partial re-expansion of the right lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1I</xref>). The next day, the aminocaproic acid infusion was discontinued. Heparinization parameters were normalized, ECMO was progressively weaned and the patient was decannulated on hospital day 24 (ECMO day 20). Three days later, the chest tube was removed without incident while the patient was on conventional ventilation. The patient was successfully extubated to nasal cannula oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1K</xref>) on hospital day 30 and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on room air 33 days after hospital admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469549">Figure 1L</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intrathoracic bleeding is a known complication of chest tube insertion and may be life-threatening while systemically anticoagulated during ECMO. As such, insertion of chest tubes and other de novo invasive procedures should be avoided in ECMO patients if possible. However, there are situations that necessitate such procedures due to concerns of imminent death or non-sustainability while on ECMO. Due to the shifting of the large intrathoracic vessels, a tension pneumothorax can impede drainage of ECMO cannulae and compromise, or arrest, life-sustaining ECMO flow. In an experimental canine model of ECMO, tension pneumothoraces reproducibly severely limited ECMO flow and rapidly resulted in clinical deterioration, which was readily resolved with aspiration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112469549">1</xref></sup> In our case, clinically significant symptoms of a tension pneumothorax included intermittent pausing of the ECMO pump (“autoregulation”) due to poor venous drainage and systemic desaturations. Because of poor outcomes with chest tube placement, its placement was only considered because of the emergent life-threatening nature of the situation.</p>
<p>We experienced the most dreaded complication of any procedure while on ECMO - severe, uncontrollable hemorrhage. Because the rate of chest tube bleeding was approaching a point of non-sustainability, we implemented a multi-faceted, previously un-reported approach, using both mechanical and hematologic maneuvers to control this intrathoracic bleeding.</p>
<p>We attempted to normalize prothrombin, fibrinogen and platelet parameters while, simultaneously, reducing the level of systemic anticoagulation as much as possible, using conventional means (i.e. transfusions and lowering heparin infusions). In addition, we used the anti-fibrinolytic agent, aminocaproic acid, which has been used for ongoing bleeding while on ECMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112469549">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112469549">3</xref></sup> Activated factor VIIa is FDA approved for hemophilia and there are a small number of case reports of its use during ECMO, most of which are in post-operative cardiac patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112469549">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112469549"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112469549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112469549">13</xref></sup> In our institutional experience, we have used factor VIIa approximately 10 times in our pediatric (non-cardiac, non-neonatal) ECMO without any instances of fatal, or even severe, circuit thrombosis. In the recent literature, there have been case reports of severe thrombotic complications and fatal outcomes with the use of activated factor VIIa in ECMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112469549">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112469549">15</xref></sup> The acceptability or role of activated factor VIIa has yet to be definitively determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112469549">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112469549">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112469549"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112469549">18</xref></sup> Ours appears to be the first paper to describe the concurrent use of aminocaproic acid and activated VIIa. Our team was very cognizant of the potential complications of this approach. To attempt to minimize circuit clotting, we maximized the ECMO pump flow. It is unclear if this straightforward approach to increase intra-circuit blood flow to reduce stasis was used in the reported cases of severe and fatal thrombosis following factor VIIa. Factor VIIa was given directly to our patient; in other reports, this therapy appears to be delivered to the circuit or not explicitly reported. During this case, our ECMO personnel maintained highly vigilant monitoring for thrombus formation in the ECMO circuitry and kept a back-up circuit readily available in case of circuit seizure.</p>
<p>In addition to the hematologic correction and therapeutics, we were concerned that the iatrogenic “mechanical” irritations might destabilize intrathoracic thrombus formation and might have been expanding active bleeding sites. To decrease the continued barotrauma, we let the right lung deflate and rest by preferentially intubating the contralateral lung. Because active suction might be directly irritating lung tissue and vessels and active removal may impair clot formation, we changed the chest tube from active to passive drainage (i.e. water seal) and, at times, clamped distally – so we could observe if passive drained blood was clotting. We must be aware that different ECMO hardware (i.e. oxygenator, tubing, cannulas) may react differently to our therapies, including activated factor VIIa, and our observations may not be fully generalizable.</p>
<p>The factors that contribute to thrombosis were classically attributed to Rudolf Virchow, a 19<sup>th</sup> century physician-scientist, and include the triad of (1) briskness of blood flow, (2) intactness of the coagulation cascade and (3) severity of vascular endothelial damage, together known as Virchow’s Triad.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112469549">19</xref></sup> There are several scenarios in medicine in which these principles provide the rationale to lowering the incidence of thrombosis and their sequelae, including deep venous thombosis, pulmonary emboli, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. In the setting of life-threatening hemothorax while systemically anticoagulated on extracorporeal life support, the principles of Virchow may be able to be differentially used in the patient and the circuit. In our example, we attempted a unique combination of conventional and non-conventional approaches to enhance in-patient thrombosis formation by fostering the pro-thrombotic hematologic profile and decreasing continued assault on the vascular and tissue irritation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112469549">Table 1</xref>). We attempted to minimize the risk of circuit clotting by maintaining some levels of systemic anticoagulation and maximizing the flow of blood through the circuitry. In addition to novel therapeutics that may enhance thrombosis during episodes of hemorrhage and bolster one arm of the triad, it is probably prudent to assure that other factors that may contribute to bleeding are also recognized and addressed. If implementing such measures, it is requisite to maintain close observation on clot formation in the ECMO circuitry and have a readily executable plan in case of the development of a critical circuit thrombus or circuit failure.</p>

<p>Even while on extracorporeal support, a chest tube may be considered the <italic>sine qua non</italic> to prevent certain death due to an intrathoracic calamity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112469549">1</xref></sup> Our internal data shows that ECMO patients needing a chest tube have a 4-fold higher mortality rate than those without. Whether there is a causal or just associative association of chest tube placement and poor outcomes while on ECMO is unclear. Our center had not used activated factor VIIa in all patients with chest tubes placed on ECMO, probably due to real and perceived risks of this therapy. Improved approaches to deal with the obvious bleeding complications of chest tubes may result in enhanced use of chest tubes when needed and, thus, improved survival. Even with today’s technically advanced medical therapies, it is important to recognize that some of the basic principles of medicine (even if described over a century ago) still have important roles in the care of even our most complicated patients.</p>
