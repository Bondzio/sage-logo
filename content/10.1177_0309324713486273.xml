<abstract>
<p>A nickel-base superalloy sub-scale disc has been studied using neutron diffraction to characterise the residual stress distribution following heat treatment. Strain has been calculated using measured neutron diffraction <italic>d</italic>-spacings in combination with <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> reference values obtained using three distinct methods, namely, measurement of a stress-free cube, a sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> characterisation (used independently and as a correction factor), and an axial stress balance. In addition, data obtained using the contour method have been included since it allows comparison of diffraction-based data to a technique that does not require a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value. In terms of residual stress, agreement between all <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurement techniques and the contour method was high, with the exception being those made using the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique. An offset of approximately 350 MPa was observed in these data, and a possible systematic error was ascribed to a unique diffraction characteristic of a <italic>γ</italic>/<italic>γ</italic>′ nickel-base superalloy. A global <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value obtained using a stress balance or stress-free cube was found to be reliable throughout the sample bulk in cases where thermal processing was carried out at a slow rate, such as ageing. However, <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> differences equivalent to 400 µε were observed between central and surface regions when a global <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> was applied to a water-quenched sample.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Residual stresses are introduced into an engineering component through a number of widely used manufacturing steps, including forging, heat treatment, and machining. The level of residual stress within a component is known to affect performance as it can promote or retard failure mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309324713486273">1</xref></sup> Characterisation of residual stress following manufacture is therefore a crucial part of understanding the in-service capabilities of any single component. The measurement techniques used to determine residual stress <italic>γ</italic>′ include destructive techniques such as slicing and hole drilling, as well as non-destructive techniques such as neutron and X-ray diffraction (XRD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324713486273">2</xref></sup> In each case, residual stress is calculated from the measured elastic strain and material-specific elastic properties.</p>
<p>In a diffraction experiment, the inter-planar spacing can be derived from the measured diffraction angle 2<italic>θ</italic> as given by Bragg’s law (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0309324713486273">equation (1)</xref>)</p>

<p>When using a specific lattice plane for stress determination, it is important to choose the one that is insensitive to intergranular strain development during plastic deformation, as this would affect any elastic strain determination in components with plasticity-induced stored energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309324713486273">3</xref></sup> The lattice parameter <italic>a</italic> is considered to be free of such intergranular strain development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309324713486273">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>By measuring strain in the three principal directions, it is possible to calculate stress using the following relation</p>

In the case when strain is based on lattice parameter measurements, conventional bulk elastic properties can be used. The elastic constants used in this particular study are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309324713486273">Table 1</xref>. These properties are specific for RR1000, which is a <italic>γ</italic>′ precipitation–strengthened polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy for disc application that was investigated in this study. The <italic>γ</italic>′ precipitates are an ordered phase with an L1<sub>2</sub> crystal structure, while the <italic>γ</italic> matrix is face-centred cubic (fcc). The two phases have a cube–cube orientation relationship, and due to an almost identical lattice parameter, <italic>γ</italic>′ is often coherent with the <italic>γ</italic> matrix. In RR1000, the volume fraction of <italic>γ</italic>′ is close to 50%.</p>

<p>The measured strain, and hence calculated stress, is highly sensitive to the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value. Consequently, it is recommended that an uncertainty half that of the <italic>d</italic>-spacing is sought to reduce the inaccuracies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324713486273">6</xref></sup> One of the most widely used <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurement techniques is to remove a coupon from the sample that is of sufficiently small dimension to have zero type I stress. This coupon is measured during the neutron diffraction experiment alongside the actual component to obtain the required <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>. However, in cases of significant <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variations due to dramatic microstructural variations, a large number of cubes or a comb type sample are required to account for the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value at each measurement location. If a more detailed <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> characterisation is required, a sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique can be employed across a sample surface to map <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> to a resolution depending on the chosen spot size. Further details on <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurement including the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique can be found in the in-depth review given by Withers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324713486273">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we report the observed variations in residual stress calculated from the same neutron diffraction data using three techniques to characterise <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>: a stress-free cube measurement, an axial stress balance, and a sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> lab XRD measurement. A fourth <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> data set was generated by using the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> data as a position-dependent correction factor for the stress-free cube measurement. The material studied was a <italic>γ</italic>′-strengthened nickel-base superalloy, which displays a complex diffraction spectrum due to the matrix (<italic>γ</italic>) and precipitates (<italic>γ</italic>′) having almost identical lattice parameters. In order to determine the validity of the three independent <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> techniques, additional residual stress analysis was carried out using the contour method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324713486273">8</xref></sup> This method consists of sectioning a sample, thus relaxing the residual stress, and then measuring the newly created (and deformed) surface contour to infer the original residual stress distribution. As this method is based on a completely different approach without the requirement of knowing a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value, it was considered to be most appropriate for validation. The focus of this article is to draw together these data sets to study the impact of <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> characterisation on the final residual stress calculated using diffraction techniques.</p>

<p>Each specimen was cut from a large pancake forging at the same radial distance to ensure a closely matched thermo-mechanical history for each part. Sample 1 (S1) was sub <italic>γ</italic>′-solvus heat treated at 1120 °C for 4 h followed by water quench (WQ). Sample 2 (S2) was subjected to an identical heat treatment but with the addition of a 2-h ageing heat treatment at 760 °C.</p>
<p>The WQ process was chosen in this sub-scale geometry to achieve high levels of residual stress despite the small geometry of the sample, while an ageing temperature of 760 °C was chosen because it is a typical stress relief/ageing temperature for <italic>γ</italic>′-strengthened nickel-base superalloys.</p>

<p>In order to calculate stress, it was necessary to measure strain in three perpendicular directions, namely, hoop, radial, and axial as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324713486273">Figure 1</xref>. Five measurements were made along each of the three line scans, the centre line (CL) and +7 mm and −7 mm from CL, making a total of 15 points. In order to balance spatial resolution with count statistics, a gauge volume of 4 × 4 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> was chosen and defined using primary and secondary slits.</p>
<p>Data analysis was carried out during and immediately after completion of each measurement point using an FRM II in-house software package known as StressTex. This software allowed fitting and subtraction of the background, followed by a Gaussian fit of a single peak to obtain a value of <italic>d</italic>-spacing. However, in a <italic>γ</italic>′-strengthened nickel-base superalloy, such as RR1000, any fundamental reflection contains contributions from both the <italic>γ</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>′ phases, thereby making a Gaussian fit an average of both phases. As such, the measured strain and subsequently calculated stress are an average over both phases; this is widely accepted to be a good representation of bulk behaviour when measuring the (311) reflection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309324713486273">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309324713486273">11</xref></sup> However, while this holds true, while measuring on either a neutron or XRD instrument, it has the potential to be an issue when directly combining the two. This is related to titanium having a negative neutron scattering factor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309324713486273">12</xref></sup> and since titanium is a <italic>γ</italic>′ stabilising element, it partitions to the <italic>γ</italic>′ phase and reduces the <italic>γ</italic>′ fundamental peak intensity when using neutron diffraction, while this effect is not expected when using XRD. As a result, strain calculations made using a neutron-derived <italic>d</italic>-spacing in conjunction with an X-ray-derived <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> are likely to generate systematic errors.</p>
<p>During the neutron diffraction experiment, the fit uncertainty value was used as a guide to check that the count times per point were sufficient to generate reliable data. For this experiment, the aim was to calculate stress to an accuracy of ±50 MPa or less, which on this instrument meant achieving a fit uncertainty of approximately 2<italic>θ</italic> = 0.025° (∼220 µε) in each direction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324713486273">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows a comparison of the fit uncertainty with measurement position for S1 in transmission orientation. Count times remain the same for each point shown with the exception of points at 35 mm radial distance. These points could be counted for half the time due to their proximity to the rim and hence reduced neutron path length. Overall, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324713486273">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows a general trend that the fit uncertainty falls once the measurement position approaches the sample rim. This is due to the diffracted neutron beam leaving through side of the sample, thus requiring a shorter path length.</p>

</fig>
<p>In reflection orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324713486273">Figure 2(b)</xref>), we observe larger uncertainties along the CL than along the ±7 mm line. Note that the +7 mm and −7 mm scans have identical path lengths in this case owing to the sample being rotated at 180° in 2<italic>θ</italic> to access the −7 mm line scan through the back face. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324713486273">Figure 2</xref> indicate that for the most part, the ±220 µε limit was adhered to but for a handful of measurement points. In these locations, time limitation forced a compromise to be made and uncertainties rose as a result.</p>
<p>The fit uncertainty was used to calculate errors in the residual stress values as described by Wimpory et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324713486273">6</xref></sup> However, as has been observed by Frankel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309324713486273">13</xref></sup> the uncertainty in fit does not necessarily reflect the uncertainty in residual strain and stress. It is possible that a poor fit, if applied to each peak equally, may map a peak shift without issue despite not fitting the peak to a high accuracy. It was therefore worth comparing a fit uncertainty to an uncertainty obtained by making a repeat measurement under identical conditions. In this experiment, it was noted that at the sample centre, the hoop and radial measurements were essentially on the same point; therefore, the difference between the values obtained could be used as a typical error.</p>

<title>Characterisation of d<sub>0</sub></title>
<p>Measurement of <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> using neutron diffraction was carried out using cubes of sufficiently small size to have zero macrostress as discussed in the study by Withers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324713486273">7</xref></sup> Due to a lack of additional material, such measurements had to be carried out at a later date to the primary neutron diffraction measurement as made on STRESS-SPEC. A 6 × 6 × 6 mm<sup>3</sup> cube was extracted at mid-diameter and thickness using conventional cutting techniques and mounted on the strain scanning instrument SALSA at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL), Grenoble, France. A 4 × 4 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> gauge volume was aligned carefully using entry scans to ensure full gauge volume immersion within the sample, which was crucial to avoid pseudostrains generated by partial immersion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324713486273">14</xref></sup> Measurements were made using the same set-up on the (311) <italic>hkl</italic> plane with a relatively long count time to ensure good count statistics and low peak position uncertainty. It must be noted that the use of two separate diffraction instruments for a single investigation can bring about additional uncertainty in the final stress calculations. To overcome this, a thorough calibration measurement was made on both STRESS-SPEC and SALSA using an RR1000 powder sample.</p>
<p>The sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique is widely known as a technique to measure stress without the need for a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324713486273">7</xref></sup> However, it has been shown to be equally applicable to the determination of <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324713486273">15</xref></sup> It is in this format that the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique has been employed in this investigation.</p>
<p>To obtain a full <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> map and thus generate accurate residual stress data, a sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> measurement was undertaken at each neutron measurement point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324713486273">Figure 1</xref>). Application of the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique to these points using X-rays required a slice to be removed from each sample to gain access. To extract the slice, a first cut was made using electro-discharge machining (EDM) in ‘skim cut’ mode. The cut was carried out across the diameter of the sample at the same circumferential position as the neutron diffraction line scans. Thus, the free surface revealed was that on which the three neutron line scans were made. EDM was chosen for the first cut as it allowed a contour method measurement to be made on the cut faces, details of which are provided in the next section. Following the initial EDM cut, a second conventional cut was made across the diameter parallel to the first to extract a 5-mm-thick slice from one sample half. This process was followed for S1 and S2, with the result that a 5-mm-thick cross-sectional slice was extracted from each sample.</p>
<p>As final preparation before measurement, the face of each slice cut with EDM was ground and polished back to the base material. This was essential since the EDM cutting process generates a recast layer along the surface, which can affect the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value for the sample.</p>
<p>The instrument chosen for the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> measurement was a Bruker AXS D8 lab-based X-ray diffractometer coupled to a general area detector diffraction system (GADDS), which is a two-dimensional (2D) area detector. The instrument was set up with a Fe tube, which, when driven at 20 kV and combined with a sequence of foil filters, produced a monochromatic K<italic>α</italic> beam at <italic>λ</italic> = 1.94 Å. In the case of the Bruker instrument, the beam is passed through a collimator to give a spot size of ∼1 mm and an approximately parallel beam. To acquire <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> data relevant to the neutron study, the (311) plane was chosen again, which in this set-up gave a 2<italic>θ</italic> angle of ∼127°.</p>
<p>Both slices were mounted simultaneously on a translational sample stage attached to an Eulerian cradle that is capable of rotating around the beam focus point. This set-up allowed translation in <italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> directions and rotation in 2<italic>θ, ψ</italic>, and <italic>φ</italic>. In this way, it was possible to undertake sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> measurements in two orthogonal directions, <italic>φ</italic> = 0° and 90°, with <italic>ψ</italic> ranging from 0° to 45° in steps of 5°.</p>
<p>Alignment on the Bruker system is carried out by rotating the stage to place the sample surface perpendicular to a laser and camera system. The laser and camera are set at an angle to each other such that the laser beam falls in the centre of the camera cross hairs when the sample surface is at the correct distance from the X-ray source. Each measurement point was aligned in this way by moving the laser and camera to a point and refocusing, thus generating a set of <italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> positions, which were executed within a customised script.</p>
<p>Each diffraction peak was fitted using the Bruker STRESSplus software package. A sliding gravity approach was used to obtain the peak centre in 2<italic>θ</italic>, and this was written into a stress report along with the angles of <italic>ψ</italic> and <italic>φ</italic>. Using Bragg’s law to convert from 2<italic>θ</italic> to <italic>d</italic>-spacing, we obtain a data set of <italic>d</italic>-spacing values over a range of sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> angles for the two orthogonal directions in <italic>φ</italic>. As described in the study by Hauk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324713486273">15</xref></sup> the relationship between sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> and <italic>d</italic>-spacing is linear providing there are no significant shear stresses present. A linear fit was therefore carried out for each <italic>φ</italic> direction, and the gradient of each fit was used to calculate the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value.</p>
<p>As a data check, the linearity of each sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> versus <italic>d</italic>-spacing plot was calculated as an <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value, also known as a Pearson correlation coefficient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309324713486273">16</xref></sup> where an <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 1 indicating perfect linear relationship. By calculating <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> for each measurement point and setting a limit of 0.9, it was possible to filter the entire data set and identify sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> plots that contained anomalous data points. The points were then marked as such and removed from the data set.</p>
<p>The X-ray <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> values obtained were incorporated into the final residual stress calculations in two distinct ways. First, by using a powder sample of RR1000 measured on both instruments to calibrate between neutron and X-ray <italic>d</italic>-spacings. The ratio of powder <italic>d</italic>-spacings measured on each instrument was used as a multiplication factor to convert from X-ray <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> values to neutron <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> values. Second, by normalising the X-ray <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value with respect to the location from which a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> stress-free cube was measured, in this case at mid-diameter and thickness. The normalised <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation could then be multiplied by the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value obtained from the stress-free cube to give a full <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> map without the use of a powder calibration.</p>
<p>Prior to <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> characterisation by XRD, a preliminary study was carried out to assess the precision of the alignment system and to obtain a characteristic error for this technique on this instrument. This study was carried out in two stages.</p>
<p>The first stage tackled the issue of sample alignment. The technique employed was to take measurements while moving systematically through the focus point of the beam and to assess to what degree the focus point affected the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value obtained. Following this, the instrument was repeatedly de-focused and refocused upon the same point, and the variation in the value of <italic>z</italic> was recorded each time. These two exercises revealed the correlation between focus and <italic>d</italic>-spacing and the fundamental limit to the accuracy of this alignment system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324713486273">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324713486273">Figure 3(a)</xref>, one can see a linear relationship between the focus point and the <italic>d</italic>-spacing measured. To ease comparison with the experimental error, this is also expressed in terms of microstrain. The limits of repeatable focusing are shown as dashed lines. They indicate a focusing accuracy of ±0.02 mm, which translates to ±25 µε. Since diffraction experiment errors of approximately ±100 µε are generally expected,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309324713486273">17</xref></sup> it was concluded that focal alignment is expected to add only a very minor experimental inaccuracy.</p>
<p>The second stage of this preliminary study assessed the inherent error in the instrument. The method employed was to measure a point, move each of the motors to a new position, and then return to the same point and remeasure. This was repeated 10 times to observe the instrumental scatter in <italic>d</italic>-spacing and then converted into microstrain to be expressed as an error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324713486273">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324713486273">Figure 3(b)</xref> that the instrumental error was no greater than ±60 µε, with the standard deviation being ±30 µε. Having conducted this study, it was possible to conclude that the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurements are expected to have an experimental accuracy better than ±80 µε.</p>
<p>Finally, the third approach to determine a correct <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> was the application of a stress balance as described in the study by Withers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324713486273">7</xref></sup> The axial component of stress was forced to balance across a circumferential sweep of the CL scan. This approach required the compressive axial stress at the rim surface to balance with a tensile region immediately behind it; much of the remaining line scan had near-zero axial stress. The CL scan was chosen in this case since the neutron diffraction data points were found to be the most reliable when away from the steeper stress gradients closer to the surface.</p>

<sec id="section6-0309324713486273">
<title>Contour method</title>
<p>The contour method for measuring residual stress is a relatively new technique, which measures a full cross-sectional map of residual stress normal to a cut surface. The technique is based upon the elastic relaxation of residual stresses causing a surface deformation immediately following a cut. The deviation of the surface contour from a planar surface is measured and then used to calculate the original residual stress distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324713486273">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each sample was sectioned into half using the EDM. The EDM cut was made across the sample diameter using a very slow cut rate, also known as a ‘skim cut’; this was chosen so as to ensure that the cutting process did not contribute to the residual stress state of the sample. Details of the cutting parameters have been given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0309324713486273">Table 3</xref>. Each sample half was placed on a NanoFocus confocal laser profilometer to measure the surface contour. This instrument has a theoretical vertical precision of approximately 10 nm, for stress contour measurements, this is at least two orders of magnitude greater than required. The laser profilometer was set up to measure at 100 µm intervals across the entire surface, generating a total of approximately 227,000 measurement points per sample surface. Measurement locations with a reflectivity lower than 80% indicated that the laser had moved over the sample edge; these data points were masked off and set to a default low value. These data were then exported for analysis in commercially available data manipulate and finite element software packages.</p>

<p>The surface contour from each sample face was imported individually and run through a script to remove the masked points from the data and to identify the sample outline. Following this, the data were manually checked for artefacts and any identifiable outliers removed. In this case, it was necessary to remove 5 mm of data from the end of the sample to eliminate artefacts generated as the EDM wire exits the workpiece.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309324713486273">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two data sets, one for each face, were aligned by minimisation of misfit strain between the corresponding outlines of each half. After alignment, an average of the two displacements was made. The averaging process allowed all stresses, except those normal to the surface, to cancel out with those on the opposite face. The displacement left over after averaging was therefore said to be solely generated by the relaxation of residual stresses normal to the cut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324713486273">8</xref></sup> Finally, experimental noise was removed; this was achieved by implementing a bi-variant spline fit to the averaged surface as described by Prime et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309324713486273">18</xref></sup> The spline fit to the contour therefore represented the displacement from which bulk residual stress would be calculated.</p>
<p>In order to model accurately the sample geometry, the measured outline was used directly as the starting point from which a 3D mesh was generated. This was achieved through extruding the outline back by the sample radius and then forming a semi-circular shape out of the extruded block. The part was meshed using quadratic elements with a bias to allow a dense mesh near the deformed surface and a coarse mesh further back. The typical mesh length at the surface was 1 mm, which increased to 3.5 mm in length at the curved back face of the sample. The fully meshed part was combined with the spline fit of the contour to form the initial and final conditions for the finite element model.</p>
<p>Since the contour method assumes elastic isotropy, residual stress can be calculated from the relaxation data using bulk material properties. Using the bulk Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309324713486273">Table 1</xref>), with the sample mesh as an initial state and the surface contour as the final state, a model is generated. By solving this model, a 2D map of the residual stress normal to the cut surface was generated.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713486273">Figure 4(a)</xref> shows the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation with radial distance across three line scans in S1. It is clear from the data that a trend exists for the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value to increase near the sample rim and that the degree to which this is occurring varies with sample depth. Across the CL scan, only a marginal increase in <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value is seen, whereas at +7 mm and particularly at −7 mm, stronger trends are visible. A possible explanation for this may exist through considering the thermal history of the sample with respect to measurement position. The WQ process will rapidly cool the sample exterior while the interior will lag behind and cool at a slower rate. In this transient period, thermally dependent elemental diffusion processes within the alloy will exist for longer in the sample core than in the regions close to the surface. The net result of this would be to cause a variation in chemical composition of the <italic>γ</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>′ phases with respect to proximity to the surface. Since the (311) diffraction peak measured to calculate <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> is made up from both the <italic>γ</italic> and the <italic>γ</italic>′ phases, this would lead to a change in peak shape and therefore a shift in the fitted Gaussian. This in turn would alter the stress-free lattice spacing, and it is postulated that this would lead to a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation such as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713486273">Figure 4</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation of S2 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713486273">Figure 4(b)</xref>.

The additional ageing heat treatment will allow the chemical compositions of <italic>γ</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>′ to evolve towards equilibrium and reducing the effect of the initial different cooling rates as a result of the quenching process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324713486273">Figure 5</xref> shows the potential impact on an arbitrary stress calculation if an apparent <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation such as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713486273">Figure 4</xref> is ignored, this has been termed as ‘pseudostress’. To calculate the pseudostress, the microstrain data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713486273">Figure 4</xref> were assumed to be equal in the three principal directions, and the stresses were calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0309324713486273">equation (3)</xref>.

<title>d<sub>0</sub> measurement technique and stress calculation</title>
<p>The residual stress profile along the CL and +7 mm scans of S1 and S2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713486273">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324713486273">7</xref>, respectively. Data from the −7 mm scan have not been included since the neutron diffraction data were incomplete along this line scan, thus preventing any useful comparison from being made. Four methods were used to obtain the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> reference value: X-ray sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> measurement, stress balance, stress-free cube measurement, and position-dependent correction of the cube data using the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> findings. The <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurements obtained from the X-ray sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> approach were calibrated against the neutron diffraction data by having a powder measurement on both sources. The residual stresses that resulted from each method have been plotted for comparison. In addition, residual stress data obtained by the contour method measurement technique are added to both line scans.</p>

<p>In both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713486273">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324713486273">7</xref>, along the CL and +7 mm line scans, the agreement between each of the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurement techniques is high with the exception of the XRD method, which shows a relatively consistent offset of ∼400 MPa. The consistency of the offset in these data points to a systematic error generated as a result of using XRD to obtain a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value for neutron diffraction data. Furthermore, the calculated stresses are in some cases significantly above yield (∼1200 MPa), which indicates an erroneous result. As already discussed, it is suspected that this is the result of the differing diffraction characteristics of the <italic>γ</italic>/<italic>γ</italic>′ peak when using neutrons and X-rays in combination.</p>
<p>The axial stress balance can be compared to the cube <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> since they both generate a single global <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value for the entire sample. In both S1 and S2, the two <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> approaches gave almost identical residual stress profiles indicating the stress balance to be a good approximation of the measured <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> in this case. However, it is acknowledged that a stress balance is subject to comprehensive measurement of a valid cross section, the symmetry of the stress distribution, and the uncertainty of each data point. Given this, the stress balance is best used as a first approximation before a more thorough <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> characterisation is carried out, as was the case in this investigation.</p>
<p>The cube <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> with and without the XRD correction factor can be compared along each line scan, the differences indicate the significance of a full <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> characterisation on final residual stress calculations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713486273">Figure 6(a)</xref>, the WQ CL scan, indicates that the correction factor only alters the residual stress at the 35 mm location and by approximately −100 MPa. In addition, the correction factor result agrees more closely with the contour method data, although a 300 MPa discrepancy still exists between the two data sets at this location. It is thought that this discrepancy is due to a contour method uncertainty created during the cutting process as the wire exits the sample through a region of high stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309324713486273">19</xref></sup> This is backed up by the exceptionally high compressive stress characterised at the surface by the contour method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713486273">Figure 6(a)</xref>, which is unlikely to be realistic.</p>
<p>From the bore through to the 30 mm location, the correction factor has very little effect, indicating minimal <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation in this region. The WQ +7 mm line scan shows a trend similar to that of the CL scan, in particular that very little <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation is observed at the bore. However, at the 30 and 35 mm locations, the correction factor has an impact on the residual stress of −100 and −200 MPa, respectively. As with the CL scan, the correction factor produces stronger agreement between the contour method and neutron diffraction data, pointing to a real effect, which is being accounted for in the XRD correction factor. In the WQ sample, the rapid quench has resulted in the near surface regions cooling faster than those close to the bore; it is thought that such differential cooling has resulted in a change in alloy composition close to the surface and thus in <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324713486273">Figure 7</xref> plots the same two line scans as S1 for the 2-h aged (S2) sample. Along the CL scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324713486273">Figure 7(a)</xref>), the cube <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> with and without XRD correction shows very little difference in final residual stress value, and a change of approximately −50 to 100 MPa is visible only at the 35 mm location. Along the +7 mm, a very similar trend is observed, with the correction factor playing a role only at the 35 mm location, altering the measured residual stress from −100 to 150 MPa. As with S1, the generation of this <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation is thought to originate in the differential cooling of the quench. However, the addition of an ageing process is likely to allow further elemental diffusion to occur, which will further alter the composition and thus the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> value. Comparing the near rim locations in the CL and +7 mm scans for S1 and S2, it can be seen that the ageing process appears to have marginally reduced the impact of the XRD correction factor. This trend agrees with what should be expected since the XRD data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713486273">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324713486273">5</xref>) showed a reduced pseudostress effect in S2 compared to S1 when assuming a uniform <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>. Overall, the results indicate an ageing heat treatment that allows a partial reversal of the chemical composition gradient set-up by the quenching process, which is observed as a reduced <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation within a forging following heat treatment shows a correlation to the measurement location, in particular with proximity to the sample surface. It is believed that this is related to the elemental diffusion between phases set up by the differential cooling rates as the sample surface cools more rapidly than the interior. It was found that although a global <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> can be applied to the sample, a pseudostress will result once this <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> is used near to the surface. In the most extreme case, a pseudostress of 200 MPa was generated in a WQ sample. In comparison, the aged sample generated a maximum pseudostress of 100 MPa, with most other measurement locations being less than 50 MPa. The reduced <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation in the aged condition is thought to be the result of elemental diffusion during ageing, which works to create a more stable chemical composition of <italic>γ</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>′ setup by the quench.</p>
<p>The nickel superalloy powder calibration between the <italic>d</italic>-spacings measured using X-rays and neutrons was found to be unreliable in this alloy. The presence of titanium, which has a negative scattering factor when using neutrons, is thought to have generated an offset in the powder <italic>d</italic>-spacing when compared to the X-ray measurement. However, data from each experiment remained valid, and an alternative means of calibration between the two data sets was found using a stress-free cube as measured on the neutron beam line. An axial stress balance was also conducted, and the residual stress values obtained were compared. While in this case reasonable agreement was seen, it was acknowledged that the stress balance method of obtaining a <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> is open to a number of inaccuracies and should be treated as an estimate rather than a final characterisation.</p>
<p>The sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> measurement was employed as a position-dependent correction factor to the stress-free cube measurement of <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>. In the subsequent stress calculations, the corrected <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> differed from the stress-free cube in regions close to the surfaces of the specimen, where more rapid cooling had taken place. In both the WQ and aged samples, this improved agreement in the neutron diffraction and contour method data. In view of this trend, it is felt that during strain-measuring diffraction experiments in quenched specimens, the measurement line scans are chosen with consideration to the <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> variation. If a global <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> (i.e. single cube or far field measurement) is to be used, strain measurement locations should avoid near surface regions or accept a large uncertainty due to measured pseudostrains. If accurate bulk and near surface measurements are required, a more detailed <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> study should be carried out to account for variation across each line scan. In a <italic>γ</italic>/<italic>γ</italic>′ nickel superalloy, the sin<sup>2</sup><italic>ψ</italic> technique is ideally suited to a full <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> characterisation, providing it is used as a position-dependent correction factor to global <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>, as opposed to a direct <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> measurement technique.</p>
