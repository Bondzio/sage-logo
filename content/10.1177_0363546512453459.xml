<p><bold>Dear Editor:</bold></p>
<p>The recently published article “Calcifying Tendinitis of the Shoulder: Midterm Results After Arthroscopic Treatment” by Balke et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512453459">2</xref></sup> contains methodological and content-related issues requiring more detailed reflection and discussion. Also, in consideration of available knowledge about pathogenesis, prognosis, and results of arthroscopic treatment, some of the results and suggested conclusions need to be put into perspective.</p>
<p>The authors present a retrospective study including 62 patients (70 shoulders) who underwent arthroscopic removal of calcific deposits. Surgeries were performed from 2000 to 2007. The number of involved surgeons remains unclear. They incised the rotator cuff over the deposit and removed it with a full radius resector and curettes. This technique inevitably involves substantial damage to the rotator cuff tendon, particularly when aiming for complete deposit removal. The authors do not further specify whether and how they controlled the extent of resection. This implies a considerable performance bias (type II error), which even increases with the number of involved surgeons.</p>
<p>An aim of the study was to assess the development of rotator cuff tears. In this respect, ultrasound examinations of 48 shoulders were performed after a mean follow-up of 6 years (range, 2-13 years), corresponding to a follow-up rate of 69%. Presence of a partial rotator cuff tear was assumed when sonography showed fluid within the tendon or thinning of the tendon of more than 50%. Since the described technique of calcific deposit removal causes damage to the rotator cuff tendon, it appears more than likely that such lesions were falsely rated as degenerative rotator cuff tears at follow-up. This methodological problem could have been adequately addressed by comparison with ultrasound examinations obtained in the early postoperative phase shortly after remission of postoperative artifacts.</p>
<p>Additional subacromial decompression was performed in 44 of 70 shoulders (63%) with type II and III acromion shapes according to Bigliani, which showed fraying of the coracoacromial ligament or erosions of the undersurface of the acromion. The subitem pain of the Constant score was significantly better in the decompression group (11.4 points compared with 12.9 points; <italic>P</italic> = .048). The authors concluded that subacromial decompression reduces postoperative pain. This conclusion needs to be questioned for several reasons. Most importantly, evaluation of the value of additional acromioplasty in arthroscopic treatment of calcifying tendinitis requires a prospective, randomized, controlled study design. Seil et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512453459">7</xref></sup> incised the rotator cuff over the deposit and then expressed the calcific deposit with blunt instruments. Subacromial decompression was indicated if signs of mechanical irritation were apparent on the undersurface of the acromion or if the calcific deposit could not be completely removed without creating major damage to the tendon. This was only the case in 6 of 58 (10.3%) patients. The mean Constant score was 90.9 points at 24-month follow-up. Others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512453459">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512453459">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512453459">5</xref></sup> also reported excellent clinical outcomes in approximately 90% of their cases regardless of additional subacromial decompression. Calcific deposits with medial localization related to the acromion are more likely to require surgery because of chronic symptomatic nonoutlet impingement.<sup>6</sup> All this supports the estimation that subacromial decompression does not represent a causative treatment of symptomatic rotator cuff calcifications.</p>
<p>Balke et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512453459">2</xref></sup> do not adequately question that the reported clinical outcome (mean Constant score, 76.2 points) was considerably inferior compared with that found in the literature.<sup>1,3-5,7</sup> The operative technique might have been a possible cause, as sharp excision of a calcific deposit inevitably results in a rotator cuff lesion. This is particularly true for large, solid deposits. However, the authors neither specified sizes nor consistencies of the surgically addressed deposits. At follow-up, relevant partial rotator cuff tears were sonographically detected in 11 of 48 (23%) of the operated shoulders and in only 3 of 48 (6%) of the contralateral shoulders. On the contrary, Seil et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512453459">7</xref></sup> found no relevant partial rotator cuff tears after blunt calcific deposit removal. It is a considerable drawback that the relevance of residual calcifications has been discounted. The wide range of follow-up (2-13 years) involves a potential selection bias (type I error) because some of the residual calcifications might have resolved in the interim while others might have not. The study should have reported on surgical complications.</p>

<p><bold>Authors’ Response:</bold></p>
<p>First of all we would like to thank Dr Maier and colleagues for their comments and take the opportunity to respond to the issues that were raised.</p>
<p>As pointed out, the number of involved surgeons was not mentioned in our manuscript. Over the 7-year period all procedures were performed by 3 fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons. Another issue that was raised concerned the surgical technique of calcium removal that was described in our manuscript. Our description might have been misleading to some degree. We did not insert the full radius resector into the tendon in all cases. Similar to Seil et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512453459">5</xref></sup> the shaver was only inserted into the defect if blunt expression did not lead to sufficient removal of the deposit. The primary goal was not complete calcium removal but, rather, opening of the deposit and removal as much calcium as possible without causing significant damage to the tendon. Therefore we did not control for complete removal by intraoperative fluoroscopy. Because of the number of surgeons, a performance bias cannot be completely ruled out. Concerning the correlation of residual calcifications on radiographs with the clinical results the literature presents contrary results. As we did not perform postoperative radiographs on a regular basis, we cannot comment on this point based on our data. Porcellini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512453459">4</xref></sup> published that their high Constant scores were inversely related to the number and size of residual calcium deposits. Ark et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512453459">1</xref></sup> published that 12 of 14 patients with persistent calcium on radiographs had significant pain relief. Seil et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512453459">5</xref></sup> obtained complete or nearly complete removal of the calcium in only 44% of patients, which did not alter the excellent functional results. We agree that the aim of arthroscopy is to remove the calcific deposit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512453459">3</xref></sup> but a complete removal does not seem to be absolutely necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512453459">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512453459">5</xref></sup> The reproducible clinical benefit is most likely due to the reduction of the intratendinous pressure as well as the improvement of the mechanical impingement.</p>
<p>Of course “comparison with ultrasound examinations obtained in the early postoperative phase shortly after remission of postoperative artifacts” would have been interesting. In our experience, the value of ultrasound in the early postoperative period for evaluating the integrity of the rotator cuff is often limited. Therefore it is not part of our clinical routine and thus was not available in this retrospective study.</p>
<p>The role of additional subacromial decompression remains controversial and is extensively discussed in our paper. The Constant score value of 76.2 points reflects our honest results at midterm follow-up. There is no simple explanation for the discrepancy with the results by others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512453459">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512453459">5</xref></sup> whose excellent postoperative results for the Constant score were superior to our healthy control group (88.8 points). However, we did not find a correlation between the structural integrity of the rotator cuff and the clinical outcome in our patients. We did not have any postoperative complications.</p>
<p>We hope that this response helps to clarify the questions raised by Dr Maier and his colleagues.</p>
