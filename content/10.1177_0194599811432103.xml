<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To evaluate the inner ear effects of canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) with regard to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and reported tinnitus and dizziness-related disability.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Tertiary care academic medical center.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Prospective study of 86 patients treated by CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM with or without cholesteatoma. Standard patient workup included preoperative audiogram and completion of 2 surveys: Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). Patients underwent repeat audiogram, DHI, and THI surveys at 4 to 6 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative data were analyzed.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. No significant SNHL occurred after CWD mastoidectomy. Thirteen patients (13/34 [38%]) had DHI improvement greater than 18 points, indicating a significant improvement in dizziness-related disability. Three patients developed new-onset postoperative dizziness complaints. Twenty patients (20/43 [46.5%]) had THI improvement greater than 7 points, indicating a significant improvement in tinnitus-related disability. Five patients developed new-onset postoperative tinnitus complaints. The odds ratio for improving DHI and THI scores after surgery was 6.6 (1.8 to 25.0) and 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.45% to 12.2%), respectively.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. In this study, CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of COM did not cause significant SNHL. In addition, using the DHI and THI measures, patient-perceived disability from dizziness and tinnitus, respectively, was shown to decrease after mastoid surgery.</p>

<p>Exposure to noise is known to cause temporary and permanent auditory threshold shifts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811432103">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432103">2</xref></sup> This hearing loss may occur as a result of single or multiple exposures to high levels of acoustic energy (acoustic trauma) or result out of lower levels of noise exposure over prolonged periods of time (noise-induced hearing loss). Experimental data in both humans and animals have shown that exposure to noise can result in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811432103">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811432103">3</xref></sup> and certainly one of the most serious complications of otologic surgery is SNHL. SNHL has been reported in 1.2% to 4.5% of patients undergoing chronic ear operations, with the otologic drill being implicated as one possible source.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811432103">4</xref></sup> There are 3 mechanisms that could account for this observed SNHL: (1) direct contact with the ossicles that cause excessive vibration of the stapes footplate, (2) direct injury to the membranous labyrinth, and (3) acoustic injury caused by high levels of drill noise.</p>
<p>Various studies have shown that mastoid drilling can produce sound pressure levels exceeding 100 dB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811432103">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811432103">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811432103">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, noise levels are shown to be higher with larger diameter burrs and with cutting rather than diamond burrs. Although temporary threshold shifts have been observed during drilling in both animal and human studies, it is unclear whether the noise levels can lead to significant permanent SNHL unless the ossicular chain is traumatized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432103">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811432103">7</xref></sup> Others have shown no temporary threshold shift after several hours of mastoid drilling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811432103">8</xref></sup> The amount of energy transmitted to the cochlea and the resultant threshold shift depend largely on the noise levels produced and the duration of exposure, and most authors will agree that permanent shifts occur with extended exposure to high levels of drill noise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432103">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811432103">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tinnitus is closely related to hearing loss, and those patients with chronic otitis media (COM) undergoing mastoid drilling are variably affected by mixed hearing loss with or without tinnitus. Inner ear disturbance can cause postoperative dizziness or imbalance. Because of the paucity of literature concerning the inner ear effects of mastoid surgery, and the controversy that still exists with respect to the association between mastoid drilling and SNHL, we sought to prospectively investigate the outcome with regard to sensorineural hearing and patient-reported symptoms of dizziness and tinnitus for patients undergoing canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599811432103" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Following approval by the Loyola University Medical Center Institutional Review Board for Human Research, we prospectively investigated the inner ear effects of CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM with or without cholesteatoma in 125 consecutive patients who underwent either primary or revision surgery by the senior author (J.P.L.). Patients undergoing ossiculoplasty were excluded from analysis because of the increased possibility of iatrogenic inner ear injury due to ossicular chain manipulation. Audiograms and disability-related surveys, current within 6 months of the surgical procedure, were obtained from all patients as part of a standard preoperative workup. Surveys consisted of the standardized Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The THI and DHI are separate 25-item questionnaires, designed to quantify on a 100-point scale, with 100 corresponding to the worst perceived symptoms, patient self-perceived disability or handicap caused by symptoms of tinnitus or dizziness, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811432103">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432103">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Descriptive analysis of intraoperative variables such as overall surgical procedure time and duration of drilling, as well as the sizes and types of burrs used, was recorded. In all cases, Anspach Xmax pneumatic continuous 120-psi drill instruments (Anspach, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida) were used with an average drill speed of 80,000 rpm. At 4 to 6 months postprocedure, patients underwent a repeat audiogram and THI and DHI surveys were readministered. Only those patients with complete data (n = 86) were included in our statistical analysis. Primary outcomes measured were preoperative and postoperative audiograms at frequencies of 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz. Secondary outcomes measured were preoperative and postoperative DHI and THI scores. Subgroup analysis of primary and revision surgical patients was also conducted to assess any differences in those patients who underwent repeated surgical drilling (≥2). A <italic>P</italic> value less than or equal to .05 was selected as significant. Paired <italic>t</italic> test and the McNemer test were used in testing for group differences. Statistics 6.0 from Statsoft (Tulsa, Oklahoma) was used for all tests.</p>

<p>For primary and revision surgery, 15 of 41 patients (37%) and 19 of 45 patients (42%) had a positive preoperative DHI score, respectively. Postoperatively, DHI scores remained positive in 10 of 41 patients (24%) after primary surgery and in 14 of 45 patients (31%) after revision surgery. Statistically, there was no significant difference between primary and revision surgery DHI scores either before or after surgery.</p>
<p>Further analysis was performed excluding those patients with a preoperative and postoperative DHI = 0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599811432103"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). Analyzing 37 patients who either developed new-onset, worsened, or improved DHI score, the average DHI score (±SD) decreased by 11 ± 17 (<italic>P</italic> = .005, paired <italic>t</italic> test). Postoperatively, analyzing 16 primary surgical patients who either developed new-onset, worsened, or improved DHI scores, the average DHI score (±SD) decreased by 15 ± 29 (paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> = .007). Analyzing 21 revision surgical patients who either developed new-onset, worsened, or improved postoperative DHI scores, the average DHI score (±SD) decreased by 8 ± 15 (paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> = .032).</p>
<p>Previous psychometric analysis suggests that test-retest reliability is high for the DHI survey with a change of 18 points or greater required to achieve a clinically significant change in patient-perceived disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432103">11</xref></sup> Of 34 patients with preoperative dizziness complaints, 13 (38%) reported a postoperative improvement of greater than or equal to 18 points in DHI score.</p>

<p>For the entire cohort, the proportion of patients with a positive THI score was significantly reduced from 50% preoperatively (43/86; 95% CI, 39% to 61%) to a postoperative proportion of 30% (26/86; 95% CI, 21% to 41%, <italic>P</italic> = .001; McNemer test). For the 43 patients with positive preoperative THI scores, 21 patients, or 49% (33.6% to 64.3%), remained with some degree of postoperative tinnitus-related complaints, giving an improvement rate of 51% (THI = 0). For the 43 patients without preoperative tinnitus-related complaints (THI = 0), 5, or 11.6% (95% CI, 4.4% to 25.9%), developed new-onset postoperative tinnitus complaints. The odds ratio for developing a new-onset positive THI score after surgery is 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09% to 0.60%). The odds ratio for a postoperative THI score improving to 0 relative to developing new-onset THI complaints is 4.2 (95% CI, 1.45% to 12.2%).</p>
<p>Further analysis was performed excluding those patients with a preoperative and postoperative THI = 0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0194599811432103"><bold>Table 6</bold></xref>). Analyzing 45 patients who either developed new-onset, worsened, or improved THI scores, the average THI score (±SD) decreased by 10 ± 27 (paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> = .02). Analyzing 20 primary surgery patients who either developed new-onset, worsened, or improved THI scores, the average postoperative THI score (±SD) decreased by 15 ± 27 (paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> = .02). In 25 patients undergoing revision surgery who either developed new-onset, worsened, or improved tinnitus, the average THI score (±SD) decreased by 6 ± 27 (paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).

<p>Previous and recent psychometric analysis suggests that test-retest reliability is high for the THI survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811432103">13</xref></sup> Based on a recently published statistical analysis of the THI survey, clinically significant improvement was defined as an improvement of 7 points, and a “super response” was defined as improvement of at least 17 points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811432103">14</xref></sup> Of 43 patients with preoperative tinnitus complaints, 20 or 46.5% of patients achieved a significant improvement in tinnitus score of at least 7 points, and 16 or 37% achieved a super response with an improvement of 17 points or greater.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients with COM are variably prone to SNHL and tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811432103">15</xref></sup> Paparella and Brady<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811432103">15</xref></sup> theorized that changes in the biochemical gradient at the semi-permeable round window membrane allowed for cochlear damage in the setting of inflammatory mastoid disease. Some patients affected with COM may also be bothered by dizziness, vertigo, or a sense of imbalance. The primary role of mastoidectomy is to provide a safe, dry ear, with secondary goals of preservation and/or improvement in hearing thresholds. Mastoid surgery in the eradication of COM and cholesteatoma is not traditionally meant to address tinnitus or dizziness complaints, although some patients will report an improvement in these symptoms after surgery with the resolution of chronic inflammation. This study set out to prospectively investigate sensorineural hearing and patient-reported symptoms of dizziness and tinnitus after CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM.</p>
<p>Patients in this series underwent CWD mastoidectomy for either extensive cholesteatoma disease or had failed a previous canal wall up (CWU) mastoid procedure. The mastoid cavity was saucerized widely, the facial ridge was lowered, and a wide meatoplasty was performed in all patients. A full complement of burrs was used in most patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811432103"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Ossicular contact with a high-speed burr can induce SNHL, although the risk does appear to be somewhat dependent on the size of burr and/or magnitude of manipulation. Paparella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811432103">16</xref></sup> demonstrated in cats that placing a 4-mm cutting burr against the body of the incus resulted in injury to the organ of Corti, whereas a 0.5-mm cutting burr placed directly on the long process of the incus failed to produce cochlear injury. Surgery for cholesteatoma also carries the risk of damage to the membranous labyrinth, which can occur either by direct drilling trauma or in the dissection of matrix from a labyrinthine fistulae. No labyrinthine fistulae were encountered in this series.</p>
<p>SNHL as a result of drill acoustic trauma is also reported. Average surgical and drill time in our series was 74 and 31 minutes, respectively. This drill time is comparable to previously reported series, and although controversial, it appears sufficient to produce measured threshold shifts. Using distortion product otoacoustic emissions, Da Cruz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811432103">17</xref></sup> reported on reversible outer hair cell dysfunction in the contralateral ear in patients undergoing mastoid drilling for 90 minutes to several hours. Kylen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811432103">7</xref></sup> using electrocochleography, studied 14 patients undergoing ear surgery with drilling times ranging from 5 to 90 minutes. Immediate (within 1 hour) postoperative studies demonstrated significant increases in postoperative thresholds at 2, 4, and 8 kHz in 9 of these patients. In addition, Palva and Sorri<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432103">2</xref></sup> found temporary and permanent SNHL in high-frequency ranges in a minority of operated patients and found a positive correlation between hearing loss and operative time. Alternatively, Urquhart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811432103">8</xref></sup> do not give the exact drill time but reported overall surgical time to be 2 to 3 hours in most patients and failed to show any significant threshold shifts following mastoid surgery. Spencer and Reid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811432103">18</xref></sup> also found no evidence of postoperative sensorineural threshold shift, although their patients underwent a limited mastoidectomy lasting an average of 4 minutes and 47 seconds.</p>
<p>It does seem that the literature is divided on the associated effects of drill time, burr usage, and postoperative SNHL. Despite the fact that the duration of our procedures and choice of burr were comparable to previous studies that demonstrated threshold shifts, our 4- to 6-month postoperative testing did not produce significant auditory threshold shifts. Short-term or temporary threshold shifts were not measured in our study.</p>
<p>The DHI is a 25-item questionnaire designed to measure the self-perceived disability or handicap caused by symptoms of dizziness or imbalance. The maximum total score (indicating maximum handicap) is 100, with DHI values in the normal population presumed to be zero. On average, patients will have an improved DHI score after surgery. However, as stated previously, a change of 18 points or greater is required to achieve significant change in patient-perceived disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432103">11</xref></sup> In this study, 13 of 34 patients, or 38%, achieved improvement by 18 points or greater in DHI score. Although the odds ratio favors an improved DHI score after surgery, our study showed that a few patients (n = 3) developed new-onset dizziness complaints after surgery.</p>
<p>The THI is a 25-item questionnaire designed to measure the self-perceived disability or handicap caused by symptoms of tinnitus. The maximum total score (indicating maximum handicap) is 100, with THI values in the normal population presumed to be zero. The THI is designed to probe patients’ functional and emotional reactions to tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811432103">10</xref></sup> It is reportedly not affected by age, gender, or hearing loss and is meant to serve as a companion to the DHI in measuring patients’ self-reported functional status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811432103">11</xref></sup> In this cohort (n = 86), one-half of patients (n = 43) had a positive preoperative THI score and one-half (n = 43) had a preoperative THI = 0. The odds ratio favors an improved THI score after surgery, although 5 patients did develop new-onset tinnitus-related complaints. Overall, THI scores improved after surgery, and in fact, 22 of 43 patients, or 51%, with a positive preoperative THI score improved to a postoperative THI = 0. In a recent study, the THI score improvement necessary to be considered significant was 7 points, and the improvement necessary to be considered a super response was 17 points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811432103">14</xref></sup> This standard was lower than previously published reports, which required a 20-point improvement to be considered significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811432103">13</xref></sup> Using criteria established by Zeman et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811432103">14</xref></sup> 20 of 43 (46.5%) of those with preoperative tinnitus complaints had significant improvement in tinnitus disability based on a 7-point or greater improvement in THI score. Moreover, 16 of the 43 patients (37%) showed a super response with an improvement of 17 points or greater.</p>
<p>The psychological impact of tinnitus must be considered as previously addressed by Danish and Italian adaptations of the THI survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811432103">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811432103">20</xref></sup> These studies have independently shown that significant correlations exist between THI and psychological distress and further recommend that psychiatric referral or counseling should be considered in select patients. Thus, tinnitus-related complaints and disability appear improved after CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM, although the mechanisms of improvement are likely multifactorial.</p>
<p>This study is limited to the evaluation of patients undergoing mastoid surgery without ossiculoplasty in an attempt to avoid confounding results with ossicular trauma-induced inner ear injury. Admittedly, many patients undergoing cholesteatoma surgery may also require a variable level of ossicular manipulation with or without ossiculoplasty, and so our study group only partially represents the general population of chronic ear patients. Further studies evaluating mastoid surgery with ossiculoplasty would contribute to our understanding of the inner ear effects of otologic procedures.</p>
<p>This prospective study demonstrates that a significant number of patients affected by COM are also affected by complaints of dizziness and tinnitus. More than one-third of patients achieved significant improvement in their symptoms after CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty with a low risk of sensorineural hearing loss.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of COM did not cause significant SNHL. In addition, using the DHI and THI, patient-perceived disability from dizziness and tinnitus, respectively, was shown to decrease after mastoid surgery.</p>
