<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Theory of Reinvestment proposes that a variety of demands or contingencies, such as anxiety, altered constraints in the environment or physical disabilities, can evoke conscious control of movements that are best controlled automatically, potentially resulting in disrupted performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512448381">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512448381">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In early work, a psychometric tool, the Reinvestment Scale was developed to assess the propensity for reinvestment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512448381">2</xref></sup> Studies using the Reinvestment Scale showed that, in healthy movement populations, high scores on the Reinvestment Scale tended to be associated with an increased likelihood of disrupted performance under psychological pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512448381">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512448381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512448381"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512448381">5</xref></sup> More recently a Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale has been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512448381">6</xref></sup> Studies in the rehabilitation context suggest that a high propensity for movement-specific reinvestment is associated with fall incidence in elderly people,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512448381">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512448381">8</xref></sup> duration of Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512448381">9</xref></sup> and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512448381">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wong et al. found that elderly people with a history of falling scored significantly higher on the scale than elderly non-fallers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512448381">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512448381">8</xref></sup> and displayed greater awareness of their movements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512448381">8</xref></sup> In a cross-sectional study, Masters et al. found that high scores on both the Reinvestment Scale and the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale were associated with longer duration of Parkinson’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512448381">9</xref></sup> Unlike the Reinvestment Scale, the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale has two factors, one related specifically to conscious control of movements (conscious motor processing) and one related to self-consciousness about moving (movement self-consciousness).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512448381">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512448381">6</xref></sup> Although scores on both factors were significantly higher in people with Parkinson’s disease than in age-matched controls, regression analysis revealed that only conscious motor processing made a unique contribution to duration of Parkinson’s disease, explaining almost 26% of the relationship with duration of disease.Conscious involvement in movements appears to be high post stroke, as people struggle to recover their movement integrity or just move safely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512448381">11</xref></sup> Orrell et al. found an association between score on the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale, functional impairment and time spent in rehabilitation post stroke, suggesting that a high propensity to consciously control movements might be disadvantageous in the rehabilitation process, at least in some stroke patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512448381">10</xref></sup> The Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale might potentially be a quick and easy tool for identifying such patients.</p>
<p>Here we report an initial study in which we translated the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale for use in Dutch-speaking people with stroke and investigated the reliability of the translated version. Further, we examined scores on the two factors that contribute to the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale – ‘conscious motor processing’ and ‘movement self-consciousness’ – and compared them with findings of an earlier study of English people with stroke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512448381" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In a preliminary step, the English version of the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale was translated into Dutch. Translation, back-translation and comparison of the source version with the final version were carried out in accordance with stages 1–3 of the guidelines for translation proposed by Guillemin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512448381">12</xref></sup> Each factor of the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale comprises five statements, such as ‘I try to think about my movements when I carry them out’ (conscious motor processing) and ‘I am concerned about what people think about me when I am moving’ (movement self-consciousness). In previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512448381">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512448381">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512448381">8</xref></sup> the statements have been assessed with a Likert-style response or with a simple binary response (yes/ no). In keeping with the single previous study of movement-specific reinvestment in stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512448381">6</xref></sup> we chose to use a binary response. A ‘yes’ response represents a score of 1, resulting in a maximum score of 5 for each of the two factors (10 in total) and a minimum score of zero. Higher scores are associated with a greater propensity for reinvestment. Test–retest reliability has been shown to be high for both factors and the internal reliability was acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512448381">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A convenience sample of 120 adult, community-dwelling patients with stroke in the chronic phase of recovery (stroke &gt;1 year) was selected from the electronic database at Adelante, a local rehabilitation centre. All patients had finished their rehabilitation treatment. Broad inclusion criteria were employed so that people with various levels of physical impairment would potentially participate. Patients were not approached if severe additional orthopaedic, neurological or cognitive impairments prior to stroke had been reported in the medical file, or if severe cognitive or communication problems had been described. The local medical ethics committee (University Hospital Maastricht) approved the study protocol and all participants gave informed consent.</p>
<p>Participants received an information letter from their rehabilitation consultant inviting them to participate in the study. A stamped return-envelope, an informed consent form and a copy of the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale, together with instructions on how to complete the scale, were included (T1). People with stroke were asked to report whether they had completed the scale on their own or with assistance. They were asked to return the consent form and the questionnaires within five days of receipt. Participants who did not respond to the first invitation received a reminder after two weeks. Participants who responded, and agreed to continue participating, received a second letter after two weeks (T2), which contained the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale and, in addition, the Rivermead Mobility Index, which was included to assess the mobility level of the participant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512448381">13</xref></sup> The Rivermead Mobility Index assesses 14 yes or no activities ranging from ‘turning over in bed’ to ‘running’ and a single observed item (‘standing without any aid’). This item was rephrased as a 15th question (‘Are you able to stand for 10 seconds without any aid?’). Higher scores reflect better mobility. A Dutch version was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512448381">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following demographics were extracted from the medical files: gender, age, time post stroke, localization of the stroke and comorbidities. Demographic variables are summarized using means and standard deviations for continuous data and absolute numbers with percentages for categorical variables.</p>
<p>In accord with recently published guidelines, reliability was investigated in terms of test– retest reliability and measurement error.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512448381">14</xref></sup> To evaluate test–retest reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, type A,1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512448381">15</xref></sup>) were computed for the factor scores and the summed factor scores of the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale using a two-way random model for the analysis of variance including systematic errors. It seems that this type of ICC is equivalent to a weighted kappa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512448381">16</xref></sup> (Note: Considering the binary response format of the scale as providing interval-level scores has the advantage that an indication of measurement error can be provided, which should of course be interpreted with caution.) Substantial reliability can be assumed if the intraclass coefficient is at least 0.70.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512448381">17</xref></sup> To investigate measurement error, the Bland–Altman plot was used. Differences between the paired measurements were plotted against their mean and 95% limits of agreement were computed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512448381">18</xref></sup> Given the limited number of items of the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale, only a Bland–Altman plot for the total scale is presented.Differences between scores on the two factors of the Scale- Consicous Motor Processing and Movement Self-Consciousness- were investigated using Wilcoxon’s signed rank test.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Forty-five people with stroke agreed to participate and 44 completed the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale on both occasions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512448381">Table 1</xref>). Five participants received reading or writing assistance from a family member. Mean scores for the Conscious Motor Processing factor were 2.51 (SD = 1.58) and 2.41 (SD = 1.54) at T1 and T2, respectively. Mean scores for the movement self-consciousness factor were 1.53 (SD = 1.58) and 1.32 (SD = 1.58) at T1 and T2, respectively. Wilcoxon’s signed rank test showed that for both T1 and T2, scores for conscious motor processing were significantly higher than scores for movement self-consciousness (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Reliability in terms of test–retest was acceptable for total score on the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale and for both factors separately. Based on the limits of agreement, a change in score of at least 3 points on separate measurement occasions would suggest a change beyond measurement error. On a scale ranging in score from 0 to 10 this seems considerable and future studies should investigate whether this is a clinically relevant change.</p>
<p>There was a chance of selection bias in this study as we only recruited people who had received intensive rehabilitation in a specialized centre. The high non-response rate from this specific subpopulation might explain why participants were generally young with low mobility disability, as shown by moderately high scores on the Rivermead Mobility Index. (Note: One item of the Rivermead Mobility Index was reworded as a question. This is unlikely to undermine interpretation of the scores given that the remaining items of the index are also formulated as questions.) They were the people most prepared to participate in the study. Consequently, generalization of the results to the entire stroke population is not recommended without further evidence. The advantage of the selected research population was, however, that participants were most likely to be in a stable state, which is crucial for a test–retest design.</p>
<p>The Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale has also been administered using a Likert scale in populations other than stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512448381">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512448381">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512448381"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512448381">9</xref></sup> We employed a binary response in order to retain the possibility for comparison of our findings (a population of Dutch stroke patients) with the findings of Orrell et al. (a population of British stroke patients).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512448381">10</xref></sup> Orrell et al. found that people with stroke scored significantly higher on both factors of the English Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale than age-matched controls, suggesting that people with stroke try harder to consciously control their movements and are more self-conscious about their movements. The scores for our Dutch stroke participants are similar to those reported by Orrell et al., although slightly lower for both factors, possibly reflecting their relative youth compared to participants in the Orrell et al. study (mean age 61.31 ± 5.54 versus 66.10 ± 10.94, respectively). Importantly, the scores display the same trend as found by Orrell et al., with scores for conscious motor processing significantly higher than scores for movement self-consciousness.</p>
<p>The propensity for movement-specific reinvestment by stroke patients may have consequences for the selection of motor (re)learning strategies during rehabilitation. It has been proposed that for people with a high propensity for reinvestment implicit forms of motor learning may be a preferred strategy, as they prevent the accrual of conscious movement knowledge that is easily reinvested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512448381">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512448381">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512448381">20</xref></sup> While therapists should rely on their experience and the characteristics of the tasks to be learned when deciding upon a rehabilitation strategy, we speculate that the Dutch Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale potentially can aid decision-making by indicating which patients are likely to be most susceptible to reinvestment.</p>
<p>First, further research is required to establish other psychometric properties of the Dutch Scale, including its validity, and to assess whether the findings generalize to different stroke populations, who may be less mobile or higher in age.</p>
