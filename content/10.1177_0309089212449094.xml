<p>Debates about Ezek. 28.1–19 have long centered on textual difficulties and cryptic mythological language. While these issues remain intractable, the overall structure and rhetorical strategy of the oracles concerning Tyre's ruler can be perceived by analyzing Ezek. 26.1–28.19 as a whole. Specifically, the larger passage evinces a repeated pattern of judgment oracle followed by funeral dirge. The dirges, which contain elements of parody, proleptically eulogize Tyre and its ruler before they have perished. In this way, they communicate the irreversibility of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s judgments against Tyre. Such a study suggests that rhetorical considerations ought to be considered when examining the redactional artistry of larger literary units.</p>

<p>Ezekiel's oracles against the ruler of Tyre in Ezek. 28.1–19 are some of the most difficult and obscure passages in the book of Ezekiel. The Hebrew text contains cryptic vocabulary and at points appears to be corrupt. Despite enormous scholarly interest in this passage, a proper translation is far from certain. Alfred Bertholet argues that ‘the text is in such disarray’ that scholars should not attempt to reconstruct it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212449094">1</xref></sup> In addition to the textual difficulties, the prophet uses enigmatic mythological references which to date have not been adequately deciphered. Ezekiel's imagery is simply lost on the modern commentator.</p>
<p>Beyond the difficulties intrinsic to the Hebrew text and its uncertain mythological background exist questions about textual unity. Discussing alleged additions to Ezek. 28.1–19, Robert Wilson observes, ‘The oracles … do not seem to be unified in form or content’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089212449094">2</xref></sup> In the first oracle, for example, most scholars agree that vv. 3–5 are a late intrusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212449094">3</xref></sup> In the second, various scholars excise references to wisdom in vv. 12 and 17, the list of stones in v. 13, references to trade as the source of the ruler's sin in vv. 16 and 18a, or mention of the king profaning his sanctuaries and of divine judgment by fire in v. 18.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212449094">4</xref></sup> No consensus exists, however, on which of these suspect passages are secondary and which original.</p>
<p>Pursuing questions about the editorial history and redactional integrity of Ezekiel 28 is hampered by these textual difficulties and by the cryptic and allusive mythological language. In this article, I will not resolve these thorny interpretive issues. Instead, I will show that by zooming out and refocusing on Ezek. 26.1–28.19 the structure of the whole section regarding Tyre becomes rhetorically intelligible. Specifically, I argue that the basic structure of the Tyre material is built upon a repeated pattern of judgment oracle followed by funeral dirge, and that this structure communicates the irreversibility of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s judgments against Tyre and its ruler.</p>
<sec id="section1-0309089212449094">
<title>1. Literary Structure in Ezekiel 26–28</title>
<p>This basic pattern may not be immediately obvious. A single date formula (Ezek. 26.1) governs Ezek. 26.1–28.19 as a whole, thus no internal chronological principle guides the organization of the material concerning Tyre. Instead, the individual oracles share several verbal and thematic features—most obviously a focus on Tyre and its ruler. Beyond these features, several structuring devices are at work in the Tyre material, and these sometimes appear to work at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most commented-upon structuring device is the threefold תוהלב refrain in Ezek. 26.21; 27.36b; and 28.19b, appearing at the end of chs. 26 and 27, and in ch. 28 at the end of the Tyre material and before the Sidon material. Based on the three occurrences of the refrain, Zimmerli refers to Ezekiel's ‘three oracles against Tyre and its princes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212449094">5</xref></sup> Usually considered part of the redactional framework, the refrain imposes a structure on the Tyre material in several ways. First, it brackets these passages from what comes before and after, thus packaging them as a unity. Second, it suggests that 28.1–10 and 28.11–19 ought to be read together, as a single literary unit. (I shall return to this point shortly.) Third, the refrain divides the Tyre material into three parts. By doing so, the refrain imposes a threefold scheme on the Tyre passages and thereby masks an underlying rhetorical structure, one that can be discerned by attending to other structuring devices.</p>
<p>The first clue to the underlying rhetorical structure is a second structuring device that competes with the threefold refrain. The revelation-event formula רמאל ילא הוהי־רבו היה appears not three times but four in the Tyre passages, in Ezek. 26.1; 27.1; 28.1; and 28.11. This suggests a four-part division of the Tyre material, rather than a three-part division.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089212449094">6</xref></sup> This fourfold division, at least provisionally, points to a structure in which a judgment oracle against Tyre in ch. 26 is followed by a funeral dirge over Tyre in ch. 27, and a judgment oracle against Tyre's ruler in 28.1–10 is followed by a dirge over Tyre's ruler in 28.11–19.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212449094">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A third structuring device is the declaration formula הןהי ינובםאנ in Ezek. 26.5, 14, 21; and 28.10. The declaration formula complements the fourfold division indicated by the revelation-event formula, as it closes each of the judgment oracles (26.21 and 28.10). The extended judgment oracle in ch. 26 is, not surprisingly, punctuated by two further occurrences of הןהי ינוא םאנ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212449094">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>If we look more closely at the threefold תוהלב refrain, we will note that the occurrence in Ezek. 26.21 differs significantly from the other two:</p>

</table>
</table-wrap>
<p>The latter two examples are identical, except for the 2fs and 2ms forms, as demanded by the context. The form of the first occurrence has been altered and greatly expanded, in order to fit a very different context, the end of a judgment oracle rather than the end of a dirge. Note, too, that the expanded תוהלב refrain in Ezek. 26.21 has been tucked in front of the declaration formula הבהי ינךא םאנ which we would expect to appear at the end of a judgment oracle.</p>
<p>All of this makes the presence of the תוהלב refrain at the end of ch. 26 suspect. Why a redactor inserted a variant of the תוהלב refrain here remains a mystery. Perhaps the refrain was originally associated with the funeral dirge—as in chs. 27 and 28 and as befits the meaning of the refrain—and the presence of the dirge over Tyre by the princes of the sea in 26.16–18 attracted its occurrence here in variant form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212449094">9</xref></sup> If it was attracted by the princes' dirge, it then seems to have been inserted right before an existing הבהי ינךא םאנ as a conclusion to the judgment oracle. In any case, we should ignore this instance of the תוהלב refrain in Ezek. 26.21 as a structuring device, since it masks the fourfold division which the other structural indicators highlight.</p>
<p>If I am correct in this intuition, then we are left with a two-fold תוהלב refrain which divides the Tyre material into two parts: Ezek. 26.1–27.36 and 28.1–19. The revelation-event formula corresponds with this division, and further indicates the presence of four literary units:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The overall ABAB pattern is obvious, where chs. 26–27 are directed against Tyre itself, and ch. 28 is directed against the ruler of Tyre. Zimmerli seems to be aware of this design: 'Conscious arranging can be seen here in the fact that the proclamation of judgment against Tyre in ch. 26 is followed by the הניק (lament) in ch. 27 and that the same sequence can be seen in 28.1–19 in its two sections vv. 1–10 and vv. 11–19, which are directed against the princes of Tyre'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212449094">10</xref></sup> Nevertheless, he still treats Ezekiel 26–28 as three oracles, on the basis of a redactor's insertion of the threefold תוהלב refrain.</p>
<p>Owing perhaps to the complex literary history of the book, the Tyre material is less tidy than a simple ABAB pattern might suggest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212449094">11</xref></sup> For example, Ezekiel 26–27 is much longer than Ezek. 28.1–19. Additionally, the judgment oracle of ch. 26 includes a miniature funeral dirge in vv. 16–18. I would note, however, that this dirge is spoken not by Ezekiel, but by the princes of the sea—just as the miniature dirge-within-a-dirge in 27.28–36 is spoken by the seafarers—and forms part of the judgment oracle itself. That the judgment oracle and dirge in ch. 28 address the prince of Tyre and the king of Tyre, respectively, also points to a lack of structural tidiness. Certainly the difference in subjects points to separate origins for these units. Yet, as I will show below, the two passages share numerous verbal and thematic features that bind them together. While the ABAB symmetry of Ezek. 26.1–28.19 is not perfect, the overall structure is sufficiently clear to move forward with an exploration of the rhetorical significance of the judgment oracle plus funeral dirge pattern in the redacted form of the passage, even if the mythological allusions and textual problems cannot all be explained.</p>

<title>2. Ezekiel 26.1–21 and 28.1–10: Judgment Oracles over Tyre and Its Ruler</title>
<p>Ezekiel 26.1–21 and 28.1–10 both take the form of judgment oracles. Each oracle in its own way, however, evinces complexity.</p>

<sec id="section3-0309089212449094">
<title>A Judgment Oracle over Tyre</title>
<p>The narrative formula for receiving Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s word (v. 1) and the concluding refrain הבהי ינךא םאנ at the end of the expanded תוהלב refrain (v. 21) delineate the literary boundaries of Ezek. 26.1–21. The judgment oracle against Tyre adheres closely to the form of a judgment oracle against a people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212449094">12</xref></sup> The basic accusation—Tyre's celebration over the demise of Jerusalem—is introduced by רשב ןעי (v. 2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212449094">13</xref></sup> The announcement of judgment is introduced by ןכל, and as expected the messenger formula immediately precedes the sentence (v. 3): Tyre's destruction at the hand of foreign nations. The rest of the passage amounts to an expansion on this sentence.</p>
<p>Most commentators agree that the oracle contains four parts: vv. 2–6, 7–14, 15–18, and 19–21.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212449094">14</xref></sup> These divisions are mostly indicated by formal features, and the whole likely results from an organic process of growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212449094">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ezekiel 26.2–6 suggests that unspecified nations will destroy Tyre. The segment closely resembles the brief oracles against foreign nations in Ezekiel 25 and may have been modeled on them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212449094">16</xref></sup> The formulae ינא יכיתרבך הוהי and הוהי ינךא םאנ in v. 5b (cf. v. 14) appear to end this segment, but two notes about Tyre becoming plunder for other nations (v. 5c) and about the destruction of its satellite cities on the mainland (v. 6) seem to have been added by a later hand. Whether the recognition formula הבהי ינך־יכ ועךיו ended the original oracle (cf. Ezek. 25.5, 7, 11, 14, 17) or was added by this redactor as a concluding statement remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Whereas vv. 2–6 leave unidentified the instrument of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s judgment, Ezek. 26.7–14 specify that Nebuchadrezzar and his army will destroy Tyre. The segment begins with יכ plus the messenger formula, and it predicts Tyre's fall in much greater detail than vv. 2–6. The segment closes with the same formulae found in v. 5b: יתרבך הוהי ינא יכ and הבהי ינךא םאנ.</p>
<p>Beginning with the messenger formula, but unmarked by any concluding phrase, Ezek. 26.15–18 shift from a description of how Tyre will fall to a prediction about how others will respond to its fall: specifically, the coastlands will quake and the princes of the sea will engage in mourning rites and intone a dirge over Tyre. The future-oriented verbs in this section integrate the princes' dirge into the judgment oracle and thus distinguish this dirge from the prophet's own dirges in Ezek. 27.1–36 and 28.11–19, which are oriented toward the past.</p>
<p>To the physical description of Tyre's demise as an island fortress in the preceding sections, Ezek. 26.19–21 add a parallel mythical description of Tyre's descent to the underworld, described as the Pit (רוב, 2×) or the land of the lower regions (תויתחת ץרא). This segment begins with יכ plus the messenger formula, like vv. 7–14, and ends with the concluding refrain הבהי ינךא םאנ as part of an expanded תוהלב formula, as discussed above (v. 21).</p>
<p>Despite the oracle's length and composite origins, the message is rather simple: Tyre gloated over Jerusalem's fate and will therefore face divine punishment. This concise message is wholly contained in what appears to be the earliest stratum, vv. 2–5a. The expansions in the subsequent verses embellish this basic message in several ways. First, they suggest that Tyre, like Jerusalem will be plundered by the nations (v. 5c). Second, the dependent cities on the mainland will also suffer judgment (v. 6a). Third, and perhaps most importantly, Nebuchadrezzar is identified as the instrument of divine punishment. Fourth, nature and humans alike will react to the horror of Tyre's downfall. And finally, Tyre's physical demise will be accompanied by a mythical descent to the netherworld. The overall effect of the oracle is to suggest that Tyre will be erased completely from the land of the living.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0309089212449094">
<title>A Judgment Oracle over Tyre's Ruler</title>
<p>The narrative formula for receiving Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s word (v. 1) and the concluding refrain הבהי ינךא םאנ (v. 10b) demarcate the literary boundaries of Ezek. 28.1–10. The oracle in between conforms closely to the genre of a prophetic judgment speech against an individual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212449094">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the commissioning formula (v. 2aα), the messenger formula introduces the oracle proper (v. 2aβ). The presence of the messenger formula at this point represents the only deviation from the classic form of the judgment oracle, and in this case it substitutes for the summons. The causal conjunction ןעי introduces the accusation (v. 2aγ-b): namely, the prince's hubris and pretensions of divinity (ינא לא), despite his humanity (םךא). Most scholars regard vv. 3–5 as a later interpolation, since they interrupt the natural flow from the basic accusation in v. 2 to the announcement of judgment in v. 6.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212449094">18</xref></sup> A form-critical analysis would concur, since brevity is characteristic of the judgment oracle against individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212449094">19</xref></sup> In addition, these verses are considered to have little connection to the prior or subsequent context. I would note, however, that the theme of wisdom (המכח) central to vv. 3–5 is often related to the mind (בל 2× in v. 2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212449094">20</xref></sup> Moreover, the judgment mentions specifically the prince's wisdom (v. 7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212449094">21</xref></sup> In their present location, then, vv. 3–5 can be considered an expansion on the simple accusation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212449094">22</xref></sup> As a development of the accusation, they describe how the extraordinary wisdom of the prince (v. 3) allowed him to generate great wealth (v. 4), which in turn led to pride (ךבבל הבגיו, v. 5; cf. ךבל הבג v. 2).</p>
<p>The term ןכל signals the transition from the accusation to the announcement of judgment over Tyre's prince (vv. 6, 7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212449094">23</xref></sup> After the messenger formula, which typically separates the accusation from the announcement (v. 6a), the prophet restates part of the accusation (v. 6b).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212449094">24</xref></sup> Ezekiel predicts that Y<sc>hwh</sc> will bring against the prince foreign nations who will attack the prince's wisdom and splendor (v. 7). These foreigners will send the prince down to the pit (תחש) and he will die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas םימי בלב, v. 8). The phrase echoes the prince's boast in v. 2, where םימי בלב calls to mind the geographic location of Tyre as a fortified island. In v. 8, however, םימי בלב parallels תחש, frequently a reference to the underworld (Job 9.31; 33.24; Ps. 16.10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212449094">25</xref></sup> In an ironic turn, the prince's island fortress becomes his watery grave. In v. 9, Y<sc>hwh</sc> questions rhetorically whether the prince will still claim before his slayers, ‘I am god’ (ינא םיהלא). Before the concluding formula, Y<sc>hwh</sc> uses the emphatic construction יתרבך ינא (v. 10ba) in contrast to—and forming an <italic>inclusio</italic> with—the claims to divinity made by the prince using ינא (v. 2).</p>
<p>Despite the addition of vv. 3–5, an interpretation of the judgment oracle is relatively straightforward. According to the original oracle (vv. 1–2, 6–10), the prince-as leader of the impenetrable island fortress—came to think of himself as divine. For this pretension to divinity, Ezekiel predicts that human enemies will mete out a fitting punishment: a violent death in his watery grave. In the face of such mortality, the prince will no longer be able to claim divine status. The insertion of vv. 3–5 expanded upon this original motif of hubris and on the reference to wisdom in v. 7 by alluding to Tyre's enormous commercial activity. According to the addition, the prince used his wisdom to accumulate great wealth, and this wealth in turn led to his hubris. With or without the addition, the passage portrays the prince as a mere human who considered himself divine and suffered the consequences.</p>
<p>Despite the asymmetry, the parallels between the A elements of the ABAB pattern are obvious. First, the overall forms of the two judgment oracles are similar, owing to their dependence upon a common genre. Second, the indictments filed against Tyre and its prince both cite the accused's own words. Third, foreign nations will execute the sentence upon Tyre and its prince. And finally, both the city and its ruler will descend into the underworld.</p>

<title>3. Ezekiel 27.1–36 and 28.11–19: Funeral Dirges over Tyre and Its Ruler</title>
<p>Ezekiel 27.1–36 and 28.11–19 each bear the explicit label ‘dirge’ (הניק 27.2; 28.12). Although the dirge genre originated in the <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> of the funeral, in the prophetic materials it became transformed into a taunt over enemies. Ezekiel's use of this genre in his dirges over Tyre and its ruler can be interpreted best in light of the original form of the funeral lament and its transformation into a taunt.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0309089212449094">
<title>The Funeral Dirge in the Hebrew Bible</title>
<p>The noun הניק (‘dirge’ or ‘lamentation’) and its companion <italic>polel</italic> verb (ןנוק) occur only in 2 Samuel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and 2 Chronicles. A dirge must be distinguished from the more familiar form ‘lament’. The lament, which accounts for about one-third of the Psalter, is characterized by a particular structure and presupposes a situation of distress that can be changed if Y<sc>hwh</sc> intervenes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212449094">26</xref></sup> In contrast, a lamentation grows out of the funeral context and is suitable to a situation that cannot be changed, such as a person's death. Hedwig Jahnow's comprehensive work on the Hebrew funeral dirge remains unsurpassed in its analysis of the הניק form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212449094">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking David's dirge over Saul and Jonathan in 2 Sam. 1.19–27 as a prototype, Jahnow deduces that a הניק exhibits certain characteristics:</p>
<list id="list1-0309089212449094" list-type="alpha-upper">

<p>In the context of its contentious relationships with surrounding nations, Israel's prophets parodied the funeral dirge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089212449094">38</xref></sup> In its parodic form, the dirge imitates the elements of a funeral lamentation but supplies new content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089212449094">39</xref></sup> The features of the traditional funeral dirge are exploited and turned into a gleeful taunt over the fallen enemy. Rather than hiding knowledge of the death, the news is to be broadcast to all adversaries of the slain. The deceased villain is derisively eulogized for the incomparable terror he imposed on the taunters. The fear once felt by the taunters contrasts with the present rejoicing over the tyrant's death. Professional mourners are called upon to perform a mock funeral. And, finally, the performer of the dirge parody expresses not personal grief but personal joy. The dirges in Ezekiel 26–28 illustrate many of these elements of parody.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 26.17–18 is not one of the dirges spoken by Ezekiel. Rather, it forms part of the judgment oracle of ch. 26. Nonetheless, because some of its dirge elements appear in parodied form, this miniature dirge illustrates how Israelite prophets could redeploy the genre in their oracles against Israel's enemies.</p>
<p>Even a cursory glance reveals the complexity of Ezekiel 27. The passage has been constructed out of various elements, such as the <italic>mashal</italic> of the ship (vv. 5–10) and, closely related to this metaphor, the ship's manifest and a list of trading partners (vv. 12–25). These building blocks, however, have been packaged in final form within the genre of a funeral dirge. The entirety of the chapter is labeled a dirge (v. 2), put in the mouth of Ezekiel. In addition, at the end of the chapter, the rowers, mariners, and sea captains take up a dirge (vv. 32b-36) within the dirge over Tyre. Many of the elements characteristic of a funeral dirge are present, some in parodic form:</p>
<list id="list4-0309089212449094" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>A. In v. 26b Tyre's death is announced in the image of a shipwreck.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>C. The coastlands shake (v. 28).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>D. Instead of recalling Tyre's military might, these dirges catalog the city's economic prowess. Verses 4–25 enumerate Tyre's economic trading practices using the metaphor of a ship and its manifest, and in vv. 33–34 the mariners mourn the loss of Tyre's trading empire.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>E. In the dirge within the dirge (vv. 32b-36), the point of comparison shifts from Tyre's economic might to the level of its destruction, and the incomparability element takes on a mocking tone: ‘Who is like Tyre—destroyed in the midst of the sea?’ (27.32b).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089212449094">44</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>F. The dirge parodies the lofty description of the deceased person's life by substituting the fallen hero's own haughty words (27.3; cf. 26.2).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>G. Verses 33–34 provide a once/now description of Tyre's life.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H. In vv. 29–32 the sailors descend from their ships and engage in traditional mourning behavior: wailing aloud, crying bitterly, casting dust upon their heads, wallowing in ashes (v. 30), shaving their heads, wearing sackcloth, and weeping (v. 31).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089212449094">45</xref></sup> Some observers engage in taunt: the inhabitants of the coastland are appalled (םמש, v. 35) and merchants hiss (קרש, v. 36a) at the devastated city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089212449094">46</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I. The expression of personal grief on the part of the mourner appears to be absent in this passage, except possibly for v. 33, where the mariners and sea captains express some sense of loss.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>From the numerous dirge elements present, we can see that Ezekiel 27 constitutes a dirge in more than name only. By comparing these elements to those identified by Jahnow, it becomes clear that the prophet has adopted the funeral dirge form, in order to parody several of its elements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0309089212449094">
<title>A Dirge over the King of Tyre</title>
<p>Like Ezekiel 27, Ezek. 28.11–19 is explicitly labeled a הניק (v. 12). Yet key characteristics of the funeral dirge are missing:</p>
<list id="list5-0309089212449094" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>A. There is no announcement of death and no expression of astonishment with ךיא.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>C. Nature is not called to participate in mourning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>E. The dirge does not declare the incomparability of the king of Tyre.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H. Noticeably missing are the professional mourners who engage in wailing and other ritual acts of mourning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I. Nowhere in the lamentation does Y<sc>hwh</sc> express personal grief.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Given the absence of these elements, Jahnow concludes, ‘We can therefore regard this section as one of the examples which rather clearly indicates the disintegration of the form of the funeral song’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089212449094">47</xref></sup> Jahnow argues that this passage ‘contains nothing of the form of the old Qinah except the opposite of “once” and “now” [G], apparently the moment in the myth that has tempted the prophet to apply the form’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089212449094">48</xref></sup> In fact, the contrast between ‘once’ and ‘now’ is quite marked in this passage. Verses 12b-15a are an extended, hyperbolic description of the king's past glory. This contrasts with the jarring discovery of the ruler's iniquity in v. 15b. The rest of the passage details his sins, subsequent punishments, and their results (vv. 16–19).</p>
<p>Rather than understanding Ezek. 28.11–19 as a disintegration of the dirge form, as Jahnow does, I propose that we interpret the passage as a dirge-enhanced <italic>mashal</italic>. In the same way that the dirge in Ezekiel 27 has been built from a complex of materials, including the <italic>mashal</italic> of the ship, so also Ezek. 28.11–19 has taken a <italic>mashal</italic> about a primordial being and enhanced it with features of a funeral dirge. In fact, in addition to the once/now motif observed by Jahnow, other characteristics of the funeral dirge are discernible:</p>
<list id="list6-0309089212449094" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>B. In the mock version of the funeral dirge, there is an element of public humiliation. The king's death is not kept secret from his enemies, but as he is cast to the ground he is set before kings who gloat over him (v. 17).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0309089212449094">49</xref></sup> He is incinerated before ‘all who see him’ (v. 18).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>D. As in ch. 27, the motif of the fallen hero's weapons assumes new content. Instead of referring to the king's matériel, Ezekiel utilizes images of trade, the weaponry of Tyre's commercial empire. Twice Ezekiel links the king's trading practice with his downfall. In the first elaboration on the accusation against the king, the prophet links the king's violence and sinfulness to the abundance of his trade (v. 16a). In the third elaboration on the accusation, the unrighteousness of the king's trade caused him to defile his sanctuaries (v. 18a).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>F. Verse 12 uses extended adjectival phrases to describe the king (המכח אלמ and י−בי לילכ).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H. Professional mourners are not mentioned explicitly, but like the mourners in Ezekiel 26 and 27, all those who knew the king are appalled (וממש, v. 19) at his downfall.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>J. Finally, the concluding refrain of this passage signals the irreversibility of the king's fate: ‘You have come to a calamitous end, and you are no more’ (v. 19).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Like Ezek. 17.3–10 and 27.5–10, this passage probably originated as an Ezekielian <italic>mashal</italic>. The <italic>mashal</italic> described the fall of Tyre's king, as a specific example of the fall of a primordial figure. For this reason, it does not bear all the hallmarks of a dirge. Yet, the presence of several characteristics of a funeral dirge and the explicit label suggest that a redactor sought to repackage the <italic>mashal</italic> as a dirge.</p>
<p>Thus, the funeral dirge has left indelible impressions upon the many parts of Ezekiel 26–28. The fact that no single passage exhibits all the characteristics of the funeral dirge should not lead to the assumption that these passages are not instantiations of the dirge genre. As these forms came to be used in new situations, one would expect their structure to evolve. Moreover, as Yee observes in her analysis of Isaiah 14, ‘it is through a distortion of these features that the poet achieves a brilliant parody, operating primarily through the reversal of the reader's expectations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0309089212449094">50</xref></sup> Given the presence of numerous elements of the funeral dirge in Ezekiel 26–28—some more genuine in their expression of grief, others more taunting in tone—we ought to interpret these passages as parodies of the genre.</p>

<sec id="section9-0309089212449094">
<title>4. Redactional Unity in Ezekiel 28.1–19</title>
<p>Earlier, I argued that the extended תוהלב refrain at the end of ch. 26 presented an obstacle to thinking of Ezekiel 26–27 as one unit and 28.1–19 as a second unit of similar pattern, and thus ought to be dismissed as a structuring device. Nonetheless, that suspect occurrence of the refrain serves a useful purpose in the process of interpreting the Tyre material as a whole. As I noted in the introduction, the refrain concludes the first, second, and fourth oracles, but not the third. This indicates that a redactor desired that the third and fourth oracles be read together closely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0309089212449094">51</xref></sup> Thus, the threefold תוהלב refrain encourages the reader to consider the judgment oracle in 28.1–10 and the funeral dirge in 28.11–19 as a unit, which turns out to be a key to unlocking the literary artistry and rhetorical impact of the judgment oracle-funeral dirge combination.</p>
<p>On the basis of form-critical criteria, Ezek. 28.1–19 is divided into two units: a judgment oracle in vv. 1–10 and a funeral dirge in vv. 11–19. Moreover, the different subjects—the former addresses the prince (ריגנ) and the latter the king (ךלמ) of Tyre—indicate that the units were originally independent of one another. Nevertheless, a number of clues suggest that within their current positions the two function in a coordinated manner, which invited the redactional unification of these two parts by the תוהלב refrain. The coordination of these two passages can be seen both from internal textual clues which unite the passages, as well as from other examples in the prophetic literature which pair a future-oriented judgment oracle with a past-oriented funeral dirge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0309089212449094">
<title>Internal Textual Clues</title>
<p>On the level of terminology, Ezek. 28.1–10 and 11–19 share extremely rare vocabulary. The noun הלכר (‘traffic, merchandise’) appears only in Ezek. 26.12; 28.5, 16, and 18.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0309089212449094">52</xref></sup> Moreover, the noun הע−בי (‘splendor’) occurs only in 28.7 and 17. The presence of these unusual terms suggests that the juxtaposition of these two passages is more than coincidental.</p>
<p>On the thematic level, both oracles concern the political ruler of Tyre and share a number of similar motifs. First, the ruler is accused of hubris (ךבל הבג, vv. 2 and 17; ךבבל הבג, v. 5). In vv. 1–10, his hubris is related to his claim to divinity (v. 2) and to his accumulation of wealth (v. 5). In vv. 11–19, his elevated self-importance originates from his beauty (v. 17). Second, the ruler is also noted for his great wisdom (המכח). In vv. 1–10, the prince is considered wiser than Danil (v. 3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0309089212449094">53</xref></sup> Through his commercial skill or wisdom, the prince increases his wealth which leads to his haughtiness (vv. 4–5). In vv. 11–19, the king is also extolled for his ample wisdom (v. 12). One of the three accusations against him is that he corrupted his wisdom on account of his splendor (v. 17). Third, in both passages, the commercial activity (הלכר) of the ruler plays a role in his transgression. In vv. 1–10, the prince's facility in trade leads to prodigious wealth which in turn leads to his hubris, the cause for judgment (v. 5). In vv. 11–19, the king is filled with violence, sins in the abundance of his trade (v. 16), and defiles his sanctuary through the unrighteousness of his commercial activity (v. 18). Fourth, beauty (י−בי) is an attribute associated with the ruler. In vv. 1–10, beauty describes the prince's wisdom (v. 7), and in vv. 11–19 the king himself is ‘complete in beauty’ (v. 12), the beauty which led to his arrogance (v. 17). Fifth, the ruler is defiled (ללח). In vv. 1–10 earthly kings will defile the prince of Tyre (vv. 7, 9). In vv. 11–19, Y<sc>hwh</sc> himself defiles the king (v. 16). Finally, both sections share the theme of being cast down. In vv. 1–10, as a punishment, foreigners will cast the prince down to the pit (ךודדוי תחשל), where he will die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas (םימי בלב, v. 8). In vv. 11–19, the king was on the holy mountain of god (v. 14), but because of his transgression, Y<sc>hwh</sc> ‘defiled’ him by removing him from the mountain of god (v. 16) and flung him to the earth (ךיתכלשה ץדא לע, v. 17).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0309089212449094">54</xref></sup> Thus, we can see that in addition to sharing rare vocabulary, these two oracles have in common numerous motifs that suggest their close relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0309089212449094">
<title>External Formal Criteria</title>
<p>The integration of these two units is also suggested by a similar combination of a judgment oracle with a funeral dirge elsewhere in the prophetic corpus. As an example, consider the oracle over Israel in Amos 5.1–17. J. de Waard observes the chiastic structure of this passage:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A elegy (vv. 1–3)</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>B 'seek and live' (vv. 4–6)</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>C complaint (v. 7)</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>D doxology (vv. 8–9)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>C' complaint (vv. 10–13)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>B' ‘seek and live’ (vv. 14–15)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A' mourning (vv. 16–17).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0309089212449094">55</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The passage is explicitly referred to as a dirge (הניק) in v. 1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0309089212449094">56</xref></sup> The accusations are nestled in vv. 7 and 10–13, predictions of coming judgments are found in vv. 3, 6, and 11, and the dirge elements envelop the entire oracle (vv. 2–3, 16–17). The dirge of v. 2 uses the perfective form to elegize Israel, who has fallen and will not rise again. Given the dire situation, the oracle ends with Y<sc>hwh</sc> calling for rituals of mourning (vv. 16–17).</p>
<p>Similarly, within the book of Ezekiel itself, Ezek. 32.1–16 coordinates a judgment oracle and a dirge. Labeled as a dirge (הניק, v. 2a) over Pharaoh, the passage begins as a past-oriented lamentation with a perfect followed by several <italic>waw</italic>-consecutive imperfects. As Zimmerli notes, this dirge-like beginning is abruptly ended by the messenger formula in v. 3 a. What follows is a series of future-oriented judgment oracles (vv. 3–8, 9–10, 11–14) with a proof saying in v. 15. The closing verse (v. 16) returns to the opening theme by referring to this passage as a lamentation (הניק), which is to be chanted (ןנוק 3×).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0309089212449094">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>I would argue that Ezekiel 26–27, understood as a unit, similarly coordinates a judgment oracle and a funeral dirge. This coordination has been masked somewhat by the insertion of the expanded תוהלב refrain in Ezek. 26.21. Once we reflect on the unity of the judgment oracle and funeral dirge in Ezek. 28.1–19, the parallel construction in Ezekiel 26–27 comes into focus.</p>
<p>Thus, not only are there internal verbal and thematic clues that suggest Ezek. 28.1–10 and 28.11–19 should be read together, but also there exist elsewhere in the prophetic corpus formal pairings of a prophetic dirge and a judgment oracle. Once we recognize the coordination of a judgment oracle and dirge parody in Ezekiel 26–27 and other places, Ezekiel 28 looks less like a pairing of forms with overlapping words and themes and more like a unity, built as part of a plan, and perhaps the most coherent combination of judgment oracle and dirge parody.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0309089212449094">
<title>5. Parody and Prolepsis</title>
<p>Thus far, I have argued that Ezek. 26.1–28.19 evidences an overall ABAB pattern, one in which judgment oracles against Tyre and its ruler are each followed by funeral dirges over the accused. What could this coordination of judgment oracle and funeral dirge mean? John Hayes argues that Israelite oracles against foreign nations are not intended primarily for the ears of the foreign nation, but rather for the Israelites themselves. Therefore, he contends, one must search for ‘the function which they performed within the context of Israelite society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0309089212449094">58</xref></sup> Such a search benefits from a historical context.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties with the Hebrew text, it is possible to venture an educated guess concerning the dating of Ezek. 26.1–28.19.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0309089212449094">59</xref></sup> Ezekiel 26 expects the imminent fall of Tyre and predicts the city's destruction at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (vv. 7–14). The date formula in Ezek. 26.1 locates the following oracle in the year March 587 to March 586 BCE. Moreover, Josephus reports that Nebuchadnezzar's attack against Tyre occurred during the reign of Ithobaal and persisted for thirteen years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0309089212449094">60</xref></sup> Ethbaal III of Tyre reigned 591/90–574/73 BCE. Taking all of this data into account, Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre can be dated to around 588/87 to 573 BCE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0309089212449094">61</xref></sup> Ultimately, Nebuchadnezzar failed to capture Tyre, and it appears as though a negotiated end to the siege resulted in the relocation of Ethbaal and his family to Babylon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0309089212449094">62</xref></sup> This historical reconstruction accords with the date 26 April 571 that accompanies the oracle in Ezek. 29.17–21, a passage which insinuates that Nebuchadnezzar will plunder Egypt as compensation for his less than successful siege of Tyre.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0309089212449094">63</xref></sup> Ezekiel 28.1–10 predicts the demise of Tyre's ruler by human hands, although the agent of destruction is unnamed. Presuming that this oracle—like Ezekiel 26—also refers to Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre, and noting that it seems unaware of the siege's failure, we should also date this judgment oracle to the time of the siege, 588/87–573 BCE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0309089212449094">64</xref></sup> If this is the case, then all of these oracles can be assigned a date no later than 573 BCE.</p>
<p>If I am correct in assuming that Ezekiel's dirges should be dated before the end of Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre, then the king is presumably very much alive and still in control of his commercially successful kingdom. This probable historical context for Ezekiel's dirges over Tyre and its ruler points to the proleptic nature of the dirges. Although the Tyrian king is alive and his city still stands, the funeral dirges recount the king's death and the city's destruction in the past tense. The traditional form of the dirge dictates this past-tense viewpoint. Because the king is not dead and the city not destroyed, however, these funeral dirges have been plucked from their original <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> and repurposed in a new context. In this new context they express an expectation of Tyrian defeat. The mythical reality of the king's fall is meant to foretell the physical reality of Tyre's destruction at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the instrument of Y<sc>hwh</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0309089212449094">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, paired with a judgment oracle, the funeral dirge creates a certainty of judgment beyond that of a simple judgment oracle. Jahnow observes that neither Amos 5.1–17 nor Ezek. 32.1–16 use the lamentation in its primary sense as a funeral dirge over a person's physical death; rather, both display a secondary usage, a prophetic prediction of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0309089212449094">66</xref></sup> The funeral dirge, which looks to the past, conveys a sense that the object of judgment has already ‘died’. Although the punishment anticipated by the future-oriented judgment oracle is yet to be realized, the use of a dirge to enact a mock funeral bespeaks a judgment as already accomplished, creating an effective rhetorical device.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0309089212449094">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the Israelite context, then, Ezekiel's dirges over Tyre and its king function to accentuate the certainty of the judgment oracles in Ezek. 26.1–21 and 28.1–10. If we assume with Zimmerli that the oracle over the king of Tyre is to be dated after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 586 BCE, then the oblique references to the Jerusalem temple complex observed in Ezek. 28.11–19 by Wilson strengthen the sense of inevitability attached to the judgment over Tyre's prince.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0309089212449094">68</xref></sup> The priestly and royal imagery in Ezek. 28.11–19 connects the dirge over the king of Tyre with the Jerusalem temple, reminds Ezekiel's Judahite listeners of their own razed sanctuary, and impresses upon them the gravity of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s judgment. While granting a glimpse of the Jerusalem temple, Ezekiel nonetheless retains imagery that could only be applied to Tyre, so that the target of his oracle would not be lost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0309089212449094">69</xref></sup> The experience of the destruction of the Jerusalem temple only serves to strengthen the sense of inevitable judgment over Tyre's king: if Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s judgment had such tragic consequences for Judah and its priests and king, how much more so for Tyre and Tyre's king. Thus, the dirges over Tyre and its king function within the larger unit of Ezek 26.1–28.19 to punctuate the future-oriented judgment oracles against the city and its prince as a <italic>fait accompli</italic>.</p>

<title>6. Conclusion: Rhetoric and Redaction</title>
<p>Neither the dirge parody nor the combination of a judgment oracle and funeral dirge are unique to Ezekiel. Yet, more than any other known Israelite prophet, he parodies the dirge form and employs it in tandem with judgment oracles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0309089212449094">70</xref></sup> This proleptic use of the dirge forms a powerful rhetorical device, whose performance emphasizes the certainty of divine judgment beyond what a simple judgment oracle can communicate on its own. Within Ezekiel's own dirge-laden corpus, Ezek. 26.1–28.19 stands out as the only example in which two adjacent combinations of judgment oracles and proleptic dirge parodies are coordinated against a people and its ruler. The doubling of this pattern against Tyre and its ruler indicates the significance of Tyre in Ezekiel's imagination and the theologically problematic nature of Tyre's endurance in light of Jerusalem's own destruction.</p>
<p>Based on her analysis of Ezekiel's oracles against Tyre, Carol Newsom has argued for the importance of attending to the rhetorical power of metaphors as part of the critical exegetical enterprise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0309089212449094">71</xref></sup> I would add that rhetorical considerations must also be taken into account when examining the redactional unity of larger literary units. In this article, I have demonstrated that the individual units of Ezek. 26.1–28.19 are integrated by more than shared vocabulary and themes. They also cohere rhetorically. Speciically, the funeral dirges accentuate the inevitability of the judgment oracles over Tyre and its ruler and thereby underscore the proleptic fulfillment of the prophetic word. Such rhetorical coherence suggests that rhetorical function also was a consideration of redactors in the collocation of prophetic material. For this reason rhetorical considerations in the arrangement of material should be analyzed as part of the redactional artistry of prophetic texts.</p>

Bevan, ‘The King of Tyre in Ezekiel XXVIII’, <italic>JTS</italic> 4 (1903), pp. 500–505. Wilson suggests that the dirge over the king of Tyre is an oblique but literal reference to the high priest in Jerusalem. The similarity between the list of precious stones in v. 13 and those of the high priest's breastplate in Exod. 28.17–20 and 39.10–13, and the symbolism of the holy mountain, Garden of Eden, and the cherub, Wilson argues, point to the Jerusalem temple. Moreover, Wilson suggests, םתוח (‘signet’) is an appropriate image of the high priest as an earthly representative of Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s power. He additionally associates the stones of fire (שא ינבא) with the coals of fire (שא ילחג) on the temple altar (Lev. 16.12; Ezek. 10.2). Whereas Bevan understands the Jerusalem temple imagery to indicate that the king of Tyre is a priest in the Tyrian sanctuary, Wilson argues that its purpose is ‘to identify the figure in the garden as the Israelite high priest’ (see pp. 214–16).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn69-0309089212449094"><label>69.</label><p>Some of the images which Wilson stretches to conform to the high priest are not as elastic as he would have them be. For example, no clear evidence associates the stones of fire with the coals of fire on the temple altar. The ‘signet’ seems to be legitimately a royal and not a priestly term (Jer. 22.24; Hag. 2.23). In Exod. 28, the םתוח is used as an analogy for an engraving process; in Wilson's scheme, it would be an outright metaphor for the priest himself. Furthermore, some of the imagery Ezekiel employs in this passage is not appropriate to Israel and its high priest but suits Tyre and its king quite well. First, elsewhere Ezekiel never accuses Israel of haughtiness. In fact, the expression ךבלהבג is only used of the prince/king of Tyre (28.2, 5, 17). Barry Margulis has demonstrated that hubris is a charge usually reserved for oracles against foreign nations, and particularly for those against foreign rulers; <italic>Studies in the Oracles Against the Nations</italic> (Ann Arbor, MI: University Microfilms International, 1967), pp. 262–65, 282. Second, the commercial imagery is germane to Tyre and not to Israel or Israel's high priest. Elsewhere, Ezekiel never uses לבר in the sense of business transactions to refer to Israel. The verb is used only in the oracle against Tyre in ch. 27, except for the <italic>mashal</italic> of ch. 17 where it refers to Babylon. The noun is used only in Ezek. 26 and 28. Third, Y<sc>hwh</sc> accuses the king on account of his unrighteous trade, charging, ‘You defiled your sanctuaries’. If Y<sc>hwh</sc> were speaking of the temple in Jerusalem, we would expect to find ‘my sanctuary’ (Ezek. 5.11; 8.6; 9.10; 23.38, 39; 24.21; 37.26, 28; 44.7–16). Indeed, this is what we find in the oracle against Ammon; Y<sc>hwh</sc> reproaches the Ammonites: ‘Because you said “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was defiled…’ (25.3). Moreover, the plural ‘sanctuaries’ would be an unusual reference to Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s temple.</p></fn>
