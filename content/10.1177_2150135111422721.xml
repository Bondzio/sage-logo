<abstract>
<p>In the accompanying article, Chenu and colleagues describe “an uncommon course of the right superior vena cava in a patient with heterotaxy syndrome.” In their discussion, they pose the question, “Is this an isolated atrial inversion, or a case of left isomerism?” They proceed to comment “this remains a debate among cardiac morphologists.” I can agree with them on their first description, since although I have previously examined many hearts from patients with isomerism of the left atrial appendages, or “polysplenia syndrome,” I had not noticed the unusual feature they have emphasized in their case report; although, as I will show, the evidence was there for me to observe their feature of emphasis. They deserve great credit, therefore, for bringing this feature to our attention. I also agree with their first statement, namely that their patient has the left isomeric variant of the so-called visceral heterotaxy, but I must question their suggestion that the patient may exhibit mirror-imaged arrangement of the atrial chambers or “atrial situs inversus.” I would question even more strongly their comment that the distinction remains “a debate among cardiac morphologists.” As I will further show, the distinction has major clinical implications, not only for pediatric cardiac surgeons but also for those involved with genetic counseling.</p>

<p>In the accompanying article, Chenu and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> describe “an uncommon course of the right superior vena cava in a patient with heterotaxy syndrome.” In their discussion, they pose the question “Is this an isolated atrial inversion, or a case of left isomerism?” They proceed to comment “this remains a debate among cardiac morphologists.” I can agree with them on their first description, since although I have previously examined many hearts from patients with isomerism of the left atrial appendages, or “polysplenia syndrome,” I had not previously noticed the unusual feature they have emphasized in their case report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> although as I will show, the evidence was there for me to observe their feature of emphasis. They deserve great credit, therefore, for bringing this feature to our attention. I also agree with their first statement, namely that their patient has the left isomeric variant of so-called visceral heterotaxy, but I must question their suggestion that the patient may exhibit mirror-imaged arrangement of the atrial chambers, or “atrial situs inversus.” I would question even more strongly their comment that the distinction remains “a debate among cardiac morphologists.” As I will further show, the distinction has major clinical implications, not only for pediatric cardiac surgeons but also for those involved with genetic counseling.</p>
<p>First, nonetheless, the evidence that their patient has left isomerism is surely overwhelming? The patient is known to have multiple spleens, there is interruption of the inferior caval vein, with continuation through the left-sided azygos venous system, the hepatic veins drain symmetrically to the common atrial chamber, and there is an atrioventricular septal defect with separate valvar orifices for the right and left ventricles. As discussed by the authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> all this points to a diagnosis of left isomerism or “polysplenia syndrome.” The authors also noted that all four pulmonary veins drained to the left-sided component of the common atrial chamber. Subsequent to the surgical correction, the pulmonary veins entered the newly created left atrial chamber. As we will see, this finding is highly pertinent to their alternative suggestion that the patient may have had “isolated atrial inversion.” In patients with left isomerism, it is frequent for both caval veins to drain directly to the opposite sides of the roof of a common atrial chamber, this feature being found in over one third of the cases analyzed by Uemura and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111422721">2</xref></sup> Until reading the account of Chenu and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> however, I had not analyzed in detail the course of the right-sided superior caval vein in such cases. The photographs of one of the hearts in the Frank Sherman and Cora Lenox archive of Pittsburgh Children’s Hospital, nonetheless, clearly show the features they have identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422721">Figure 1</xref>). As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422721">Figure 1A</xref>, in this specimen there is unequivocal left bronchial isomerism, with bilateral and symmetrical drainage of the pulmonary and hepatic veins to a common atrial chamber. The image obtained by opening the right-sided atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422721">Figure 1B</xref>) shows clearly the feature now described by Chenu and colleagues, namely that the right-sided caval vein extends across the lateral and posterior wall of the right-sided atrium before opening to the atrial cavity through an orifice adjacent to the opening of the right-sided hepatic vein. I had previously interpreted this opening as a “coronary sinus”; but in the absence of an atrial septum, it is inappropriate to describe the coronary sinus as having an orifice. It is better described, as indicated by Chenu et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> as unroofing of the right-sided superior caval venous channel. Comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422721">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422721">D</xref> then shows the unequivocal isomeric arrangement of the caval venous channels, with each entering the atrial cavity sandwiched between the pulmonary veins and the appendage on that side. The isomeric arrangement of the atrial appendages is also obvious. I submit that the findings in this case from the Pittsburgh archive parallel almost exactly the findings as described by Chenu and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> and add weight to their suggestion that their patient also had left isomerism.</p>

<p>The images show the features of the superior cavoatrial connections in the heart from a patient with “polysplenia syndrome.” A, The heart from behind. Note the presence of isomeric long bronchuses (white arrows), each bronchus being long and crossed by the pulmonary artery before giving its first branch. The pulmonary veins (black open stars) open in symmetric fashion to the sides of the common atrial chamber, and the hepatic veins (white stars) open in symmetric fashion to the base of the atrial chamber. B, The right-sided cavoatrial junction. Note the morphologically left atrial appendage on the right side (Rt-s LAA). The right-sided superior caval vein (Rt-s SCV) runs down the lateral aspect of the atrium before opening to the atrial cavity (white star). (C and D) compare the courses of the left-sided (Lt-s SCV) and right-sided (Rt-s SCV) SCV superior caval veins. Each venous channel is sandwiched between the appendage on that side (Lt-s LAA and Rt-s LAA) and the attachment of the pulmonary veins (white and black stars).</p>

</fig>
<p>What, then, is the evidence in favor of the argument that their patient could have had mirror-imaged atrial arrangement? The evidence that the right-sided atrial chamber is morphologically left is very convincing. But an atrial chamber with a morphologically left atrial appendage is found both in patients with mirror-imaged atrial arrangement and in those with left isomerism. So as to substantiate the notion that the patient has mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, therefore, it is necessary to show that the left-sided atrium is morphologically right. The authors tell us that the suggestion for “isolated atrial inversion” was made following discussions with Richard Van Praagh. One of the most important principles established by Dr Van Praagh during his long and distinguished career has been the so-called morphological method. This states that structures within the heart ideally should be identified on the basis of their most constant component, and not on the basis of another component that itself might be variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111422721">3</xref></sup> Within the atrial chambers, the most constant component is the appendage. As was shown by Uemura and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111422721">2</xref></sup> when based on the extent of the pectinate muscles relative to the atrioventricular junctions, the morphology of the appendages distinguishes in all cases between left and right isomerism. Chenu and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> acknowledge that, in their patient, it was not possible to distinguish the morphology of the appendages. Could it be that they did not seek this information during the operative procedure, since it would have been an easy matter to establish the extent of the pectinate muscles relative to the right-sided atrial vestibule? Be that as it may, they were unable to establish the morphology of the appendages. They did, nonetheless, establish that all four pulmonary veins drained to the left-sided component of the common atrial chamber, which also received at its roof the left-sided superior caval vein. This feature, surely, points to this left-sided atrial chamber also as being of left morphology, with a greater degree of unroofing of the left-sided superior caval vein? There seems scant evidence, therefore, in favor of suggesting that their patient has mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. It could also well be the case that several of their other citations of patients allegedly having “isolated” usual or mirror-imaged atrial arrangement in reality have isomerism of the left atrial appendages, since as the authors indicate, these described patients have several morphologic features of “heterotaxy.”</p>
<p>What, then, of their suggestion that the debate remains the province of cardiac morphologists? The debate among cardiac morphologists has revolved around the very existence of isomerism within the heart. It was unfortunate that, when we first supported the notion of cardiac isomerism, we described the subsets we had identified as “right atrial” and “left atrial” isomerism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111422721">4</xref></sup> As Dr Van Praagh subsequently emphasized, patients with left atrial isomerism would be expected to have eight pulmonary veins, which is never the case. On this basis, Dr Van Praagh questioned the very existence of cardiac isomerism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111422721">5</xref></sup> But as we subsequently showed in the study spearheaded by Uemura, when based on the morphology of the appendages, this being determined according to the extent of the pectinate muscles, then the morphologic evidence in favor of isomerism of the atrial appendages is overwhelming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111422721">2</xref></sup> And, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422721">Figure 1</xref>, there can also be a considerable degree of overall isomerism within the atrial segment of the heart, albeit that it remains better to describe the features in terms of isomerism of the appendages. Subsequent work using genetically modified mice has now shown that it is possible to generate animals with isomeric right atrial appendages by knocking out genes such as <italic>Pitx2</italic> or <italic>Cited2</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111422721">6</xref></sup> or to generate animals with left isomerism by knocking out other genes such as <italic>Lefty2</italic> or <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111422721">7</xref></sup> The evidence is now very strong, therefore, that all patients with congenitally malformed hearts can be catalogued, in terms of arrangement of the atrial appendages, into those with usual arrangement, those with mirror-imagery, or those with right or left isomerism. This has important implications for the congenital cardiac surgeon, since the sinus node is directly related to the morphologically right atrial appendage being duplicated in patients with right isomerism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111422721">8</xref></sup> The inferences for arrangement of the atrioventricular conduction axis will also be different depending on whether the patients have discordant atrioventricular connections, possible only in the setting of usual or mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, or mixed atrioventricular connections in the setting of isomeric atrial appendages. In the latter setting, of necessity, half of the heart in patients with biventricular atrioventricular connections will be concordantly connected, while the other half will be discordantly connected. The disposition of the atrioventricular conduction axis in such instances is determined by ventricular topology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111422721">9</xref></sup> In the case described by Chenu and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> if the patient were considered to have discordant atrioventricular connections, then the possibility would exist for abnormal origin of the conduction axis from an anterior atrioventricular node. If, in contrast, the patient were deemed to have left isomerism with right-hand ventricular topology, which is the most likely diagnosis, then it would be highly unlikely to find anything other than a regular disposition of the atrioventricular conduction axis, recognizing that this would be as expected for atrioventricular septal defect. And then, with regard to genetic counseling, the implications would be quite different if the patient was deemed to have mirror-imaged atrial arrangement as opposed to left isomerism. The debate, therefore, is now very much in the domain of the clinician.</p>
<p>In summary, Chenu and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422721">1</xref></sup> have identified an arrangement of the right-sided superior caval vein that, to date, has gone unnoticed in the setting of isomerism of the left atrial appendages, or “polysplenia syndrome.” I submit that there is scant evidence to support their alternative suggestion that their patient may have had “isolated atrial inversion.” More importantly, the highlighted debate now has several clinical implications, showing how accurate analysis of atrial morphology, ideally based on the arrangement of the atrial appendages according to the extent of the pectinate muscles, should now be a feature identified routinely by the pediatric cardiac surgeon when opening either atrial chamber.</p>
