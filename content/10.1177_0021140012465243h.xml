<p>While this is a good book, I should say from the outset that I find the title misleading. This is not a book as such about Anglican theology, neither being a systematic theology which is Anglican, nor a discussion of the main theologians of the Anglican tradition. Indeed, Mark Chapman himself questions at the beginning if there is such a thing as Anglican theology. As such, it would be much better had there been a subtitle to the title which explained what it is doing, rather than a title which seems to imply one thing while the book then does another. This of course may be an issue with the publisher as much as with the author, but it is somewhat confusing.</p>
<p>What we have instead is a very interesting discussion with a demythologization of various 19th-century views of what Anglicanism is about. Most of these views come out of the Tractarian movement in England, although in the case of the Anglican Communion, Mark Chapman shows that this emerging theology was also developing in other parts of the communion, not least in North America.</p>
<p>Chapman calls his book a study of a combination of scholarship fantasy and myth, i.e. he intends to look at the way Anglicans have understood themselves, particularly through the lens of Victorian Romanticism. As such, the book gradually debunks the perception of the Reformation, the place of Richard Hooker, the attachment to the Caroline divines, the notion of the <italic>via media</italic>, and the interpretation of latitudinarianism. The last chapter makes the key point that there is now non-English Anglican theology. The conclusion deals in part with the Anglican covenant. This has rapidly dated the book, as since it was written the Church of England has refused to accept the covenant, throwing the process into some confusion.</p>
<p>Anglican theology: the demythologization of some Victorian views—this might have been the title of the book and would explain it very well. The book clearly deals with central features of Anglican identity, which are still important within the Anglican world. It is unfortunate that such sharp and clear critique was not also applied to some of the evangelical views from the same century, as the two parties, catholic and evangelical, have forged in debate particular identities. Indeed, one of Chapman’s key theories is the centrality of debate and controversy in the development of Anglican thinking.</p>
