<p>The annual Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Conference will be held in Melbourne 10–12<sup>th</sup> October 2013 at the Melbourne Conference and Exhibition Centre Southbank. A preconference workshop day will be held on Wednesday 9<sup>th</sup> October with workshops on eating disorders, borderline personality disorder in youth and anxiety and sleep disorders in younger children.</p>
<p>The conference has been titled <italic>Snakes &amp; Ladders</italic> to reflect the need for fun and play in our work, as well as to capture the ups and downs of work with children and young people and their families. The subtitle <italic>Continuities and Discontinuities: in Development, Families and Communities</italic> captures the centrality of developmental context and transitions, both for individuals and families, in our work with children and young people and their families. It also captures our effort to recognise the discontinuities between our communities and those who suffer greater disadvantage and constricted resources in neighbouring regional countries as well in our indigenous communities. We have made child and adolescent global mental health a conference theme, and hope the conference will begin a greater engagement between Australian and New Zealand child and adolescent psychiatrists and child mental health professionals from neighbouring regional countries.</p>
<p>The conference aims to be inclusive of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, Psychiatrists working with youth and Paediatricians working with the mental health of children and young people and their families. We have worked to ensure it is equally relevant to those in public and private practice. It is hoped that the conference will bring stronger linkages between all working with children and youth.</p>
