<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective study on hemodialysis fistulae in patients aged 75 years and older.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Dialysis records of 2 hospitals were searched for patients of 75 years and older who had primary autologous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (RCAVFs) and brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (BCAVFs). Outcome measures were primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates. Also, quality of life (QOL) was measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 107 fistulae were placed in 90 patients; 65 (61%) RCAVFs and 42 (39%) BCAVFs were created. The primary patency rate (<italic>P</italic> = .026) and the primary-assisted patency rate (<italic>P</italic> = .016) of BCAVFs were significantly higher than that of RCAVFs. Secondary patency rates at 1 year (<italic>P</italic> = .01) and 2 years (<italic>P</italic> = .035) were higher in BCAVFs than in RCAVFs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The BCAVFs give significantly higher primary and primary-assisted patency rates and also significantly higher secondary patency rates at 1 and 2 years. Therefore, we suggest the placement of elbow fistulae in the elderly patients. The QOL was surprisingly high in this population despite a high mortality rate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) recommends radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (RCAVFs) before brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (BCAVFs) in all dialysis patients needing hemodialysis (HD). When the placement of arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) is indicated for patients requiring HD, the primary creation site according to the DOQI should be in the nondominant limb and then in order of preference, radiocephalic, brachiocephalic, and brachiobasillic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413495464">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413495464"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413495464">3</xref>
</sup> There are several factors influencing the patency of AVFs such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, gender, and ethnicity, and age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413495464">1</xref>
</sup> Several studies reported mixed results in comparison to outcomes in RCAVFs and BCAVFs in elderly patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413495464">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413495464">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In elderly patients, in need of HD, the patency rates of different types of AVFs can be useful to make a decision about which type of AVF should be used. Weale et al described equivalent outcomes in RCAVFs and BCAVFs in patients ≥80 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413495464">3</xref>
</sup> The RCAVFs have a high functional failure rate compared to BCAVFs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413495464">5</xref>
</sup> However, the RCAVFs are preferred to BCAVFs because future access site options should be saved in the HD population. In elderly patients with lower life expectancy, a fistula with higher primary patency rate and less reinterventions might be the preferable option, also when considering quality of life (QOL). Currently the information on QOL in elderly HD patients is still lacking. However, this information is crucial in the choice of therapy in these patients.</p>
<p>The present study compares the outcome of autologous RCAVFs and BCAVFs in our institutions in the HD population of 75 years and older and evaluates the QOL of the elderly HD patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574413495464" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We consulted the institutional review board (Adviescommissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Amphia, AMOA) of the Amphia hospital, and they confirmed that no formal written waiver for the need of ethics approval was required because of the retrospective design of the study. Also there was no written consent needed from the patients.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574413495464">
<title>Trial Design</title>
<p>The study was performed at the departments of surgery and dialysis at the Amphia hospital in Breda and St Elisabeth Hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands. Dialysis and operating room records from 2001 through 2008 were reviewed to identify all patients of 75 years and older undergoing a vascular access procedure for HD. Autogenous RCAVFs and BCAVFs were included in this study. Information about patient demographics, comorbidities, and previous dialysis access procedures was collected. Follow-up data were obtained from the hospital records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574413495464">
<title>Work-Up and Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>Fistula placement was preferably performed in the most distal portion of the nondominant arm. Clinical judgment as well as preoperative duplex ultrasonography were used to assess vascular anatomy and to determine the diameters of the radial and brachial arteries and the cephalic vein with minimum acceptable threshold for internal diameters set at 2.0 mm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413495464">6</xref>
</sup> The AVF procedures were autogenous RCAVFs and BCAVFs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574413495464">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>The surgical procedure was considered successful if the presence of a thrill on palpation and/or auscultation was determined the day after the operation. Primary patency or intervention-free access survival was defined as the interval between access placement until any intervention designed to maintain or reestablish patency, access thrombosis, or the time of measurement of patency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413495464">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413495464">8</xref>
</sup> Primary-assisted patency was defined as the interval between access placement until any preemptive surgical or endovascular repair without access to thrombosis. Secondary patency was defined as the interval between access placement until access abandonment or the time of patency measurement including intervening manipulations (surgical or endovascular interventions) designed to reestablish functionality in thrombosed access.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413495464">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413495464">8</xref>
</sup> Primary failure or inadequate maturation was defined as an AVF that did not develop to maintain dialysis or thrombosed before the first successful cannulation for HD treatment, at 6 weeks after surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413495464">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413495464">7</xref>
</sup> The AVFs that never matured were included in the patency rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574413495464">
<title>Quality-of-Life Assessment</title>
<p>Patients were asked to fill out the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument (WHOQOL-BREF), which is an abbreviated version of the original WHOQOL-100.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413495464">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413495464">10</xref>
</sup> This questionnaire was sent to the patients in January 2010. The questionnaire consists of 26 questions, and 24 questions assess the domains physical health (7 questions), psychological health (6 questions), social relationships (3 questions), and environment (8 questions). Each question has a 5-point Likert scale. The other 2 questions assess Global QOL and general health. Instructions of the World Health Organization (WHO) scoring were used to calculate the various QOL domains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574413495464">11</xref>
</sup> Likert scale data were converted into raw domain scores of the 4 distinct domains and transformed on a range from 0 to 100, with higher scores corresponding with a better QOL. Raw QOL domain scores of our population were compared with raw QOL domain scores of patients 3 months after peripheral bypass surgery in our institution as studied by Öztürk et al.<sup>

<sec id="section7-1538574413495464">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The SPSS 18.0 for Windows package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) was used for the statistical analysis. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for reporting the baseline characteristics of the patient group.</p>
<p>Patency rates were transformed into a dichotomous outcome for specific time periods (1 year and 2 years). Data of access sites were assessed to be either patent or thrombosed at the end of each time period. The number of outcome events is represented by the number of thrombosed fistulae. Primary failures were included in the patency rates.</p>
<p>Patency rates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier curves, and the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance. A <italic>P</italic> value below .05 was considered to denote statistical significance. Dates of death were recorded. Patients who died or lost for follow-up were censored for analysis. Descriptive analyses were used to calculate means and medians on each part of the QOL.</p>

<title>Baseline Characteristics</title>
<p>From 2001 to 2008, a total of 107 permanent vascular accesses in 90 patients were recorded in the database. Mean age was 78 years (range 75-88) and 59 were males (66%). A total of 17 (19%) patients received more than 1 AVF during this observation period. A total of 65 (61%) AVFs were created at the wrist and 42 (39%) AVFs at the elbow. A total of 58 (54%) fistulae were actually used for dialysis, 41 (38%) fistulae were never cannulated and 8 (8%) fistulae dialysis records provided insufficient information about its cannulation. Of the 41 fistulae that were never used, in 9 cases the patient died, in 27 fistulae there was primary failure, and in 5 cases HD never started. In the primary failure group, 4 fistulae could not be cannulated because of inadequate maturation, 14 fistulae were occluded before first cannulation, 2 fistulae were abandoned because of steal; in 2 cases, cannulation was not successful and in 5 cases, dialysis records only reported primary failure. Baseline characteristics of the 90 HD patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574413495464">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences in gender and comorbidities between the RCAVF group and the BCAVF group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>According to demographic trends in the Netherlands, in the next 30 years the age category of 75 years and older is expected to double in size.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413495464">13</xref>
</sup> Also, a rapid increase of Dutch patients older than 75 years requiring dialysis is foreseen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413495464">14</xref>
</sup> Next to a higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), these elderly people have important comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574413495464">15</xref>
</sup> The presence of these comorbidities and therefore an expected poor vessel quality challenge the creation of a reliable vascular access, which is a critical requirement for providing adequate HD.</p>
<p>Guidelines for vascular access do not include special recommendations for the elderly patients. Randomized controlled trials comparing dialysis access outcome in the elderly patient are lacking. The rationale for the DOQI to recommend RCAVFs before BCAVFs are lower morbidity rates associated with their creation, greater durability compared with other access types, and conservation of proximal access sites for future use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413495464">4</xref>
</sup> An increased risk of RCAVF failure in the elderly patient and benefit of BCAVFs were reported in a meta-analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413495464">4</xref>
</sup> However, studies reporting on outcome of RCAVFs and BCAVFs in the elderly patients are difficult to interpret due to different patient populations, different cutoff points for age groups, and different outcome measures regarding patency. However, our study in elderly patients shows significant higher primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates (at 1 and 2 years) in elderly patients with BCAVFs compared to patients with RCAVFs. This means that patients who received BCAVFs had a larger intervention-free and thrombosis-free access survival and time to access abandonment was longer. This lower reintervention rate is essential for this specific population of elderly HD patients in which, according to other studies, poor survival was measured.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413495464">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413495464">16</xref>
</sup> We believe that in a group of patients with a short life expectancy, preservation of future access sites is less important. Because of this, we propose BCAVFs to be the first choice fistulae in the elderly patient.</p>
<p>Next to the patency rates, another key outcome measure in the elderly patients is the QOL, which is increasingly being evaluated for other vascular interventions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574413495464">17</xref>
</sup> The QOL is defined by the WHO as an individual’s assessment of physical, psychological, and social well being that incorporates a patient’s individual perception of its disease and functioning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413495464">10</xref>
</sup> Psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF are found to be good with studies that have shown good internal consistency, validity, and good sensitivity to change.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574413495464">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413495464">19</xref>
</sup> In our study, a relative high overall global QOL score was measured. Due to the poor survival in the studied population, the QOL analysis could only be performed in a relative small amount of the patents that made it impossible to compare QOL between the BCAVF group and the RCAVF group. Despite these small numbers, we think it is important to describe the QOL in this population. The fact is that most patients in which QOL was measured belonged to the RCAVF group. The RCAVF group had the worst patency and most reinterventions, so QOL was measured in the group of patients with the worst outcome. Our high QOL scores are consistent with the literature on this subject. Elderly dialysis patients have been found to be more accommodating to their disease and dialysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574413495464">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574413495464">21</xref>
</sup> Besides this, QOL of the elderly dialysis patient did not differ greatly when compared to the QOL of an elderly person from the general population and patients after peripheral bypass surgery, as we also demonstrated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495464">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574413495464">22</xref>
</sup> So these elderly dialysis patients, in which survival was poor, seem to maintain a relative high QOL despite the discomforts of dialysis. It remains important to incorporate QOL in dialysis care, since perceived mental health seems to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with ESRD and therefore a measure of the quality of dialysis care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574413495464">23</xref>
</sup> This could be done by incorporating QOL questionnaires in the admission protocol for access surgery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The BCAVFs should be considered before RCAVFs in HD access in elderly patients because of a longer intervention-free and thrombosis-free interval time. The QOL was surprisingly high in this population despite a high mortality rate.</p>
