<abstract>
<p>This study searches for small molecules, which can be generated by photoacid generators (PAGs) capable of inducing the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation in zirconia nanocrystals. Metastable tetragonal zirconia nanocrystals were exposed in alcohol suspension. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that water, HCl, HF, and NH<sub>3</sub>, all initiate phase transformation of tetragonal zirconia at room temperature, whereas NBu<sub>4</sub>Cl and NBu<sub>4</sub>OH do not. 2-(4-Methoxystyryl)-4,6-<italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine) was the most efficient (monoclinic volume fraction reached 0.57) out of the four tested PAGs. For dispersion in a dimethacrylate matrix together with zirconia crystals, a monoclinic volume fraction of 0.19 was observed after 2 min of exposure to light, increasing to 0.6 after 30 min.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311434359" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shrinkage during polymerization of dental resin composites is unavoidable and the leading problem in the usage of composite resin restorations. Stresses are induced on the filling/tooth interface. The filling can loosen from the tooth, leading to the formation of a crack between tooth and the composite material or micro-cracks in the composite material itself. This will facilitate discoloration by colorants from, for example, coffee and red wine entering the crack, or even worse, leading to secondary caries and infection of dental pulp due to bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311434359">1</xref></sup> During the past few decades, substantial efforts have addressed the shrinkage in dental resin composites by an approach based on modification of the monomer system to achieve less polymerization shrinkage. The typical dimethacrylate monomers have been replaced with ring-opening systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311434359">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311434359">4</xref></sup> The overall curing shrinkage has an effect on the clinical properties of the composite and a low-shrinkage composite will reduce the preparation time because of the possibility to make bulk fillings instead of having to use the more time-consuming technique, where the filling is a buildup of layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311434359">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>An investigation in order to identify an alternative approach to minimize the polymerization shrinkage was performed. Instead of aiming at the reduction of the polymerization shrinkage of the monomer system, the shrinkage problem is addressed by counteracting the polymerization shrinkage with an expanding inorganic filler. An expandable metastable tetragonal zirconia filler which, upon reaction with water, is able to counteract the polymerization shrinkage of the monomer system was developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311434359">6</xref></sup> The tetragonal to monoclinic (t→m) phase transformation is due to an expansion of the unit cell accompanied by a decrease in density, where the crystals expand ∼4 vol.%. This expansion is, for instance, used in transformation toughening of ceramic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311434359">7</xref></sup> The tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation is known to be initiated by the following: chemical reaction with, for example, water,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311434359">8</xref></sup> annealing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311434359">9</xref></sup> and mechanical stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311434359">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The polymerization shrinkage of common dimethacrylate monomer mixtures used in dental resin composites is in the range 3–5 vol.%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311434359">1</xref></sup> By adding a controlled amount of metastable tetragonal zirconia to the resin, it should be possible to obtain a composite material, which upon curing shrinks ∼1%. This would be the most optimal level of shrinkage as the cured filling will absorb water from saliva and this can in a stable volume fillers lead to an undesired expansion of the filling, and thereby to fractures in the tooth.</p>
<p>When developing a dental resin composite restorative, different material properties have to be taken into consideration such as mechanical properties, solubility and water sorption, color stability, polymerization shrinkage, depth of cure, radiopacity, and biocompatibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311434359">1</xref></sup> All these issues have to be addressed for the expandable filler approach also. This investigation concentrates on the ability to induce the t→m phase transition at will. Until now, the potential of the filler to counteract the polymerization shrinkage by initiating the phase transformation with water diffusing into the polymer matrix has been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434359">11</xref></sup> It was concluded from the shrinkage analysis of a composite containing 42 wt% zirconia stored in water at 40°C for 7 days that the overall shrinkage was reduced by 44% compared with an equivalent sample stored in air. This is, however, too slow for a good dental composite where the shrinkage reduction optimally should happen within the time it takes to prepare the filling. The most desirable scenario is to make the zirconia phase transform during curing, starting when the gel point is reached. In this way, the strongest interface will be obtained and the matrix will have the lowest level of stress.</p>
<p>Annealing and mechanical stress, for obvious reasons, are not the possible ways to initiate phase transformation in dental composites. In this article, the focus is on light-initiated release of initiator molecules. This study investigates the phase transformation potential of possible initiators in order to find the initiator candidate molecules for light activated phase transformation.</p>

<p>All chemicals were supplied by Sigma–Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) and used as received. Highly porous (specific surface area of ∼150 m<sup>2</sup>/g) nanocrystalline tetragonal zirconia powders were synthesized as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311434359">12</xref></sup> by controlled hydrolysis of ZrOCl<sub>2</sub> followed by careful calcination. The synthesized t-ZrO<sub>2</sub> powders were kept in water-free environment for further treatment to prevent the t→m phase transformation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311434359">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311434359">14</xref></sup> which is induced by exposure to water vapor.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311434359"><title>Testing of potential phase transformation initiators</title>
<p>Solutions of potential phase transformation initiators in anhydrous methanol or isopropanol were prepared. In a glove box (&lt;10 ppm water), zirconia was added to the solution and allowed to react. The reaction mixture was filtered and the zirconia was dried at room temperature (RT) in the glove box. To prevent further phase transformation and make it possible to handle the zirconia samples in ambient atmosphere, the sample was mixed with a dimethacrylate monomer mixture (bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether dimethacrylate, urethane dimethacrylate, and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate – <italic>bis</italic>-GMA/UDMA/TEGDMA, 36/44/20 wt%) and a photopolymerization system (camphorquinone and ethyl 4-dimethylamino benzoate – CQ/DABE both 0.5 wt%). A sample was placed between two glass plates and cured for 2 min using blue light (1100 mW) from a Bluephase® light probe (Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein). The polymer matrix prevents the tetragonal crystals from undergoing phase transformation. Such samples are termed matrix-dispersed zirconia. The cured samples were then subjected directly to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement for phase analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998311434359"><title>Test of potential photoacid generators in solvent</title>
<p>In a glove box (&lt;10 ppm water), 200 mg of zirconia particles and 150 mg of photoacid generator (PAG) were weighed into a glass flask (A total of 100 mg of LiOH was added to the samples with PAGs, which only releases a proton. OH<sup>−</sup> from the LiOH will react with the proton under formation of water.). Then, 21 g of methanol was added. The suspension was exposed to 22 h of UV (BlueWaveTM 50, Dymax Corp., CT, USA) while stirred with a magnetic stirring bar. The suspension was filtered and dried in vacuum. The samples were matrix dispersed as described above.</p>

<p>In a glove box, 200 mg of zirconia particles was mixed with 100 mg of 2-(4-methoxystyryl)-4,6-<italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine (CAS number: 42573-57-9) in 5 mL of anhydrous methanol, and the methanol was evaporated. The dried zirconia powder was dispersed in the dimethacrylate matrix as described above, with prolonged curing, and subjected to XRD measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311434359"><title>HCl yield</title>
<p>One gram of 2-(4-methoxystyryl)-4,6-<italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine) was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol and the solution was irradiated with the light from a Bluephase® light probe for 20 min. To this, 0.5 M of AgNO<sub>3</sub> was added in order to precipitate the formed HCl. The precipitate was filtered and dried.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311434359"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>XRD patterns were scanned in steps of 0.05 (2<italic>θ</italic>), with the 2<italic>θ</italic> range from 20° to 60° (STOE &amp; Cie GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) with a Cu source. The energy-dispersive Kevex detector was tuned to the Cu-Kα energy (8.04 keV). The XRD patterns were analyzed using WinXPOW software. The tetragonal and monoclinic volume fractions (<italic>v</italic><sub>t</sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub>m</sub>) were calculated from the integral intensities of the monoclinic diffraction lines (−1 1 1) and (1 1 1) and the tetragonal diffraction line (1 0 1), following the procedure proposed by Toraya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311434359">15</xref></sup> The XRD patterns are run such that the typical reliability indices are below 0.03, which insures that a typical standard deviation on intensity ratio, <italic>X</italic><sub>m</sub>, is of the order 1% or less, which translates to a similar error in the volume fractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311434359">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The attenuation in the matrix-dispersed material is dependent on the element number of the atoms in the sample. The attenuation increases with Z<sup>4</sup>. In the analyzed composites, the X-rays will reach the zirconia particles hundreds of micrometers below the surface of the sample. Since the zirconia crystals are small (∼5.5 nm), the X-ray will penetrate at least 10<sup>4</sup> crystals and ∼10<sup>2</sup> particles. The XRD data will thus be dominated by the bulk.</p>
<p>The data are based on single specimens.</p>

<p>The XRD patterns from the water test are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311434359">Figure 1</xref>. It is observed that the reference sample only contains traces of the monoclinic phase prior to exposure to water and the tetragonal (1 0 1) reflection of zirconia at 2<italic>θ</italic> = 30.2° is dominating. The broad peaks in the XRD patterns are a result of small crystal sizes. After exposure to a phase transformation initiator, the two monoclinic reflections (−1 1 1) and (1 1 1) at 28.2° and 31.5° (2<italic>θ</italic> angle) grow in intensity and the (1 0 1) reflection decreases, indicating a t→m transformation. From the tests of potential transformation initiators, it was observed that water and HCl are best at initiate phase transformation. HF and NH<sub>3</sub> initiate less phase transformation. HBr was also tested and showed a tendency to initiate the transformation. It has previously been shown that analysis of the limited 2<italic>θ</italic> range used here is sufficient to quantitatively analyze the t→m transformation and that no change in crystal size occurs.

<sec id="sec13-0021998311434359"><title>Qualitative assessment of phase transformation initiators</title>
<p>A number of molecules are found to initiate the t→m phase transformation: H<sub>2</sub>O, HCl, HF, and NH<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434359">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311434359">Figure 1</xref>). The most effective of those are water and HCl, with a tendency that water induces more phase transformation than HCl and that an aqueous solution of HCl results in the highest <italic>v</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311434359">Figure 2</xref>). Sato and Shimada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311434359">16</xref></sup> also found that an aqueous solution of HCl had a little higher degradable effect on tetragonal zirconia compared with pure water. The transformation mechanism is, however, controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311434359">17</xref></sup> and a discussion is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>The phase transformation is not, to our knowledge, initiated by any organic solvent, not even after boiling for 48 h (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434359">Table 1</xref>). This is in contrast to the results published by Sato and Shimada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311434359">16</xref></sup> who found that solvents with a lone pair all have a degrading effect on tetragonal zirconia. However, in the study by Sato and Shimada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311434359">16</xref></sup> the water content in the tested solvents were as high as 15,000 ppm, whereas in this study, anhydrous solvents with a water content of &lt;0.005 ppm are used. Also, a number of bases and acids were tested and no phase transformation was found. Apparently, the initiator molecules need to be a proton donor and also provide a small nucleophile to initiate the phase transformation. LiCl or LiOH do, for instance, not initiate the phase transformation and the same is the case for carboxylic and sulfonic acids. Phase transformation to a small extent is, however, observed as a result of exposure to organic acids. This is a result of formation of measurable amounts of water (Karl Fischer titrator, Metrohm Ltd, Herisau, Switzerland) due to condensation reactions with the OH groups on the zirconia surface. It is also, previously, shown that the zirconia does not transform as a result of exposure to phosphoric or sulfuric acid. These acids actually stabilize the metastable tetragonal phase toward water initiated phase transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311434359">14</xref></sup> These results confirm the above notion that the initiator has to be a proton donor as well as provide a small nucleophile in order to induce the t→m phase transformation. For both water and HCl, a strong correlation between the concentration of initiator molecules and the monoclinic volume fraction in the sample was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311434359">Figure 2</xref>). Based on several experiments in various solvents it is observed that the degree of phase transformation appears to be more dependent on the initiator–zirconia ratio than on the initiator concentration in the solvent (data not shown). It is also found that the phase transformation is dependent upon the activity of the initiator molecule. Thus, the zirconia particles phase transform to a higher degree when exposed to humidity in the atmosphere or water in solvents such as methanol than in the more hydrophobic dimethacrylate matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434359">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311434359">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311434359">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>Molecules, which generate acid upon exposure to radiation, are called PAGs. A large number of PAGs are known because of their wide applications, especially in the field of photolithography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311434359">19</xref></sup> PAGs split into two radicals, which form a strong acid after chemical reaction with each other or the medium. They can be used to initiate the phase transformation if one of the formed radicals is either hydroxide or halogen radical. These radicals will abstract hydrogen from either the monomer or another PAG molecule during the curing, resulting in the formation of initiator molecules (HX).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311434359">20</xref></sup> PAGs were selected for their ability to form either water or HCl, because of the conclusion that these two molecules induce phase transformation the most. From the screening of potential PAGs it was found that 2-(4-methoxystyryl)-4,6-<italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine caused phase transformation the most. Consequently, the ability of triazine to phase transform matrix dispersed tetragonal zirconia was tested. It was found that a phase transformation in the tetragonal zirconia powder can be induced and that a <italic>v</italic><sub>m</sub> of 0.6 was observed after 30 min of exposure to the blue light.</p>
<p>The yield of HCl from the triazine is low, only 2.8% of the expected yield after 20 min. The polymerization is fast and when the polymer reaches the glass transition, the mobility of the initiator molecule is decreased. It is, here, necessary to point out that triazine used is not the most optimal one for the system, but the commercially available 2-(4-methoxystyryl)-4,6-<italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine, which has a <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> of 379 nm. This is not the optimal value as the light probe (Bluephase®) used for these experiments has a wavelength range of 430–490 nm. It is expected that the system can be optimized by finding (or developing) a small PAG with <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> ∼460 nm, which releases an initiator molecule. It may furthermore be important to decrease the diffusion distance to diminish the necessary PAG amount by placing the PAG as close as possible to the zirconia surface. This is the rationale for dissolving the triazine in methanol and subsequently evaporating the methanol in an effort to precipitate the triazine on the surface of zirconia. This will presumably generate the HCl as close to the zirconia surface as possible. It has furthermore been proved that the methanol treatment is important in order to inhibit the competing reaction between the formed initiator molecule and surface carbonates. This reaction limits the phase transformation initiation through reduction of initiator molecules reaching the zirconia surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311434359">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Triazines are large yellow molecules, which is the reason for the sensitivity toward blue light. This leads to discoloration of the cured resin due to the need for large amounts of triazine to initiate the phase transformation of zirconia. Preferably, the zirconia should be transformed before the resin reaches the glassy state, since at this stage, the expanding filler will have the maximum effect on the overall shrinkage. A high concentration of triazine is needed to insure that a sufficient amount of initiator molecules reach the zirconia surface. This amount can, of course, be limited by the use of a more optimal PAG with a better adapted λ<sub>max</sub>, since this should give a higher HCl yield. The most ideal would, of course, be a HCl yield of 100%, which would allow the use of the lowest PAG concentration.</p>
<p>As a result of the photoactivation, the composite turns brown. For optimization of this system, there is a need for a photobleaching PAG. This could, for instance, be a merocyanine dye linked <italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311434359">22</xref></sup> These molecules are photobleaching and have <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> in the region 400–500 nm. This will result in a higher HCl yield but the high molecular weight of this compound is a drawback due to need for large amounts to initiate the phase transformation. It is furthermore important that the added PAG does not compromise the mechanical properties of the composite. However, since the PAG and the polymer matrix will copolymerize and the PAG should be added in small amounts, this is of limited concern. This underlines the importance of the adaption of <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> even further.</p>
<p>Besides the low HCl yield from the triazine, another reason for the slow phase transformation may be due to the fact that the diffusion rate of HCl in the curing dimethacrylate matrix is low. This will increase the time for the formed HCl molecules to reach the zirconia surface. The mobility of the radicals is highly affected by the viscosity of the system. Dental composites are highly viscous systems, where both high filler content and monomers contribute to the viscosity. When the resin is cured, viscosity is significantly increased. This leads to substantial increases of lifetime of the generated radicals. The half-life of the radicals at a degree of polymerization of 40% is 4 s, which increases to 30 s at 60%. Polymerization of commercial resin composite restoratives normally stops at 60–80% conversion at RT. At this conversion, the half-life of the radicals is 53 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311434359">23</xref></sup> The experiments in this study were conducted at RT due practical limitations in the glove box. By increasing the temperature to 37°C, the radicals are able to diffuse at higher rates. This will most likely lead to a higher degree of phase transformation of the tetragonal zirconia. Furthermore, a dental filling will absorb water from saliva, which over a time is expected to lead to further phase transformation because of diffusion of water through the composite. However, the phase transformation is too slow to be of commercial interest and the byproducts of the PAG are esthetically unacceptable and further investigations have to be conducted.</p>

<p>This study shows that photochemical release of an initiator for the t→m phase transformation is possible in a dental composite. During the investigations, it was found that out of the tested molecules, water and HCl induce most of the t→m transformation and that HF and NH<sub>3</sub> induce some. Water and HCl resulted in monoclinic volume fractions of 0.65 and 0.6, respectively, in the metastable zirconia samples. It was furthermore concluded that the phase transformation initiators need to be a proton donor and provide a small nucleophile in order to be able to induce transformation. Initial experiments with PAGs were performed and of the tested PAGs, triazines were the most promising. The tested PAGs were triazine, diphenyl idonium chloride, <italic>ortho</italic>-nitrobenzylalcohol and two sulfonium salts. It was found that it was possible to phase transform zirconia in resin by exposure to blue light by adding 2-(4-methoxystyryl)-4,6-<italic>bis</italic>(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine to the composite. A monoclinic volume fraction of 0.6 was reached after a 30-min exposure.</p>
