<abstract>
<p>This article examines the practices, logics, and politics of foie gras production and consumption. It argues that scholars need to rethink both pain and sentience to account for the fact that ducks are responsive, and not just reactive. Rather than using the capacities of animals to judge when power relations between species are acceptable, it suggests that scholars should start with the power relations themselves to account for how animal and human experiences are made.</p>

<body>
<p>In April 2006, the Chicago City Council passed legislation that banned the sale of foie gras within city limits. Two years later, the council reversed itself and rescinded the ban, citing concerns about the overreach of council authority and the fact that Chicago had become, in the words of Mayor Richard Daley, the “laughingstock of the nation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911398049">1</xref></sup> Tellingly, both the ban and its repeal were passed through parliamentary maneuverings that ensured that no formal debates took place. The initial ban was slipped into broader package of legislation, while its subsequent repeal used parliamentary tactics to prevent any discussion on the floor.</p>
<p>If there was little official debate, a lively public discussion over foie gras did occur, addressing both its production and its consumption. Animal welfare and animal rights groups argued for its symbolic importance in a city once famous for its meatpacking industry, hoping a ban could usher in a broader reconsideration of meat production. Famous chefs in the city clashed publicly, with some protesting the ban by running what one chef called “duckeasies.” A famous Chicago hot dog establishment, Hot Doug’s, openly flouted the ban and foie gras’s fine-dining reputation, serving a foie gras hot dog and receiving the first foie gras ticket for $250. Coming on the heels of legislation banning smoking in Chicago bars and gun-control ordinances, a vocal libertarian contingent saw the ban on foie gras as an unwarranted political intervention into the economic and lifestyle choices of individuals. Many people thought the entire matter was a waste of time, compared to the more pressing problems of crime and poverty facing the city.</p>
<p>In sometimes unpredictable ways, the actions of the ducks and geese out of whose bodies foie gras is made were translated into these debates. More than just a neutral vehicle for the expression of preexisting political views, the very meanings of sentience and pain in these birds were a critical pole in public discussion. Did the ostensibly “natural” behavior of geese and ducks in the wild authorize certain kinds of treatments under domestication? Could we substitute their behavior in captivity for verbal assent or dissent? How much did the biological constitution of their bodies, such as the presence or absence of a gag reflex, matter in judging cruelty? Was pain a category that could seamlessly be read across human and bird experiences?</p>
<p>What united most voices was the assumption that it is possible to derive an appropriate ethical and political stance toward ducks and geese based on their biological capacities, or lack thereof. For animal rights advocates,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911398049">2</xref></sup> the capacity for sentience, associated with the ability to feel pain, was the baseline for arguments against foie gras based on cruelty. For defenders of foie gras, a variety of natural capacities constituted the grounds for accepting the practice: ducks are unlike humans in a way that would mean they qualify as political subjects worthy of protection, and their evolved capacities to overeat in preparation for winter migration suggest an authorization for force-feeding them in captivity.</p>
<p>After reviewing the different production processes involved in foie gras, the article advances an alternative framework for thinking about foie gras production and consumption. Rather than using the capacities of animals as an answer to the question of when and which power relations between species are acceptable, I suggest that we should start with the power relations themselves and seek instead to understand how power produces subjectivities—understood in broad terms—across species lines. In doing so, I grant analytic (but not biological or political) equality to the experiences of humans and ducks as effects of power and then seek to explain how those experiences are differently produced in specific contexts. I argue that ethical, and to a lesser extent traditional, forms of foie gras production can legitimately encounter ducks as responsive, rather that just reactive, agents and therefore able to accept certain forms of pain. At the same time, I suggest that there is also an uncomfortable biopolitical connection between the process of gavage and the logics involved in making ducks killable, one that stretches beyond the foie gras context to meat production more generally.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911398049">
<title>What Is Foie Gras?</title>
<p>Foie gras, translated from the French, means “fatty liver,” referring to the enlarged liver of a goose or duck.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911398049">3</xref></sup> However, a more accurate term is “fattened liver,” since the birds must be actively induced or forced to overeat through a process called “gavage” (or cramming) to produce an enlarged liver up to ten times the normal size. Historically, foie gras was produced from geese, but most foie gras is now produced from ducks. This shift is due primarily to the greater economic efficiency of raising ducks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911398049">Ginor et al. (1999)</xref> note that geese do not breed year-round (unlike ducks), which means that the seasons must be simulated through careful regulation of indoor lighting to induce breeding. It is also more difficult to keep large numbers of geese in one location than with ducks because of greater health risks. The throats of geese are more fragile than those of ducks, leading to higher labor costs and greater mortality rates among the birds. In France, the world’s biggest consumer of foie gras, 94 percent of foie gras now comes from ducks and only 6 percent comes from geese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911398049">Le Neindre et al. 1998</xref>, 16).</p>
<p>Foie gras consumption in the United States has grown over the past twenty years from almost zero to 420 tons per year in 2005, almost of all which (95 percent) is consumed in urban “fine-dining” establishments. Consumption of foie gras in the United States still remains small compared to in France, which consumes 17,500 tons annually. Most foie gras consumed in the United States is nonetheless produced domestically, in California and New York.</p>
<p>There are three general methods of producing foie gras: traditional, industrial, and ethical (or humane). The traditional method, mostly employed by the few U.S. producers, entails keeping the birds in small groups and feeding them individually by hand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911398049">4</xref></sup> The ducks are initially hatched, raised, and fed in conventional fashion. Twelve to fourteen weeks after hatching, they are brought into feeding barns where gavage begins. The birds are fed a corn-based mixture, by inserting a tube with a funnel on one end down the esophagus of the bird. The person doing the feeding then turns on an electric motor connected to a wire auger, which pushes the feed down the tube into the bird’s crop. The feeding lasts approximately thirty seconds to one minute and takes place two to three times a day for ducks and four times a day for geese. The process lasts between four and five weeks, before the birds are sent to the slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>A second method of gavage is an industrial one. Here, to facilitate feeding, the birds are kept individually in small cages, rather than in groups. Whereas the traditional method involves the same person tending to a smaller group of ducks, the industrial method allows one individual to tend to between eight hundred and one thousand ducks per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911398049">Ginor et al. 1999</xref>, 80). Using a pneumatic pressure feeder rather than a wire auger, each bird can be fed in a few seconds. The birds are ready for slaughter after only two weeks, which reduces labor costs and increases overall productivity. However, industrial foie gras is an inferior product in terms of taste and size, and most industrial foie gras is therefore used for pâtés and canned products rather than served as meat in restaurants.</p>
<p>Animal welfare advocates argue that the practice of force-feeding geese is cruel in both traditional and industrial methods. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) document situations in which they claim that significant damage is caused to the esophagus by the insertion of the tube and point out that geese with massively swollen livers are sometimes unable to walk or breathe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911398049">Cook 2007</xref>, 264). Moreover, for a variety of health-related reasons, the mortality rate of force-fed birds is up to twenty times greater than that of non-force-fed ducks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911398049">Baker and Zhang 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A third, newer form of foie gras production is ethical (or humane) foie gras. The humane method involves no force-feeding. Instead, it allows the birds to overeat on their own, drawing on the “natural” inclination of birds to fatten up to create energy reserves for winter migrations. The size of the goose liver is substantially smaller than in the other methods (the liver is only two to three times its normal size), the product can be obtained only seasonally near migration times, and the quality of the product remains an open question. Producers of ethical foie gras include a Spanish company and a company in South Dakota. The Spanish product surprisingly won the “best foie gras” award at the Paris International Food Salon in 2006, though the French Professional Committee of Foie Gras Producers suggested that ethical foie gras was not “actually” foie gras since it was not produced using gavage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911398049">5</xref></sup> Following French convention, this product is generally labeled “fatty goose liver” rather than foie gras in the United States since, according to French law, “foie gras” applies only to livers that are produced by force-feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911398049">6</xref></sup> Therefore, this free-range, seasonal version remains, as a BBC reporter puts it, the “holy grail” of foie gras—trying to square fully the competing demands for perfect taste and ethical treatment—and it represents a tiny percentage of the market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911398049">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>And Say the Duck Responded?</title>
<p>In public debates and political discussion over Chicago’s ban, animal rights advocates vociferously argued for considering ducks and geese as sentient creatures capable of feeling pain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911398049">8</xref></sup> Foie gras advocates, meanwhile, levied a series of counterclaims that emphasized various biological and physiological facets of species uniqueness: ducks are not people. Yet to make this case, defenders of foie gras also repeatedly introduced the “natural” behavior of ducks as evidence to ground their claims about domesticated birds, and some suggestively read ducks as volitional agents capable of authorizing human practices toward them. Similarly, even as animal rights advocates emphasized a basic continuity between humans and animals on the biological qualities of sentience and pain, they also introduced strong differentiations between nature and culture, relying on the one-way projection of a moral reasoning and capacity-based empathy onto nonhuman animals who lack those very qualities. Caught between these slightly muddled poles of human–animal and nature–culture, those without declared positions tried to grapple with the ethical considerations of animal treatment and to translate this into adequate political response to the problem of responsible consumption. Mirroring the tangled debates over sameness–difference that run through a variety of other political discourses, they tried to work through two arguments with respect to species: the claims that ducks are like humans when it comes to pain and sentience and that ducks are different from humans in many other ways that should be relevant to the debate, including the lack of a gag reflex and the ability to endure swollen livers, driven by the desire to prepare for winter migration.</p>
<p>What many commentators largely assumed is that an adequately thick and accurate description of animal capacities such as pain or sentience would be sufficient to ground a political stance toward foie gras. Not only is such a description difficult without recourse to thicker concepts such as “nature” or “torture,” but it also assumes that power relations among species have no constitutive role to play in producing the kinds of animals and humans in question: the creation of interests, the places and ways where resistance is expressed, the different ways pain can be inhabited, and the production and channeling of desires to eat.</p>
<p>Central to the rather unequal relations between species in this context is an imaginary about animals and humans, in which ducks and geese are largely creatures defined by biological and natural reactions, while humans are taking part in what Jacques Derrida characterizes as “response”—the ability to use language in abstract and autonomous ways, or to use forms of metalanguage such as pretense or lying. The dichotomy between response and reaction is the premise of a public discussion about foie gras that involves only humans: ducks cannot participate, self-evidently, in such a debate, lacking language and, more importantly, lacking a capacity to respond autonomously.</p>
<p>For Derrida, the effects of the boundary between human and animal depend significantly on the kinds of questions that are asked of “the animal,” a general category that gathers up the diversity of life forms under a single heading. In the long tradition of Western political thought, which Derrida traces in a meandering fashion, Derrida suggests that we have asked variations of “can the animal speak?” or “can the animal reason?” As initially posed, this question—asked of a singular “animal”—was answered in the negative, with animals understood in Cartesian thought as machines or automatons. A more nuanced version of the question followed once this view of animals as lacking communication, culture, and experience itself broke down. On Derrida’s reading, at the moment when humanist political thought admitted that “the animal” was, in fact, capable of language, it reframed the question by distinguishing between response and reaction. Whereas animals may be capable of reaction, in the sense of using language or other communicative signals in reaction to outside stimulus, this second-order humanism suggests that the animals does not have “the power to <italic>respond</italic>: to <italic>pretend</italic>, to <italic>lie</italic>, to <italic>cover its tracks</italic> or <italic>erase</italic> its own traces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911398049">Derrida 2008</xref>, 33). But Derrida is skeptical that humans even have this ability:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it is <italic>not just</italic> a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power. . . . It <italic>also</italic> means asking whether what calls itself human has the right to attribute to man, which means therefore to attribute to himself, what he refuses the animal, and whether he can ever possess the <italic>pure, rigorous, indivisible</italic> concept, as such, of that attribution. Thus were we even to suppose—something I am not ready to concede—that the “animal” was incapable of covering its tracks [i.e., “responding”], by what right could one concede that power to the human?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Humans do not have the power to erase their own “traces” or tracks (which Derrida uses to refer to the way that signifying processes such as language always exceed our intentions exclusions and absences created by signifying processes) in their responses anymore than the animals that we claim cannot respond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911398049">9</xref></sup> Although “it is inherent to a trace that it is always being erased and always capable of being erased . . . , this . . . does not mean that someone, God, human or animal can be its master subject and possess the power to erase it” (p. 136); rather, “traces erase (themselves)” (p. 136), operating essentially behind our backs.</p>
<p>Moreover, what we think of as response tends to contain elements of reaction in it, such as the repetitive moments in unconscious thought. What we think of as pure reaction, such as a bee reacting to a chemical signal from another bee, is often, on closer examination, more like response than we might think. Derrida, in an amusing turn of events, even chides his philosophical interlocutors for not presenting sufficient ethological evidence, or even personal testimony of encounters with animals, in their considerations of animal life (p. 133).</p>
<p>The breakdown of the response–reaction dichotomy, Derrida suggests, “affects all the solid oppositions that we are in the process of tracking down, beginning with that between the symbolic and imaginary, which underwrites, finally, this whole anthropocentric reinstitution of the superiority of the human order over the animal order” (p. 136). When we suggest that animals cannot respond, Derrida points out that we are denying them a kind of response that not even we have. In turn, what we think of as animal “reaction” might more properly understood of as a kind of response, if that term can be rethought outside of the human–animal dichotomy. Thus, in this context, “it would not be a matter of ‘giving speech back’ to animals, but perhaps of acceding to a thinking, however fabulous and chimerical it might be, that thinks the absence of the name and the word otherwise, <italic>as something other than a privation</italic>” (p. 48).</p>
<p>To think about animals such as ducks and geese in these terms requires both a broadening of horizons when it comes to communication and signification and a greater humility about the autonomy and power of human language. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912911398049">Cary Wolfe (2003a</xref>, 79) puts it,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The difference in <italic>kind</italic> between human and animal that humanism constitutes on the site of language may instead be thought as difference in <italic>degree</italic> on a continuum of signifying processes disseminated in the field of materiality, technicity, and contingency, of which “human” “language” is but a specific (albeit highly refined) instance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The next two sections of this article aim to take up Derrida’s challenge to rethink animal life on these terms by assuming that the question “and say the duck responded?” is more than a provocation, but one that can be answered in a qualified affirmative. I do so by working through two categories central to the possibility of animal response in relation to human actions: pain and subjective experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1065912911398049">
<title>Pain and Context</title>
<p>Animal rights philosophers, most prominently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911398049">Peter Singer (1990)</xref>, have started with the assumption that industrial meat production treats animals as objects or as raw materials for production, an idea that is echoed by animal welfare advocates like the ALDF and PETA. Singer suggests that rather than using species membership as the criterion for how we treat animals, we should use capacities, most importantly the capacity to feel pain, to judge how we treat all forms of life. If minimizing suffering is something that we accept for humans, Singer argues that we need to do the same for animals. Although there are physiological differences between animals that make the same action result in different amounts of pain being felt, Singer nonetheless insists that it is possible to measure pain as a kind of universal currency across species lines. Therefore, “if we consider it wrong to inflict . . . pain on a baby for no good reason, then we must, unless we are speciesists, consider it equally wrong to inflict the same amount of pain on a horse for no good reason” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911398049">Singer 1990</xref>, 15). When applied, this argument for minimizing suffering leads to a rejection of factory farming, animal experimentation, and hunting.</p>
<p>But pain is not just an objective biological category that is amenable to precise scientific measurement. Rather, it is also an idea, and like all ideas it changes in meaning over time. Singer’s argument about pain reflects a particular modern understanding of pain that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911398049">Talal Assad (2003</xref>, 67-99) calls secular pain. Tracing the shifting meanings of pain, Assad suggests that secularized pain across species lines came to be understood in the Victorian era as a passive, private, and brute physiological experience that, among other things, denied the possibility of agency to the sufferer. Here, pain is a universal common denominator, drawing from Jeremy Bentham’s view that “subjective experiences of pain can be objectively compared” (p. 108).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911398049">10</xref></sup> It is also only an object that must be escaped (as a consequence of its inarticulate and nonsocial character) but can never be actively inhabited. Because inflicting secular pain is something that modern societies understand to be cruel and undesirable as such, Assad also suggests that the infliction of pain requires particular forms of legitimation or denial, and not just its outright performance. That is, justification for inflicting secular pain is required: “[T]he modern conscience regards the inflicting of pain ‘without good reason’ (to perform a medical operation, say, or to slaughter animals for meat) as reprehensible, and therefore as an object of moral condemnation” (p. 106).</p>
<p>Although Assad assumes that slaughtering animals for meat is already a “good reason” and does not require further justification, the public discussions over foie gras apply the modern conscience that Assad describes to the more limited arena of gavage. Working within a modern view of pain, commenters on all sides sought to justify the practice of force-feeding ducks and geese, using strategies of anthropomorphism and naturalness to make their case. Though it does not compare pain across species lines, a 1998 European Union report on foie gras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911398049">Le Neindre et al. 1998</xref>) also operates within this vocabulary in its explicit comparisons of birds’ experiences of pain across production contexts. Just as human torture in modern states requires a rhetoric of denial (or must be justified as a policing activity in the interest of society) rather than inflicted as such (since pain itself is judged to be cruel, in the terms specified above), so too must the infliction of pain on animals by explained by “good reasons.”</p>
<p>While the modern view of pain enables a political discussion of cruelty toward animals, it forecloses the possibilities for recognizing animal agency. In contrast to secular, modern pain, Assad introduces the idea of agentive pain, which is useful for thinking about the pain of ducks and geese in foie gras, as I discuss below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>to suffer (physical or mental pain, humiliation, deprivation) is, so we usually think, to be in a passive state—to be an object not a subject. One readily allows that pain may be a cause for action (seeking to end the suffering, say), but one does not normally think of it as action itself. . . . Yet one can think of pain not merely as a passive state (although it can be just that) but as itself agentive. (p. 79)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, the modern view of pain ultimately misunderstands the ways in which it is culturally and socially specific, the ways in which it has a public and relational rather than private character, and the ways in which it can be actively, not passively, experienced by a person or animal. Though Assad does not make the leap to animals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911398049">Derrida (2008)</xref> does pick up this thread, suggesting that in casting animal rights in Benthamite terms of the question “can they suffer?” we too readily deny animals the possibility of responding in an active and agentic way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911398049">11</xref></sup> That is, by assuming that pain exists as a brute reality in geese and ducks, animal rights advocates are able to make the case for their humane treatment as passive sufferers, but this move also undermines an acknowledgment of their capacity to inhabit pain in an agentic way. In spite of strategic arguments to the contrary, acknowledging the agency of animals is also a goal of animal rights advocates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911398049">12</xref></sup> If the secular pain sees pain as a reaction to a stimulus, measurable in principle across all animal bodies, then an agentive view of pain directs us to think about it as a form of response, something inhabited and interpreted by specific animals rather than by animals as such, and not easily calculable or comparable in its reduction to “reaction.”</p>
<p>Moreover, by retaining an emphasis on secular pain as a biological capacity that generates our political activities toward animals, animal rights advocates create the possibility of factory farms responding to this critique by biologically engineering pain away or medicating it away.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911398049">13</xref></sup> Because biological capacities are increasingly open to modification or manipulation, and because modern societies are already oriented toward managing and minimizing pain in the brute physiological sense, the pain of ducks and geese can be dealt with along already-existing axes of biopolitics—that is, politics that is aimed toward biological life “as such” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911398049">Rose 2001</xref>). In biopolitics, animals are understood as living beings, but also as no more than life as such. This way of thinking about the continuity of animals and humans as only biological life forms an extension of contemporary biopolitics that undermines the possibility of qualified life such as political life.</p>
<p>An agentive possibility of pain, by contrast, opens the door for a consideration of nonhuman animals as bearers of more than biological life, as forms of qualified life that humans must encounter and consider in contexts such as foie gras. By thinking of pain as something that can be inhabited agentively, we can see that the interests of mulard ducks are not reducible to their capacity to feel brute pain but are instead related to the construction of their experience of the world, one in which multiple experiences of pain are possible.</p>
<p>On the specific question of gavage (leaving aside, for the moment, the political ethics of killing other animals), mulard ducks may indeed sometimes accept gavage, and some of the associated forms of pain that go along with a swollen liver, but not many of the other practices associated with industrial forms of foie gras production or in the abusive moments in traditional foie gras production. Moreover, as documented by animal rights groups, the excessive force of industrial foie gras creates specific kinds of pain that the ducks actively resist and creates bodily harm beyond that which they are produced to endure or accept. But by casting their arguments solely on biological grounds of pain, understood in secular terms, ducks and geese continue to be represented as nothing more than biological life that feels pain or suffer. “War is waged,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911398049">Derrida (2008</xref>, 29) puts it, “over the matter of pity,” but the possibility of encountering animals as complex beings who can interpret and act on their own worlds is foreclosed.</p>
<p>Even if ducks were biologically engineered to feel no pain whatsoever, they would retain a form of sentience—a subjective experience of the world, rooted in a context of power relations between birds and humans, but not reducible to human domination. Would this life matter? How can we think about the sentient experiences of animals in the different contexts of foie gras production?</p>

<title>Sentience and Power in Meat Production</title>
<p>Alongside raising the issue of pain, a second staple of animal rights arguments is that factory farms disavow animal sentience and that this in turn enables the instrumental treatment of cattle, pigs, chickens, and other animals as commodified material objects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912911398049">Williams [2004]</xref> for a review). On this view, the treatments of animals as resources and of animals as sentient subjects are mutually exclusive. However, a growing body of literature argues that industrial meat production and animal subjectivity have not always been diametrically opposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911398049">Wadiwel 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912911398049">Williams 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911398049">Novek 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911398049">Holloway 2007</xref>). Instead, drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911398049">Michel Foucault (1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911398049">1978)</xref>, these authors suggest instead that industrial agriculture has already recognized animal sentience for reasons of its own and has long since moved from a treatment of animals as objects to accepting their subjective experience and steering those experiences in ways that are profitable and expedient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911398049">14</xref></sup> On these readings, the docility of sentient, domesticated animals is a valuable commodity, both because it is more cost-effective than direct coercion and because it ensures a higher-quality product.</p>
<p>On the floors of animal production facilities, animals may refuse to enter the slaughterhouse in an orderly fashion, have high levels of stress that lead to reduced quality of meat, or develop involuntary pathologies (tail biting by pigs or birds feather pecking each other or themselves). These voluntary and involuntary forms of resistance to industrial production practices have been met by techniques that openly acknowledge, manage, and discipline animal sentience rather than reject its existence outright. These techniques include the careful organization of space on the floors (by separating and crating individual animals); surveillance and data collection on animal health, sexuality, and reproduction; the creation of optically deceptive technologies designed to ensure quiet and compliant entry into the slaughterhouse; and the administration of antibiotics and other pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>A better approach to thinking about foie gras production might thus involve looking at how animal sentience is produced through power relations and where it is resisted, by granting human and animal experiences analytic (though not necessarily political or biological) equality. Such an approach permits exploration of two things that are obscured by assuming an opposition between sentience and meat production. First, it allows a tracing and explanation of how power functions in the context of foie gras by working on how animals understand themselves and therefore understand their interests. By specifying how power produces sentience, then, it is possible to offer an alternative account of human–animal relations that does not ground animal interests either in a generalized category of “animal” or in opposition to human domination. Second, this approach also opens the possibility of inquiring into the ways that biopolitical strategies are developed across both human and animal arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911398049">Shukin 2009</xref>). The treatments of animals and humans as purely biological life are linked in various ways—for example, the transferring of techniques and knowledge developed in scientific research on animals to human populations and the use of violence against some people by treating them as animals, in the name of biological life as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911398049">Dillon and Reid 2009</xref>). It is therefore important to think about the logics that span the human–animal divide. In thinking about ethical foie gras below, there are affinities between the discourses of autonomy and responsibility surrounding human obesity and the politics of food and the ways that we think about the autonomy of ducks who overeat themselves into a state of near-disease.</p>
<p>Bringing this perspective to foie gras pushes us, then, to understand the specifics of how meat production processes actually work by acknowledging, managing, and disciplining animal sentience, not by rejecting it. Such disciplinary practices are found across the three methods of foie gras production. For example, Michael Ginor, cofounder of a foie gras operation in New Jersey (which uses the “traditional” method of raising birds for foie gras), notes the way that the stress level of ducks and their capacity to recognize humans are carefully accounted for and managed during gavage:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The first day of feeding is the highest-stress stage of the process, largely due to the fact that the ducks have never before been in close contact with humans or fed by hand. . . . Many of the feeders are women, because the farmers have found that they are gentler and more patient with ducks than are men. Once a feeder has been assigned to a group of ducks, absolutely no other person is allowed to handle them. Studies have shown that the birds recognize people by their faces and by the touch of their hands, and they become stressed if feeding is attempted by anyone other than their regular feeder. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911398049">Ginor et al. 1999</xref>, 78)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ginor et al. also note that lighting systems are set up to mimic the spring sunlight conditions during which ducks mate, which pushes them to reproduce at “maximum potential” (p. 77). A virtual rendering of nature is set up to direct their desires at the appropriate time and frequency. Housing for birds is likewise carefully designed to achieve “a balance between design and performance criteria”—in the industrial method, for example, the small cages have been changed from a flat floor to a trough shape to reduce blisters on the breasts of the ducks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911398049">Le Neindre et al. 1998</xref>, 23). A vast array of scientific experiments and investigations consider everything from the effects of force-feeding on hormones to the specific chemical composition of the liver based on feeding methods. Through these processes, ducks are steered toward channeling their life energies into biological productivity, but in ways that they themselves sometimes accept and internalize as a routinized activity, rather than regularly and repeatedly resist.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the techniques that minimize stress among the birds (which leads to higher quality foie gras) is judged by the efforts that ducks put into coping behaviors and verbalizations, suggesting that although ducks surely do not speak back using human language, they are nonetheless responsive subjects who, at a minimum, exhibit forms of resistance. This calls into question the ostensible inarticulacy of ducks to testify about their welfare. As the report adopted by the European Union on foie gras notes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[M]any agree that welfare particularly concerns what an individual animal feels, but think that the techniques to measure feelings are not very well developed at the present time. Techniques to measure the effort an animal is putting into coping with a situation are better developed and, since this should be correlated with feelings . . . current research should concentrate on these measures as indicators of welfare. The most commonly used welfare indicators are measures of health [e.g., diseases, physical damage], production [physical growth, reproduction], physiology [stress], and behavior [retreat, avoidance behaviors, stereotypes]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911398049">Le Neindre et al. 1998</xref>, 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Proponents and producers of traditional foie gras likewise defend gavage by suggesting that geese do not find the force-feeding practice objectionable, as evidenced by their behavior around feeding time. Food writer Josephine Bacon observes that “they enjoy [being force fed in the traditional method], they love being petted and cuddled while it’s being done.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911398049">15</xref></sup> On his television show, celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain visits the Hudson Valley production facility and interviews a veterinarian, who suggests that ducks are less stressed by force-feeding than they are in the wild. He follows this interview with clips of ducks lining up for feeding time and says, “Look at these happy-go-lucky little guys, they love it, here you go quacky, don’t shove!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911398049">16</xref></sup> Like the production process itself, public defenses of the process tend to assume that ducks are not objects but rather animal subjects, capable of displaying emotions that testify to their inner mental states.</p>
<p>Yet arguably, these ducks who seem to acquiesce happily to gavage are simply unaware of their own interests, blithely supplying their biological energies to a process that they do not know (or cannot know) the end to. Put in political terms, perhaps there is a structural inequality here in which ducks suffer from a form of false consciousness that prevents them from acting in their true interests by struggling at feeding time. On such an account, the natural behavior of ducks in a situation of freedom (“the wild”) might be the baseline for judging what those true interests are, and a faithful interspecies politics would involve animal rights or animal welfare groups giving voice to those interests. Contra Bourdain, the happy-go-lucky ducks might tell us nothing themselves about their interests.</p>
<p>Above and beyond the obvious limitations of the false consciousness metaphor as applied to ducks rather than humans, this structural argument is problematic at a more fundamental level. It assumes that ducks have discernible objective interests given by nature and that these interests form a baseline that no amount of social interaction or biological manipulation can change. This assumption is particularly complicated in the instance of mulard ducks, from which most foie gras comes. Mulard ducks are hybrids of Pekin duck females and Muscovy duck males. Because these two species of duck are sexually incompatible and their offspring are sterile, artificial insemination is necessary. Of the offspring, only the males are kept for foie gras, while the females are raised for regular duck meat. The advantage of mulard ducks, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911398049">Ginor et al. (1999</xref>, 76) explain, is that they have “strong bodies with large esophagi and, unlike geese, [are] relatively resistant to disease. Goose farmers had to separate each stage of production to guard against epidemics, but with the hardier ducks, farmers could house the entire operation under one roof. As a result, raising mulards [is] significantly easier and less expensive.” As such, there is no natural, in-the-wild instance from which their interests can be directly read. What, in other words, are the interests of animals who never came from nature and have no nature to go back to?</p>
<p>Moreover, the structural analogy to naturally occurring ducks undermines the aim of rethinking animals on specific terms rather than as “the animal” that Derrida suggests has functioned so problematically in political theory. To encounter ducks and geese as complex, multifaceted beings requires taking them on their own terms to the greatest extent possible, including the contexts in which they are born, live, and die and the ways that their desires and tendencies are produced. Because of their hybrid lineage, mulard ducks exhibit specific behaviors that not all ducks share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911398049">Le Neindre et al. 1998</xref>, 26). For example, from their Pekin lineage, they tend to avoid going into trees, move relatively slowly, and spend more time in water, while from their Muscovy side, they are particularly social animals and have claws. Unlike wild ducks, they are also unable to fly (though whether this is the result of nature or culture is unclear). Self-induced overeating for migratory purposes has been retained, even as the capacity to engage in flight migration has been removed.</p>
<p>Though cross-breeding in animal husbandry and agriculture has taken place for centuries (e.g., mules, to which “mulard” owes its etymological roots), striving to discern the objective interests of the mulard duck outside of captivity relies on an analogy rather than on actually existing counterparts of “wild mulards.” Mulard ducks indeed violate (or at least are an exception to) the dominant definition of species currently in place in biology, the biological species concept, which posits reproductive capability in the wild as the main criterion of species-hood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912911398049">Wilson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911398049">Mayr 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, because animal rights arguments tend to see all forms of gavage as coercive or structural relations of power that are rooted in a conception of natural interests, they have difficulty addressing the intersubjective nature of the process in both traditional and industrial modes of foie gras production. While the industrial mode is certainly organized around fundamental acts of direct coercion (forced caging and feeding and slaughter), it is not based on a rejection of sentience, so much as a management of that sentience whenever possible. There are, indeed, a wide variety of strong reasons to reject industrial meat production, including industrial foie gras. But advocating for acceptance of animal sentience as a bare capacity is unlikely to transform a system that already presupposes it and seeks to produce it in specific ways.</p>

<title>Ethical Foie Gras</title>
<p>The centrality of productive power is most evident in the relatively new emergence of ethical foie gras. This version of foie gras avoids coercive power entirely during the feeding period, by relying on the fact that quasi-wild ducks and geese will voluntarily overeat when food is put out at the right times of year. Because the birds cannot be force-fed the usual corn-based mixture by force-feeding, ethical foie gras pioneer Eduardo de Sousa makes available more attractive foods such as figs, nuts, acorns, and olives for his free-range birds to eat. The birds eat only as much as they choose and no more, and they do so only seasonally. Indeed, Sousa’s techniques are so appealing that he claims that wild geese fly in even from outside his farm and stay for the duration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1065912911398049">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under these conditions, it appears as ethical to simply provide the food and to consume the foie gras that results. These are “naturally greedy geese” whom we can hold responsible for their own actions, thereby absolving us of any lingering guilt when it comes to our own appetites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1065912911398049">18</xref></sup> In short, stipulating natural greed dissolves any further obligations or ethical questions about the productive power relations that might be involved.</p>
<p>Where is the exercise of power in ethical foie gras, then, if the ducks are freely choosing their activities? In part, the power comes in linguistic form, in the assignation of “nature” to mark the desires and appetites of the geese. But there is also a more subtle form of productive power, one that channels the desires and appetites of autonomously acting ducks and geese to do the work of overeating themselves. The birds do not understand the language of responsibility, and so in one sense the work they do on themselves is not “in the name of” their own health. Recalling Derrida’s argument above, where the absence of the word is not seen as a privation, it is possible instead to see that these ducks are, through an active inhabiting of the pain that comes from a swollen liver, working on themselves and their bodies.</p>
<p>Efforts to replicate the ethical foie gras experiment in the United States, based on this assumption that the narrative of natural greed was correct, ran into practical difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1065912911398049">19</xref></sup> One U.S. producer of ethical foie gras initially tried using geese who were born and bred in captivity and were raised on corn before being converted into free-range geese who could produce humane foie gras. Once converted, however, these geese no longer had the desire to gorge on the foods made available to them. It turned out that seasonal overeating for migration was a result of a cultural activation of biological nature, not nature itself, and the birds overate only when they were convinced from birth that they were free and wild. Rather than using incubators to hatch goslings, then, the geese had to be permitted to build their own nests and to hatch their own eggs to activate their proclivities to overeat. Even in ethical foie gras, where its ethicality rested on the naturalness of the practice, the autonomous pursuit of natural greed in ducks and geese has to be activated through careful “social” means.</p>
<p>The desire to ascribe responsibility to ducks based on nature—whether their own natural greed or the necessity of natural migration—stands in stark contrast to the way that contemporary debates about human obesity are structured. In humans, if obese individuals can be said to have autonomously chosen what to eat, then they are understood to be socially and legally responsible agents; by contrast, if obese individuals are impelled by genetic inheritance, natural evolution, or structural forces to pursue certain foods, then it is more difficult to understand them as responsible agents. Whereas nature is understood to deactivate agency as responsibility in human obesity (and must therefore be ascribed by legal systems or social norms), precisely the reverse is true in ethical foie gras, where those same natural drivers are understood to constitute legitimate authorization of the practice by the ducks. Nature for the free-ranging ducks in ethical foie gras is the very grounds for understanding them as responsible agents who can authorize their own swollen livers. Yet because nature in ethical foie gras is both simulated and socially made, the practice should raise the questions of ethics and power in an interspecific social context rather than hide them behind nature. In the absence of truly natural greed, ethical foie gras is nearly impossible, at least on the terms that it enters public debate.</p>
<p>The ethics of ethical foie gras are ultimately one of gazing at natural creatures with a form of regard, rather than ethics of relation, and therefore, duck the question of how the agency of ducks is activated in social ways rather than given by nature. Power relations between humans and animals are, at a minimum, not incompatible with ethical obligations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1065912911398049">20</xref></sup> However, thinking about such obligations requires engagements with interspecies relationships on the terrain of responsivity (the ability of animals and humans to respond) rather than ethical regard<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1065912911398049">21</xref></sup>—that is, to start our thinking about foie gras with the assumption that animal response is a possibility, on one hand, and yet to remember that what we mean by “response” is more complicated than what we assume it to mean in humans. Thinking about the possibility of animal response means expanding the concept to include nonlinguistic forms of expression and signification, such as those considered above. These elements of animal life convey more than a reaction—they are contingent, open-ended, and open to change and cannot be translated across contexts or generalized to species or the entire animal kingdom. Unlike a reaction, the response of a duck in the wild, for example, cannot stand in as a generalizable “reaction” for ducks in an industrial bird-raising operation or for ducks as a species. At the same time, the idea of interspecies responsivity suggests a different stance toward the place and conception of human language. Following Derrida, it means recognizing that human response includes elements of repetition and unthinking that we usually reserve for “the animal.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1065912911398049">22</xref></sup> In encountering animals who, to varying degrees, also display elements of reaction and repetition, we are encountering animals who are more like ourselves than we have previously admitted.</p>
<p>Industrial forms of foie gras plainly prevent the possibility of response, as practice and as discourse. Ethical foie gras, by contrast, does hold open the possibility of hearing animal response in public deliberation, but only to the extent that it can move away from the idea of naturally greedy geese as a salve for guilty human consciences. Making foie gras truly ethical, in other words, would require moving from ethical regard to politico-ethical relation that faces questions of violence, killing, and community in encounter.</p>

<title>Bringing Gavage and Killing Together</title>
<p>This article has focused largely on the various practices of “fattening the goose,” ranging from industrial forms of gavage to free-range optimizations of desires to overeat. For the most part, I have steered clear of the difficult questions surrounding when or if we should be killing animals such as ducks and geese at all, though it has been impossible to understand the sophisticated techniques and apparatuses in any of the three contexts of foie gras without remembering the final act of killing in the background. Were ethical foie gras simply a matter of feeding free-range geese, for example, it might be little different from feeding pigeons in Times Square (though this presents its own quandaries). In looking at the production of foie gras in industrial settings, the life of ducks and geese is promoted and optimized in ways that acknowledge their sentience. How, then, can the switch be made to killing them in a routinized way?</p>
<p>Industrial and traditional forms of foie gras make ducks killable in part by relying on an analogy with wild ducks and geese who overeat somewhere out in nature. This move is more than an analogy, however. It is also a constitutive move that calls sovereign power and political community into being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911398049">Agamben 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911398049">2004</xref>). Biological life is included in political life through its very exclusion. For Agamben, this move is what characterizes the modern anthropological machine: humans are fully animalized and therefore placed outside of political consideration, as in the camp, while also bringing sovereign power into existence. Derrida’s analysis of the human–animal dichotomy uncovers a similar relation: the animal’s reaction is both outside of the human but also necessary within the human as that which enables the idea of response to be formed.</p>
<p>What foie gras reveals is that these constitutive exclusions work across species lines, in an inverted form. The freedom of ducks in the wild is not a biological fact but an idea that has practical effects: it allows us to justify the constitutive exclusion of domesticated ducks and geese and ultimately to kill them. While we might have previously excluded ducks and geese simply in the name of human well-being and by recourse to the “fact” that ducks are animals, the turn to ground foie gras in the natural activities of wild ducks and geese marks an ecological turn in sovereign power that displaces this older logic. Increasingly, there is an interspecies affinity that is drawn on to manufacture this idea: the freedom of the diners who choose what and how much to eat and the sovereign power of the city of Chicago (or the United States, more broadly) to regulate the production and consumption of animals are linked with the freedom of ducks in the wild. It demarcates an inside (free ducks, free diners), founded by the constitutive exclusion of an outside. Alternatively, the stressful nature of animal life in the wild can help make the claim in familiar ways, grounding claims for the security and well-being of enculturated chimpanzee actors with federally funded retirement homes or pets kept in apartments and granted inheritance rights.</p>
<p>Once this link is traced, an unexpected species miscegenation of political community emerges, one that can no longer be understood to be only human in composition. Whereas Agamben might agree that animals are constitutively excluded, he does not read nonhuman animals as part of that which is created through the exclusion. Even if the sovereign is always human, the community that is created through constitutive exclusion often includes other animals. The annual reprieve of a turkey at Thanksgiving by the president is exemplary. By granting an exception to one specially chosen turkey, the pardon marks turkeys, in general, as bare life and therefore killable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911398049">Fiskesjo 2003</xref>). That moment also brings the sovereign into being. But for that one moment, the chosen turkey is inside of political life. There, political life may be increasingly oriented around the same imperatives that guide the management of ducks and geese while they live: a politics of maximizing biological life itself.</p>
<p>In ethical foie gras, the paradoxes come together in the same duck. The justifications of ethical foie gras emphasize a duck who freely chooses how, where, and when to express its biological desires and how to inhabit pain. It needs no analogy with the free ducks of nature, only with the free consumers and citizens who will choose to eat it. Although species differences are significant, the ducks’ lives resemble those of human citizens under biopower in significant ways, involving “the administration of bodies and the calculated management of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911398049">Foucault 1978</xref>, 140). Yet once the question turns to killing, its status is determined through an older form of sovereign power that can “take life or let life live” (ibid, 136) or, in Agameben’s terms, through institutionalized exception. If Agamben is concerned about the way that the category of the human always shifts by recourse to animalization, the instance of ethical foie gras shows that the anthropological machine can also work to include and exclude nonhuman animal species as well. The question of how to undo the anthropological machine turns not just on how we understand the relation of the human to its own animal nature, then, but also on how we move back and forth between including animals as quasi-human political actors and excluding them as truly animalized animals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I have argued that it makes little sense to think about geese and ducks in foie gras as objects instead of subjects—foie gras producers and animal welfare activists largely agree on this point, in fact, though they diverge in what that subjectivity implies. However, I have also suggested that we should think about them as subjects who are produced by, not prior to, power relations to think about their interests. Part of such an approach requires that we move away from the modern vocabulary of pain that characterizes most public discussion on foie gras because of the ways that it denies both the very possibility of an active animal response and our own ability to be in a relationship of that puts responsivity of animals front and center. In emphasizing these dimensions, I have not answered the question of whether or not we should eat foie gras, writ large, or how we should treat ducks and geese, writ large. However, I hope to at least have moved the context of asking these questions in a more productive direction.</p>
<p>Most consumers of foie gras—and many public discussants of Chicago’s ban—are multiple steps removed from encountering the contexts of production. Their social context is one of encounter with abstract ideas of pain and sentience and stylized imagery, either in the service of flavor or in the service of rights, rather than with the ethics of face-to-face encounter. In this space, embracing forms of dissonance are arguably the most cogent response we can take. Such thoughts open the space to think about the logical disjunctures in foie gras suggested here. They force us to ask, at least, the difficult question of interspecies life, which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911398049">Haraway (2008)</xref> suggests, is, what can be killed and why? For Haraway, the morally and politically problematic aspect of this question is not killing life itself (which she suggests is, at some level, inescapable, though the degrees certainly matter) but rather that which places some classes of beings in a state of killability. “It is not killing that gets us into exterminism, but making beings killable” (p. 81). Rethinking interspecific life, then, should require us to make it impossible to “make killable” (and its inverse, “making savable”) and instead start to address questions of killing more directly in a politics of responsivity.</p>

<p>I use <italic>animal rights</italic> here as an umbrella term. Those who advocate largely for laws against cruelty to animals, rather than specific animal rights, nonetheless use animal rights to designate their approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911398049">Sunstein 2002</xref>). Animal rights also include advocates of specific rights for animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912911398049">Wise 2002</xref>) and more advocates of animal liberation, some of whom reject rights-based approaches but nonetheless use the term “as a shorthand reference to ways in which the needs and desires of animals give rise to moral obligations on our part” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911398049">Singer 1987</xref>,).

<p>The judges noted that foie gras is “is strictly defined as a product from an animal which has been fattened” (i.e., force-fed).

<p>French Rural Code L654-27-1 says, “Le foie gras fait partie du patrimoine culturel et gastronomique protégé en France. On entend par foie gras, le foie d’un canard ou d’une oie spécialement engraissé par gavage” (“Foie gras is protected French cultural and gastronomic heritage. By foie gras, we mean the liver of a duck that has been specially fattened by gavage”). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CRURALNL.rcv&amp;art=L654-27-1">http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CRURALNL.rcv&amp;art=L654-27-1</ext-link> (accessed March 18, 2010).</p>

<p>Recent experiments in genetic engineering have been able to modify the ability of animals to perceive pain by ensuring that they do not produce particular peptides. The sensory abilities connected to pain perception are left in place, so that animals can use their pain-related capacities to sense danger and thereby avoid situations where they might be harmed, but the perception of pain is diminished or eliminated. See “Not Grass Fed But At Least Pain Free,” February 18, 2010, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19shriver.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19shriver.html</ext-link> (accessed March 18, 2010).</p>

I use <italic>sentience</italic> here to mean an ability to perceive or feel subjectively, and therefore use it coterminously with subjectivity. Conventional cutoffs for sentience are taken at mollusks (plants are not generally understood as sentient). Though I am not in complete agreement with this cutoff point, ducks and geese clearly fall under this general heading of sentience.</p>

<p>Two categories of blogs were chosen to represent the (presumed) opposing perspectives on the ban—“foodie” blogs and environmentalist and animal rights blogs. The foodie blogs were celebrity food writer Michael Ruhlman’s blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ruhlman.com">www.ruhlman.com</ext-link>) and the NYT Diner’s blog (dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com); the environmental and animal rights blogs were Grist (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.grist.org">www.grist.org</ext-link>) and PETA’s blog (www.peta.org). These blogs were augmented by two Chicago newspaper websites with comments sections (<italic>Chicago Sun-Times</italic> and <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>). For each site, only posts that dealt directly with the repeal of Chicago’s foie gras ban in 2008 were selected, and only the comment threads associated with those posts were examined. This article does not attempt to gather a representative sample of comments from the American blogosphere as a whole. The self-selecting nature of commenters also deserves acknowledgment. I do not claim that these comments reflect “general public opinion,” even on the news sites. The demographic composition of these commenters is unknown, but it seems reasonable to suggest that they reflect only a subset of the general population in ways that probably bias the results relative to the population as a whole. Nonetheless, as an illustrative analysis of the ways in which people construct their political stance on foie gras, this three-pronged sample offers a useful starting point.</p>
