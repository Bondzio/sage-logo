<abstract>
<p>This review article discusses two recent books in English dealing with Italian history, both recent and past. David Gilmour’s <italic>The Pursuit of Italy</italic> maintains that the unification of Italy was a sin against history and geography, and considers virtually all the elements of dysfunction – military, political, administrative – a tragic consequence of that ill-conceived and poorly executed unification. Attaching particular importance to a statement by Gobetti, even fascism and the 20 years of its dictatorship are seen among those tragic consequences. However, Gilmour also proposes that the majority of Italians favored the regime or it could not have lasted 20 years. Michael Ebner’s <italic>Ordinary Violence in Mussolini’s Italy</italic> makes it abundantly clear how and through which violent means the regime was able to last that long, without needing to invoke the supposed complicity of the majority of the Italian people.</p>

<p>David Gilmour is earnestly intent on debunking almost everything that generations of modern Italians have wrongly held dear, because he thinks that they have swallowed the brazen propaganda of the PR machinery of every government since Napoleon departed Italy, aimed at covering up ill-conceived and poorly-executed plans. Never having had to sit on the bench of an Italian classroom to be fed such nonsense, he is sure he knows better, and aims to show those gullible Italians, and the rest of the world, how things really went.</p>
<p>Not that he makes many factual mistakes – they are few, albeit important – but his interpretations often show the influence of other popular entertainers who write about Italy for English language readers, so that his ways of retelling the historical events – the facts, the people, the circumstances – are so critical of everything and everybody that the result is a portrait of an Italy totally dysfunctional, in inexorable decline (p. 386), apparently ungovernable (p. 387), a ‘unitary state’ but ‘evidently not a united one’ (p. 393), as he sums up the argument in his concluding pages. ‘Except in a purely formal sense, could it [Italy] really be said to exist?’ he asks (p. 387).</p>
<p>In his opinion, Italy should never have been united – a bad idea from the start, and Italians have been paying for such a mistake ever since:<disp-quote>
<p>It was the peninsula’s misfortune that in the nineteenth century a victorious Italian movement tried to make its inhabitants less Italian and more like other people, to turn them into conquerors and colonists, more to be feared and respected by their adversaries. (p. 399)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, the Italians were not cut out to be a united country, or to have colonies like France or England or Spain or Germany; they just were not that adult. And Italy failed the ideologues who advocated unification. A united Italy never became the nation its founders had hoped for because its making had been flawed both in conception and in execution, because it had been truly what (Pasqualino) Fortunato was told by his father: a sin against history and geography (p. 399).</p>
<p>But it was neither. It was not a sin against history, for although Italy had not been united since the Roman period, in Roman times it was united for practically five centuries; and it was certainly not a sin against geography, for since Roman times, and particularly in the thinking of Dante and Petrarch, God and Nature had given Italy what looked very much like natural borders, the Alps and the sea; it is the same ‘geographical unit with natural borders’ that the author finds to be a valid reason for the existence of Iberia. Italy instead ‘did not seem to require political unity now [after Napoleon’s disappearance and the Congress of Vienna] or in the future’ (p. 8), he thinks. This pet idea of the author pervades the entire last two-thirds of the book, dealing with Italian history from 1815 to Berlusconi, and colors all his judgments of what Italians have done with their united country for the last two centuries.</p>
<p>Throughout, Gilmour lets us know that he would have preferred a confederated Italy rather than a unified one, a confederation of the kind that had been proposed before the sin of unification was committed: like that proposed by the Piedmontese priest Vincenzo Gioberti, which would have been presided over by the Pope, or by Cesare Balbo, presided over by the king of Piedmont, or by the Milanese Carlo Cattaneo, which would have been presided over by neither of the above. If he finds a united Italy so dysfunctional, Gilmour seems to have no idea of just how dysfunctional such a loose union would have been.</p>
<p>He blasts away at the belief ‘that Napoleon had brought the idea of unity to Italy, that his defeat had led to a dismal interlude of oppression and reaction and that Italy’s destiny had finally been fulfilled by the heroic endeavors of its patriots’, calling it a ‘deterministic theory’ that ‘is completely unhistorical. Italy was no more preordained to unite than Scandinavia, Yugoslavia or North America’ (pp. 146–147). But his prejudicial preferences prevent him from seeing that, even if one does not believe in destinies and Napoleon did not tell Italians that it was their destiny to unite, his easy conquest of the peninsula from Piedmont to Lombardy, to the Veneto, Tuscany, the papal states and the Bourbon kingdom in the South, made the patriots see the unification as a possibility if a strong leader would undertake it; in fact both Napoleon’s viceroys, Beauharnais in Milan and Marat in Naples, made, albeit unsuccessfully, an attempt at achieving it after their leader’s defeat.</p>
<p>The author then explores the reality behind the supposed heroism of those guilty of committing that sin against geography and history, dragging them down from the pedestals on which they were set both by their own self-promotion and that of their glorifiers. Chapter 8, called ‘Legendary Italy’ (for only myth-making could have made them into heroes), is dedicated to this purpose. Some important Americans, Britons, and Italians – Lawrence Lowell, George Meredith and Trevelyan, Settembrini and historian Carlo Tivaroni – have at times spoken of such Risorgimento leaders as Cavour, Mazzini, and Garibaldi as ‘giants’, so the introductory section has a mocking title, ‘A Generation of Giants’, and presents them collectively, then each separately in mock-titled sets in which they are cut down to size: Cavour in ‘The Wisest Statesman’, Garibaldi in ‘The Noblest Roman’, Victor Emanuel in ‘Father of the Nation’, the generals Lamarmora, Cialdini, Gavone, Della Rocca and Carlo Pillion, Count of Persano, the defeated admiral of the battle of Lissa, in ‘Some Generals and an Admiral’, in which these commanders are not just cut down to size but properly chopped up for their incompetence.</p>
<p>After debunking all these canonized heroes of the Risorgimento, the author sets out in Chapter 9, ‘Making Italians’, to illustrate the failures of the first unification government, both in regard to internal policies, especially those of the Piedmontese rulers toward the South, in two sub-chapters, ‘Piedmont Comes to Naples’ and ‘Sicily Goes Downhill’, and to colonial policies in another sub-chapter, ‘The Quest for Glory’. These new Italians cannot do one thing right: they should not have unified the country, it was an overambitious and ill-conceived task.</p>
<p>In a final section, Gilmour treats one more Risorgimento ‘giant’ whose patriotic merits have been wrongly overvalued by Italians, whom he had not included in Chapter 8 (although he had talked quite extensively about him in Chapter 6, ‘Revolutionary Italy’, sub-chapter ‘Operatic Italy’), the composer Giuseppe Verdi. In ‘The Bear of Busseto’, he tries to demolish the idea that with his most popular arias Verdi was a great inspirer of patriotism, especially the idea expressed by his contemporary, novelist Antonio Fogazzaro, that his music had been ‘our great unifier’ (p. 275). He had emphatically denied in Chapter 6 (esp. pp. 172–179) that there was any patriotic motif in Verdi’s so called ‘Risorgimento operas’ (p. 173).</p>
<p>How could those Italians who survived Napoleon’s Russian campaign, into which 100,000 had been drafted to die of hunger and frost in a foreign land, now be inspired by the chorus of the Lombard crusaders dying of hunger and thirst in the deserts of the Middle East as they sang ‘O Signor che dal tetto natio / ci chiamasti con santa promessa’; how could those Italians who had endured almost 2000 years of foreign tyrannies and were still ruled by Bourbons and Habsburgs and Lorenas, identify with the Jews, deported by Nabucodonosor to Babylon, sadly singing ‘Va pensiero sull’ali dorate / va ti posa sui clivi e sui colli / ove olezzano tepide e molli / l’aure dolci del luogo natal’? No, the author says, ‘there is no contemporary evidence to suggest that audiences made this connection or that the composer intended to do so’ (p. 149).</p>
<p>But the evidence is abundant: apart from the words Gilmour has just quoted of Verdi’s contemporary, Antonio Fogazzaro, it is a fact that every Italian, young and old, sang those arias in the streets for the rest of the century, and it would be enough here, if the space allows, to quote just another very illustrious ‘contemporary’ of Verdi, Giuseppe Giusti, who, in his most famous poem, ‘Sant’Ambrogio’, tells the chief prosecutor of Tuscany’s Grand Duke Leopold’s regime that, having chanced into the old Sant’Ambrogio church in Milan and having found it full of Austrian troops attending mass, he felt revolted by the ‘stench’ until the military band surprised him with a perfectly executed chorus of the <italic>Lombards at the First Crusade</italic>: ‘Era un coro del Verdi; il coro a Dio / là dei Lombardi miseri, assetati; / quello: O Signor che dal tetto natío, / che tanti petti ha scossi e inebriati’ [the Verdi chorus-prayer to God by the poor Lombards dying of thirst over there, the one: O Lord who have called us from our hearths and homes, <italic>which has shaken and enthralled so many hearts</italic>].</p>
<p>The author berates Isaiah Berlin for writing about another famous chorus of Verdi that ‘the Hebrews of <italic>Nabucco</italic> were Italians in captivity’ and ‘their famous chorus “was the nation’s prayer for resurrection”’ (p. 173), for, Gilmour protests, ‘a glance at the words, by Temistocle Solera, makes one wonder how such a myth can ever have gained credence’ (p. 173).</p>
<p>One can gauge the author’s extremely low regard for Italians again in his treatment of fascism, which occupies a good portion of the book. He is convinced that practically all Italians supported it, and repeats this myth at every opportunity; even when discussing the number of people who joined and died in the Resistance, he cannot refrain from remarking that an equal number of youth ‘volunteered’ for the Nazi-fascist republic of Salò. That the author enjoyed the luxury of not spending a single day of his life under a dictatorial regime is no justification for such deep-seated conviction and ignorance.</p>
<p>For instance, he remarks that<disp-quote>
<p>it is revealing to look at a newsreel of [Mussolini] making a speech in the late 1930s in Padua’s Prato della Valle, one of the largest squares in Europe. The Piazza contains nearly the entire population of the city, tens of thousands of people cheering every sentence and throwing their hats in the air or twirling them deliriously at the end of their sticks. The event was, of course, orchestrated, but the enthusiasm was genuine. (pp. 314–315)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Gilmour seems unaware of the extent of the orchestration. At such rallies, hundreds of fascist organizers watchfully guided the members of the crowd who had been told that they had better be there and were directed to applaud and shout ‘Duce, Duce, Duce!’ on cue. He seems not to know that the newsreel also was carefully edited in the studios of the fascist agency L.U.C.E., whose newsreel production was exclusively fascist propaganda throughout the fascist years. It is even possible that some details of the author’s description might be products of his imagination, for in general Italians never threw such expensive items as their hats into the air, and had stopped using walking canes since the late 19th century. The only guys carrying sticks by the 1920s and 1930s were the fascist squads carrying clubs for their punitive night expeditions.</p>
<p>He also seems to take literally a phrase heard from a friend, that ‘the night of July 25, 1943 [the night Mussolini was toppled] every Italian went to sleep as a Fascist and woke up the next morning as an anti-fascist’ (p. 335), not understanding the deeper truth beneath its superficial irony. Of course, virtually all Italians who survived fascism had had to adjust to it one way or another, as the Russians and the Germans and the Spaniards and the Portuguese had to do, and later the Rumanians and Bulgarians and today the Chinese, the Egyptians, and the Libyans, to survive their respective totalitarian regimes. After the first decade of the fascist dictatorship, when it was difficult to join the party, the membership was opened to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the regime to all who could get the sponsorship of two party members; everybody took advantage of it, even members of those our author calls a few ‘clandestine communist cells’, because it had become practically impossible to get a job either in the public or the private sector without the membership card. It was a question of survival, even if one did not have a family to feed.</p>
<p>School-age youth, starting with the first grade, would not be admitted to the classroom until they paid the membership money at the beginning of each year. One became a <italic>Balilla</italic> first, then an <italic>Avanguardista</italic>, then a <italic>Giovane Fascista</italic>, then a <italic>Fascista</italic>; university students had to belong to the GUF, the <italic>Gioventú Universitaria Fascista</italic>. Thus, in one generation, membership became universal, for it was compulsory. All the student and working population got locked into party membership. That is why every Italian went to bed as a fascist on the night of 25 July 1943.</p>
<p>Adult workers who were not yet members were offered membership in the OND, <italic>Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro</italic>, which was presented to them as a kind of recreational organization, which many accepted because of the benefits it carried, particularly the free summer camps in the mountains or at the seaside for the kids, something they could never have afforded otherwise. But then the local leaders made it the equivalent of fascist membership, so that they could boast to the national authorities how fast membership was growing in their districts thanks to their zeal.</p>
<p>In every town, in every village, there was a fascist agent, the party secretary (in some provincial towns where he was particularly vicious he was called Ras, after the Ethiopian provincial warlords) who was the eyes and the long arm of the central authority; he made sure that the directives of the central authority were carried out to the letter at the local level and took notice of everyone and everything that was said and done – or that was not said and done, for even neutrality was considered hostility. It was considered dangerous ‘to get noticed’ for anything, like not donating one’s gold wedding band to the nation at the beginning of the Ethiopian war; it was dangerous for any firm to employ white collar workers who were not members of the party; it was dangerous for even a cabinet maker to keep his shop open on Saturday afternoons, when his workers were supposed to be at the soccer field or in the school yard for pre-military training. The degree of danger depended of course on the zeal of the local party watchdog or Ras. But one could bet that it was usually strong; his prestige and career were at stake, and he preferred to be feared than befriended.</p>
<p>The author contends that the good feelings toward Italians that visitors to post-war Italy universally felt were due to the ‘impression that most of the people had been anti-fascist. It was simply not true. The dictatorship could not have lasted for twenty years if Mussolini had been despised and fascism had been detested’ (p. 314).</p>
<p>This is quite strange, coming from a historian who has seen so many dictatorships last as long or longer, some still going in our time. To support his contention, he refers us to the fact that ‘in recent years there has been much debate about how popular Mussolini really was, how much <italic>consenso</italic> – a word somewhere between acceptance and approval – he enjoyed among the Italian people. For a decade after his victory in the last real election of 1924, <italic>consenso</italic> seems to have been fairly general’ (p. 314), for, after all, ‘order, discipline, authority wedded to the Italian temperament. This was what most people wanted, especially the middle classes, and almost all the members of the petty bourgeoisie’ (p. 314).</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that it is unworthy of any serious historian to call the elections of 1924 ‘the last real elections’, even if the middle class and the petty bourgeoisie were all supportive of Mussolini and fascism, which is hardly the truth, how large a middle class, how large a petty bourgeoisie was there in Italy in the 1920s and 1930s, when most people were living in poverty? Elsewhere Gilmour says that ‘in the South where the petty bourgeoisie – its natural recruiting ground – scarcely existed, fascism was imposed and then accepted without enthusiasm’ (p. 316). This describes, if anything, what was happening all over Italy, and not just in the South, because the petty bourgeoisie was just as scarce in the rest of Italy and almost exclusively concentrated in the few large cities; in the countryside and in small towns and villages, where at that time the bulk of the population lived, most Italians were subsistence peasant laborers, their landlords seldom present.</p>
<p>Finally, how can the author generalize about what ‘wedded to the Italian temperament’ when his entire book is dedicated to the demonstration of the different character of Italians of different regions, because of which it was a mistake to even think of making one nation out of them, that they have never really united because of it and should have remained in small, separate, confederate states.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the author claims that ‘Fascism’s appeal was blunted by its failure to promote prosperity. Italians might be deceived into thinking they were well governed but they could not be deceived into thinking they were well off’ (p. 315). This gratuitous cynicism also ignores the fact that Italy in those years, in addition to its endemic poverty, was facing, like the rest of the world, the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The armistice was announced on 8 September 1943 on the insistence of the Allied command, meeting reluctance from the Italian government which was asking for a few more days to plan for confronting the Germans, who would certainly retaliate; the Allied landing, instead of taking place close to Rome, occurred far to the south at Salerno, leaving Rome undefended and indefensible, and the king and the government had to flee south behind the front lines. Gilmour maintains that that flight ‘marks one of the lowest points in the history of united Italy’ (p. 331). The lowest point in that history, instead, happened in 1922, when the king handed Mussolini the leadership of the country, although the fascists in parliament were extremely few and all the fascists in the country were engaged in the most outrageous acts of lawless violence. This was the real cause of the king losing the throne in the 1946 referendum. The flight of the royal family and his government was a necessity at that point. The king and the government, who were after all the signatories of the armistice, could not stay to be taken by the Germans, tried and shot, like the former fascist ministers who were tried and shot in Verona the following spring because they had voted against Mussolini the night of 25 July 1943. The English did not think it was cowardly of the queen of Holland or the king of Belgium or General De Gaulle to flee to Britain.</p>
<p>Although any immediate resistance to the Germans was impossible, our author says that <disp-quote>
<p>the collapse of the state made it easier for the Germans to rescue Mussolini from his mountain prison and install him as their puppet ruler of the Republic of Salò, a new Fascist state based on Lake Garda in the Nazi-held north. Many young men volunteered to fight for this new entity. (p. 331)</p></disp-quote> This last assertion (repeated more than once in the text) is completely false. The recruiting orders of these ‘many young men’ were issued repeatedly and insistently and threateningly – especially with the Graziani proclamation of 14 February; non-compliants were called <italic>renitenti</italic>, their non-compliance carried the death penalty, and their families were harassed and endangered as accomplices to a desertion. Frequent raids were organized to comb every village or town to catch the <italic>renitenti</italic> as in a net – the raids were in fact called <italic>retate</italic> [net hunting] – and those who were caught in the net were made to either ‘volunteer’ immediately or face the firing squad.</p>
<p>Gilmour’s disdain for the flight of the king and his government becomes something close to resentment: ‘the king was thus enabled to declare war on Germany’ and make Italy a co-belligerent rather than simply a defeated power (p. 335). The king’s government was in fact able to gather some remnants of the Italian army and some who took the risk of crossing the front line to join the Allied army campaign up the peninsula until the end of the war:<disp-quote>
<p>The king’s later declaration of war on Germany and the co-belligerency thus acquired, convinced many Italians that they were Hitler’s victims rather than his allies and that they were in fact ‘co-victors’ in 1945. This feeling was brazenly reflected in Italy’s attitude toward Austria after the war. There were plenty of foreigners, including nearly 200 British MPs, who believed that the Alto Adige, the former South Tyrol, should be given to the newly independent state of Austria. Italy was adamant that it should not, retorting that the scheme was iniquitous because Austria had fought with the Nazis from beginning to end and had not produced a Resistance movement. The Italian position thus implied that there was a wide moral gap between a nation that had been invaded and annexed – and thus forced to fight for the Reich – and one that had voluntarily joined Hitler even if, as a result of military defeat, it had only stayed the course for three and a half years. (p. 335)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One clearly feels the scorn here expressed toward these Italians who want to ignore their responsibilities for a war fought on the wrong side, and the sympathy for the poor Austrians invaded, annexed, and also made to fight on the wrong side. But there is evidence that the Austrian willingness to collaborate in the Nazi’s pan-German ideas and plans was much more widespread than Gilmour is willing to say, according to the Italians who lived there or crossed the country during their dangerous trek home from the various fronts where they were caught at the time of the armistice. In any case, it is a known fact that Italians who were fighting a war they did not want on a side they considered wrong gave themselves up as prisoners by the hundreds of thousands during the North African campaign; they posed no resistance whatsoever in Sicily; and the few who had the chance fought up the peninsula side by side with the British army under British command.</p>
<p>The Italians had every right to consider themselves Hitler’s victims during the German occupation that lasted a good year and a half, and produced an appreciable Resistance movement, which fought the Germans as well as their fascist collaborators, suffered more than 100,000 losses, and saved most cities and their industries from being dismantled and destroyed by the retreating German army, from Naples, which was liberated 5 days before the arrival of the Allies, on up the peninsula until the final push of the front into the Po Valley.</p>
<p>But Gilmour is intent on belittling the value of the Resistance too: it is partly a myth that it ‘symbolizes the rebirth of the nation in 1945’ (p. 333); ‘many simply drifted into it because they were on the run from the German and Fascist forces’ (p. 333); and anyway, ‘comparable numbers had volunteered to fight for the Republic of Salò’ (p. 334). And how many were the partisans after all? ‘The Resistance was not the nation in arms, it was about one third of 1 percent of it in arms. Nor were its achievements of the magnitude claimed on its memorials’ (p. 334). Nor is it true that the Resistance ‘was supported by the bulk of the population’ because ‘for reasons of self-preservation many Italians preferred to remain neutral’ (p. 334). About this last point, the author does admit that any sign of collaboration ‘left villages vulnerable to reprisals from German and fascist forces’ (p. 334), although he never mentions how many were actually wiped out when collaboration was merely suspected.</p>
<p>In any case, he insists, ‘anti-fascist views seldom reached the ears of the Italian populace, and organized opposition rarely consisted of much more than a few clandestine cells of the communist party’ (p. 315). This also is untrue, because when it became possible to organize an armed Resistance, although the majority was, of course, made up of communist groups, there were also social-democratic and Giustizia e Libertà groups, even pro-monarchy and pro-Badoglio.</p>
<p>Since it is the author’s conviction that Italians were all fascists, when he presents the view of distinguished Italian historians or diplomats he rejects them as biased: <disp-quote>
<p>Sforza regarded ‘the vain show of the fascist years’ as ‘only a brief interlude of unreality,’ while Croce described the dictatorship as a ‘parenthesis’ in his nation’s story, implying that it was not closely connected with what happened before or after; the genuine connection, so it was claimed, was between the regimes that preceded and succeeded Mussolini. (p. 332)</p></disp-quote> Gilmour prefers the assessment of ‘the young liberal Pietro Gobetti’ who ‘may have got closer to the truth when he observed in the 1920s that fascism was part of Italy’s “autobiography,” a logical consequence of unification’s failure to be a moral revolution supported by the mass of the people’ (p. 332). This is a statement Gilmour likes because it supports his conviction that fascism too was one of the tragic consequences of an ill-conceived and badly-executed unification, but it reflects a typical assessment of leftist intellectuals of the post-war and post-fascist period – although Gobetti did not survive fascism – who liked to talk about the masses but did not belong to them, did not know them, and did not understand that, poor and barely educated as they were in Italy after the Second World War, the masses could not be involved, be indoctrinated, participate the way better-off people could and did.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the author realizes that his prejudicial assessment of fascism is similar to the views of the fascists themselves: <disp-quote>
<p>that fascism was ‘the child of the Risorgimento’ was also Gentile’s verdict, a view much derided in the years to come but supported intrinsically at the time by the fact that so many liberal fathers had fascist sons without having family ruptures. (p. 332)</p></disp-quote> Of course both fascist indoctrination and their own family obligations worked on the sons for 20 years, and the fathers understood what pressure their children were under in their white-collar work places. ‘Liberal fathers’, we should understand, existed almost exclusively in the tiny middle class, because the fathers of the masses were not ‘liberal’ fathers, they were just fathers.</p>
<p>Similarly, the author speaks with evident scorn of the exiguity of the anti-fascist movement during the regime, just ‘some secret communist cells’: as only the better-off, not the masses, could afford to actively participate as volunteers in the Risorgimento movement, so it was for any active anti-fascism. The young people who belonged to Giustizia e Libertà, for instance (which, by the way, had nothing to do with ‘secret communist cells’ and was active from Turin all the way to Paris), were all children of the urban bourgeoisie who could afford to engage in such activities and go abroad and live there when things got hot, which the children of the masses could not.</p>
<p>The author tries to reinforce his idea that Italians were in great sympathy with fascism by claiming that after the liberation ‘retribution in Italy may not have been as extensive as it was in France because the Fascist regime had not excited as much revulsion among Italians as the Vichy collaboration with Germany had among the French’ (p. 336). This is a poor parallel for a serious historian to make: the Vichy period of French history corresponds, with regard to collaboration, not to the fascist period but to the period of the German occupation of Italy during the Salò Republic, when collaboration excited as much revulsion among Italians as it did among the French. So much so that the ‘retribution’ was directed exclusively at the active collaborators of that period; they were almost all captured and shot during the few days between the flight of the Germans and the arrival of the Allies. Gilmour admits that ‘some 12–15000 fascists were pursued and killed at the time of liberation, and thousands more perished over the next couple of years’ (p. 336), including Mussolini, who was captured and shot while trying to cross into Switzerland with a German convoy, as were other fascist leaders like Starace and Farinacci.</p>
<p>People who had to join the party during the regime got off easily because even the communist leaders after the war knew that the Salò troops during the republic were not ‘volunteers’, as our author insists on calling them. The Salò ‘volunteers’ were sent to proper debriefing camps. Men like Badoglio and Grandi, about whom the author complains that they were allowed to die as octogenarians, could not be shot because of their decisive role in ousting Mussolini and fascism. Historian David Gilmour ought to know this. The civil servants were not prosecuted not because otherwise there would have been no civil service left, as he remarks (p. 336), but because Italians knew how one could hardly survive fascism without a party card, let alone have a career in the civil service, in the army, in the carabinieri, in the health care profession, or in the teaching profession at any level. Therefore, the 1946 ‘amnesty for former Fascists’, issued while a very prominent communist leader was Minister of Justice, was fully justified.</p>

<p>My extensive objections to David Gilmour’s prejudices against Italians under fascism are fully confirmed by our second book, Michael R Ebner’s <italic>Ordinary Violence in Mussolini’s Italy</italic>. While Gilmour maintains that ‘the dictatorship could not have lasted for twenty years if Mussolini had been despised and Fascism had been detested’ (p. 314), Ebner clearly demonstrates through extensive documentation how the dictatorship was established and maintained for 20 years only by relentlessly striking fear and terror into every level of the Italian population, first through the beatings and killings by the fascist squads, and then by imposing a regime of rigid control and oppression which assured the external obedience of the entire country for two decades, terminated only by the intervention of an extremely costly global war.</p>
<p>The ‘ordinary’ of Ebner’s title is of course ironic; the violence was ordinary in the sense that it was part of the everyday experience of all Italians who were not willing supporters of the regime. Not that every Italian witnessed acts of violence daily, though countless ones were committed daily throughout the country, but the appalling memory of them underlay everyone’s daily life. The acts of violence themselves were anything but ordinary.</p>
<p>While Gilmour hardly ever documents his broad assertions of Italians’ complicity with fascism, and seems to be echoing the dismissive comments of contemporary Italian friends and acquaintances, Ebner backs every assertion by a thorough documentation, and it is his firm position that ‘any account of Mussolini’s dictatorship that makes claims about Italian society must start by acknowledging that violence was at the heart of the regime’s ideology and methods’ (p. 265); that ‘historical memory of how greatly Fascism relied upon prosecuting social outsiders and subaltern groups has been repressed for so long in part because the victims were often too marginalized or embarrassed to talk about it’, so that ‘in popular culture and the historical profession, the only “true” victims of Fascism were the anti-fascists’ (p. 265).</p>
<p>And that has been a great oversight indeed by historians, unless one considers most Italians as anti-fascists, which is the opposite of Gilmour’s thesis of widespread complicity, for surely most Italians, as Ebner contends, suffered the fear and oppression through which the regime ruled.</p>
<p>His book follows the history of the rise and fall of a system ‘that enabled the few to control the many’ (p. 21), beginning with the two ‘red years’ (1918–1920) when the sudden rise of socialist unionism threw a large portion of post-First World War Italy into turmoil, and caused an uninterrupted cycle of strikes in agriculture, industry, and public services; this provoked a violent reaction in the opposite, rising ‘revolutionary’ movement of the fascists, self-proclaimed champions of law and order, although their advocacy and practice of violence had nothing to do with law, and indeed made violence the new law.<disp-quote>
<p>During the Fascist takeover [1920–1922], many Italians lived in a state of terror. Blackshirted <italic>squadrists</italic> beat, shot, ritually humiliated, and destroyed the property of peasants, workers, politicians, journalists, and labor organizers. Although socialists and working classes were the primary victims, the Fascists also targeted Catholics, liberals, Masons, State authorities, and even dissident Fascists. (p. 23)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For the following 20 years, neither the memory of the 2 years of red disruptions nor that of the 2 years of black terror would be forgotten, and the Italian people tolerated 20 years of fascist oppression rather than go back to the experience of those 4 post-war years.<disp-quote>
<p>The terror of the first half of the 1920s thus conditioned the experience of Italians who lived under Fascist rule for the next twenty years. The victims of those acts of brutality had families, friends, and acquaintances who did not forget what had happened. The thousands who fled Italy to escape fascist violence left behind lives full of people; Italians who witnessed, first- or second-hand, murders, beatings, and the destruction of homes and offices were affected profoundly. Any assessment of the role of violence under Fascism thus must take into consideration the initial terror upon which Mussolini established his dictatorship. (p. 47)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Mussolini had founded the first <italic>Fasci di combattimento</italic> in Milan in 1919; it ‘initially had few adherents, and squad violence was limited to a small number of urban areas in northern Italy’ (p. 27). However, 1 year later labor unrest in the countryside was so threatening, disruptive and widespread that the government was both reluctant and unable to intervene, so the landowners, to protect their interests and property, turned to the fascists, who by the fall of 1920 had ‘spread to the provinces like Bologna and Ferrara’ (p. 28).</p>
<p>Historians agree that ‘the rising of Fascism in the provinces of the Po Valley occurred in reaction to the post-war growth of Socialist power’ (p. 28), after the 1919 elections, in which socialism made huge electoral gains nationally and locally and the labor unions went wild, unleashing ‘a wave of strikes unprecedented in Italian history’ (p. 28).<disp-quote>
<p>This postwar surge in working class militancy peaked in 1920, socialist union membership spiked (the General Confederation of Labor had 2.2 million members in 1920), and thousand of strikes occurred in virtually every area of the economy. In September, the workers of Italy’s industrial triangle (Milan, Turin, and Genoa) seized control of their factories, and strikes and occupations spread to other parts of the peninsula. (p. 29)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The first chapters of Ebner’s book concentrate therefore on the years of ‘squadrist’ violence directed first at the union leaders: ‘Fascists sometimes beat these men, occasionally with homicidal intent, but perhaps more commonly intimidated them until they were forced to leave town, thereby decapitating their organizations’ (p. 31). It was never easy or possible for even the local police to marshal any resistance to their attacks, let alone private citizens, for the perpetrators were always well armed and always worked in large groups:<disp-quote>
<p>Late at night, ten, thirty, or even a hundred Black Shirts, sometimes traveling from neighboring towns, might surround a home, inviting a Socialist, anarchist, or Communist outside to talk. If they refused, the Fascists would enter forcibly or threaten to harm the entire family by lighting the house on fire. Fascists sometimes fired guns indiscriminately or threw hand grenades into homes in order to drive out the inhabitants. (p. 31)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Unless the beating was initially fatal, it would be repeated again and again until the victim became unavailable one way or another: some left for another region, some for another country, some for their eternal resting place, due to the internal injuries inflicted, as was the case with eminent public figures like Giacomo Matteotti, Giovanni Amendola, and Pietro Gobetti.</p>
<p>The Ras of Ferrara, Italo Balbo, ‘ordered his Fascists to explain to them [the Socialists] that it would be healthy for them to have a change of air and to settle down in some other province’. Adding that: ‘If they insist on staying you should beat them up, without exaggerating but with regularity, until they decide’. Balbo also instructed that his letter be shown to the prefect, suggesting that ‘the police station would do well to persecute them [the Socialists] with arrests at least once a week’ (pp. 37–38).</p>
<p>Perhaps sometimes more effective than the beatings were humiliating treatments like the notorious administering of castor oil during a mock trial interrogation, artfully protracted until the purgative outcome became visible, and the victim sent home on public display.<disp-quote>
<p>In small towns, where everyone knew everyone, Fascists inflicted ritual humiliations on their enemies, a powerful strategy of terror understood by all. Black Shirts forced their opponents to drink castor oil and other purgatives, and then sent them home, wrenching with pain and covered in their own feces. (p. 32)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The first targets were the socialist leaders, often well-known figures, locally revered, with the intent of thus decapitating the organization locally, in the provincial centers of the countryside where such figures had a following.<disp-quote>
<p>Despite the ‘internationalist’ orientation of Socialist ideology, the peasant leagues, cooperatives, labor halls, and social clubs – the entire infrastructure of the Socialist ‘state’ – were intensely parochial institutions, organized around popular, charismatic political and labor leaders. Fascist squads thus practiced highly personal, localized strategies of violence and intimidation, attacking the most prominent and influential ‘subversives.’ (pp. 30–31)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Once the leaders had been disposed of, the violence turned on what remained of the organization; the meeting halls, the printing offices of their newspapers, and anything else that served their daily operation was burned down:<disp-quote>
<p>In the provincial centers Fascist violence was initially used to break the Socialist hold on local administration and labor organizations. Fascists interrupted meetings, beat elected officials, and made impossible the work of local government. Socialists in particular were intimidated, threatened, and even beaten until they resigned. (p. 30)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>So the ‘red menace’ was targeted almost exclusively in the first burst of violence and attacked until it was eliminated: ‘The fascists demolished the Socialist Party in a matter of months. Between March and May 1921, the squad destroyed dozens of newspaper offices, chambers of labor, peasant leagues, cooperatives and social clubs’ (p. 30).</p>
<p>Once the labor organizations had been scattered, the violence turned to the local socialist governments still functioning in the ‘red belt’ regions; the municipal meetings were disrupted, the administrations attacked and prevented from meeting and deliberating. Squadrist assault on municipal government and working-class institutions soon flooded Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Tuscany, and Puglia (p. 29).</p>
<p>They avoided the national arena, the frontal assault on government, where the army would have to be confronted; they kept their violence strictly localized but spread all over, town by town, where the governmental forces were weak and thin and therefore powerless against the local eruptions of squad violence: ‘Despite its broad geographic impact and the importance of large, coordinated, interprovincial squad activity, the Fascist “Revolution,” or reaction, largely consisted of thousands of intensely local episodes of violence’ (p. 34). Fascist violence spread like wildfire, practically unstoppable: ‘Squads resorted to personal, highly symbolic, face to face violence and murder, rather than mass anonymous killing. In essence, although they could be exceedingly brutal, Fascist squads practiced a selective, calibrated, and choreographed economy of violence’ (p. 34).</p>
<p>So, while it seemed that the fascists’ most explicit goal was that of destroying Bolshevism in Italy, or preventing it from developing in Italy as it had in Russia, actually their goal was much higher, the government of the country: ‘The squadrists’ most explicit goal – destroying “Bolshevism” – was rapidly achieved, yet the violence continued unabated. Only by perpetuating the “revolutionary” situation could the Fascist movement undermine the liberal state and continue its push for political power’ (p. 32).</p>
<p>At every step this violence that remained practically unopposed by government forces was successful, so when the fascists marched on Rome on 28 October 1922, instead of facing the army they met the king intent on handing Mussolini the premiership, despite the fact that, as said earlier, in parliament the fascists were a tiny minority and throughout the country they were acting with no regard for the law. That success confirmed their belief in the nature and function of violence in the political life of a nation both internally and externally, a belief that had informed fascism’s beginnings, the ‘formative moment when violent action produced ideology and, in turn, belief’ (p. 24). After their conquest they made a credo of it – they attached tremendous significance to the war they had waged on Italy’s internal enemies. They interpreted <italic>squadrist</italic> violence as a creative, regenerative act (p. 24). And out of this experience and this concept of violence came a fascist economy of violence that would preserve the regime’s political power for nearly two decades (p. 25).</p>
<p>Those in parliament and outside it who did not mind seeing a strong hand taking hold of the rudder of government at such a chaotic moment, hoping that the chaos would quickly come to an end, were to be disappointed. Fascist violence would take different forms according to different places and circumstances, but it never ceased – it just replaced the preceding unionist chaos with malevolent control.<disp-quote>
<p>Many political elites assumed that a Mussolini government would bring an end to two years of violent disorder, but it did not. Political violence in the years after the March on Rome continued to serve the same purpose as before: it suppressed opposition, replaced Socialist and non-Fascist administrations, and extended Fascist control over the rest of Italy. Mussolini occasionally decried the illegal activities of the squads, but they operated as the motor that drove the government along the road to dictatorship. (p. 37)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Once fascism had become the government, Mussolini made several such ‘gestures’ and declarations aimed at giving the Italian people the illusion that law and order had returned to the country, publicly denouncing some excesses when they attracted unwanted publicity, as when Matteotti was killed, but with no intention of putting an end to the violence; it was just a question of changing the kind of violence, from the squadrist expeditions to the implementation of ‘carefully calibrated “surgical” violence’ (p. 24), creating an environment of constant fear and intimidation (p. 80).</p>
<p>So for the next 20 years, to which the central chapters of the book are dedicated, violence continued: ‘Squadrist violence had cowed the provinces’ population, and the main proponents of the opposition had withdrawn from politics or fled’ (p. 160); the new violence took the form of harassment.<disp-quote>
<p>The most intense strategies of political and social control operated at the local, rather than the national, level. Police and <italic>carabinieri</italic> repeatedly arrested, jailed, and generally harassed anti-Fascists, who spent hours, days, weeks, and months in local jails and prisons. When important personages – Fascists, state officials, members of the royal family – visited a city, authorities jailed dozens if not hundreds of ‘dangerous’ persons. (p. 89)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These practices were so common, so widespread and so local that they remained practically undocumented and thus unavailable to today’s historians, but unforgettable to the tens of thousands of Italians who were their victims or witnessed them because their family members were involved: ‘these practices were so ordinary that memoirs and other sources mention them only in passing, if at all; they are part of the assumed backdrop to larger, more dramatic events’ (p. 89).</p>
<p>If the squadrists’ killings had become rare, other practices had become more widespread; if the terror was more limited, the fear of it was now everywhere, because of the ‘constant watchfulness, harassment, humiliations, and discrimination inflicted by authoritarian police chiefs and a voluntary corps of Fascist watchdogs’ (p. 47). ‘Constant harassment by police made militancy impossible and life very difficult’ (p. 89). Subjecting any suspected anti-fascist activist ‘to intense surveillance, strict control, and multiple periods of confinement, police effectively neutralized’ the most experienced militants (p. 86), so that ‘continued resistance became nearly impossible under the regime. Year after year, anti-Fascists endured regular stints in jail, prison, and confinement.’ Even after they had been released from prison or pardoned, the lives of ex-detainees were made miserable; ‘political activity still proved difficult for those who wished to fight on’ (p. 83).</p>
<p>In big cities with a large working class, like Turin, Genoa, and Rome, the squads did not cease their activities and were not willing to listen to the call from Rome to tone them down: ‘urban districts known for anti-Fascism were attacked and occupied’; Fascist excesses were tolerated by local authorities (p. 43). Laws and institutions ceased to be effective, ‘thanks to the Fascist practice of <italic>ex post facto</italic> juridical-legislative legitimization’ that allowed action to overstep law, for state and party authorities engaged in practices that had no basis in the law ‘but were “legal” in that the state ultimately condoned them’ (p. 46).</p>
<p>At a national conference of his party, Mussolini told the delegates that, for him, violence was ‘profoundly virtuous, more virtuous than compromise or agreement’ (p. 42). And so Italy became a repressive police state where political power rested upon what the regime claimed to be the ‘consensus’ of the Italian people rather than the ‘system of mass repression’ (p. 45) that it was. Supreme authority in the provinces rested with the prefects, who had to be indisputably good fascists to be appointed in the first place, and therefore carried out the party’s policies, or their personal interpretation of them, with righteous vigor.</p>
<p>The fascist police-state functioned by involving local fascists in the gritty, day-to-day surveillance and intimidation of opponents and enemies (p. 46), and everybody could be targeted. Early on, Mussolini had ordered prefects to compile lists of ‘subversives’ and political opponents – communists, anarchists, socialists, republicans, Catholic Popolari, and others – throughout Italy (p. 39). In one circular to prefects, Police Chief De Bono instructed the police not to focus solely on the communists, because the state had ‘dangerous enemies even among the men who displayed the most ostentatious devotion to the state itself’ (p. 39). At its second meeting, the newly established Fascist Grand Council, a sort of shadow cabinet set up in December 1922, created a fascist militia (Voluntary Militia for National Security, MVSN), which would organize the squads into a formal hierarchical military structure, making them an official institution of the Italian state (p. 38). At an emergency meeting of Mussolini’s Council of Ministers on 5 November 1922, only a week after the March on Rome, all publications hostile to the regime were banned, a political investigative unit within the MVSN was created and a call went out for a total reorganization of the police (p. 44). Fascists also exerted tremendous pressure on the non-Marxist dailies to take a pro-fascist line (p. 37).</p>
<p>All over Italy institutions and individuals, even if they were not targeted, felt the danger. Emilio Lussu, one of the very few who ever escaped from confinement, wrote that ‘while the punishment might have hit the few, the threat was meant for everyone. That is, the punishment meted out to the few was meant to serve as a threat for the many’ (p. 103).</p>
<p>In working-class neighborhoods, there were families that were ruined by a prison or a confinement stint inflicted on the family’s breadwinner; in such neighborhoods ‘an ordinary knock on the door late at night was terrifying’, according to a woman from the San Lorenzo working district of Rome, ‘it was terror’ (p. 102).</p>
<p>And it was not just the arrests: ‘the patterns of Fascist political violence created a formidable array of ordinary vexations’ (p. 258). On the occasion of the regime’s many national celebrations, parades, and ceremonies, fascists beat up people for trifling offences, not taking off one’s hat, as fascist authorities or flags passed by (p. 225). And if one was picked up by the fascists rather than the police, ‘Fascists and militiamen conducted their own “investigations” and roughed up, beat, and intimidated people as they pleased, without the police ever getting involved’ (p. 225). If provincial police officials were at times punished for misusing violence to preserve ‘the veneer of legality the regime cultivated for domestic and foreign consumption’ (p. 60), the fascist actions were never targeted for such discipline. ‘Further immunizing the perpetrators of ordinary violence from punishment was the predictable fact that the victims of attacks, extortion, and other crimes committed by Fascists were unlikely to file a complaint with authorities, who were often themselves complicit in Fascist misdeeds’ (p. 225), so reporting would have served no purpose beyond probably provoking retaliation.</p>
<p>‘Many MVSN officials and rank-and-file militiamen simply rejected the notion that their actions should be bound by the law’ (p. 115); whether on or off duty, they arrested ex-detainees and free citizens for ‘provoking’ or ‘defaming’ them (p. 115). ‘Fascist Ras, together with their cronies and clients, continued to rule towns, small cities, and neighborhoods as private fiefdoms, engaging in a wide array of illegal activities, ranging from extortions to physical attacks’ (p. 217). A <italic>squadrista</italic> of the first hour and secretary of the local <italic>fascio</italic>, like a Farinacci or a Starace and his clique of fascists, held the city under a regime of terror (p. 218).<disp-quote>
<p>The police recruited bar owners and employees as informants. And no wonder that so many bar owners acquiesced: the police controlled business permits, which they could summarily revoke or fail to renew. Moreover at the risk of losing their operating license, bar owners were also forbidden from hiring persons of bad ‘moral and political conduct'. (p. 202)</p>
<p>When confronted with a drunken person shouting anti-Mussolini slurs, to remain silent was to risk punishment. To deny to police that such a blatant act had occurred was to bring political suspicion upon oneself. A proprietor, patron or passerby who listened passively to an anti-Fascist diatribe might well be accused by the police of complicity, attracting unwanted attention and even sanctions. (p. 245)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>At a certain point, all party members were officially made to involve themselves in denouncing and repressing anti-fascist acts. It became common for them to threaten ‘people with sanctions in order to intimidate them, often in terms that suggested that the party rather than the state held jurisdiction on <italic>confino</italic> sentences’ (p. 227). It came to be ordinary that every street had its fascist charged with following the latest news about what occurred on the street, private matters of the residents, especially those who were not fascists (p. 220). This penetration of Italian society by the party and the militia ‘led to a nationalization of politicized conflict and violence’ (p. 220). Gradually, that is, what was often left to local initiative became so widespread that it seemed to be totally macro-managed by the central organs. ‘Party and militia members wielded a great deal of coercive power’ in the implementation of political and social control (p. 220).</p>
<p>The author concludes that ‘many of the quotidian vexations of the lived experience of Fascism, so colorfully captured by film directors, novelists, and poets, have been taken for granted, but rarely studied by scholars’, and yet ‘ordinary violence and bullying are simultaneously everywhere’ – the creeping influence of party-state authority seeps into the relationships between friends, neighbors, family members, and strangers (p. 216). With the passing of time, the penetration of the policies of the regime became so intrusive that it affected family life – a bachelor tax, prizes for large families or for every new birth, prohibition of birth control devices – the regime’s<disp-quote>
<p>policies of political and social control began permeating broader sections of Italian society and shaping the minutiae of everyday life. No longer confined to the venues of conflict between Fascists and anti-Fascists, the politics of ordinary violence metastasized to communities throughout the Italian peninsula, infiltrating public spaces, the work place, and even the family home. Personal relationship and social interactions became political. The threat of physical attacks, institutional confinement, and financial ruin loomed over even the most mundane events. (p. 216)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus in fascist Italy there was a self-proclaimed totalitarian regime in which most individual liberties and due process had been suspended, and ‘security measures’ were proclaimed but left undefined, so that everyone from the judges down could mete out the punishment that was supposed to fit the crime, which could vary from incarceration to institutionalization, to ‘<italic>libertà vigilata</italic>’ or a simple ‘<italic>ammonizione</italic>’ which meant ‘mind, we are keeping an eye on you’ to Italians who might not have been proved guilty of anything (p. 199). When there was a question of balancing individual rights against collective interests, the principle of state authority over legality prevailed (p. 65). Political and common crimes were framed as threats to the nation (p. 65). When politics had been involved, even if no crime had been committed, there could be a simple <italic>ammonizione</italic>, or a <italic>diffida</italic> (‘don’t let yourself be caught in the same situation or else’), or the political confinement (p. 199) on one of the many islands of the Tyrrhenian or Adriatic sea, or in a tiny remote village in the mountains of the South.</p>
<p>The political trouble spots in fascist Italy were usually sniffed out by the paramilitary political militias who had seized and consolidated power through illegal terrorist violence and thus were themselves expert conspirators and had ‘become responsible for identifying, punishing and controlling a good number of enemies of the state’ (p. 66). During the regime they were swarming everywhere in uniform or in plain clothes and held the right to ‘take custody of their fellow citizens’ based primarily ‘on their ideological zeal and capacity for violence’ (p. 66). The place of the party and the militia within the repressive apparatus ‘was somewhat ambiguous, perhaps intentionally’ (p. 71). But even simple party members were responsible for reporting information regarding the activities of friends, acquaintances, and coworkers (p. 70). In Rome, Mussolini encouraged and enabled local authorities, fascists, and ordinary Italians ‘to denounce and suppress “anti-fascist” behavior in their own communities’ (p. 214).</p>
<p>One of the worst punishments, in spite of the fact that the regime made it sound, especially for the benefit of the foreign press, like being sent to a pleasant summer resort, was the <italic>confino di polizia</italic> – to which a few highly informative central chapters of this book are dedicated – usually to a tiny island in the Tyrrhenian or the Adriatic seas or to a lost village in the mountains of the South. Most political cases were handled by a ‘Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State’ which began operating in early 1927 (p. 63).</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that confined persons had to report to the police daily and were not allowed to go beyond a certain perimeter, they had to scramble to obtain the humblest lodgings and the food for their survival, and to get money from their family who, if they had been deprived of the breadwinner, now had to rely on charity. The lucky ones were given a miserly daily allowance by the government. But the conditions the family had been left in at home were the worst form of punishment for the detainees to bear, and the regime knew that. It ‘fully recognized the importance of the family as a tool for controlling political opponents’ (p. 96).</p>
<p>State officials knew that the absence of a primary breadwinner ‘horribly eroded a family’s already precarious financial situation’ (pp. 96–97), and if an individual might have been willing to suffer and be defiant, ‘most were unwilling to subject their families to such danger’ (p. 31). Ebner says that Mussolini’s view of <italic>confino di polizia</italic> was that of ‘an institution of “social hygiene” and “national prophylaxis”’ (p. 135), and that he wanted to call public attention to colonies that hosted prominent anti-fascists to make them seem like pleasant resorts, but that in fact the tens of thousands of Italians sentenced to <italic>confino di polizia</italic> collectively experienced ‘prison, filth, sleeplessness, exhaustion, malnutrition, thirst, disease, homesickness, illness, fear, physical violence, financial ruin, and pernicious uncertainty’ (p. 137). For, perhaps even ‘more significant than the scope of violence and suffering was the fact that anything was possible. Once the police arrested an Italian, the State could subject him to all manner of mistreatment, punishment, and neglect’ (p. 137).</p>
<p>The severity of the punishment and its consequences were enough ‘to induce most of Mussolini’s opponents to abandon their opposition to Fascism; the regime exploited their desperation, offering many of them pardons, which could then be used as propaganda to lessen the appearance of political repression and dishearten rank and file anti-Fascists’ (p. 165). The suffering of the detainees and their families provided admonitory examples for other members of the community, who quickly fell into line (p. 24).</p>
<p>Mussolini bragged about the many letters of submission he had received, reading them aloud in the Chamber of Deputies (p. 143). Before conceding a pardon, Mussolini had the prefects, the police and party officials agree on each individual case, but the detainees had to ask for it as well, obsequiously professing their newly-acquired or faith from birth in fascism, and promising to dedicate themselves thenceforth exclusively to work and family, staying away from public establishments and renouncing old friendships, all the while passively submitting to invasive police surveillance of private life (p. 149). After returning home, the former detainees had a hard time finding jobs, drifted in and out of low-paying ones or remained unemployed for long periods, subjected to constant surveillance (p. 165).</p>
<p>Besides the individual pardons there were also regular amnesties, especially on the occasion of fascist anniversaries. The amnesties, Ebner points out, ‘had a practical purpose: to make room for the ever growing number of detainees. Publicly, however, the regime presented “acts of clemency” as evidence of diminishing opposition, growing consensus, and decreasing repression under Mussolini’s dictatorship’ (p. 143). Of course ‘the most important anti-Fascists would remain in jail, while the thousands of inconsequential political prisoners and common criminals would be set free’ (p. 143). The author quotes Francesco Nitti (one of the few who escaped detention), who wrote that<disp-quote>
<p>each time one of these ‘pardons’ takes place the Fascist press lauds to the skies the ‘magnanimity and clemency of the beloved Duce.’ If one remembers that these men have committed no crime, that they have been undergoing arbitrary punishment, and that the liberty which they ought never to have been deprived of is hailed as an act of magnanimity when given back to them, one can form some opinion of the Duce’s character and that of his propaganda agents. (p. 149)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is interesting to see what charges led to confinement. Ebner has compiled a list in descending order from the statistics: political activity in Italy, volunteering in the Spanish Civil War on the anti-fascist side, political activity abroad, Slavic resistance, insults or criticism of regime and its policies, insults or criticism of the Duce, insults or criticism of the PNF/MVSN, defeatism during the Ethiopian and Spanish civil wars, defeatism in the Second World War, singing anti-fascist jingles, Catholic pacifism, corruption by members of the Fascist Party, economic activities against the regime, expatriation, homosexuality, Jehovah’s Witnesses–Pentecostals, etc., which is like saying that the regime’s authoritarian practices of confinement, harassment and discrimination, if they were often deployed selectively against specific groups, ‘just as often they cast a wide net, striking at the poor, unemployed, vulnerable, which is to say the majority of the Italian population in the mid-twentieth century’ (p. 264). Once they had been caught in these nets, detainees had to formulate appeals, request subsidies, seek permission for family visits, obtain authorization for medical care, ‘and, most importantly, win their freedom’ (p. 19).</p>
<p>Besides these forms of internment run by the Ministry of the Interior, there were also military internment camps run by the Italian military authorities (approximately 70,000 prisoners) to which at the beginning of the Second World War the detainees still remaining in the civilian camps were transferred, plus ‘60,000–100,000 Slovenian, Croatians, and Montenegrin civilians’ and some ‘Italian citizens from Venezia Giulia, while others were former citizens of the ex-Yugoslavian territories annexed by Italy during 1941 and 1942’ (p. 260). It should not be surprising that ‘conditions in the military camps were far worse than in those operated by the Interior Ministry’, Ebner points out: ‘the military had already developed practices of mass civilian internment before the Second World War. In the early 1920s in Cyrenaica’ (p. 260).</p>
<p>Besides the pardons and amnesties, another tool of propaganda for the regime, we are told in one of the final chapters, was the establishment of a fund, called EOA for needy families (‘distributing food, clothing, firewood, and other aid’, p. 233), which was administered by the local party authorities and thus gave rise to opportunities for discrimination and favoritism as well as corruption, so much so that at a certain point the state took it over ‘with the goal of making welfare distribution more professional and less corrupt’ (p. 234), but because it was chronically underfunded, ‘these shortcomings ultimately led to the dissolution of the EOA in 1937’ (p. 234). The discrimination involved local fascists against ‘workers who did not join the party, failed to take part in the parades and ceremonies, or had a reputation for criticizing the regime’ (p. 233).</p>
<p>Another of the final chapters is dedicated to the strategies of survival ordinary Italians had to learn. They had to figure out the ‘mechanism of Fascist rule’ (p. 263), and ways to contend with it, to learn what constituted ‘acceptable, as well as obligatory, political and social behavior’ in order not ‘to court trouble, even disaster’ (p. 239). ‘Discerning and navigating the dangers and opportunities presented by state-backed coercion constituted a way of life’ (p. 239). The author posits a case that would have been applicable to millions of families: <disp-quote>
<p>If a poor, married woman with four children did not give her wedding band to the Party in support of the Ethiopian war, what consequence might befall her down the road? What about her children? Due to the nature of Mussolini’s rule, the answer was: anything can happen. Repressive policies were fluid – uncertainty prevailed. Thus, it was always better to conform. (p. 264)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The distribution of punishment, patronage, and pardon depended in part on whether Italians exhibited certain behaviors and avoided others (p. 258). Failure to join the National Fascist Party (PNF) or take part in its public ceremonies compromised citizens in the eyes of the state (p. 240). If you were called in and asked why you had not joined the party, what would be your answer? Any answer would make you guilty: Italians who were not members of the party were left to explain why (p. 256). Requiring membership for government public employment, state-controlled teaching positions, academic and athletic competitions was another way of exercising coercion, ‘other than resorting to physical and institutional punishment’ (p. 231). As the author very accurately observes, ‘living a life of calculated political conformity penetrated and shaped the individual psyches of many Italians’ (p. 240).</p>
<p>Ebner outlines the history of party membership very clearly: for adults, getting the party’s membership card was not easy in the 1920s, but it became easier in the 1930s, automatic, indeed compulsory for school-age youth and any public employment. Under the two secretariats of Giovanni Giurati and Augusto Turati,<disp-quote>
<p>joining the PNF was voluntary and admission was highly selective. Between 1927 and 1932, entry to party rolls was either closed or severely restricted, and 230,000 members were purged. Under Starace, by contrast, membership became automatic for many young men: every year the ‘leva fascista’ initiated members of the fascist youth organizations – the Balilla (ONB) and, from 1937 onward, the Italian Youth of the Lictors (GIL) into the PNF proper. (p. 219)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Belonging to the party also became obligatory for state employment, eligibility for social services, and other benefits (p. 219). For many, the saying went, the PNF stood for ‘Per necessità familiare’ (For Family Necessity). ‘Accordingly, party membership increased from 825,000 in 1931 to more than two million in 1936; it would reach almost five million by 1939. Additionally Italians joined party organizations – the labor syndicates, the <italic>fasci femminili</italic> (women’s section), the youth groups, the Dopolavoro – by the millions’ (p. 219).</p>
<p>Ebner rightly challenges the orthodox history of Italian fascism which ‘invariably suggests that violence disappeared after 1925–1926, only to reappear in 1935 in the form of outwardly directed military violence’ – that is, with the Ethiopian war, and later with the Second World War – so that there would be a lost decade, roughly between 1925 and 1935, in which ‘the dictatorship allegedly limited itself to “traditional police-state methods”’ (p. 262). He contends instead that fascist violence continued to operate under Mussolini’s party-state, that ‘violence was carefully calibrated, selective, highly personal, and insidious, if seldom lethal. It operated within and exploited the parochialism of Italian towns – Fascists knew which buttons to push in small, tightly knit communities’ (p. 263).</p>
<p>He recalls how, in 1945, when fascism had been liquidated, the memory of the terror was still alive in many people and ‘induced many partisans to seek out for summary execution those same “<italic>squadrists</italic>” and their patrons who had killed and terrorized Socialists and trade-unionists in the early 1920s’ (p. 262).</p>
<p>As for the 1924 elections that Gilmour calls ‘the last real elections of 1924’ (p. 314), Ebner tells us how ‘black shirts intimidated opposition candidates and voters. Their manipulation of elections was brutally straightforward’ (p. 38). For instance Italo Balbo, the Ras of Ferrara, ‘explaining tactics that could apply to other elections of the era’, instructed fascists<disp-quote>
<p>to seize the first elector to leave the voting booth and break his head open – even if he voted for us, too bad for him – shouting, ‘Bastard, you voted for the Socialists.’ In this way we can be sure that, after this example, no one will risk not voting for the [fascist] <italic>lista nazionale</italic>. Although the fascist list did not win everywhere in 1924, in some districts it miraculously received all votes, without a single person supporting the opposition candidate. (p. 38)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the author of <italic>Ordinary Violence</italic> comes back to a question he poses at the beginning of the book. The question is whether the regime’s repressive rule that disseminated fear, promoted conformity, and deeply affected ordinary Italians had succeeded or failed in creating a population that would, as the slogan went, ‘believe, obey, fight’ (p. 20), that ‘credere, obbedire, combattere’ followed by Mussolini’s signature and plastered on every available wall in every town. And, of course, his answer is that it failed miserably, as every dictatorship in recent decades, no matter how solid it may have looked, has been rejected. Because if violence seems to breed conformity as a way of survival, conformity seems to breed, just as inevitably, fatigue, revulsion, and rebellion.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If Gilmore’s study leaves the reader with the impression that he has expressed exclusively personal opinions on the Italian support of fascism, without either consulting the archival documentation or exploring the matter with the survivors of life under fascism, Ebner, on the contrary, seems to have done both, for not only is his documentation thorough but his tone in conveying the conclusions he draws from the study of the documents is very close to that of the many victims of fascist violence who published dozens of memoirs during the immediate post-war years.</p>
<p>While Ebner’s narrative relies on facts, told straightforwardly as might be expected of a historical study (as my numerous quotations have demonstrated), Gilmour’s style is predominantly impressionistic and anecdotal, so his book will unfortunately probably be popular with the kind of reader who loves to see Italians ridiculed or disparaged as they are here, Italians who, since Napoleon, cannot do one thing right any more – politics or war, or what have you.</p>

<list-item><p>On the succession to the throne of Naples in the 1700s, when the present king must leave the throne of Naples to sit on the throne of Spain:</p></list-item>
</list><disp-quote>
<p>As the king’s eldest son was an imbecile and his second was heir to the Spanish crown, the Neapolitan throne went to the third brother, Ferdinand, who was left alone at the age of eight when his parents went to Madrid. While a Council of Regents directed his realm, Ferdinand emerged as a boisterous, bonhomous, rough-edged youth who loved hunting as much as his father and hated reading, writing and even signing his own name. His first complaint about his wife, a Habsburgh princess, was that she liked books. His rustic manner and earthy vocabulary may have been ill-suited to the palace of Caserta – ‘the Italian Versailles’ – but they made him popular; he was called the <italic>lazzarone</italic> king because he empathized with the city’s famous under-class known as <italic>lazzaroni</italic>, and like them he enjoyed eating <italic>maccheroni</italic> with his fingers.

<list-item><p>On Massimo D’Azeglio, twice Piedmont’s prime minister:</p></list-item>
</list><disp-quote>
<p>Massimo D’Azeglio might have been a character from <italic>The Charterhouse of Parma.</italic> He was a romantic figure, tall and handsome and blue-eyed, and he possessed the aristocratic charm and sexual appeal of the novel’s protagonist, Fabrizio del Dongo. Irreverent and unreserved (unusual qualities in Piedmont), he could talk to anyone from dancing girls to countesses, from bandits and wagoners to colonels and cardinals. A painter and a writer by profession, his amateur skills included music, swimming, riding and fencing. Perhaps his talents were too diffused for him to be really good at anything, even politics, although in 1849, at the age of fifty, he became prime minister of Piedmont. Azeglio seldom bothered to conceal his rather frequent boredom, and in old age he regretted the invention of <italic>l’homme serieux</italic> in France. He also deplored the fact that ‘the most tedious of the seven [deadly] sins – pride, envy and avarice – [had] got the better of the other four’: a Friend of Pleasure (another rare species in Piedmont), he saw nothing very reprehensible about sex, eating, laziness and occasional wrath. He enjoyed a good number of love affairs and tolerated two bad marriages. (p. 148)</p></disp-quote>

<list-item><p>On the two critical battles of 1859, Magenta and Solferino, for Italian unification, fought by the French rather than the Italians:</p></list-item>
</list><disp-quote>
<p>One of them, Magenta, was so sanguinary that it gave its name to the artist’s color magenta, but little Piedmontese blood helped inspire the name since the army did not arrive at the battlefield till nightfall, after the struggle was over. At the other, Solferino, the sight of wounded soldiers left to die was so horrifying to one Swiss witness that he went home and founded the International Red Cross. (p. 185)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This colorful, dismissive impressionism is unfortunately also reflected in some excessively generalizing or extremely abbreviated statements about very complex phenomena, like the characteristics of Renaissance humanism (p. 76), or the involvement of Leon Battista Alberti in the building of the church of Santa Maria Novella (p. 76), or in some attempts at critical judgment like the ones on Rossellini’s <italic>Open City</italic> (p. 351) and Fellini’s <italic>Vitelloni</italic> (p. 394), or when dealing with the belabored question of the importance of the family in Italian social life – generalizing, that is, on a matter that presents enormous differences in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is easy to see in Gilmour the influence of another sensationalist book about the Italians and their fundamental flaws, Luigi Barzini Jr’s <italic>The Italians.</italic> Another book that is mentioned frequently and admired limitlessly as a ‘beautiful novel’ is Lampedusa’s <italic>The Leopard</italic>, of which ‘the communist press blasted the ideological deficiency’, but their ‘campaign of denigration was blunted by the French writer Louis Aragon, one of the leading Marxist intellectuals in Europe, who mocked Alberto Moravia’s grumble that Lampedusa’s work was ‘right wing’ and a success for the Right. Even more disconcerting was Aragon’s assertion that <italic>The Leopard</italic> was ‘one of the greatest novels of this century, one of the great novels of our time; and most crushingly, “perhaps … the only Italian novel”’ (pp. 355–356), while the book is actually one of the most derivative historical novels of Italian literary history, modeled structurally, in its use of historical material, and thematically (especially in its central point that, in the belief of the southern aristocracy, the more things change the more they remain the same) on De Roberto’s 1910 masterful novel, <italic>I vicerè</italic>.</p>
