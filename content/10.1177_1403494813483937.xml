<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: To describe the development of a deprivation index for Danish parishes and to investigate its association with all-cause mortality compared with the Townsend index and individual-level factors. <italic>Methods</italic>: Nine socioeconomic factors were aggregated to the parish level from individual-level register data comprising the entire Danish population in 2005. A principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the number of factors and to apply weights. An ecological analysis investigated the association between the Danish Deprivation Index (DANDEX) and standardised mortality ratios in Danish parishes. Results were compared with the Townsend index and a possible modifying effect of population density was investigated. Sensitivity of the index was investigated with multilevel survival analyses evaluating the association between all-cause mortality and DANDEX, the Townsend Index, individual-level socioeconomic factors, and population density. <italic>Results</italic>: DANDEX consists of two components measuring socioeconomic properties of all 2119 Danish parishes. The first component measures deprivation related to housing (house and car ownership) while the second component is related to classical measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation). A clear gradient in standardised mortality ratios was seen across quintiles of both index components. Modifying effects were seen when stratifying the index components by population density. In a frailty model, DANDEX accounted for 76% of the between-parish variation in all-cause mortality, while the Townsend index and individual socioeconomic factors accounted for 71 and 76%, respectively. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: The index can be used to identify Danish parishes by their levels of deprivation and it provides municipalities with a tool to allocate resources to the geographic areas where they are most needed.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>In many countries, composite deprivation indices have been developed to describe the socioeconomic composition of inhabitants in defined area units, such as municipalities or census districts. Authorities have used these to target programmes and to allocate resources to geographic areas where demand is highest or where interventions are most needed. In health research, such indices have been used to evaluate the association between social position and health when individual-level data have not been readily available. The most well-known deprivation indices are the Townsend index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483937">1</xref>], the Carstairs index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813483937">2</xref>], the Jarman index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483937">3</xref>] and the English Indices of Deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483937">4</xref>]. Especially the Townsend deprivation index has been widely used in health research.</p>
<p>Composite deprivation indices have not received the same attention in the Nordic countries where researchers often have access to register-based individual-level data making deprivation indices less relevant. However, outside research institutions, individual-level data are not easily available and there has been growing interest among regional authorities to use composite deprivation measures in resource allocation and city planning. Examples of Nordic indices include the Swedish underprivileged area score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813483937">5</xref>] and two Danish indices used in identifying low-resource municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813483937">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813483937">7</xref>]. The Danish indices were constructed for municipalities by ranking them according to the proportion of inhabitants with low education, unemployment, and income and finally summarising rankings into an overall score. The aim of this investigation was to develop a Danish Deprivation Index (DANDEX) by applying the same advanced methods as were used in development of other validated indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483937">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483937">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813483937">8</xref>]. This includes the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and the shrinkage technique. DANDEX was constructed for parishes, as opposed to municipalities, to better capture variation in relative deprivation, since the socioeconomic composition of inhabitants can vary greatly within short distances. Further in evaluating its validity, the association between DANDEX and all-cause mortality was assessed; this relationship was in turn related to population density because previous measures have been criticised for not being able to explain variation in health in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813483937">9</xref>] and also because some indicators of deprivation, such as proportion of car owners (as used in the Townsend index), are automatically higher in rural areas irrespective of income level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813483937">10</xref>]. Finally, it was assessed how much variation in all-cause mortality DANDEX was able to explain compared to the Townsend index and individual-level socioeconomic variables.</p>

<title>Data and statistical analyses used to construct the index</title>
<p>Socioeconomic indicators and parish codes for the entire Danish population on 1 January 2005 (<italic>n</italic>=5,412,168) were obtained from Statistics Denmark. Persons without a parish code (<italic>n</italic>=20,173) were omitted. Individual-level data were aggregated to the parish level. Parishes today have no political or administrative tasks and in 2005 differed in size from 0.1 to 157 km<sup>2</sup> (median=20 km<sup>2</sup>). Parish populations ranged from 34 to 20,783 persons (median=2545). The total data set comprised 5,391,898 persons in 2119 parishes. Definitions of the variables are described in Supplementary Table A. The variables represent domains of income, employment, education, and housing, which have been established as important indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483937">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813483937">11</xref>]. Additionally the proportion of one-parent households was included as this previously has been shown to be associated with health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483937">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813483937">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813483937">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813483937">13</xref>]. Inspired by the English indices of deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483937">4</xref>], a crime domain was also included.</p>
<p>A shrinkage technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483937">4</xref>] was used to assure more reliable and robust proportions for parishes with few inhabitants. The shrunken parish-level proportions were log-transformed to obtain normalised distributions and to reduce heterogeneity in score variance. Each score was then standardised to a z-score.</p>
<p>To reduce the number of indicators and to determine the relative weight of the variables, a PCA was performed with varimax (orthogonal) rotation. The final set of components was determined upon eigenvalue-one criterion, scree test, and amount of common variance accounted for by each component and interpretability criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813483937">14</xref>]. Weights obtained by a PCA were multiplied with the z-score for each indicator. Weighted z-scores for all variables were summarised into a final score for each component. These steps were executed with the PROC FACTOR procedure in SAS 9.2. Parishes were sorted into quintiles by their level of deprivation and for each strata proportions for all variables were calculated. To evaluate whether components measured one-dimensional concepts, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated.</p>

<title>Ecological analyses</title>
<p>Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) by sex and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each quintile of parishes by comparing the observed number of all deaths in 2004–06 with the expected number of deaths based on age- and sex-specific deaths rates for the Danish population in the same period. The SMRs for each of the two resulting components’ quintiles were compared to SMRs calculated for quintiles of the Townsend index and were stratified by quintiles of population density (persons per km<sup>2</sup>). In addition SMRs for combinations of the two DANDEX components were calculated.</p>
<p>The Townsend index is the unweighted sum of four z-scores measuring proportion of unemployed over the age of 16 years, proportion of households without a car, proportion of households living in a rented dwelling, and proportion of households with more than one person per room. Unlike the original Townsend index, we used the shrinkage technique and calculated unemployment for persons between 30 and 60 years as opposed to 16 years and over.</p>

<title>Individual-level analyses</title>
<p>All persons with residence in Denmark on 1 January 2004 were followed for death and emigration through 2006. The study population was restricted to individuals aged 30–81 years to ensure that the majority of individuals had completed their educations and to exclude older age groups whose education level is not registered. Residence as of 1 January 2004 determined the parish codes assigned to individuals. For a limited number of cases (<italic>n</italic>=152,950), parish codes were not available for 2004, but were assigned from 2005 and 2006 residence. To ensure a homogeneous study population, immigrants were excluded, because preliminary analyses indicated that their susceptibility to individual- and parish-level SES differed from ethnic Danes. Furthermore, persons with missing data were excluded, resulting in a data set comprising 2,741,271 persons, equal to 91.8% of the total population between 30 and 81 years.</p>
<p>Parishes were split into quintiles based on their scores on the DANDEX components, the Townsend index, and population density. These values were applied to each individual according to parish residence. Individual-level SES factors included highest obtained education, disposable family income, occupation-based SES, and marital status. Education was coded according to the three-group version of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813483937">15</xref>]. Disposable income was calculated as annual gross income after taxation and interest per person deflated to 2000 price levels and divided by number of persons in the household elevated by a factor of 0.6. This is routinely done by official economic institutions in Denmark to account for the economic advantages of sharing costs in households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813483937">16</xref>]. Occupation-based SES was based on the six-class European Socio-Economic Classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813483937">17</xref>]. Persons with no employment were grouped into four additional categories: students, unemployed, disability pensioners, and pensioners. Only those who were already retired in 1990 were classified as pensioners and only individuals who had been unemployed for more than two years were grouped as unemployed; all others were grouped according to last position held. Marital status was dichotomised into cohabiting/married and single. Since major life events can occur shortly before death (e.g. job loss, income reduction, changes in marital status), individual characteristics were measured 3 years prior to death (2001–03). Individual characteristics for all right-censored persons were measured in 2002.</p>
<p>To evaluate how well DANDEX explained variation in all-cause mortality compared to the Townsend index and individual factors and to explore the relationship between the deprivation indices and population density, shared frailty modelling was conducted using the STREG procedure in Stata MP version 12. A frailty model is a generalisation of survival regression which accounts for the effect of a latent multiplicative factor, the frailty, on the hazard function. The shared frailty model is a random-effects model where frailties are shared among groups of individuals (inhabitants in the same parish) and are randomly distributed across groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813483937">18</xref>].</p>
<p>A null model estimated the total variation in all-cause mortality between Danish parishes. Subsequent models adjusted for individual age and sex in combination with different factors. Model 1 contained DANDEX alone and was estimated together with population density in model 2. In model 3, the Townsend index was evaluated alone and supplemented with population density in model 4. Then a model containing only individual factors was estimated (model 5) and DANDEX and population density were added (model 6). Finally individual factors were evaluated together with the Townsend index and population density (model 7).</p>

<p>Two main components emerged from the PCA: one describing housing deprivation and a second describing socioeconomic deprivation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813483937">Table I</xref>). These two components accounted for 38 and 29%, respectively, of the variance. A third component was also produced but only one variable (proportion of households with more than one person per room) loaded on this and therefore was dropped from the analysis.</p>

<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813483937">Table I</xref>, higher scores on the housing component were associated with lower proportions of car owners and higher proportions of rented dwellings, one-parent families, unemployment, and criminal records. Higher scores on the socioeconomic component were associated with higher proportions of inhabitants with low education, low disposable income, manual jobs, and unemployment. The DANDEX components were entirely uncorrelated and measured one-dimensional concepts, as confirmed by the Cronbach’s alpha of 0.76 for both component. The housing component (component 1) was highly correlated with the Townsend index (<italic>r</italic>=0.88), while the socioeconomic component (component 2) was not (<italic>r</italic>=−0.16).</p>
<p>Deprived parishes, as defined by component 1, were found in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, and Aalborg (the four largest cities in Denmark), but also in more remote areas such as northern Jutland, Lolland, and Bornholm. More affluent areas were mainly found in mid and western Jutland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813483937">Figure 1</xref>). For component 2, deprived areas were found in northern and southern Jutland, western Zealand, Lolland, Falster, and Bornholm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494813483937">Figure 2</xref>), while affluent areas were concentrated around larger cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus.</p>

<p>Deprived parishes as measured by component 1 had an average of 48% households without access to a car and 63% of households were rented dwellings; affluent parishes had 10 and 12%, respectively (Supplementary Tables B and C). Deprived parishes, as measured by component 2, had 36% of inhabitants between age 30 and 60 with a low education and 15% with low disposable income, compared with 17 and 7%, respectively, in affluent parishes.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813483937">Table II</xref>, deprived parishes had higher SMRs and affluent parishes had lower SMRs for both genders, whether measured by component 1, component 2, or the Townsend index. Differences in mortality, however, were more pronounced for men than for women. In affluent areas, SMRs were identical for component 1 and the Townsend index (SMR=0.79 among men and SMR=0.84 in women). In deprived areas, SMRs for component 1 and the Townsend index were nearly identical (SMR=1.08 vs. 1.09 in men and SMR=1.02 vs. 1.03 in women). SMRs for component 2 in affluent areas were 0.92 among men and 0.94 among women while in deprived parishes SMRs were 1.11 among men and 1.06 among women. Supplementary Table D shows that SMRs generally were lower in all deprivation-level strata in parishes with low population density compared to those with high density. Although results for less densely populated parishes were less stable due to fewer observations, they suggest that component 1 and the Townsend index measured the same dimension and that population density was an important effect modifier.</p>

<p>Higher SMRs were found in parishes deprived on both dimensions (SMR=1.14 for men, SMR=1.08 for women), and lower SMRs were evident in parishes that were affluent on both dimensions (SMR=0.76 for men, SMR=0.80 for women) (Supplementary Table E).</p>
<p>The first individual-level analysis showed that age and sex explained 51.5% of the variation in all-cause mortality. Adding DANDEX to this model explained 76% of the variation, with larger effects seen in component 1 than in component 2 (model 1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813483937">Table III</xref>). By further adding population density to the model only slightly more variation was explained (77.4%). The effect of component 1 was attenuated while a stronger effect of component 2 was seen (model 2). Using the Townsend index alone explained 71.3% variation (model 3) and adding population density only marginally increased the percentage of explained variation (model 4). By further adjusting model 4 for education, disposable income, or occupation-based SES, population density became significant (results not shown). A model with four individual SES factors (model 5) explained 75.8% of the variation. Adding population density and DANDEX (model 6) or the Townsend index (model 7) increased explained variation to 88.0 and 88.2% respectively. The addition of individual SES factors greatly attenuated the effects of DANDEX (models 2 vs. 6) and the Townsend index (models 4 and 7), but the effects of population density increased.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we have reported the development of DANDEX and have evaluated it for its use in epidemiological and health services research to identify socioeconomically deprived small areas in Denmark. DANDEX measures two aspects of socioeconomic deprivation in Danish parishes. The first component, consisting primarily of deprivation related to housing, is comparable to the Townsend index, while the second component is related to classical measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation). Clear gradients in mortality risks were seen in both DANDEX components. DANDEX explained more variation in individual all-cause mortality than the Townsend index and also as much as did individual-level SES factors.</p>
<p>Three of the four highest weighted factors in component 1 are also three of the factors included in the Townsend index. Deprived parishes as identified by this component are found in urban areas largely because cars are needed less and rented housing is more common. Thus, deprivation in component 1 in urban parishes may reflect consequences of an urban lifestyle and housing markets. In rural areas, on the other hand, car ownership is needed more and rented housing is less common, suggesting that deprivation in rural parishes is related to restricted financial capabilities and to a lack of job opportunities in the areas. Deprivation as measured by component 1 is therefore modified by urbanicity. This is supported by comparing models 1 and 2 in Table III, where the effect of component 1 is reduced after introducing population density.</p>
<p>Affluent areas as measured by component 2 were concentrated around the larger cities, which likely reflects that higher-educated persons settle here due to the presence of educational institutions and companies employing higher-educated staff. Deprived parishes on the other hand were found in more peripheral areas of Denmark where the labour market does not attract as many inhabitants with a high SES and education.</p>
<p>When investigating the association between DANDEX and all-cause mortality, gradients in SMR were observed in both DANDEX components, as well as for combinations of the two. This is expected for a valid composite measure of relative deprivation. We can attribute three explanations to this finding: First, on the individual level it has been documented that a negative association exists between mortality and socioeconomic status due to increased health awareness and the health behaviour of higher socioeconomic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813483937">11</xref>]. Secondly, research documents an association between neighbourhood exposures and individual health which goes beyond the effect of individual characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813483937">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813483937">20</xref>]. Previous studies have shown how access to green space, healthy food, safety, or high social cohesion in neighbourhoods promote healthier lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813483937">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813483937">20</xref>]. Thirdly, this investigation has documented that population density is an important effect modifier, mostly of the socioeconomic component. Thus, some of the apparent effects of any deprivation index can be attributed to population density. Studies have shown that inhabitants in urban areas are exposed to increased levels of traffic-related air pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813483937">21</xref>] and noise pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813483937">22</xref>] and that alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813483937">23</xref>] and tobacco use are higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813483937">24</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that all three of these explanations are relevant. Although DANDEX was strong enough to explain as much variation in all-cause mortality as did individual SES indicators, one of its limitations is that it cannot separate effects caused by the individual level, the area level, and population density. Our results confirm previous studies advocating for use of aggregated variables in the absence of individual-level variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483937">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813483937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483937"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483937">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813483937">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813483937">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813483937">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813483937">25</xref>] as long as no causal relationships are inferred. They challenge, however, the view that individual-level SES variables explain more variation than aggregate measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813483937">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813483937">27</xref>].</p>
<p>It should be recognised that our index, as well as already existing indices, measures relative deprivation. For a country that ranks ninth in per capita gross national income amongst 213 nations and 32nd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813483937">28</xref>] out of 34 countries on the Gini index (lower ranking meaning more income equality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813483937">29</xref>], we are not speaking about absolute deprivation. Nonetheless, previous research has documented that even within a wealthy country inequalities in health persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813483937">30</xref>]. With the goal to identify those with poorer health outcomes in relatively wealthy societies, deprivation measures are useful tools.</p>
<p>DANDEX is a more complex construct than the Townsend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483937">1</xref>] or Carstairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813483937">2</xref>] indices which consist of only one dimension with four unweighted standardised variables. Our index encompasses a wider range of domains which are known to be associated with deprivation compared to the existing Danish indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813483937">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813483937">7</xref>]. Measuring deprivation as a two-dimensional entity enables users to describe deprivation more elaborately. A further advantage of this index is the more detailed geographical resolution compared to the two existing Danish indices (2119 parishes vs. 98 municipalities), ensuring more homogeneous areas with respect to inhabitant characteristics.</p>
<p>To conclude, the index serves two purposes. First, it can be used to identify areas by their socioeconomic status and therefore enable municipalities and health professionals in planning future geographically oriented initiatives and policies. Second, DANDEX can be used in epidemiological studies where there is no access to individual-level variables or in studies on area-level effects. We suggest that future research focus on validating the DANDEX with health outcomes other than all-cause mortality and investigate its usefulness at other levels of geographical aggregation.</p>
<p>In Supplementary Table F, the scores on the two components for all 2119 parishes are available.</p>
