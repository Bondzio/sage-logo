<abstract>
<p>Infants’ inability to articulate their pain and distress and the diverse range of behavioral responses evoked by painful stimuli may partially explain the challenges associated with the treatment of pain in neonates and infants. To assist nurses in distinguishing nonspecific distress responses from specific pain responses, a concept analysis using Wilson’s method was preformed. An evaluation of published, peer reviewed literature referencing distress in neonates and infants was conducted to extract meaningful information related to distress. This article examines the essential features, antecedents, and consequences of infant distress to generate an evidence-based definition that has relevance for neonatal and pediatric research and clinical practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite its ubiquitous nature, the structure and meaning of infant pain is surrounded by ambiguity and confusion. Disparate interpretations of infant pain variables contribute to researchers’ and clinicians’ misunderstanding of the phenomenon and ineffective pain management strategies. Many infants fail to receive appropriate analgesia for painful procedures because their pain is misinterpreted as distress. Infants’ inability to articulate their pain and distress, the subtle differences, and the diverse range of behavioral responses evoked by pain and distress highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between pain and distress in this population. This uncertainty surrounding the conceptual and operational definition of infant distress has hampered nurses’ ability to identify, interpret, and communicate behavioral pain responses in this population.</p>
<p>The literature analyzing distress experienced by adults makes little attempt to distinguish distress from other important concepts such as threat, conflict, misery, agony, suffering, and anguish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1054773811410601">Ridner, 2004</xref>). Fewer distinctions are made among these concepts in literature pertaining to pediatric populations. To date, there appears to be only one study exploring the graded expression of distress within the context of acute pain in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1054773811410601">Warnock &amp; Sandrin, 2004</xref>). The paucity of research providing conceptual and operational clarity for distress and the disparity between evidence and evidence-based practice establishes the theoretical and clinical relevance for a conceptual analysis of distress.</p>
<p>To help nurses identify appropriate pain management interventions for infants, it is crucial they recognize infant distress. The purpose of this concept analysis is to identify the essential features, antecedents, and consequences of infant distress, and to advance the concept’s utility for recognizing pain in infants.</p>

<title>Search Method</title>
<p>Searches of Medline (January 1996-November 2010), CINAHL (January 1982-November 2010) and PyscINFO (January 2000-November 2010) online databases were performed to extract peer-refereed publications from the disciplines of medicine, nursing, and psychology. Keywords and MESH headings used included distress, concept analysis, infant, pain, and newborn. The literature review recognized 176 peer-refereed articles. English language and full-text articles from the university subscription sources limitations were applied. Of the 63 remaining manuscripts, articles that focused on pregnant women and fetuses (24) and concrete physiological and psychological phenomena such as postnatal posttraumatic stress disorder, respiratory distress, and fetal distress (10) were excluded from analysis as these conditions complicate the extraction of relevant content for pain-related infant distress. The remaining 29 publications are the basis for integration and concept development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1054773811410601">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Concept Analysis of Distress</title>
<p>The selection of concept analysis methodology is predicated on the methodology’s ontological focus, which refers to the nature of knowledge and perspectives and complexity of concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773811410601">Duncan, Cloutier, &amp; Bailey, 2007</xref>). The Wilsonian method of concept analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson, 1963</xref>) with its ontological focus lends clarity and meaning to the understanding of complex concepts and their application to practice. Although nurse scholars frequently utilize the concept analysis framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1054773811410601">Walker and Avant (1995)</xref>, a modification of Wilson’s approach for the development of nursing theory for research and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773811410601">Hupcey, Morse, Lenz, &amp; Tason, 1996</xref>), the original method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson (1963)</xref> allows greater clarity around phenomena related to the concept of interest. Commonly, terms such as distress, pain, suffering, and anxiety are used interchangeably suggesting a need for delineating these concepts to direct assessments and intervention-based care.</p>
<p>This focused inquiry and critical examination of infant distress applies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson’s (1963)</xref> method of concept analysis. Wilson utilizes an 11-step inductive process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1054773811410601">Table 1</xref>) that systematically allows essential elements of a concept to emerge from the literature, establishes construct validity, and results in a precise operational definition of the concept.</p>

<title>Step 1: Isolate the Concept</title>
<p>The initial stage in concept analysis is to isolate the question of concept and determine the concept’s criteria for use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1054773811410601">Walker &amp; Avant, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson, 1963</xref>). Through a systematic review of the literature, relationships among concepts, insights into the conceptual underpinnings of a phenomenon, and new associations are developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773811410601">Broome, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1054773811410601">
<title>Definition of the concept</title>
<p>The origin of distress as a noun dates back to 1150-1475 <sc>ad</sc>. Its etymology is from Middle English [<italic>distresse</italic>], Old French [<italic>destresse</italic>]. The original meaning is a state of being in “extreme pain; anguish of body or mind; great unhappiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773811410601">McKechnie, 1970</xref>, p. 535). The etymological meaning of distress as a verb, in Middle English [<italic>distressen</italic>], Old French [<italic>destresser</italic>], and Latin vocabulary [<italic>distringere</italic>] is to “restrain, constrain, to pull asunder, or distract” (p. 535). Webster defines distress as to “afflict greatly, to afflict with pain or anguish, to harass, to make miserable, to make unhappy, anxious, etc., to trouble” (p. 535). In the Authorized King James Version of the Bible, the concept distress implies harassment, misery, unhappiness, anxiety, or to be troubled; Deuteronomy 2:9 “Distress not the Moabites” and in II Corinthians 4:8 “We are troubled on every side, but not distressed.” Sir Alexander Hamilton used distress to compel or to constrain by pain or suffering, “Men who can neither be distressed nor won into sacrifice of duty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1054773811410601">Hamilton, Madison, &amp; Jay, 1788</xref>, p. 493). Dictionary definitions describe distress in natural language. These definitions are limited because they are contextual and do not identify essential features or provide an operational definition of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1054773811410601">Reynolds, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1054773811410601">Walker &amp; Avant, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1054773811410601">
<title>Uses of the concept in the literature</title>
<p>In a legal context, distress means to “distrain, to seize and hold as security or indemnity for a debt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773811410601">McKechnie, 1970</xref>, p. 535). In linguistic context, antique dealers describe distressed furniture as furniture marred to give the effect of aging, teenagers wear distressed jeans, and merchants offer distressed merchandise for sale at a loss. In a maritime and aeronautical context, S O S (…—…) used in wireless telegraphy and “mayday” used verbally are the international standard signals of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773811410601">Campbell, 1998</xref>). In financial literature, distress covers both the difficulty a firm has in meeting its debt obligations and the consequences of these difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1054773811410601">Kindleberger, 2000</xref>). Viewed from a social-cultural context, a distressful condition would be a condition inappropriate to the social and cultural traditions that shape an individual’s outlook and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1054773811410601">Schaie &amp; Geiwitz, 1982</xref>). Environmental distress pertains to noxious distraction, restraint, noise, odors, habitat, people, and chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1054773811410601">Jorgenson, 1997</xref>). These contextual definitions reflect the everyday use of the concept. They are not discipline specific and do not reflect the subtle nuances of health care.</p>
<p>Health care professionals use distress in the context of physical, psychological, and spiritual conditions. The medical literature portrays distress as temporary conditions of great mental or physical suffering or anguish brought on by exogenous stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811410601">Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773811410601">Dirckx, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1054773811410601">Thomas, 1993</xref>). Within psychology, the concept of distress signifies feelings resulting from stressors such as trouble, depression, anxiety, conflict, and anguish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811410601">Block, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811410601">Cederholm, Sjoden, &amp; Axelsson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773811410601">Kirmayer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1054773811410601">Shelton &amp; Brown, 2001</xref>). Oncology literature refers to psychological distress as “maladaptive psychological functioning in the face of stressful life events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811410601">Abeloff, Armitage, Liechter, &amp; Niederhuber, 2000</xref>, p. 556). In obstetrics, the term “fetal distress” is no longer used; rather, a three-tier fetal heart rate interpretation system provides criteria to define characteristics and patterns for monitoring changes in fetal status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1054773811410601">Macones, Hankins, Spong, Hauth, &amp; Moore, 2008</xref>). The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association defines spiritual distress as a disruption in an individual’s life principle that fully invades a person. The disruption integrates and transcends their biological and social nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1054773811410601">North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International, 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>The field of veterinary medicine views distress as an adverse state in which an animal cannot escape from, or adapt to, the external or internal stressors or conditions it experiences, resulting in negative effects on its well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1054773811410601">National Research Council &amp; National Academy of Sciences, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1054773811410601">United States Department of Agriculture, 2000</xref>). This multifaceted definition is decontexualized, with identifiable antecedents and consequences; however, the relationship between these phenomena is not well established. Physiological and behavioral manifestations such as changes in weight, external appearance, or temperature, reduced activity, vocalization, avoidance, and biting are accepted indicators of pain and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811410601">Carstens &amp; Moberg, 2000</xref>). Animal experimentation can exploit these vulnerable subjects and, therefore, strict guidelines are imposed to weigh animal harm with human benefit. Expert judgments are made regarding perceived levels of distress that may result from animal testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1054773811410601">Orlans, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Related phenomena and concepts</title>
<p>Inability to distinguish between the terms stress, distress, and pain has contributed to ambiguous assumptions about infant behavioral responses to noxious stimuli. Failure to recognize and treat pain and distress in infants can have serious implications and deleterious long-term effects on health. With infants, the confusion surrounding the conceptualization of these terms is compounded by the infant’s lack of cognitive awareness of the stressors. Being unaware of stressors diminishes the perceptual aspects of feeling and processing sensory information. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773811410601">Lazarus (1999)</xref>, stress is cognitively perceived as a positive or negative environmental stimulus that evokes a myriad of nonspecific psychological and physiological responses requiring adaptation. Brief controlled periods of stress (eustress) have been found to enhance organism functioning. Protracted, uncontrolled situations of stress (distress) that exceed an individual’s adaptive capacities result in stress-related illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1054773811410601">McEwen &amp; Stellar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1054773811410601">Smith &amp; Selye, 1979</xref>). The same stressor produces unique responses and disorders in different persons due to the adaptive capability of the individual. Research suggests that distress scales cannot be utilized as diagnostic tools to distinguish between stress and distress because they are designed to explore comorbidity among symptoms, not to directly measure distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1054773811410601">Poulin, Lemoine, Poirier, &amp; Lambert, 2005</xref>). Distress often accompanies the experience of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1054773811410601">International Association for the Study of Pain Subcommittee on Taxonomy, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1054773811410601">Tak &amp; van Bon, 2006</xref>). Distress may also occur in the absence of any identifiable cause(s) for pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1054773811410601">Tak &amp; van Bon, 2006</xref>), and so it is impossible to sort out all sources of distress and to confirm or disconfirm the presence of pain, especially in neonates and infants when factors contributing to distress and pain cannot be evaluated through subjective reports. The coexistence of distress and pain further hampers the ability to differentiate them from one another and to target effective treatments.</p>
<p>The concepts of misery, agony, suffering, anxiety, anguish, and threat are often used as synonyms for distress. Misery denotes unhappiness, sickness, or poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811410601">Gove, 1963</xref>). Agony refers to pain too intense to be borne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811410601">Gove, 1963</xref>). Suffering is conscious endurance of pain or distress and often a stoical acceptance of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773811410601">Cassel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811410601">Gove, 1963</xref>). Anxiety is apprehension, tension, or uneasiness that stems from anticipation of danger from an unknown source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1054773811410601">Mereness &amp; Taylor, 1978</xref>). Anguish is distinguished by prolonged pain or suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811410601">Gove, 1963</xref>). Defined as “an indication of imminent danger, harm, evil” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773811410601">McKechnie, 1970</xref>, p. 1901), threat is a statement or expression of intention to harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1054773811410601">Pagana, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1054773811410601">Scholtz, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Threat is an antecedent of distress and is dependent on the perception of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1054773811410601">Scholtz, 2000</xref>). Distress, a consequence of appraised threat, occurs when the individual perception of threat challenges inadequate personal resources or when threat is so overwhelming to the psyche that the result is emotional pain and suffering. Although these concepts indicate an adverse state, threat and anxiety are future rather than present oriented, suffering and misery have a passive rather than aggressive tone, and agony and anguish refer to the character of the concept.</p>
<p>Harmony is a concept that is contrary to distress. Within a health care setting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811410601">Easley (2007)</xref> describes harmony as a major aspect of personal, working, and nurse–patient relationships. Patient–nurse and nurse–nurse relationships are affected by the three attributes of harmony: balance, peace, and rhythm. The balance is important for decreasing the incidence of disease and promoting health. The five consequences of the concept are identified as pleasant environment, sense of satisfaction, positive self-concept, beautiful sound, or effective program.</p>

<title>Step 2: Finding the Right Answers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson (1963)</xref> states that a concept analysis distinguishes the primary and central uses of a concept from derived and borderline uses through the identification of essential features. Essential features are characteristics that must be present to recognize the concept. They should be abstract, universal, and be applicable to any situation in which the concept is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1054773811410601">Morse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1054773811410601">Walker &amp; Avant, 1995</xref>). The essential features of the concept distress were inductively derived from data utilizing the techniques of grounded theory as described by Glaser and Strauss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1054773811410601">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). Data were analyzed by a constant comparative process, where data were collected and analyzed simultaneously, allowing for essential features, extensions, derivatives, and metaphors of the concept to be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1054773811410601">Figure 2</xref>). Content of publications were examined until no new data emerged, resulting in categories that were saturated and linked around five categories or attributes: (a) reality; (b) orientation in present; (c) assignment of negative meaning; (d) negative emotion; and (e) absence of tissue trauma.</p>

<p>Health care literature supports this orientation through multiple lines of evidence detailing interventions to alleviate distress resulting from physical, psychological, and spiritual conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811410601">Abeloff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811410601">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811410601">Block, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811410601">Cederholm et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773811410601">Kirmayer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1054773811410601">Shelton &amp; Brown, 2001</xref>). An analysis of threat exposes the expectancy of harm or loss for a given stimulus. Threat is oriented in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1054773811410601">Scholtz, 2000</xref>). In distress, the reality of the harm or loss for a given stimulus is in the present.</p>

<sec id="section11-1054773811410601">
<title>Assignment of negative meaning</title>
<p>The cognitive process of assessing distress as an adverse state begins with assigning a negative meaning to the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1054773811410601">Murrow &amp; Welch, 1997</xref>). The assignment of negative meaning reflects individuals’ unique perception of the situation and encompasses their age, appraisal of overall health, personality, ego structure, temperament, and interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1054773811410601">Molassiotis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1054773811410601">Qureshi, 1996</xref>). Personal beliefs, a sense of commitment, and coping mechanisms affect an individual’s perception of distress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1054773811410601">
<title>Negative emotions</title>
<p>Negative emotions resulting from distress require cognitive and emotional appraisals of the situations and are a reflection of personal beliefs about self, world, and goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773811410601">Lazarus, 1999</xref>). Two individuals faced with the same situation may perceive the event differently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1054773811410601">Taylor and May (1996)</xref> found that in some individuals negative appraisal of a situation increases negative emotional arousal leading to feelings of vulnerability, distress, and anxiety. In contrast, others faced with the same situation may interpret it as a challenge, and respond with increased determination. For instance, an infant confronted with an unfamiliar situation may respond by crying, and a need for maternal contact. Another infant may perceive the situation as an opportunity to investigate something new.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1054773811410601">
<title>Absence of tissue trauma</title>
<p>The absence of actual tissue damage distinguishes the concept of distress from the phenomenon of acute physical pain. Tissue damage may induce pain and be accompanied by distress. In contrast, a distress is not always accompanied by physical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773811410601">Green, Gustafson, &amp; McGhie, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773811410601">Gustafson &amp; Harris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1054773811410601">Porter, Miller, &amp; Marshall, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 3: Model Case for Distress</title>
<p>The model case is a concept exemplar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811410601">Easter, 2000</xref>). Scenarios illuminate the components of the concept allowing it to be fully appreciated through descriptions of life experiences. It is important that all of the essential features are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson, 1963</xref>). A case exemplar is presented. Colleagues carefully examined the case to ensure its portrayal of distress.</p>
<p>Beth, a 6-month-old infant, is in the pediatrician’s office for her routine 6-month immunizations. She sits happily in her mother’s lap playing with her toes. As the nurse approaches, Beth gets very quiet, stares intently at the nurse, and begins to cry. She senses that something unpleasant is happening. As the nurse leans forward to talk to Beth, the volume and intensity of Beth’s crying increases. She struggles and turns away from the nurse.</p>
<p>Analysis: Beth’s experience is an ideal example of distress. The essential features in this case are that it is real and is happening in the present. Beth attaches negative meaning to the events. As this negative meaning becomes apparent, she displays a negative emotional response, crying and clinging to her mother. She is not experiencing a physical injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 4: Contrary Case</title>
<p>The construction of a contrary case is useful to illustrate what the concept is not. The following example constructs a contrary case for distress. John, an 8-month-old infant, is falling asleep in his mother’s arms. As he nuzzles deeper into his mother’s chest, his breathing slows and becomes rhythmic that his peaceful presence captures the essence of harmony.</p>
<p>Analysis: This case does not conceptualize the meaning of distress. Although the event is real and occurs in the present, it is not associated with negative meaning, negative emotion, or portrays a negative physical component. John feels emotionally safe and secure, and does not assign a negative meaning to being in his mother’s arms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 5: Related Case</title>
<p>A related case helps to depict concepts that are similar and connected to the concept of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson, 1963</xref>). The related cases identify differences from the model case.</p>
<p>Meg, a 12-month-old infant girl, participates in day care while her mother is at work. As her mother holds her and speaks with the day care assistant, Meg struggles to be placed on the floor so she may play with the toys. As Meg walks across the room in search of her favorite toy, she trips over another toy in her path. Falling she hits her head on the table. With her eye squeezed shut, her body snaps into a rigid position. Her intense crying can be heard throughout the house. Meg’s mother runs to her side, holds her, and tries to distract her with her favorite toy, but Meg is inconsolable.</p>
<p>Analysis: This case relates to the concept distress because it shares similar and connected attributes. Meg’s case has negative cognitive (she did not want to experience pain) and negative affective (pain in an unpleasant sensation) properties and her distress occurs in the present. However the physical component to this case reflects the phenomenon pain rather than distress. The specific responses to pain, eyes squeezed shut, rigid body posture, intense cry, and inconsolable represent valid and reliable indicators for infant pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1054773811410601">Soetenga, Frank, &amp; Pellino, 1999</xref>). In the model and related case both infants cry intensely. However, the absence of physical injury in the model case suggests the infant is in distress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 6: Borderline Case</title>
<p>A borderline case is an example that contains some but not all of the defining attributes of a model case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>Larry, a 10-month-old infant boy, is beginning to walk and enjoys exploring his environment. He often grabs small objects within his reach, and then throws them to the ground laughing in delight as they shatter into tiny pieces. After Larry breaks a small bowl, his mother reprimands him for his actions. Initially, Larry looks forlorn, but before his mother is finished talking to him his affect switches to delight. Larry moves away as if nothing has occurred.</p>
<p>Analysis: This case has all the attributes of the model case; however, it is considered borderline because Larry’s perception of the situation is positive. Larry’s case is real, and occurs in the present. In the beginning, Larry perceives the scolding by his mother as a negative stimulus, but he turns the negativity of the situation into a positive event by treating it as a game.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 7: Invented Case</title>
<p>Invented cases come from outside one’s experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1054773811410601">Walker &amp; Avant, 1995</xref>) and provide other opportunities to clarify a concept. An illustration of Tarzan of the Apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773811410601">Burroughs, 2006</xref>) is used to reflect on the notion of distress.</p>
<p>In 1888, Lord and Lady Clayton sail from England to fill a military post in British West Africa and perish at the edge of a primeval forest. Tarzan, their infant son, is the lone survivor. Alone and vulnerable in the jungle, baby Tarzan begins to cry. Gorillas come across the crying infant and nurture him as their own.</p>
<p>Analysis: This is an excellent example of the concept viewed outside one’s personal experience. The infant Tarzan is alone with no human to care for him. He is obviously distressed, which naturally is expected, and this distress occurs in the present. Tarzan perceives negative meaning to being alone in the forest and longs for human contact. Without his sense of having mother and father present, he shows signs of distress. Although distraught that his parents are absent and he is alone in the forest, baby Tarzan is not physical hurt.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 8: Social Context</title>
<p>The social context of distress determines its meaning and is derived from a perceived view; the perception of the experience and incorporation of ideals that are subjective, intuitive, humanistic, and integrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1054773811410601">Meleis, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In a health care, distress may be associated with alterations in physiology resulting from pain, stress, suffering, or anguish. Economic distress is regarded as an inability to fulfill financial obligations. Inappropriate responses to social and cultural traditions may elicit social distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1054773811410601">Smith, 1983</xref>). In these examples, the essential features of distress remain the same, the foci are different.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 9: Underlying Anxiety</title>
<p>In health care, the underlying anxiety surrounding distress is the need to alleviate stressors and restore the patient’s health. The long-term effects on neurological function and behavior resulting from severe distress in early life underscore the critical importance of identifying infant behavioral responses to distress in the early stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773811410601">Anand, Coskun, Thrivikraman, Nemeroff, &amp; Plotsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773811410601">Anand &amp; Scalzo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773811410601">Grunau, 2002</xref>). Restoration of health is achieved through a multidisciplinary approach involving therapeutic, preventive, public health, and social interventions that examine an individual’s potential to adapt to distressful stimuli.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 10: Practical Results</title>
<p>A clear understanding of the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of distress are essential to the delivery of appropriate care. Distress is conceptualized by the relationships between the antecedents, consequences, and maladaptations that result from the inability to adapt to endogenous or exogenous stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1054773811410601">Figure 3</xref>).Threat and the inability to cope with the stressors are identified as antecedents, while acute pain, stress, anxiety, and maladaptations are the consequences. Exploration of the attributes set forth in this analysis may assist in distinguishing the concept distress from the related phenomenon infant pain and facilitate the evaluation of instruments utilized for assessment and measurement of pain in infants.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section22-1054773811410601">
<title>Step 11: Results in Language</title>
<p>Words have subjective and ambiguous meanings. While it is not always possible to be decisive about the exclusive or best meaning of a word, it is sensible to adopt one meaning that will “use the word to its fullest advantage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1054773811410601">Wilson, 1963</xref>, p. 37). The conceptual definition proposed for infant distress incorporates four essential features of the concept; reality, orientation in present, negative emotion, negative meaning, and absence of known tissue injury. Infant distress is operationally defined as the maladaptation to endogenous or exogenous stressors. Four elements of this distress include (a) the event is experienced in the present; (b) the infant’s cognitive perception of the event is negative; (c) the infant is in an adverse emotional state; and, (d) there is an absence of known tissue damage to account for pain. The definition is satisfactorily fulfilled when all four elements are present.</p>
<p>Infant distress can be positioned anywhere along a continuum of infant behavior ranging from no distress to extreme distress. Caregivers can distinguish mild to moderate infant distress from severe infant distress by observing the variability of infant behavior along five broad categories: cry intensity and duration, facial expression, consolability, body movement/posturing, and sleep patterns. For example, infants experiencing mild distress may whimper or cry gently, frown, or occasionally grimace. They may be easy to console with holding, position change, or nonnutritive sucking, may be fidgety and restless. Infants in severe distress have a consistent cry that increases in volume and duration, and their facial expressions exhibit marked distress. Signs include eyebrow bulge, eyes squeezed shut, an open mouth, taut tongue, and deepening of the nasolabial furrow. Infants in severe distress are inconsolable. Sucking patterns both nutritive and nonnutritive are inconsistent and may be nonexistent as infants resist attempts to feed or be consoled with a pacifier. They may not tolerate touch or positioning, and often display disorganized body movements such as thrashing, flailing, or strong voluntary immobility with pronounced flexion/hypertonicity indicative of incessant agitation. Infant distress is also associated with sleep disturbances and interruptions manifested by erratic and sudden jerky movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1054773811410601">Soetenga et al., 1999</xref>). Understanding the contextual aspects of infant distress influences decisions for the types of interventions used to reduce or manage it. Moreover, empirical outcomes measured by observational scales or assessment criteria gauges improvements or worsening of distress indicators.</p>

<sec id="section23-1054773811410601">
<title>Application of Distress in Pediatric Pain Management</title>
<p>The assessment of pain and distress in adults is a consequence of their complaints of discomfort; such a system is not operative for infants who are unable to provide subjective reports. The suboptimal management of acute pain in infants is due in part to the uncertainty surrounding the conceptual and operational definition of distress. This lack of understanding and its absence from a universal valid and reliable instrument for measuring pain in infants has been a significant deterrent to providing pain relief for infants. More seriously, failure to treat pain and distress in infants can potentially result in undesirable long-term effects for infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1054773811410601">Walco, 2008</xref>). Painful procedures without adequate analgesia inflict unnecessarily pain and suffering. Repeated exposures to painful procedures at an early age are thought to be “remembered,” and for newborns sensitization to pain can persist into children and possibly over a lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773811410601">Anand &amp; Scalzo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1054773811410601">von Baeyer, Marche, Rocha, &amp; Salmon, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The foundation of effective pain management in infants lies in the accuracy of the instruments utilized to assess and measure pain. Explicit in the accuracy of these instruments is a measurement of the variability of specific and nonspecific behavioral responses that occur during infant pain. Recognition of the diversity of newborn behavior during pain must be comprehensively and contextually present within the scales because infant pain assessment and treatment is contingent on correctly identifying newborn behavioral distress responses specific to pain. Observations that nonspecific pain responses are concurrent with specific pain responses add to our knowledge of newborn pain rather than confounding our understanding.</p>
<p>Limitations of this concept analysis include the inability to generalize findings to other populations due to sample criteria and methodological issues existing within available literature. Overt or objective signs of distress in infants are significantly different from adults, and the inability to communicate verbally prevents confirmation of its presence. Detection and measurement of infant distress is also complicated by the lack of universal criteria, which thus far have included physiological parameters measured in hospital settings and behaviors observed when infants are exposed to distressful or painful procedures. A literature review of infant pain and distress suggests that infant cry is the most common nondiscursive indicator of observed distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1054773811410601">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>). Failure to differentiate infant distress from other newborn phenomena may result in the inaccurate assessment and management of distress.</p>

<title>Implications for Nursing Practice and Research</title>
<p>A concept analysis has theoretical implications for providing structure and meaning to terms within a conceptual framework that have relevance for nursing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1054773811410601">Paley, 1996</xref>). Concept analyses can not only advance research but also ultimately lead to expert consensus around evidence-based guidelines for distress reduction. More importantly, inductive thinking about conceptual and operational definitions for infant distress contributes to the expansion of middle range theory to guide nurses’ understanding of behavioral responses in infants and theoretically derived practice-based approaches to promote positive physiological and emotional outcomes in this vulnerable population. This concept analysis may be valuable to researchers who wish to develop instruments to assess and measure infant distress and assist with the development of interventions to mitigate the long-term effects of undermanaged distress in this vulnerable population.</p>
