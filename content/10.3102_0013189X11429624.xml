<p>The 19 chapters of <italic>Childhood Programs and Practices in the First Decade of Life: A Human Capital Integration</italic> analyze the effectiveness of a wide variety of early childhood programs, from the prenatal and infancy period to early elementary education. The book’s contributors include many of the leading researchers on these programs, as is the case, for example, in the chapters on the Nurse–Family Partnership, the Abecedarian program, and the Perry Preschool program. The chapters are updated versions of papers presented at a December 2007 conference sponsored by the Human Capital Research Collaborative, a partnership between the University of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>This collection provides a valuable summary of what is known about the effectiveness of many early childhood programs, ranging from mother and infant nutrition programs to class size reduction in early elementary school. It is unique in the breadth and diversity of programs covered. In addition, some chapters include discussions of why and how particular types of early childhood programs work. As is inevitable in any edited volume, however, there are difficulties in comparing the estimated effects across the different programs analyzed by authors of diverse perspectives and disciplines. And there are inevitably some significant gaps in coverage of programs and topics.</p>
<p>The main text is divided into four parts. Preceding Part I is an introduction by the volume’s editors, Arthur J. Reynolds, Arthur J. Rolnick, Michelle M. Englund, and Judy A. Temple, who provide useful summaries of the remaining chapters, as well as some synthesis of results. The four chapters in Part I address prenatal and infancy programs. Part II has six chapters on preschool education programs. Part III has three chapters on early-school-age programs (one of these, about preschool quality, might have fit better in Part II). Part IV has five chapters providing economic benefit–cost and “paths of effects” analyses of early childhood programs. Finally, an appendix provides a fascinating summary of questions and answers from the conference discussion.</p>
<p>Programs analyzed in the book include the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the Nurse–Family Partnership; the Carolina Abecedarian Project; Early Head Start; Head Start; the Chicago Child–Parent Preschool Program; the state-funded universal preschool program in Tulsa, Oklahoma; the state-funded preschool program in Michigan; the Abbott preschool program in New Jersey; full-day kindergarten; and the Tennessee experiment reducing class size for kindergarten through third grade. The economic benefit–cost analyses in the book include studies on the fiscal benefits of both universal and targeted pre-K; the economic benefits of early childhood programs in increasing Black male high school graduation rates; and a new benefit–cost analysis of the Perry Preschool program by a team that includes Nobel-prize-winning economist James Heckman. The mechanisms by which early childhood programs have their effects are analyzed in three studies: One, by Andrew Mashburn and Robert Pianta, argues that teacher–child interaction is the key to preschool quality; the second, by a team including Heckman, argues for the importance of noncognitive skills. In the third, leading researchers on the Chicago Child Parent Center program, the Abecedarian program, and the Perry program try to determine the paths by which these programs have affected educational attainment at age 21.</p>

<title>Highlights</title>
<p>Selected highlights of the book include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0013189X11429624" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>High rates of return</italic>. The book establishes, through individual program and benefit–cost analyses, that many early childhood programs can have high benefit/cost ratios and high rates of return to investment. For example, chapter 15, by Robert Lynch, uses a simulation model to calculate that targeted pre-K programs may produce fiscal benefits exceeding costs within 8 years after program start-up, as successive cohorts graduate from the program and produce fiscal benefits such as lower special education assignment rates. Chapter 16, by Clive Belfield and Henry Levin, estimates large benefits from increasing Black male high school graduation through early childhood programs. The reanalysis of the Perry Preschool program in chapter 17, by Heckman and others, responds to some econometric criticisms of this experiment and reaffirms that the investment in the Perry program had a high social return, in the range of 7% to 10%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Budget trends for early childhood</italic>. The editors’ introduction provides a useful, quick summary of government investment in the United States in programs from birth to age 5. Total public investment in such programs was $33 billion in 2007–2008 and had doubled since the preceding decade. However, state budget crises since the book’s writing may have led to some retrenchment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X11429624">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X11429624">National Institute for Early Education Research, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Program length and rates of return</italic>. The book argues in the introduction, as well as elsewhere, that early childhood programs are more effective if they last longer. There is some good evidence that total benefits of early childhood programs go up when preschool is extended from age 4 to include ages 3 and 4, as is made clear in chapter 11 on New Jersey’s Abbott program, by Ellen Frede, W. Steven Barnett, Kwanghee Jung, Cynthia Esposito Lamy, and Alexandra Figueras. However, it is unclear what is typical for most programs with respect to rates of return as we extend program length. Are there diminishing returns?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Variations in parenting programs</italic>. In chapter 3, David Olds discusses the Nurse–Family Partnership program, a prenatal care and parenting program for disadvantaged first-time mothers, which Olds helped to develop. He briefly argues that the evidence suggests that NFP is more effective than many other parenting programs. Policy makers often are tempted to believe that a cheap parenting assistance program can solve the early childhood development puzzle. The book would have benefited from a chapter discussing in more depth why so many parenting assistance programs are ineffective.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lack of fade-out in Abecedarian program</italic>. In chapter 4, Frances Campbell and Craig Ramey describe the Carolina Abecedarian Project, which provided full-time child care and preschool from shortly after birth until age 5. What is unusual about the Abecedarian program is that its effects on cognitive achievement do not fade during the K–12 years, unlike those of many other early childhood programs. Is the lack of fade-out due to the high quality of the public schools in Chapel Hill or to the Abecedarian program’s being a longer term and earlier intervention?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Reconciling Head Start studies</italic>. In chapter 6, Gary Resnick discusses the recent findings of the first random-assignment experimental study of Head Start. This study found that the test score effects of Head Start largely fade out by first grade. A useful extension to the book would be a reconciliation of this finding with prior research that estimates the important long-term effects of Head Start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X11429624">Currie &amp; Thomas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X11429624">Deming, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X11429624">Ludwig &amp; Miller, 2007</xref>). Opinions differ on how to reconcile the two sets of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X11429624">Barnett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X11429624">Gibbs, Ludwig, &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Preschool’s unusual effectiveness</italic>. In chapter 8, Arthur Reynolds, Judy Temple, and Suh-Ruu Ou include a provocative figure that shows that benefit–cost ratios are higher for preschool programs at ages 3 and 4 than for either birth-to-age-3 interventions or interventions from ages 5 through 8. This important finding deserves more thorough discussion than was available in this book.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Preschool and the middle class. In chapter 9, William Gormley provides estimates that Tulsa’s near-universal pre-K program at age 4 leads to significant increases in kindergarten readiness for middle-class children, not just for the poor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Preschool and parent involvement</italic>. Successful preschool programs frequently include strong components of parent involvement. Two examples are the parent resource rooms in the Child Parent Center program discussed by Reynolds et al. in chapter 8 and the home visits in the Perry Preschool program discussed by Lawrence Schweinhart in chapter 7.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Early childhood and K–12</italic>. Success in many early childhood programs may be tied to reduced student mobility and strong ties to local public schools. For example, pre-K programs that are part of the public school system may pay better wages and offer better career paths for teachers, as mentioned by Gormley in chapter 9 and the appendix; by Reynolds et al. in chapter 8; and by Marijata Daniel-Echols, Elena Malofeeva, and Lawrence Schweinhart in chapter 10, on Michigan’s preschool program. As mentioned by Gormley in the appendix, pre-K programs in the public schools may ease transitions to kindergarten. In chapter 14, on the Tennessee class size reduction experiment, Jeremy Finn, Allison Suriani, and Charles Achilles suggest, on the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X11429624">Krueger and Whitmore’s (2001)</xref> work, that part of the cumulative impact of small class sizes was due to keeping students together in the same class grouping during the experiment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Full-day kindergarten</italic>. Going from half-day to full-day kindergarten, as discussed in chapter 13 by a project team from RAND, appears to have short-term but not long-term effects. How can this result be reconciled with the findings from early childhood programs indicating that more time in a program translates into larger effects?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Paths to program effectiveness</italic>. The Perry, Abecedarian, and Child Parent Center programs all are estimated to affect educational attainment at age 21. Chapter 19 presents an interesting synthesis by some of the lead researchers on these projects, including Arthur Reynolds, Michelle Englund, Suh-Ruu Ou, Lawrence Schweinhart, and Frances Campbell. The focus is on uncovering the paths of causal influence by which preschool participation leads to greater educational attainment at age 21. The findings suggest that preschool has its strongest effects on long-run educational attainment <italic>not</italic> by increasing cognitive skills in high school but by reducing special education assignments, retention in grade, and involvement in crime. These effects are, in turn, due to preschool’s effects in altering students’ motivation and social adjustment in early elementary school. The findings seem reconcilable with Heckman and Flavio Cunha’s econometric model in chapter 18, which finds an increase in the importance of soft-skills development over time, with even greater effects on adult earnings than on educational attainment.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What is this book missing? I have already indicated some areas where it could be usefully supplemented, for example, by more analysis of parenting programs or of how to reconcile the studies of Head Start. But the biggest gap is that the book does not provide a synthesis giving policy makers a clear menu of choices. What is the relative rate of return of each of these programs, measured consistently? What is a plausible full scale for each of these programs? What would be the national or per capita state costs of possible packages of early childhood programs, and what would be the benefits? Such a synthesis chapter would be quite difficult to write given differences in programs and in authors’ methodologies, but policy makers sorely need that type of analysis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the book provides a vast amount of information on early childhood programs and their benefits that will be extremely valuable to academics, practitioners, and policy makers. It will be useful both as a text in numerous education, policy, and economics classes and as a resource guide for many early childhood professionals at the state and local levels. In the field of early childhood policy, this book clearly is a preeminent reference and guide.</p>
