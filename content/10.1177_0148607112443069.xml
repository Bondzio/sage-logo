<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Copper levels are primarily regulated by biliary excretion. In cholestatic patients, there is a concern that the standard dose of copper in parenteral nutrition (PN) will result in excessive copper levels. This study looked retrospectively at cholestatic infants receiving PN with measured copper levels to ascertain if this is an actual clinical concern. <italic>Methods</italic>: All infants from the previous 10 years receiving PN who had a copper level checked and were cholestatic were reviewed. Children with metabolic or liver structural anomalies were excluded from the review. Of the 28 patients found, 26 had gastrointestinal disorders, and 82% of these infants were on the standard PN copper dose (20 µg/kg/d). <italic>Results</italic>: Only one elevated copper level was found in a child with congenital heart disease, but 13 low levels were found. A smaller number of follow-up copper levels demonstrated that despite cholestasis, some patients require copper supplementation above standard recommendations. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Cholestasis does not appear to impair copper excretion enough to result in elevated levels. In fact, infants with gastrointestinal disorders may require higher than standard dosing. Monitoring copper levels appears to be necessary to appropriately regulate copper dosing for cholestatic infants receiving PN.</p>

<p>Infants with a variety of disorders require the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) to meet their nutrition needs. One of the unfortunate consequences of long-term PN use in infants is the development of hepatic dysfunction known as PN-associated cholestasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112443069">1</xref></sup> The literature indicates that this occurs in 40%–60% of children on long-term PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112443069">2</xref></sup> PN-associated cholestasis regularly occur in infants after 6 weeks of continuous PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112443069">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no copper balance studies in infants or children. In 1988, the Subcommittee on Pediatric Parenteral Nutrient Requirements from the Committee on Clinical Practice Issues of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition published guidelines recommending copper intakes in infants and children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112443069">4</xref></sup> On the basis of the clinical reports available at the time, they suggested a standard infant dose of 20 µg/kg/d of copper in PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112443069">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A concern that arises with cholestasis due to PN is the possible elevation of the trace minerals normally excreted in the bile, copper and manganese. Copper that is given parenterally has 80% of its excretion in bile, with only 20% being excreted in the urine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112443069">5</xref></sup> In response to this knowledge, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition Subcommittee on Pediatric Parenteral Nutrient Requirements report had the following italicized cautionary note: “<italic>Considerable caution is required in administering intravenous Cu to patients with impaired biliary excretion including those with TPN cholestasis</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112443069">4</xref></sup> Based on such recommendations, copper began to be removed from PN in cholestatic patients. In 2004, Hurwitz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112443069">6</xref></sup> reported 4 infants who were cholestatic and had copper removed from their PN. All patients had gastrointestinal diseases and developed copper deficiency. The copper levels subsequently normalized when the copper was added back to the PN.</p>
<p>The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the copper levels measured in cholestatic infants receiving PN. We hypothesized that cholestatic infants receiving PN would demonstrate elevated copper levels.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Riley Hospital for Children has an extensive computerized record of laboratory data through the Regenstrief Institute. All patients younger than 1 year who had a serum copper level checked from April 1999 to April 2009 at Riley Hospital were identified. This very broad initial search was to ensure that no potential patients were missed. An initial query of the database indicated that there were 142 copper levels done in patients younger than a year.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria included any infant who had a copper level measured regardless of sex, ethnicity, or religious background who was receiving PN for more than half of their nutrition needs and had cholestasis. Any infant with a metabolic disorder leading to liver dysfunction, a structural liver anomaly, or neonatal hepatitis was excluded.</p>
<p>The protocol to query the Regenstreif database was reviewed and approved by the Indiana University institutional review board. Statistics were performed using SigmaStat 3.5 from Aspire Software (Ashburn, VA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112443069">
<title>Monitoring</title>
<p>Cholestasis was defined as direct bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL. The measurement of serum copper levels is a routine method to assess copper level. The records were reviewed to record if the infant was receiving complete or partial PN and the amount of copper in the PN. The duration that the patient received PN was also noted. The Riley hospital laboratory defined normal serum copper levels and those outside of the normal range. The normal range for copper levels was adjusted as appropriate for age postpartum. If a patient had more than 1 copper level obtained, the parameters were examined at each available time point. Because fluids can pick up copper, needles and glass containers free of copper contamination were used to measure serum levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112443069">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Population</title>
<p>Of the 142 levels done, 12 patients had biliary tract disorders, 18 had congenital liver disease, and 5 had neonatal hepatitis and were immediately excluded from analysis. The majority of the remaining patients had more than 1 copper level done through their hospital course. A total of 32 infants met the criteria for evaluation; 28 were found to be cholestatic. Of the 28 infants who received PN and were cholestatic, 13 had a second copper level and 6 a third copper level. The median gestational age was 32.0 weeks (mean [SEM] 31.3 [0.9] weeks) with a range of 23–40 weeks’ gestation. The birth weight median was 1.88 kg (mean [SEM] 1.83 [0.17] kg), with a range of 0.610–3.3 kg. The diagnoses listed were necrotizing enterocolitis/short bowel syndrome (n = 24), gastroschisis (n = 6), and congenital heart disease (n = 2). The initial serum copper level was obtained at a median of 102 days (mean [SEM] 116 [11] days) after PN was started and the follow-up levels (second and third combined) at a median of 56 days (mean [SEM] 54 [7] days) after the initial copper level.</p>

<sec id="section6-0148607112443069">
<title>First Copper Level</title>
<p>Of the 28 infants who were cholestatic, 82% were on the standard dosing in their PN, and 46% were found to have a low copper level. Three of these infants had copper omitted from their PN. There was only 1 elevated copper level in an infant with congenital heart disease who was cholestatic. The PN for this patient contained no added copper. There was no statistical correlation between the first copper level and the measured direct bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112443069">Figure 1</xref>; correlation 0.051, <italic>P</italic> = .80).</p>

<title>Second Copper Level</title>
<p>In the follow-up to the initial copper levels, 14 patients still received PN and were cholestatic. At the time of the second copper level, 50% of the patients received PN copper dosing higher than the recommended dosing, and 36% of the patients were on standard copper dosing. Two patients were on reduced doses of copper, 1 patient was on half the dose (10 µg/kg/d), and the other was on no copper. Both of these patients had initially been on standard dosing and had normal copper levels but had increasing cholestasis that resulted in the decision to decrease the copper in the PN. None of the patients had an elevated copper level, and 4 patients had low levels. Of the 4 patients with low levels, 2 were already on 150% (30 µg/kg/d) of the recommended dosing and 1 was on standard dosing. The other patient with a low copper level was on the half dose of copper in the PN. Once again, there was no correlation with the direct bilirubin level and measured copper levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112443069">Figure 2</xref>; correlation 0.045, <italic>P</italic> = .88).</p>

<title>Third Copper Level</title>
<p>Five cholestatic infants received PN long enough that they required a third copper level. Of these 5 infants, 60% were on standard or greater copper dosing in their PN. Two patients had persistent cholestasis that prompted the withholding of the copper; one of these demonstrated a low copper level. The remainder of the patients had a normal copper level.</p>

<p>To examine if there was any variance in copper handling by infants who had received PN over 6 months, we compared the copper levels and bilirubin levels with the levels separated between those obtained before and after 6 months. There was no difference in copper levels in those believed to have a more mature liver vs the earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0148607112443069">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first reported case of copper deficiency associated with PN was a 7.5-month-old on long-term PN who was not supplemented with copper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112443069">8</xref></sup> However, because copper is known to be primarily excreted in the bile, expert panels felt that caution was needed in the presence of cholestasis. Following the report warning statement from the Subcommittee on Pediatric Parenteral Nutrient Requirements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112443069">4</xref></sup> many nutrition providers began to hold the copper in PN when the patients became cholestatic.</p>
<p>In 2000, there was a report of an adult patient with short bowel syndrome who developed cholestasis while receiving PN and had the copper removed; this patient then developed pancytopenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112443069">9</xref></sup> Copper was added back to the PN and the pancytopenia resolved. The copper was then removed again because the patient was still cholestatic and the pancytopenia recurred. In 2004, Hurwitz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112443069">6</xref></sup> reported 4 infants who were cholestatic and had copper removed from their PN. All patients had gastrointestinal diseases and developed copper deficiency. The copper levels subsequently normalized when the copper was added back to the PN. In the discussion of this article, the authors suggested that maybe in the face of cholestasis, the appropriate amount of copper was half the usual dose (10 µg/kg/d) with close copper level monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112443069">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A prospective observational study of a broad age range of pediatric patients receiving PN found no correlation between cholestasis and copper levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112443069">10</xref></sup> In 1 retrospective study by Frem et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112443069">11</xref></sup> cholestatic infants younger than 1 year received at least 50% of their nutrition from PN and had a direct bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dL. The patients all received the standard 20 µg/kg/d copper in their PN and had no metabolic disorders. Only 2 of the 28 infants were found to have elevated copper levels with no correlation in the group with higher serum copper levels and liver disease progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112443069">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some controversy exists regarding the appropriate method to monitor copper levels. Multiple copper-dependent enzymes have been identified, but none has been shown to correlate directly with copper levels. Ceruloplasmin has been used in the past but is also recognized as an acute phase reactant. Serum copper levels have been derided as an imperfect measure since a study of adults on long-term PN found no correlation between liver biopsy analysis for copper and the serum levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112443069">12</xref></sup> Howard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112443069">13</xref></sup> reported that copper levels were elevated in the liver and kidney tissue of autopsy specimens from adult patients who had received PN for many years. However, the literature suggests that serum copper levels do correlate with copper status in malnourished infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112443069">14</xref></sup> A large study of healthy adults given increased copper intake found that the non-ceruloplasmin copper pool and the serum copper concentration were directly correlated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112443069">15</xref></sup> It is also important to note that an elevated liver copper level is not evidence of toxicity due to copper accumulation because many liver diseases result in increased levels.</p>
<p>Our retrospective review of copper levels in cholestatic infants agrees with the findings of the Frem et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112443069">11</xref></sup> publication. Despite cholestasis, only 1 patient had an elevated copper level. This patient was on copper-free PN and, we hypothesize, had liver hypoperfusion that resulted in the high copper levels. Most patients were on standard copper dosing in their PN. Although the numbers became smaller with time, several patients actually required increased copper dosing due to low serum levels, even though they were cholestatic. Because this was a retrospective review, it has some clear limitations. Many of the cholestatic infants were getting some enteral feedings, but these tended to be minimal because these were the sickest infants. However, this means they would have received less of the PN and the prescribed 20 µg/kg/d. Our numbers are limited, and there is no comparable control group because it is very rare to draw a copper level in infants outside of the patients in our cohort.</p>
<p>Most of our patients and the patients in the study by Frem et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112443069">11</xref></sup> had gastrointestinal disorders. Inflammatory disorders result in increased serum copper levels, but these infants were at a stable junction primarily postoperatively and past the events that led to their PN dependence. Were there increased losses from the gastrointestinal tract in these patients despite cholestasis? Perhaps despite minimal bile flow, was the amount of copper excreted increased? One could also speculate that in the presence of cholestasis, there could be a compensatory increase in renal excretion. In Wilson disease, there is increased urinary copper because renal tubular absorption is exceeded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112443069">16</xref></sup> Treatment of Wilson disease uses excretion of chelated copper via the kidney.</p>
<p>Cholestatic infants do not appear to require an automatic reduction of the copper in their PN. In fact, some infants appear to require increased copper supplementation despite being cholestatic. The best recommendation concerning copper dosing in cholestatic infants receiving PN based on our data would be to use standard dosing but perform regular monitoring of the copper level.</p>
