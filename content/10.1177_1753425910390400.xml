<abstract>
<p>The LPS-mediated lethality of NC/Nga mice, having fewer NKT cells, was examined by using <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine (<sc>d</sc>-GalN)-sensitization. The NC/Nga mice were not killed by a simultaneous administration of <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS whereas all C57BL/6 (B6) control mice were killed. The injection of <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS failed to elevate the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and caspase 3 in the liver tissues of NC/Nga mice. Further, the nitric oxide (NO) level of the <sc>d</sc>-GalN- and LPS-injected NC/Nga mice was much lower than those of the B6 mice. The expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was significantly reduced in the livers of NC/Nga mice. However, there was no significant difference in LPS-induced TNF-α production between B6 mice and NC/Nga mice. The NC/Nga mice had an impaired expression of IFN-γ protein and mRNA in response to <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS. The pretreatment with α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), which activates Vα14<sup>+</sup> NKT cells and induces the production of IFN-γ, rendered NC/Nga mice more susceptible to the LPS-mediated lethality. The livers of NC/Nga mice had fewer NKT cells compared to B6 mice. Taken together, it is suggested that the resistance of NC/Nga mice to the LPS-mediated lethality with <sc>d</sc>-GalN sensitization depended on the impaired IFN-γ production caused by fewer NKT cells and reduced NO production that followed.</p>

<p>NC/Nga mice have been used for animal models for human allergic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425910390400">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910390400">2</xref></sup> They spontaneously develop dermatitis associated with excessive IgE production under conventional conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425910390400">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425910390400">6</xref></sup> The dermatitis is caused by a loss of the Th1/Th2 balance and the overproduction of Th2-type cytokines and chemokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425910390400">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910390400">10</xref></sup> Moreover, the level of IFN-γ, the representative Th1 cytokine, in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B or LPS is much lower than that of normal mice because of the lack of Vβ8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and Vβ8<sup>+</sup> NKT-cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390400">11</xref></sup> Thus, a systemic deficiency in the Th1 response to microbial stimulation may lead to a Th2-dominant immune response and have an impaired crosstalk in the cytokine network. This causes abnormal immune conditions in NC/Nga mice.</p>
<p>Recently, we reported that NC/Nga mice have a resistance to TNF-α-mediated lethality with <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine (<sc>d</sc>-GalN) sensitization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910390400">12</xref></sup> The resistance of NC/Nga mice to the TNF-α-mediated lethality is considered to be mediated by the sustained NF-κB activation. The sustained NF-κB activation in NC/Nga mice might be dependent on the insufficient level of IFN-γ, at least partially, caused by the lack of Vβ8<sup>+</sup> NKT-cells. The LPS-mediated lethality with <sc>d</sc>-GalN-sensitization was mainly due to an excessive production of TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910390400">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910390400">16</xref></sup> The LPS-mediated lethality is strongly regulated by IFN-γ, which augments the production of TNF-α and NO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425910390400">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910390400">19</xref></sup> In the present study, we examined the resistance of <sc>d</sc>-GalN-sensitized NC/Nga mice to LPS-mediated lethality. Here, we report that the reduced NO production caused by the impaired IFN-γ production may be responsible for the low susceptibility of NC/Nga mice to LPS-mediated lethality.</p>

<p>Hepatic lymphocytes isolated from livers were stained with a 1:100 dilution of allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD3ε antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-pan-NK (DX5) antibody (eBioscience; San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4°C. To detect an intracellular cytokine, we referred to the manual of eBioscience and used their products. The isolated hepatic lymphocytes were cultured with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h and incubated in the concentration of monensin (2 µ<sc>m</sc>) for a further 2 h for the prevention of secretion of cytokines into the culture medium. The cells were harvested and stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD3 and FITC-conjugated anti-pan-NK antibody for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, fixed with the fixation buffer (eBioscience) and stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody (eBioscience) in the permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for 20 min at room temperature. The expression level was analyzed with a laser flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson; Palo Alto, CA, USA) by gating a lymphocyte fraction.

<p>NC/Nga mice and C57BL/6 mice (B6) were intraperitoneally injected with <sc>d</sc>-GalN (8 mg) and LPS (1 µg) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910390400">24</xref></sup> The administration of <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS did not kill any NC/Nga mice within 24 h, whereas it killed all of the B6 mice within 12 h.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1753425910390400"><title>No development of hepatic lesions in NC/Nga mice by the administration of <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS</title>
<p>Lipopolysaccharide-mediated lethality with <sc>d</sc>-GalN sensitization is due to acute hepatic failure characterized by massive hepatocyte apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910390400">13</xref></sup> Therefore, we studied the histological changes in the livers of the NC/Nga mice and of the B6 mice after the <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS injection. To compare the NC/Nga and B6 mice in LPS-induced hepatic damages, we determined the activities of ALT and caspase 3 in sera and liver extracts, respectively. Higher levels of ALT and caspase 3 activities were observed in the B6 mice compared to the NC/Nga mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390400">Figure 1</xref>A,B).

<sec id="sec20-1753425910390400"><title>No difference in LPS-induced NO production between peritoneal macrophages of NC/Nga and those of B6 mice</title>
<p>First, peritoneal macrophages of normal NC/Nga and B6 mice, which consisting of adherent cells, were stimulated by LPS (100 ng/ml) alone for 24 h. There was no significant difference in LPS-induced NO production between the peritoneal macrophages of the NC/Nga mice and those of the B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390400">Figure 3</xref>A). In addition, there was no significant difference in LPS-induced NO production between the liver macrophages of the NC/Nga and those of the B6 mice although the NO amount was much less than that in the peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Next, peritoneal macrophages were taken from NC/Nga and B6 mice injected with <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS 3 h before and cultured for the measurement of NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390400">Figure 3</xref>B). The peritoneal macrophages of the injected B6 mice produced the higher levels of NO. On the other hand, the peritoneal macrophages from the injected NC/Nga mice produced only a small amount of NO. It was suggested that <italic>in vivo</italic> injection with <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS did not enhance NO production in the peritoneal macrophages from the NC/Nga mice, unlike the B6 mice. Thus, peritoneal macrophages from untreated NC/Nga and B6 mice, which contained few non-adherent cells, were shown to have normal NO productivity in <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with LPS. However, peritoneal macrophages from NC/Nga mice receiving <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS <italic>in vivo</italic> produced much less NO than those from B6 mice receiving them, suggesting peritoneal macrophages from NC/Nga mice, unlike B6 mice, could not become susceptible for NO production in <italic>in vivo</italic> response to <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS. It might be related to the fact that NC/Nga mice produce a lower level of IFN-γ because of the lack of Vβ8<sup>+</sup> NKT cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390400">11</xref></sup>

<p>First, hepatic lymphocytes were prepared from livers of normal NC/Nga mice and B6 mice and stained with fluorescent antibodies to pan-NK and CD3ε. The frequencies of NKT cells expressing pan-NK and CD3 antigens in the livers of the NC/Nga mice and those of B6 mice were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425910390400">Figure 5</xref>A). Laser flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the presence of fewer NKT cells (0.9%) in the livers of the NC/Nga mice. Next, we examined whether NKT cells of the NC mice can produce IFN-γ in response to LPS like NKT cells of the B6 mice. The NKT cells of the NC/Nga and B6 mice were cultured with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 8 h. Laser flow cytometric analysis demonstrated similar intracellular IFN-γ expression in both groups of the NKT cells, suggesting that the IFN-γ-producing ability of NKT cells of the NC/Nga mice was the same as that of NKT cells of the B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425910390400">Figure 5</xref>B).

<p>NC/Nga mice have a smaller number of Vβ8<sup>+</sup> NKT cells and produce a lower level of IFN-γ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390400">11</xref></sup> In order for endogenous IFN-γ production in NC/Nga mice to be augmented, 1 µg of α-GalCer, which induces IFN-γ production via activation of NKT cells, was intravenously administered into both groups of NC/Nga and B6 mice. Interferon-γ was produced in the NC/Nga and B6 mice 8–72 h after the α-GalCer treatment, and the peak was at 24 h. Therefore, serum IFN-γ levels of the NC/Nga and B6 mice 24 h after the treatment were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753425910390400">Figure 6</xref>A).

The iNOS expression was also examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753425910390400">Figure 6</xref>B). The pretreatment with α-GalCer induced definite iNOS expression in the <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS-treated NC/Nga mice.

<sec id="sec24-1753425910390400" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrate that NC/Nga mice are resistant to the LPS-mediated lethality with <sc>d</sc>-GalN sensitization via the reduced NO production, and the reduction is caused by impaired IFN-γ production, which is, in turn, caused by fewer Vβ8<sup>+</sup> NKT cells. The LPS-mediated lethality with <sc>d</sc>-GalN sensitization is induced by a number of pro-inflammatory mediators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910390400">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910390400">16</xref></sup> Especially, TNF-α and NO are the main effector molecules in the lethality. The finding that there was no significant difference in TNF-α production between NC/Nga mice and B6 control mice suggests that the LPS resistance of NC/Nga mice is due to their impaired NO production. However, we have recently reported that NC/Nga mice are less sensitive to <sc>d</sc>-GalN and TNF-α-mediated lethality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910390400">12</xref></sup> Therefore, though there is no significant difference in serum TNF-α levels between NC/Nga and B6 mice, NC/Nga mice must be resistant to a toxic action of TNF-α. The LPS resistance of <sc>d</sc>-GalN-sensitized NC/Nga mice might be accounted for by the combination of reduced NO production and low TNF-α sensitivity.</p>
<p>Interferon-γ exhibits a priming effect on the LPS-mediated lethality and markedly augments the LPS sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425910390400">25</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425910390400">27</xref></sup> Both IFN receptor-knockout mice and STAT1-knockout mice are resistant to <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS-mediated lethality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425910390400">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425910390400">29</xref></sup> Therefore, it is suggested that IFN-γ plays a crucial role in the sensitization to the lethal reaction. Interestingly, NC/Nga mice have a lower level of IFN-γ production in response to <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS. The treatment with exogenous recombinant IFN-γ as well as the pretreatment with α-GalCer to enhance endogenous IFN-γ production renders NC/Nga mice more susceptible to the <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS-mediated lethality, suggesting a close relationship between the impaired IFN-γ production and the LPS resistance. Therefore, the impaired IFN-γ production in NC/Nga mice might correlate with reduced NO production.</p>
<p>There are several reports on the impaired IFN-γ production in NC/Nga mice. Habu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390400">11</xref></sup> reported that IFN-γ levels in the sera of NC/Nga mice injected with LPS was several fold lower than those of normal mice, and that the low IFN-γ response to LPS correlated with an impaired IL-18 production of macrophages. Further, they reported that NC/Nga mice have partial resistance to the generalized Shwartzman model induced by IL-12 and LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425910390400">30</xref></sup> The studies are consistent with our finding that NC/Nga mice have a low susceptibility against <sc>d</sc>-GalN/LPS-mediated lethality via the impaired IFN-γ production. Fujii et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425910390400">31</xref></sup> reported a new model of NKT cell-mediated hepatitis using α-GalCer and <sc>D</sc>-GalN. The hepatitis model seems to be caused by the hepatic toxicity of <sc>d</sc>-GalN to IFN-γ-sensitized mice. However, no hepatitis was induced in NC/Nga mice by using α-GalCer and <sc>d</sc>-GalN. This suggests that treatment with α-GalCer and <sc>D</sc>-GalN may not induce a sufficient amount of IFN-γ in NC/Nga mice for the development of the hepatitis. In addition, Matsumoto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390400">4</xref></sup> reported that the addition of exogenous IFN-γ to IL-4 and LPS completely abrogated IgE production by B cells of BALB/c mice, but was insufficient to suppress it by B cells of NC/Nga mice. These findings suggest that NC/Nga mice may have a lower response to IFN-γ than normal mice. However, the present study demonstrates that IFN-γ pretreatment renders NC/Nga mice more susceptible to LPS-mediated lethality, despite the low response of NC/Nga mice to IFN-γ.</p>
<p>How are NKT cells involved in the <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS-mediated lethality, known as an endotoxin shock model? Previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390400">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425910390400">30</xref></sup> reported the presence of fewer NKT cells in the peritoneal cavities and livers of NC/Nga mice as well as the present study. Interestingly, NOD mice, known as a non-obesity diabetes model, are also resistant to <sc>d</sc>-GalN/LPS-mediated lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910390400">24</xref></sup> and have functional defects in NKT cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425910390400">32</xref></sup> Therefore, NKT cells are very likely to be involved in the lethal action of LPS. Further, NKT cells might be involved in the development of sepsis and septic shock. Once again, the present study suggests that the decreased number of NKT cells is responsible for the resistance of NC/Nga mice to <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS-mediated lethality. In addition, there are a significant number of NK cells that can produce IFN-γ in NC/Nga mice. It is still unknown why NK cells do not produce sufficient IFN-γ for the induction of the <sc>d</sc>-GalN and LPS-mediated lethal reaction in NC/Nga mice.</p>

<p>NC/Nga mice have fewer Vβ8<sup>+</sup> NKT cells and produce a lower level of IFN-γ production in response to LPS. The impaired IFN-γ production fails to augment LPS-induced NO production. It might be of interest to study the importance of IFN-γ in clinical septic shock as well as experimental endotoxic shock.</p>
