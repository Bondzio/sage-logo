<abstract>
<p>The study investigated the impact of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) on coagulation and fibrinolytic activities and its effectiveness in the prevention of pelvic adhesion after myomectomy. Thirty-two infertile women underwent myomectomy followed by adhesion evaluation surgery with a second-look laparoscopy. Before myomectomy, 15 women were treated with triptorelin acetate for 3 months and 17 received no treatment. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), protein C (PC), plasminogen, α2-antiplasmin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the activity of coagulation factors V and VIII by coagulometric methods. Patients treated with GnRH-a showed significant decrease in PAI, TAFI, factors V, and VIII (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05) and increased PC (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05), but no significant change in plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin levels compared with control group. The incidence, extent, and severity of adhesions were significantly lower in GnRH-a-treated patients compared with control group (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05), suggesting a possible critical role of the GnRH-a therapy in preventing postoperative adhesion development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adhesion formation is a major cause of human illness, it occurs after most surgical procedures performed through standard laparotomy as well as laparoscopic approaches. In studies of patients with major gynecological surgery, adhesions occur in 60% to 90% of cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111428517">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111428517">2</xref>
</sup> Adhesion development leads to increased postoperative morbidity, including small-bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pains, and secondary infertility<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111428517">3</xref>

</sup> as well as longer operating times and increase in perioperative complications. However, clinical experience shows that quantity and quality of adhesions differ greatly between individual patients and cannot be predicted from surgical characteristics alone.</p>
<p>A complex network of mediators and responses including the fibrinolytic system is involved in the pathogenesis of postsurgical adhesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111428517">7</xref>
</sup> Under optimal conditions, peritoneal injuries lead to the formation of a fibrinous exudate and to the simultaneous activation of the coagulation cascade that lead to minor peritoneal adhesions reabsorbed in a few days through a normal tissue repair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111428517">8</xref>
</sup> Both fibrin deposition and resolution are required to restore the peritoneum to preoperative conditions. Vast evidence assumed that a posttraumatic insufficiency in peritoneal fibrinolytic activity permits the deposited fibrin to become organized into permanent adhesions. The central component of the fibrinolytic system is the plasminogen, a precursor enzyme which, following partial cleavage, is converted into plasmin that degrades fibrin. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of plasminogen activation. Its physiological function is inhibition of intravascular fibrinolysis. The principal cause of reduced fibrinolytic activity appears to be an increase in the concentration of PAI-1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111428517">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428517"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111428517">10</xref>
</sup> Several studies suggest that PAI-1 could be used as marker of the propensity to develop adhesions after surgery and may have potential for identification of high-risk patients. Fibrinolysis is also under the control of regulatory molecules such as α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP), and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which are potent inhibitors of fibrinolysis, and protein C (PC) that stimulates fibrinolysis by binding PAI and by inhibiting thrombin formation proteolytically inactivating factors Va (FVa) and VIIIa (FVIIIa). Less is known about their role in the adhesion formation after peritoneal injury.</p>
<p>Considerable effort has been made to develop antiadhesion treatments that are adjuvant to adhesiolysis or preventive in case of first pelvic surgery. Suggested strategies include prophylactic antibiotics, intraoperative irrigation, corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, uterine suspension, synthetic barrier agents, and minimally invasive surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111428517">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111428517">12</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, none of these therapies is ideal. Alternatively, it is assumed that treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a), widely used for the preoperative treatment of uterine leiomyomas, may prevent or moderate adhesion formation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428517">13</xref>
</sup> The accelerated fibrinolysis related to GnRH-a, mainly because of a decreased level of PAI, has been hypothesized to be a crucial biochemical event in preventing adhesion formation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111428517">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111428517">15</xref>
</sup> In contrast to this hypothesis, some authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111428517">16</xref>
</sup> have shown that preoperative treatment with leuprolide acetate did not decrease adhesion development after abdominal myomectomy.</p>
<p>Since limited and conflicting data are available in literature about the effect of GnRH-a on adhesion formation, we decided to perform a prospective study to better assess the impact of a GnRH-a therapy, triptorelin acetate, on the fibrinolytic and coagulation activities in 32 infertile women who underwent abdominal myomectomy, and the efficacy of preoperative therapy with GnRH-a in reducing the incidence, extent, and severity of adhesion development after myomectomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1933719111428517" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Our study included 35 women, aged from 24 to 37 years, with uterine leiomyomas, abnormal uterine bleeding, unexplained infertility, and repeated abortions referred to the Department of Obstetrical-Gynaecological and Urological Science and Reproductive Medicine of the Federico II University of Naples from April 2008 to January 2011. They were randomly divided into 2 groups. Sixteen patients (GnRH-a group) received GnRH-a treatment (triptorelin acetate depot 3.75 mg in monthly subcutaneous injection) for 3 months, starting within the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle. Nineteen patients (control group) did not receive any preoperative hormonal treatment. In both groups, abdominal myomectomy was performed, followed by a planned second-look laparoscopy (SLL) 4 months after the myomectomy, to assess the degree of adhesions and to perform adhesiolysis.</p>
<p>Each patient provided written informed consent before participating in the study. Women were excluded if they had hematologic or coagulation disorders, a history of endometriosis, ongoing pelvic infection, diabetes mellitus, or previous pelvic surgery. All women were in good physical health with no significant systemic condition and the cycles were ovulatory.</p>
<p>Patients included into the GnRH-a group underwent surgery within 4 weeks from the final injection. All patients desired uterine preservation. All surgical procedures were performed by the same team of surgeons and the surgical approach was similar for each patient. If possible, incisions were made on anterior uterine wall and the largest possible number of myomas was removed through the minimum number of incisions in order to minimize potential adhesion formation. After the enucleation of myoma/myomas, uterine defect/defects was closed with multilayered sutures of polyglactin (Vicryl 1-0). The serosa with Vicryl 4-0 was then approximated. Operative blood loss varied from 250 to 500 mL. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis and no other additional treatment was undertaken to reduce adhesion formation.</p>
<p>Levels of PAI, TAFI, PC, α2-AP, plasminogen, FV, and FVIII were measured in plasma at 10 time points in GnRH-a group (1 day before starting therapy; 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days after starting therapy; at the end of the surgical procedure; and 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days after myomectomy), and at 7 time points in control group (baseline; at the end of the surgical procedure; and 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days after myomectomy).</p>
<p>At each time point, 4.5 mL venous blood was sampled, anticoagulated with 0.5 mL 0.5mol/L citrate buffer, and stored on ice. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity was measured by a 2-step chromogenic synthetic substrate assay (Pefakit TAFI, Pentafarm Basel, Switzerland). Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor was first activated by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex followed by cleavage of a thio-derivated arginine substrate, which was monitored by color development after reaction with Ellman reagent. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 antigen was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercially available kit (Biopool, Umea, Sweden). Absorbance was measured by the micropolate reader at 405 nmol/L and, according to the Manufacturer's recommendations, normal values for PAI-1 were &lt;42 ng/mL. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation for PAI-1 were &lt;4.5%. Incubation of FV deficient with diluted patient plasma and thromboplastin leads to the activation of the factors of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Time was measured from the addition of the thromboplastin to the formation of a fibrin clot. A mixture of FVIII-deficient plasma and the patient’s plasma was tested in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay. The results were interpreted using a reference curve obtained with dilutions of standard human plasma with the deficient plasma. The destructive α2-AP was deactivated through oxidation with chloramines T. The plasminogen in the sample formed a complex with the streptokinase. The concentration of this complex was determined through a kinetic test by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nmol/L. The α2-AP in the sample deactivated the plasmin present. The residual plasmin content was determined through a kinetic test by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nmol/L. Total PAI, TAFI, plasminogen, α2-AP, FV, and FVIII activities were measured with Siemens healthcare (Germany) reagent in BCS XP system.</p>
<p>Protein C activity was evaluated by a chromogenic method using the kit from Dade-Behring, Milan, Italy. The plasmatic PC was activated by a specific snake venom activator. The resulting PC was assayed through a kinetic test by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nmol/L.</p>
<p>The same team of surgeons also performed the SLL; moreover, they were blinded to the randomization during both surgical procedures. Adhesions were scored using the American Fertility Society classification system for severity (<italic>filmy</italic> = 1 and <italic>dense</italic> = 4), extent (&lt;<italic>one third of organ involved</italic> = 1, <italic>one third to two thirds involvement</italic> = 2, &gt;<italic>two thirds involvement</italic> = 4), and organ involvement (abdominal wall, bowel, anterior and posterior cul-de-sac, and right and left adnexa) and they were analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the myoma and to the surgical technique used.</p>
<sec id="section3-1933719111428517">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was carried out using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Fisher’s exact test for analyzing differences between groups of patients. Level of statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-two patients completed the study without complications, while 3 patients (1 in GnRH-a group and 2 in control group) were excluded from the analysis because they had endometriosis at the time of the myomectomy procedure. No perioperative complications were encountered. Pathologic examination revealed benign myoma in all patients. Besides myoma/myomas, no other abnormality was found in any patient, including adhesions and endometriosis. Eleven (34.4%) patients had only subserous myomas (7 in GnRH-a group and 4 in control group) which were removed easily, while in the rest of the patients (65.6%) the largest myoma/myomas was located intramurally (8 in GnRH-a group and 13 in control group). The average myoma size was 4.6 cm in GnRH-a group and 4.3 cm in control group. The myomas were located on anterior or fundal uterine wall in the 66.7% of the cases in GnRH-a group and in the 52.9% of the cases in control group. The average of number of myomas removed was 4.4 in GnRH-a group and 4.7 in control group. The average number of uterine incisions was 3.2 in GnRH-a group and 2.9 in control group. Twenty-five patients (78.1%) had anterior or fundal uterine incision (13 in GnRH-a group and 12 in control group) and 13 patients (40.6%) had posterior uterine incision (5 in GnRH-a group and 8 in control group).</p>
<p>During SLL, adhesions occurred in 22 (68.7%) of 32 patients examined, including 7 (46.7%) in GnRH-a group and 15 (88.2%) in control group. The most common site was anterior abdominal wall (36.4% of all patients), followed by adnexa (31.8% of all patients), bowel and anterior and posterior cul-de-sac (22.7% and 9.1% of all patients, respectively). In GnRH-a group, 71.4% of adhesions were filmy and 28.6% showed a dense aspect; 57.1% of them involved less than one third and 42.9% occupied from one third to two thirds of the affected organs. In this group, we did not find any adhesion whose extension was more than two thirds of the affected organs. In the control group, filmy adhesions were only 20%, while most of them were dense (80%). In the 46.7% of the cases, adhesions involved more than two thirds of the affected organs. In the 40% of the cases, they extended from one third to two thirds, while only 13.3% of them occupied less than one third of affected organs. Patients treated with GnRH-a showed significant reduction in incidence, extent, and severity of adhesions compared to the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111428517">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>After 30 days of therapy with triptorelin acetate, the level of PAI activity showed a 9.4% decrease than the basal value. This difference was even more evident after 90 days of therapy, reaching a maximum reduction of 18.7%. An increased level of PAI activity, attributable to surgical manipulation of uterine and/or peritoneal tissues, was found immediately after surgery in both GnRH-a treated and control group. Thirty days after surgery the level of PAI activity was significantly lower in patients receiving triptorelin acetate depot compared with untreated patients (<italic>P</italic> = .004). In GnRH-a group, 90 days after surgery, PAI activity remained significantly lower in comparison with the control group (<italic>P</italic> = .019).</p>
<p>After 30 days of therapy, the level of TAFI activity decreased compared to basal value. After 3 months of therapy, TAFI activity continued to be suppressed, with a maximum reduction of 10%. In GnRH-a group, significant reduction was found 30 days after surgical procedures (<italic>P</italic> = .012) compared to control group. Ninety days after surgery, in GnRH-a group, the TAFI values remained lower in comparison to basal value and control group (<italic>P</italic> = .026).</p>
<p>In GnRH-a group, the mean level of PC activity was increased after 30 days of therapy compared to basal value. At 90 days of therapy, this increase was more evident. Protein C activity showed an increase of 16.2% after 3 months of therapy with respect to basal values. During surgery and in the 30 days following the surgical procedure, the level of PC activity was significantly higher than control group (<italic>P</italic> = .0001 and <italic>P</italic> = .006, respectively). Ninety days after surgery, in GnRH-a group, PC values returned to basal levels.</p>
<p>Levels of plasminogen and α2-AP activity were similar in both GnRH-a and control groups. No significant change was noted at each time for either GnRH-a treated or untreated group.</p>
<p>In patients receiving GnRH-a treatment, FV activity decreased, reaching a maximum reduction of 8% after 3 months of therapy.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Therapy with GnRH-a has been used effectively to suppress the pituitary–ovarian axis and to produce reversible hypoestrogenism in patients before myomectomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111428517">17</xref>
</sup> It significantly reduces both the uterine volume and fibroid size, intraoperative blood loss, pressure, pain, and symptoms produced by distortion of adjacent organs.<sup>

</sup> In addition to this well-known effects, several studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428517">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111428517"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111428517">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111428517">20</xref>
</sup> support the hypothesis that GnRH-a treatment is successful in preventing adhesion formation after myomectomy.</p>
<p>Experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that GnRH-a treatment induced reduction in adhesive disease through various mechanisms. Hypoestrogenic condition in rats was found to be associated with decreased adhesion formation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111428517">21</xref>
</sup> This could be related to the influence on estrogen-dependent growth factors and growth modulators by reliable and constant inhibition of ovarian estradiol biosynthesis and secretion, but also noncompetitive estrogen antagonism seems to play a role. Treatment with GnRH-a seems to reduce the growth hormone release stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111428517">22</xref>
</sup> Treatment with GnRH-a influences neoangiogenesis by modifying the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblastic growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111428517">23</xref>
</sup> Treatment with GnRH-a alters the vascular resistance index, pulsatility index, and vascular peak velocity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111428517">24</xref>
</sup> Avoidance of bleeding can reduce fibrin and therefore decreases the matrix for invasion by fibroblasts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111428517">18</xref>
</sup> Treatment with GnRH-a seems to reduce the degree of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111428517">25</xref>
</sup> The effectiveness of GnRH-a therapy also seems to be related to a relative increase in fibrinolytic capacity and reduction of the basal rate of coagulation processes. Imai and collegues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111428517">14</xref>
</sup> demonstrated a clear relationship between increased peritoneal fibrinolytic activity and attenuated adhesion formation. They showed that GnRH-a therapy induces shift to more fibrinolytic activity, mainly because of a decreased level of PAI in the peritoneal fluid, which might play a critical role in the mechanism of the GnRH-a on postoperative adhesion. Beyond studying PAI activity, we have also considered other parameters of the fibrinolytic and coagulation system that seem to be involved in the mechanism of GnRH-a-induced reduction of adhesion formation.</p>
<p>The present study showed that preoperative treatment for 3 months with GnRH-a reduced the plasmatic level of PAI. It is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) mainly produced by the endothelium and thought to play a crucial role in the inhibition of fibrinolysis. Increased plasma levels of PAI-1 are positively correlated with the risk of developing coronary artery disease and deep vein thrombosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111428517">26</xref>
</sup> Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is known to mediate inflammation and profibrotic changes essential for postsurgical tissue repair and wound healing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111428517">27</xref>
</sup> A study demonstrated that tissue levels of PAI-1 were increased in peritoneal samples from patients with severe adhesions compared to patients with less severe adhesions, therefore it was concluded that PAI-1 might be used as a tissue marker of the propensity to develop adhesions after surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111428517">28</xref>
</sup> Scott-Coombes et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111428517">29</xref>
</sup> reported that a marked increase in PAI in the peritoneal fluid could be identified in patients undergoing elective laparotomy. The present study showed that level of PAI, in infertile women treated with GnRH-a for 3 months before myomectomy, is very low at the moment of surgical insult and remains significantly lower during the 90 days of observation after surgery compared with control group. Plasminogen activator inhibitor would appear very sensible to the GnRH-a therapy. Winkler and collegues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111428517">30</xref>
</sup> have shown that women treated with GnRH-a for 6 months have reduced plasma levels of PAI, which might reduce fibrin generation and adhesion formation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found simultaneous changes in other parameters of fibrinolytic and coagulation system, such as TAFI, PC, FV, and FVIII activities. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor is a 58-kDa glycoprotein present in plasma as proenzyme, which is converted into its active form by thrombin–thrombomodulin complex. Recently, its role of inhibitor of fibrinolysis has been well documented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111428517">31</xref>
</sup> However, little is known regarding the role of TAFI on postoperative adhesion formation in patients treated with GnRH-a. We found that patients treated with GnRH-a showed decreased plasma levels of TAFI up to 90 days after surgery, suggesting a marked reduction in the rate of fibrin generation and degradation. This observation suggests that TAFI may also be an important causative factor of fibrinolysis impairment in these patients.</p>
<p>Protein C is a serine protease that suppresses coagulation activation by inhibiting FVa and FVIIIa and enhances plasmin generation by inhibiting PAI-1 activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111428517">32</xref>
</sup> It also exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the secretion of several cytokines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111428517">33</xref>
</sup> Its increased levels have been reported in patients with diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and nephrotic syndrome, following the use of anabolic steroids, oral contraceptives, and alcohol, and with increasing age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719111428517">34</xref>
</sup> In this study, we found that the level of PC, in patients treated with GnRH-a, increased during the 3 months of treatment, until returning to basal values 90 days after surgery compared with the control group.</p>
<p>We also studied the role of FV and FVIII on adhesive disease and after 3 months of therapy with GnRH-a we found a reduction in plasmatic levels of FV and FVIII. These findings indicate that with GnRH-a therapy the basal rate of coagulation processes is reduced. Leuprorelin acetate treatment has reported to reduce the procoagulant activity, that is thrombin generation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111428517">30</xref>
</sup> This suggests a beneficial effect of GnRH-a on the risk of thromboembolic disease.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have found no change in plasma levels of plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin. Plasminogen is a 92-kDa glycoprotein produced by the liver, and it is present in plasma and most extravascular fluids. Its deficiency is often seen in severe liver diseases and acute disseminated intravascular coagulation, or as a result of thrombolytic therapy with plasminogen activators.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111428517">35</xref>
</sup> Elevated levels have been reported in conjunction with pregnancy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111428517">36</xref>
</sup> hormonal contraceptives,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719111428517">37</xref>
</sup> obesity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719111428517">38</xref>
</sup> anabolic steroids,<sup>

</sup> hypothyroidism,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719111428517">40</xref>
</sup> and in liver or kidney transplant patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719111428517">41</xref>
</sup> In this study, no significant change in plasminogen activity was noted for either GnRH-a treated or control groups. α2-Antiplasmin is the fast SERPIN inhibitor of plasmin. It is a single-chain 70-kDa glycoprotein that leads to bleeding disorders if it is deficient and appears to limit the success of treatment of thrombosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719111428517">42</xref>
</sup> In this study, its levels were not significantly different between GnRH-a group and control group.</p>
<p>These preliminary findings showed that GnRH-a treatment has important effects on the plasmatic levels of the fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters. The simultaneous reduction in the levels of PAI, TAFI, FV, and FVIII associated with the increase in PC level and with the lack of modifications in plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin levels, may play an important role in the pathophysiologic balancing mechanism during adhesion formation.</p>
<p>In contrast to the classic concept that adhesion formation is related to a reduction in fibrinolysis, some authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719111428517">43</xref>
</sup> found an impressive increase in the fibrinolysis associated with the persistence of adhesions in long-term analysis of peritoneal fibrinolytic activity after surgical trauma. Others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719111428517">44</xref>
</sup> reported that the induction of PAI with GnRH-a therapy is enhanced markedly over time in rat model and adhesion formation is attenuated. Conflicting results about the role of the fibrinolytic system in adhesion formation may be due to the differences in models and/or methods used to study and measure fibrinolytic parameters. Other confounding factors may include in vivo steroidal regulation of components of the hemostatic system.</p>
<p>According to the results of our study, adhesion formation is very common after abdominal myomectomy. In this study, most of adhesions were found between the uterine incision and abdominal wall or adnexa. We found that accelerated fibrinolysis in GnRH-a group is associated with a smaller number of adhesions, also characterized by a low score, both for extent and severity, in contrast to control group that showed a greater frequency and worst aspect of the adhesions, as the Adhesion Score confirmed. The study also showed a relationship between GnRH-a therapy, myoma characteristics, and surgical technique. In particular, in patients treated with GnRH-a, a less degree of adhesions was observed in the anterior or fundal uterine incisions, myoma sizes smaller than 4 cm, subserous myomas, uterine incisions ≤ 3 and myomas removed ≤4. This may be due to the capacity of GnRH-a to increase the fibrinolytic activity and decrease the coagulation processes, to create a hypoestrogenic environment, to reduce the size of the myomas, and to decrease blood loss, making the surgery easier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no significant difference in adhesion score was observed between the 2 groups for the posterior uterine incisions, myoma size higher than 5 cm, 5 or more myoma removed, intramural myoma, and 4 or more uterine incisions. This may be potentially due to the increased manipulation of the surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Our findings differ from the results of Coddington et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111428517">16</xref>
</sup> They found that preoperative GnRH-a treatment did not decrease postoperative adhesion. They concluded that the adhesion area (cm<sup>2</sup>) increased only in relationship with the length of the uterine incisions, without considering other surgical and biochemical characteristics.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for the first time we studied the effects of GnRH-a treatment on coagulation and fibrinolytic activity through the evaluation of several plasmatic parameters. We found that GnRH-a therapy induced an increase in fibrinolytic activity, because of decrease in PAI, TAFI, FV, and FVIII levels and increase in PC level, with no change in plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin levels. Fibrinolytic activity was also studied in tissue specimens<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111428517">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111428517">28</xref>
</sup> and peritoneal fluid.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428517">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111428517">14</xref>
</sup> Though it was not measured in our study, the trend of the plasmatic biomarkers in GnRH-a group was associated to the lower adhesion development. To the best of our knowledge, further studies are needed in tissue specimens in an effort to better determine the pathophysiological effects of GnRH-a on pelvic adhesion formation.</p>
<p>In animal models, adhesion formation has been reduced by different fibrinolytic agents such as thrombokinase, fibrinolysin, and streptokinase.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719111428517">45</xref>
</sup> The use of PAI antagonists might also lead to the development of alternative forms of adhesion prophylaxis. Intervention on the TAFI, PC, FV, and FVIII functions might be an important future tool for additional therapeutic strategies in adhesion disease.</p>
