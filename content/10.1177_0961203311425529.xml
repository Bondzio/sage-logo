<abstract>
<p>We present the case of a 58-year-old woman with a long-standing history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with colonic perforation and subsequent purulent peritonitis whilst using combined immunosuppressive therapy. The pathogenesis and the clinical presentation of this unique case is discussed in detail. Opportunistic infection should always be kept in mind in SLE patients presenting with fever. Viral serology should be routinely performed in these patients, especially when immunosuppressive therapy is given, to avoid delay in instituting adequate management and therapy.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203311425529" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Opportunistic infection is a frequent and sometimes life-threatening complication in immunocompromised individuals, including those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, transplant patients and patients under immunosuppressive therapy due to autoimmune disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311425529">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425529">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In SLE environmental factors, such as viral and bacterial infections, may serve as a trigger for the development and/or exacerbation of the disease. In addition, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients share a substantial risk of developing infections, either caused by immunosuppressive therapy or due to genetic and immunologic defects inherent in the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425529">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425529">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Primary infection of healthy individuals with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is usually asymptomatic and results in the establishment of a lifelong subclinical infection of the host. Its seroprevalence may vary from 50 to 90%, mainly depending on thesocioeconomic status of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425529">5</xref></sup> Reactivation from latency may occur due to immunosuppressive therapy, leading to generalized infection with widespread organ-specific manifestations. Here we report the first case of a lupus patient who developed a CMV infection with colonic perforation and subsequent purulent peritonitis whilst using combined immunosuppressive therapy.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203311425529" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 58-year-old female patient first developed symptoms of SLE in 1993, starting with symmetrical polyarthritis of the wrists, the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. In 1999, she experienced a flare up of her disease with polyarthritis now additionally affecting the knees and the ankle joints, with Raynaud’s phenomenon and intermittent fever of greater than 38°C. A diagnosis of SLE was made after blood tests revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leucopenia of 2500 cells/µl. Fine speckled antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were found, and an infectious disease was excluded.</p>
<p>At that time, she was successfully treated with glucocorticoids and chloroquine. Her polyarthritis and fever subsided within weeks and her white blood cell count remained stable slightly below normal values. After six months, chloroquine therapy was stopped because of a newly developed exanthema; she remained on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and intermittent low dose glucocorticoid therapy. In 2009, she suffered from a retinal vasculitis, and in early 2010 anti-phospholipid antibodies were detected after she was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>In summer of 2010, she experienced a lupus flare with malaise and weight loss. Medication of azathioprine (50 mg per day) was initiated, given together with methylprednisolone (4 mg per day). In September, due to severe side effects, such as nausea and emesis, therapy with azathioprine was discontinued, and medication was changed to mycophenolate acid (720 mg twice a day). Unfortunately, under this medication the patient’s condition worsened and she developed intermittent fever up to 40°C in the evening. Subsequently, the dose of methylprednisolone was increased to 60 mg per day, but without improvement of her condition.</p>
<p>In November 2010, she was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain and reflex urinary retention. Emergency CT scan revealed free abdominal gas and perforation of the sigmoid colon. Immediate laparatomy with sigmoid resection, closure of the rectal stump and colostomy was performed, accompanied by on-table lavage due to incipient purulent peritonitis.</p>
<p>Grossly, the resection specimen showed colonic ulceration with free perforation. The peritoneal surface was dull and reddened. Histology disclosed transmural ulceration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311425529">Figure 1A</xref>). Scattered cells immunoreactive for CMV were identified within the mixed inflammatory infiltrate bordering the mucosal defect; these had not been suspected on routinely stained haematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311425529">Figure 1B</xref>). Laboratory analysis showed elevated CMV IgM (8.1 U/ml [normal &lt;0.85 U/ml]) and IgG (35 U/ml [normal &lt;6 U/l]) antibody levels, and positive CMV serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed generalized infection.

<p>Intravenous therapy with ganciclovir (5 mg/kg BW twice a day) was initiated and the patient’s general condition improved substantially. The postoperative course was complicated by severe abdominal wound healing disorder, but the patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day 45.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203311425529" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Opportunistic infections are infections caused by organisms that take advantage of a weakened immune system and cause disease when they ordinarily would cause mild symptoms or no disease in the immunocompetent host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425529">6</xref></sup> Acute viral infections in SLE patients are most commonly caused by CMV. According to Ramos-Casals et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311425529">7</xref></sup> the virus causes organ-specific infections in 65% and systemic infections in 4% of patients, respectively. In 18% of patients, acute CMV infection mimics a lupus flare, and in another 13% of patients CMV infection causes exacerbation of SLE.</p>
<p>In the gastrointestinal tract, CMV may cause single or multiple ulcerations which are typically well circumscribed showing a ‘punched out’ appearance. As in the presented case, the use of CMV immunohistochemistry may significantly increase the diagnostic yield of infection compared with routine H &amp; E staining and should be applied when clinically indicated. Symptoms include gastrointestinal bleeding or diarrhoea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311425529">8</xref></sup> Colonic perforation due to CMV infection, however, is exceedingly rare,and has so far almost exclusively been documented inAIDS and renal transplant patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311425529">1</xref></sup> In2004, Bang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425529">9</xref></sup> reported upon a 31-year-old female with ileal perforation due to CMV infection in underlying lupus enteritis. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first lupus patient to show CMV-induced colonic ulceration, free perforation and subsequent purulent peritonitis.</p>
<p>CMV may similarly affect the biliary tract or pancreas, leading to cholangitis or pancreatitis. Extra gastrointestinal manifestations include pneumonia, retinitis or meningoencephalitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311425529">8</xref></sup> Secondary CMV vasculitis has been described, possibly leading to ischemia and infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425529">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Immunosuppressive drugs represent the gold standard for the treatment of major organ involvement in SLE patients. However, the use of immunosuppressive therapy carries a significant risk for opportunistic infection. Cyclophosphamide, in particular in combination with high-dose glucocorticoids, has the strongest effect in suppressing the immune responses against microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311425529">11</xref></sup> In the systematic analysis of patients with inflammatory bowel disease by Toruner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425529">6</xref></sup> risk of opportunistic infection was notably increased when glucocorticoids were administered together with azathioprine: glucocorticoids alone odds ratio (OR) 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–4.9), azathioprine alone OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.5–7.5), and glucocorticoids in combinations with azathioprine OR 17.5 (95% CI 4.5–68), compared with patients without therapy, respectively. Hence, as illustrated in the presented case, every immunosuppressive therapy in combination with glucocorticoids significantly increases the risk for opportunistic infection.</p>
<p>As stated above, opportunistic infections may mimic a lupus flare or even promote specific organ involvement, such as gastrointestinal disorders (eg diarrhoea or bleeding) or pulmonary infiltrates, and differential diagnosis may be challenging. Ramos-Casals et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311425529">7</xref></sup> argue that acute viral infections are currently not adequately investigated in SLE patients presenting with fever and are only suspected after excluding other causes. This may lead to delays in instituting adequate management and early therapy. The authors recommend that viral serology (Epstein–Barr virus [EBV], CMV, herpes simplex and parvovirus B19) including molecular tests and cultures from body fluids should be included in the work-up of these patients, especially when immunosuppressive therapy is given. Finally, testing for bacterial pathogens should also be performed. In particular, tuberculosis has to be considered in the differential diagnosisof abdominal pain in immunocompromised patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we report the first case of CMV-induced colonic ulceration, free perforation and subsequent purulent peritonitis in a patient with SLE. Combined use of glucocorticoids and mycophenolate acid may have triggered this life-threatening opportunistic infection.</p></sec>
