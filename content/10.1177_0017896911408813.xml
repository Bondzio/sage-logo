<abstract>
<p>The evolving eHealth agenda presents a range of potential opportunities for the management and prevention of chronic disease. This paper identifies issues and barriers to the uptake of eHealth and describes a strategy (<italic>Healthy Outcomes for Australians</italic><sup>©</sup> – HOFA) for creating a central knowledge filter and cyber space method for tracking health determinants through an interactive, social media platform. Discussion will be directed towards presenting contemporary interactive cyber platforms that are aimed at harnessing social media (Web 2.0) technologies in preparation for delivering effective early 21st century health care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well established that most chronic diseases are associated with an inactive lifestyle, and encouraging exercise has been shown to be a powerful tool to effectively improve physical fitness and health-related quality of life. Diet and exercise together (along with smoking cessation) and promoting psychological well-being are acknowledged as the most important factors in reducing weight/body mass index (BMI) in the overweight, and maintaining desired weight/BMI for the prevention of chronic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911408813">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911408813">2</xref></sup>. Where these strategies can be linked with acceptance of greater personal consumer responsibility for healthy lifestyles, it is suggested that healthy behaviours can have a significant impact on the burden of chronic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911408813">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the results from numerous studies that verify the above statements, knowledge regarding the importance of lifestyle factors and attitudes to diet and exercise has been difficult to transform: geographic and socio-economic barriers to health care and advice are difficult to overcome; sustainable long-term change in health behaviours has been elusive; and community-wide change has not been possible. Therefore, barriers to engagement and sustainability need to be addressed and the inclusion of multiple disciplines within eHealth technology enablers and with patient-centred care is required as a key focus in effecting change.</p>
<p>eHealth delivery is one of a range of methods to be potentially responsive to the increasing burden of chronic disease in Australia. We propose that a new platform, called <italic>Healthy Outcomes for Australians</italic>©– HOFA, supports health behaviour change through increasing access for consumers (and practitioner/s) to real-time feedback of their health status and provides prompts and motivation to change unhealthy lifestyle habits through a variety of health enablers. This paper discusses some of the key factors in uptake of eHealth for chronic disease prevention and management, as well as the new platform that aims to address these issues.</p>

<sec id="section2-0017896911408813">
<title>Factors for consideration in supporting digital eHealth platforms</title>
<p>The potential for the use of Information and Computer Technology (ICT) to promote eHealth and give support in health care is considerable. However, despite this potential and interest, little research has been conducted in the use of eHealth for health promotion. Lintonen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911408813">3</xref></sup> conducted a review of research articles published in journals between 2003 and 2005 and found only a small number with content related to health promotion and ICT. In the years since this review was conducted, a considerable number of peer-reviewed papers have been published. Noted in the more recent literature is that one of the barriers to supporting eHealth platforms includes the lack of models to guide the design and evaluation of eHealth promotion applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911408813">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911408813">5</xref></sup>. There is a need for more research on the benefits of the use of ICT in eHealth promotion research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911408813">3</xref></sup>. This includes the identification of strategies to address barriers and allow for innovation and potential for new media to support health promotion principles, provide population level health surveillance, risk factor identification, prevention and early intervention.</p>
<p>Educating the health consumer in how to find, recommend, interpret and implement health Website information is an important step towards creating a more reliable and safer eHealth care environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911408813">6</xref></sup>. In qualitative research on participants’ perspectives on the quality, value and future potential of ICT for behaviour change and chronic disease management, Ahern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911408813">7</xref></sup> identified the need for greater coordination and integration focused on standardization, improved evaluation outcomes focused on the sensitivity, validity and reliability for eHealth quality and efficacy, the need to explore the potential eHealth cost-effectiveness, efficiency and clinical standing, and identifying the needs of underserved populations in relation to access and health and technology literacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911408813">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911408813"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911408813">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Emerging issues affecting the eHealth promotion field include the following: access, which impacts on health and technology literacy; the role of the consumer as part of the eHealth team; the quality and credibility of health Websites, including time, resource reliability, the quality of information, the credibility of information in relation to ‘trustworthiness’ and the overload of information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911408813">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911408813">12</xref></sup>; and the implication this has on policy and planning.</p>
<sec id="section3-0017896911408813">
<title>Access</title>
<p>The need for rapid access to information in supporting decision making for both health professionals and consumers cannot be disputed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911408813">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, the need for consistent, comprehensive and coordinated information is regarded as critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911408813">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911408813">13</xref></sup>, particularly in relation to access to information and management of systems. A number of barriers have been identified that require further investigation in supporting the adoption of eHealth promotion in practice and planning.</p>
<p>There is a perception that the use of modern forms of communication/information technologies has disadvantages in implementation and uptake and, in particular, that users of Web 2.0 technology need to possess special expertise when it comes to social media and content-sharing platforms. Although not all Australian households are accessing the World Wide Web, the Internet or computers, penetration of Internet usage in Australia is more than 80 per cent (compared to 74 per cent in North America, 19.4 per cent in Asia and 63.8 per cent in the European Union) with user growth in Australia between 2000 and 2009 at 158 per cent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911408813">14</xref></sup>. There is evidence to suggest that this is a result of: (1) socio-economic status; (2) education levels; (3) health literacy levels; (4) ethnicity and (5) attitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911408813">15</xref></sup>. These five factors may also be contributing to what many educators term the ‘digital divide’.</p>
<p>More so in America than Australia, the digital divide is creating a society where access to health information and education is becoming more and more difficult for those health consumers who fit into one or more of the categories linked to disadvantage in access to health care. It is important that Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 technologies address the above factors, or it would seem that health initiatives implemented throughout the early 21st century will only be affordable and accessible to those who are young, educated and are termed as part of the middle to upper class population of the western world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911408813">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To address such concerns, technologies are being developed that are easy to use, affordable and are suitable for all individuals, regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic status, disabilities, health literacy levels, language and ethnicity. Inclusions already operating in community health settings utilize Podcasts, Second Life, Wikis, Blogs and Web-programming tools that tailor responses depending on the users’ literacy and educational levels, disability, culture and age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911408813">16</xref></sup>. In addition, the interface between mobile telephone technologies and Web-based technologies is improving, such that the two appear to be converging, certainly becoming a preferred method to enhance connectivity, interactivity and utility of eHealth initiatives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896911408813">
<title>The consumer as part of the eHealth team</title>
<p>Ahern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911408813">7</xref></sup> highlight the potential for eHealth to enable the consumer to participate as an integrated member of the health care team, playing a more active role in disease management, enabling greater communication and empowering the consumer in the decision-making process. This approach represents a significant change from the traditional model of care. Health professionals, however, have identified barriers to adoption at the point of care associated with financial costs linked with systems, office workflow disruption and lack of reimbursement for interacting with consumers. Despite these barriers, eHealth potential was highly valued by health professionals in the study by Ahern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911408813">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Working together with health professionals in developing interactive technologies is important, particularly engaging practitioners early in the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911408813">17</xref></sup>. However, barriers to the adoption of technology, including the lack of computer training health professionals receive in their pre-registration education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911408813">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911408813">19</xref></sup>, lack of awareness of the emerging social network tools on the Internet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911408813">7</xref></sup> and access to information from the Internet, are seen as a source of frustration to health practitioners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911408813">20</xref></sup>. Fox and Jones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911408813">21</xref></sup> suggest that even though contemporary health professionals are showing openness to new approaches and a willingness to interact with Web 2.0 technology, there are many who avoid social media applications due to a lack of practical application models, a perception as to the vulnerability of social media accounts and issues of privacy.</p>

<title>Quality and credibility: implications for policy and planning</title>
<p>As the eHealth digital revolution provides a more active role for the consumer in decision making, challenges exist in adapting care, ensuring quality of information and ensuring evidence-informed knowledge for health service providers is promoted, maintained and safeguarded for the information consumer. Perceived drawbacks to usage, such as practitioner time constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911408813">22</xref></sup>, may well be overcome by timely and improved consumer access to reputable information. Fostering professional networking through learning communities, establishing best practice models of care to leverage the emerging technologies and supporting professional development and consumer education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911408813">23</xref></sup> are required to support health care organizational development for clinicians and consumers.</p>
<p>Challenges have been identified in relation to cyber outreach clinics, with the constant technological up-skilling of staff to support the project implementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911408813">11</xref></sup> and undoubtedly the computing infrastructure required. The former was linked to the capacity to remain flexible and adapt to the changing environment. To overcome the knowledge/skills barrier, organizations would need to have technological infrastructure to support such programs. Up-to-date infrastructure and skills are therefore inextricably linked, but costs for developing such linkages are decreasing, and access to and availability of wireless technologies is also improving. Collaborative partnerships and organizations that have these factors built across their programs and services would be well placed to support staff training and provide the flexibility to adapt to the changing environment. Establishing best practice models of care for leveraging emerging technologies to support healthy communities is critical to the development, testing and evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911408813">24</xref></sup> of eHealth-promoting Web interfaces.</p>
<p>Yee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911408813">25</xref></sup> argue that the current health care delivery model will not meet future demands and that the productivity and efficiency of future health care will only be sustainable if organizations leverage advances in technology. According to Ahern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911408813">7</xref></sup>, cohesive standardized approaches with more rigorous evaluation standards are required. In Australia currently there is no regulatory process for compliance and accreditation around health Websites. Legislation around privacy and confidentiality of electronic information lags well behind innovations in the field. There is a need for the development of industry standards and policy progression in developing guidelines and defining measures of quality, best practice compliance and credibility. Ruotsalainen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911408813">26</xref></sup> recognized the need to develop legislation to build a trusted environment for the use and access of information through ICT.</p>
<p>In Australia, the National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA) has been working closely with both government and non-government organizations involved in health services at a system level to address issues associated with standardization. The NEHTA has been working across agencies (also including suppliers, purchasers, implementers and standards development organizations) in the development of a national framework, and recognizes the central role of standardization in Australia’s eHealth agenda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911408813">27</xref></sup>. Much of this work has focused around the coordination and development of interoperability across agencies to support data exchange. The system-level interface is critical to Australia’s eHealth capability to support efficiencies in clinical care and public health benefit; however, it differs from the standardization of health Websites as trusted sources of information for both health professionals and consumers. These areas of focus for eHealth standards will be fundamental to social welfare. Furthermore, the development of accreditation for health Websites to meet industry standards will be fundamental to consumer and professional confidence for the industry.</p>
<p>Appropriate attention to the factors identified above is critical for the next wave of eHealth and new platforms would do well to take the above factors into account during the developmental phase. The following section outlines a practical application of the multidimensional future of eHealth platforms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0017896911408813">
<title>Healthy Outcomes for Australians<sup>©</sup> Website</title>
<p>HOFA<sup>©</sup> Website is a Web-based tool for educating and tracking health behaviour modifications in people at risk of, or with, chronic disease (including obesity, diabetes, lung, renal and heart disease and depression as a co-morbidity of chronic disease). It features interactive eHealth elements for diet, physical activity, psychological well-being and exercise components to address lifestyle factors related directly with chronic disease prevention and management. The HOFA<sup>©</sup> Website can be used by consumers to promote self-management of chronic disease, and by health practitioners to guide and track progress of consumers with chronic disease.</p>
<p>Explicitly, the aim of the HOFA<sup>©</sup> Website is to provide a social media platform that will heighten information sharing, community building and social networking for those individuals suffering from chronic diseases. Literature supports that such an approach to early 21st century health care delivery is necessary for addressing chronic illnesses. Traditional barriers to accessing and implementing health information are largely alleviated through the unique capabilities offered by such social media platforms. Social determinants that have traditionally prevented effective health care delivery and management (such as socio-demographic factors of location, age, gender, ethnic identity and culture) are relatively dispelled through modern technology platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911408813">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The attractions to such platforms, as a health-promoting innovation, are highlighted by examining previously disengaged pockets of health consumers, that is, males and Aboriginal women. Seeman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911408813">28</xref></sup> posits that ‘men are more attracted to social networking platforms than face-to-face support groups for depression’, whereas Aboriginal women isolated by geography and culture have been noted to use social networks as a medium for health knowledge, support and motivation within a virtual neighbourhood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911408813">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A key element of the HOFA<sup>©</sup> Website is its inter-disciplinarity, with collaborative input from specialists in key areas of disease prevention, such as physiotherapy, exercise science, nutrition, education, human services and psychology. The inter-disciplinarity extends to the technological platform to be used for the electronic-based health promotion delivery tool, with important insight and input by specialists in delivery of Web-based education and information technology.</p>
<p>The HOFA© Website is a response to the eHealth promotional needs of the community and addresses many of the issues identified in the literature to date. Understanding eHealth literacy is fundamental to supporting communities for seeking, finding, understanding and appraising health information from electronic sources, and then applying new knowledge to address, solve or support behaviour change to health problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911408813">30</xref></sup>. Developing strategies and programs that engage underserved communities who traditionally are difficult to reach populations will also be an important aspect of the eHealth promotion field. Creating cyber outreach online programs and services that are flexible and include elements with peer-based education components included have the capacity to increase access for hard-to-reach populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911408813">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Existing evidence highlights the critical unmet need for evidence-based decision support systems to manage public digital eHealth management systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911408813">12</xref></sup> and knowledge repositories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896911408813">31</xref></sup>. Sharing information, collaborating and interacting with technology have become integral parts of society with social networking resources such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and YouTube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896911408813">32</xref></sup>. Consumers have the capacity to generate and share knowledge with unparalleled levels of free will. The HOFA© Website is a technological knowledge management platform that will act as a knowledge filter. It will become a ‘go-to’ point for the accessing and sharing of knowledge, health information transactions, learning networks for relationship building, support and motivation, decision support systems and public participation repositories around chronic disease management. The HOFA© Website aims to be a clearing house for reputable information regarding the prevention and management of chronic disease through an interactive Web interface. The HOFA© Website will build on the latest evidence and support communities of practice through professional interaction in supporting clinical development and knowledge exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896911408813">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The HOFA© Website will also provide a secure framework through which: consumers can be connected remotely with their health care providers; consumers can enter health-related data and receive feedback on their personal data; and health care providers can link with each consumer’s provider, thus creating a new health service landscape. Ultimately, data collected remotely by the consumer will link wirelessly to practitioner technologies for a range of tracking and monitoring purposes. It is common consensus that the handheld gadgets and Web-connected devices that we interact with in our everyday environments will be termed ‘transparent technologies’ – interface tools that when in use become extensions of our own bodies. In order to ensure sustainability and to improve access and utility, it will be critical that technological platforms, such as the HOFA© Website, incorporate and integrate transparent technologies that are ubiquitous, relatively inexpensive and freely available.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>eHealth technologies have previously been identified as having a range of potential benefits. However, this paper has highlighted a number of factors (including access and the legislative and policy levers) that will have a significant bearing on the efficient and effective uptake of eHealth in a rapidly evolving consumer-centred society. Moreover, the HOFA© Website, as referred to throughout this paper, has presented a new platform that integrates the best features required for an effective and efficient method of eHealth delivery throughout the early 21st century. A recommendation for policy development and planning that supports a trusted environment for eHealth promotion will be a fundamental aspect for the future of health-promoting Websites and the eHealth industry. A further recommendation, from this theoretical paper, is for future research and cross-cultural empirical studies to be undertaken that will measure the effectiveness of the HOFA© Website and other similar interventional Web-based programs to deliver modern health care.</p>
