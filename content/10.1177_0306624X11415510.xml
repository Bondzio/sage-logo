<abstract>
<p>Successful reintegration of ex-prisoners into the community is multifaceted. The life conditions of 36 adult Australian ex-prisoners (20 male and 16 female) were examined via a questionnaire administered at 1 to 4 weeks post release, and a subset of 19 of the original respondents were interviewed again at 3 to 4 months post release. Interviews focused on intrapersonal conditions (physical and psychological health and substance use), subsistence conditions (housing, employment, and finance), and support conditions (social support, support services/program participation, and criminal justice support). The majority of ex-prisoners self-reported chronic physical and mental health problems as well as a history of substance use and/or current substance use. Although the housing conditions of ex-prisoners were largely favourable and constant, the employment and financial conditions of this group were generally unfavourable. Level of social support was variable. Theoretical implications and practical applications of the present investigation for reintegration theory are discussed.</p>

<p>Like many other Western countries, Australia has experienced significant increases in the prison population over the past decade. Between June 2000 and June 2010, there was a 37% increase in the total prison population in Australia from 21,714 to 29,700 prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11415510">Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2010</xref>). It is difficult to estimate the precise number of prisoners who are released annually because Australia does not have a unified federal prison system; however, investigators have placed the figure at more than 43,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11415510">Baldry, McDonnell, Maplestone, &amp; Peeters, 2003</xref>). Many of these individuals have difficulty adjusting to the multiple, complex, and varied challenges of reintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11415510">Graffam, Shinkfield, Lavelle, &amp; McPherson, 2004</xref>). In fact, ex-prisoners appear particularly vulnerable to rearrest within the first 6 months of their release, with nearly 30% of former prisoners in the United States arrested within this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11415510">Langan &amp; Levin, 2002</xref>). In Australia, more than one third (38.2%) of prisoners released in 2005-2006 returned to prison within 2 years, and 44% returned to corrective services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11415510">Steering Committee for the Review of Government Service Provision, 2009</xref>). Clearly, greater understanding of the life conditions of ex-prisoners is important in assisting these individuals to meet the challenge of reintegration, as is the provision of comprehensive and long-term support.</p>
<p>There is a considerable body of work on reintegration and reentry/resettlement that has examined the wide-ranging postrelease experiences of ex-prisoners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11415510">Bahr, Harris, Fisher, &amp; Armstrong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11415510">Graffam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11415510">Kinner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11415510">Visher, Yahner, &amp; La Vigne, 2010</xref>). Researchers have also begun to examine in more depth theoretical and criminal policy issues surrounding reentry/resettlement, including the potential effect on desistance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11415510">Burnett &amp; Maruna, 2004</xref>) and the relationship between governmental resettlement strategies and desistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11415510">Maguire &amp; Raynor, 2006</xref>). It is clear that to varying degrees, life conditions, including social support, employment, health, housing, drug use, and program participation can have a significant effect on the reintegration outcomes of this group. For example, a recent study that used a longitudinal framework to examine factors influencing successful completion of parole over a 3-year period found that participation in an in-prison substance-abuse class, greater time spent with friends in enjoyable activities on release, and among the employed, working 40 or more hours a week, were all associated with parole success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11415510">Bahr et al., 2010</xref>). Although we have a general understanding of the difficulties typically encountered during the process of community reintegration, there is rather limited empirical information about the postrelease adjustment of ex-prisoners over an extended period. The present study begins to fill this gap by examining the life conditions of ex-prisoners using a diachronic framework.</p>
<p>Successful reintegration into the community is complex and multifaceted, and typically, ex-prisoners experience comprehensive challenges to reintegration. The conditions that affect an ex-prisoner’s success in reintegration may be conceptualised as falling within three broad ecological domains: intrapersonal conditions (including physical and psychological health and substance use), subsistence conditions (including finance, employment, and housing), and support conditions (including social support, support services, and criminal justice support; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield &amp; Graffam, 2009</xref>). Adopting an ecological model of reintegration allows system-wide effects to be analysed separately and in combination to gain a more complete perspective on the type and level of challenges that ex-prisoners face in community reintegration. Understanding how these variables relating to life conditions interact and change over time is of relevance for researchers, prison staff, service professionals, criminal justice support providers, and ex-prisoners themselves.</p>
<p>With respect to intrapersonal conditions, extant research shows consistently high prevalence rates of conditions of physical ill health among prisoner samples compared with the general population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11415510">National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11415510">National Commission on Correctional Health Care, 2002</xref>). A high proportion of the prison population also experiences mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11415510">Butler, Allnutt, Cain, Owens, &amp; Muller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11415510">Butler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11415510">Tye &amp; Mullen, 2006</xref>), with estimates of the incidence of mental illness among prisoners at least twice that of the general population of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11415510">Fazel &amp; Danesh, 2002</xref>), Britain, and Australia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11415510">Butler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11415510">Fazel &amp; Danesh, 2002</xref>). Moreover, the prisoner and ex-prisoner population is characterised by high levels of drug and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11415510">Budd, Collier, Mhlanga, Sharp, &amp; Weir, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11415510">Butler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11415510">Butler, Levy, Dolan, &amp; Kaldor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11415510">Schulte, Mouzos, &amp; Makkai, 2005</xref>). In fact, substance use has been described as the most prominent condition of ill health among prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11415510">Solomon, Waul, Van Ness, &amp; Travis, 2004</xref>), with usage directly linked to criminal activity and reincarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11415510">Mumola &amp; Karberg, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We conceive substance use as an intrapersonal condition that is dynamic in nature with the extent of substance use likely impacting on postrelease outcomes of ex-prisoners. However, it is important to point out that substance use is largely a matter of choice and personal agency. Moreover, excessive misuse typically has a debilitating effect on practical and personal outcomes such as employment and mental health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11415510">Hickie, Koschera, Davenport, Naismith, &amp; Scott, 2001</xref>). Although there is limited research on how these intrapersonal conditions may influence the process of reintegration, it is likely that these variables, alone and in combination, can have a profound effect on reintegration.</p>
<p>In addition to intrapersonal conditions, there are numerous conditions that relate to subsistence. Limited finance creates a condition of disadvantage for ex-prisoners that may contribute to their marginality within the community. Ex-prisoners typically have limited finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11415510">Visher et al., 2010</xref>) as well as debt, which exceeds their monthly income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11415510">Visher, La Vigne, &amp; Travis, 2004</xref>). There are also several identified barriers to employment for ex-prisoners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11415510">Graffam, Shinkfield, &amp; Hardcastle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11415510">Graffam, Shinkfield, Mihailides, &amp; Lavelle, 2005</xref>). Given that ex-prisoners in general have poor work histories and are typically employed in low-wage jobs with few tangible rewards, it should not be surprising that many ex-prisoners return to a criminal lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11415510">Solomon, Johnson, Travis, &amp; McBride, 2004</xref>). Moreover, ex-prisoners generally experience difficulty in finding and maintaining stable accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11415510">Melbourne Criminology Research and Evaluation Unit, 2003</xref>), with problematic drug use and reincarceration being a common outcome of unstable and unsafe accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11415510">Baldry et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous support variables also play a role in the reintegration of ex-prisoners, most particularly those related to social support. Although research is limited on this topic, it is clear that family support and other positive, supportive relationships are critical to positive postrelease outcomes for this group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11415510">La Vigne, Visher, &amp; Castro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11415510">Maidment, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11415510">Mallik-Kane &amp; Visher, 2008</xref>). Ex-prisoners typically have a limited social network, which consists, in many cases, of friends who have been in prison or who have participated in criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11415510">La Vigne et al., 2004</xref>). To assist postrelease outcomes, there is a wide range of postrelease support services designed to meet the multiple and varied needs of prisoners and ex-prisoners, many of which have been effective in improving reintegration outcomes of ex-prisoners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield, 2006</xref>). In terms of criminal justice support, monitoring and assistance are provided to parolees to improve their postrelease prospects, whereas those prisoners on nonparoled, “straight” release have no criminal justice requirement and rarely receive further assistance. The extent of these different forms of support may impact significantly on postrelease outcomes for ex-prisoners, in some cases improving reintegration outcomes and in other cases, reducing the likelihood of success.</p>
<p>Although the focus of this article is on the life conditions of ex-prisoners, it is clear that there are other factors that may impact on reintegration outcomes for this group. Factors internal to the individual that have not been addressed in this article but which may play a significant role in reintegration success include cognitive (attitudes, beliefs, cognitive style/strategies, and motivation to succeed), emotional, behavioural (skills, competencies, and accountability), and volitional factors (e.g., goals and desires). All of these factors may impact to varying degrees on how actively engaged the participant is in the reintegration process and the outcomes that they achieve in reintegration. Of course, a supportive environment that fosters positive change is also important. Several companion articles have addressed the emotional aspect of reintegration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11415510">Graffam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield &amp; Graffam, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11415510">2010</xref>), but there is a need for additional examination of the role of cognitive, behavioural, actions, efforts, and other agency variables in reintegration.</p>
<p>The aim of the present investigation was to examine life conditions of ex-prisoners over a period of postrelease reintegration. Participants completed a questionnaire focusing on the main variables related to their return to the community. The questionnaire was administered to participants at 1 to 4 weeks post release, and a subset of the original respondents was interviewed again at 3 to 4 months following prison release. As the study was largely exploratory, there were no specific hypotheses, although it was generally expected that the life conditions of ex-prisoners would be unfavourable over the weeks and months following prison release. Of interest, therefore, were patterns of change in the life conditions of ex-prisoners over an extended period of reintegration.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0306624X11415510">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample comprised 36 adult ex-prisoners (20 males and 16 females) who were part of a larger study on community reintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield, 2006</xref>). Ages ranged from 20 to 61 years (<italic>M</italic> = 36.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.59), with about half (56%) males. The majority of the participants (72%) had not completed high school. The average highest level of education of those who had not completed high school was Year 9 (<italic>M</italic> = 9.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.57). A total of 32 participants were Australian and single participants self-reported that they originated from Vietnam, Afghanistan, Scotland, and South Africa. More than half of participants were married or in a de facto relationship (58.3%). Of those participants interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks post release, 19 were interviewed again at 3 to 4 months post release, a retention rate of 53%. Sample attrition was a problem in the present study in part due to the transient nature of the sample. The potential effect of sample attrition is elaborated in the discussion.</p>
<p>An exploratory analysis was conducted to determine whether there were any differences between the participants who had dropped out at 3 to 4 months post release (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and those who were retained at 3 to 4 months post release (<italic>n</italic> = 19). A number of key differences did emerge between groups; for example, a greater proportion of participants who had dropped out compared with those participants who were reinterviewed were male (53% vs. 47%), employed (35% vs. 25%), had children (82% vs. 68%), and were not in an ongoing relationship (53% vs. 42%). There were no meaningful differences with respect to other variables, including age, highest education level attained, country of birth, drug-use since release, and several variables related to reoffence/rearrest and reporting requirements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306624X11415510">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>A 58-item postrelease questionnaire was developed for the study that focused on the respondent’s present situation in the community, including general health, substance use, current housing conditions, employment conditions, financial conditions, contact with family and friends, participation in postrelease programs, and supervision and reporting. At 1 to 4 weeks post release, the items were worded in reference to the experiences of ex-prisoners since prison release, whereas at 3 to 4 months post release, the items were worded in reference to their experiences over the prior month. Response format included open-ended questions, yes or no responses, semistructured questions, and 7-point rating scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306624X11415510">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Identification of prospective participants and provision of background information on those who volunteered to participate was managed through collaboration with the Department of Corrections. Within a prison context, invitations to participate in a long-term study encompassing a prerelease and postrelease component were made by Department of Correction location personnel. A project officer from a prisoner support agency identified prospective participants who were approaching prison release (within 4 weeks of the anticipated release date) and who met the eligibility requirements for inclusion in the investigation by either (a) liaising with Department of Corrections to obtain an up-to-date list of potential participants, (b) liaising with a contact person from the relevant prison, and/or (c) posting a notice about the project in the prison and asking for volunteers. The eligibility requirements were that the individual had English as their primary language, had at least 8 years of formal education, and was within 4 weeks of prison release. This study reports on the postrelease phase of the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, we were denied access to information from the Department of Corrections relating to the criminal background of the participants, including that concerning any reoffences over the period of investigation.</p>
<p>All participants read a plain language statement and completed the consent form if they volunteered to participate. Participants were contacted by telephone or mail (if no contact number was provided) to arrange a postrelease interview. Questionnaires were completed as a structured interview, whereby the interviewer read the questionnaire to the participant and recorded the response. All but two interviews were conducted by telephone as a result of participant preference. All participants were living in the community when they were reinterviewed. The interviews took approximately 45 min to complete. The questionnaire was administered to participants at 1 to 4 weeks postrelease (<italic>M</italic> = 22 days, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.0 days) and a subset of the original respondents was reinterviewed at 3 to 4 months (<italic>M</italic> = 100 days, <italic>SD</italic> = 26.4 days) following their release from prison. Participants were paid AUD12.00 for completing each postrelease interview as compensation for their time and effort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306624X11415510">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To examine patterns of change over time, percentage distributions for items relating to physical and psychological health conditions, substance use, housing, employment, finance, social support, support services, and criminal justice support were produced for participants interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks and 3 to 4 months postrelease. Chi-square analyses were not undertaken due to low cell numbers; rather patterns of change over time are described.</p>

<p>More than 40% (41.7%, <italic>N</italic> = 36) of participants indicated that they had a diagnosed chronic medical condition. Because a small proportion (11.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 4) of participants reported two or more current diagnosed chronic medical conditions, the proportions add up to more than 41.7%. The three most prominent medical conditions for the participants were Hepatitis C (16.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 6), asthma (13.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 5), and chronic pain (13.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 5).</p>
<p>With respect to psychological health, more than 40% of the participants (47.2%, <italic>N</italic> = 36) indicated that they had a diagnosed psychological condition. Three participants (8.3%) reported two current diagnosed psychological health conditions, one participant (2.8%) reported three current psychological health conditions, and one participant (2.8%) reported four current psychological health conditions. Therefore, the proportions relevant to psychological ill health add up to more than 47.2%.

<p>Three quarters of the participants interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks post release (27 of 36) reported that they had used drugs or alcohol since their release. At 3 to 4 months post release, 68% (13 of 19) of participants reported that they had used drugs or alcohol in the prior month. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11415510">Table 2</xref>, the two most frequently reported drugs used following release were alcohol and marijuana. When the figures are recalculated only for those participants who reported using drugs and/or alcohol at 1 to 4 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 27) and 3 to 4 months post release (<italic>n</italic> = 13), the proportions are approximately 1.3 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than that reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11415510">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Of participants who reported current substance use, the majority interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks post release (70.9%) and at 3 to 4 months post release (63.3%) were characterised by multiple substance use (incorporating overuse<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306624X11415510">1</xref></sup> of alcohol). Those participants interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks post release reported current usage of an average of 1.48 substances per person (range of 1-5 substances), and those participants interviewed at 3 to 4 months post release reported current usage of an average of 1.38 substances per person (range of 1-5 substances).</p>
<p>In terms of frequency of drug use, most of the participants who reported using heroin and marijuana at 1 to 4 weeks post release indicated a low use of those drugs (1-5 times per month). The pattern of drug use was less clear for those participants interviewed at 3 to 4 months, with low (1-5 times per month) to moderate (6-15 times per month) use of heroin and amphetamines typical among users. Only a small proportion of those participants with a history of substance use and/or current substance use were enrolled in a substance-use program at 1 to 4 weeks (20%, <italic>n</italic> = 7) and 3 to 4 months (21.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 4) post release.</p>

In addition, an estimate of available income was calculated based on the ex-prisoner’s reported take-home wages (per fortnight) and their receipt of fortnightly allowances, such as a parenting payment, disability pension, and a job-seeker allowance.

<p>Less than one third of participants (31%, 11 of 36) reported that they had a job within the 1st month of release. A similar pattern of underemployment was observed for those participants interviewed at 3 to 4 months, with 32% (6 of 19) in employment. The average weekly income of participants interviewed at 3 to 4 months post release was lower (<italic>M</italic> = AUD456.67, <italic>SD</italic> = AUD211.44) than that reported at 1 to 4 weeks post release (<italic>M</italic> = AUD627.27, <italic>SD</italic> = AUD646.67), although cell numbers were too low to analyse statistically for the repeated measurements. Participants interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks post release reported that they worked an average of 37.73 hr in a week (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.25), compared with 37.67 hr (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.95) at 3 to 4 months post release. For those who were employed, the average duration of hours worked per week at both time intervals was equivalent to full-time employment. Together, these results suggest a trend for full-time workers to experience reduced wage earnings in the months following release.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11415510">Table 3</xref>, of those participants who were employed, most held a casual position. In terms of job type, of the 11 participants who were employed at 1 to 4 weeks post release, the most common jobs were fruit picking (27.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 3) and manufacturing (18.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 2). Of the 6 participants who were employed at 3 to 4 months post release, 3 were employed in manufacturing, with the remainder employed in transport/driving or storage, gardening/horticulture, or the business industry. Several participants interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks (11.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 4) and 3 to 4 months post release (38.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 7) reported that they were currently in a job-training program.</p>

<title>Housing conditions</title>
<p>Current living arrangements were examined by asking participants about the “arrangement” they had with coresidents (immediate, short term, long term, permanent, or stay as long as desired). As shown in the lower section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11415510">Table 3</xref>, more than half of the participants interviewed at both time points indicated that they could stay as long as they liked in their current housing situation, typically their own home or a family member’s home. Approximately 20% of participants interviewed at both time points indicated that they had an immediate housing arrangement, typically living on a week-by-week basis, suggesting that for at least one fifth of the group, instability in housing was an ongoing issue. There was an apparent increase in the proportion of individuals in a permanent housing arrangement over the period of reintegration, although low cell numbers did not permit statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The majority of participants (86%, <italic>n</italic> = 30) reported that they had not moved since their release, whereas 9% of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 3) interviewed at 1 to 4 weeks post release had moved on one occasion. There were also single reports of moving on two and four occasions and one individual did not respond. At 3 to 4 months post release, 95% (<italic>n</italic> = 18) of the participants reported that they had not moved in the month prior to the interview, with a single individual having moved on two occasions. Accommodation that is maintained for less than 30 consecutive days may be defined as unstable housing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11415510">Zlotnick, Robertson, &amp; Lahiff (1999)</xref>, and using this operational definition, six of the participants interviewed at 3 to 4 months post release met this criterion.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study suggest that the majority of ex-prisoners are “doing it tough” once they are released. It is clear that ex-prisoners are confronted with numerous challenges to reintegration and that these multiple challenges must be dealt with repeatedly in the weeks and months following prison release. Common among ex-prisoners are serious physical, mental health, and substance-use problems. This group was also characterised by a poor financial situation, underemployment, and variable and patchy social support networks. Accommodation outcomes were, for the most part, favourable.</p>
<p>Consistent with other studies on reintegration or reentry/resettlement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11415510">Bahr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11415510">Visher et al., 2010</xref>), the present article and our previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield &amp; Graffam, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11415510">2010</xref>) highlight the role that multiple and complex variables relating to life conditions may play in influencing successful reintegration. A high proportion of the current sample reported an existing chronic medical condition. For example, a higher proportion of our sample reported that they had asthma (14%) compared with a national prevalence rate of about 10% in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11415510">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2008b</xref>) and about 8% in the United States and Britain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11415510">Pleis, Ward, &amp; Lucas, 2010</xref>). Moreover, our sample indicated a high rate of Hepatitis C (16.7%) compared with a national prevalence rate of less than 1% of the Australian general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11415510">Dyer &amp; Tolliday, 2009</xref>). As well, almost half of the participants reported a diagnosed psychological health condition, predominantly bipolar disorder or depression. About 45% of the Australian general population experiences a mental health disorder during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11415510">SANE Australia, 2010</xref>), and our findings are comparable with those figures. Although the sample size is small, the current findings suggest that chronic conditions of physical and psychological ill health are pervasive among ex-prisoners.</p>
<p>Substance use in the community setting was also high. There was no indication of a move toward a drug-free lifestyle for those participants who reported that they had used drugs in the 1st month of prison release. However, the frequency of drug use was generally lower at 1 to 4 weeks post release than at the 3- to 4-month period, consistent with an intention to “get straight” which is typical at the point of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11415510">Nelson, Deess, &amp; Allen, 1999</xref>). Polydrug use is common among this group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11415510">Kinner, 2006</xref>), and our findings attest that this is a long-term problem generally. The present sample was approximately 5 times more likely to have recently used drugs and/or alcohol (about 70%) compared with the Australian general population at 13% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11415510">AIHW, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that only a small proportion of participants with a history of past or current substance use were engaged in a postrelease program addressing dependency issues is a real concern because the likelihood of relapse to a lifestyle of drug use and criminal activity is higher within the first 3 months of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11415510">Hiller, Knight, &amp; Simpson, 1999</xref>). The generally low engagement in community-based alcohol and substance-use programs suggests that there is scope to improve partnerships and linkages between prison-based and community-based treatment programs to reduce the likelihood of relapse and reoffending.</p>
<p>Participants reported a heavy reliance on public (government) assistance. There did not appear to be any improvement in the financial situation of ex-prisoners over the postrelease period; in fact, the level of income derived from both wages and benefits placed participants in the category of low-wage earners. Moreover, a high proportion of the participants fell below the Henderson Poverty Line<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306624X11415510">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11415510">Brotherhood of St. Laurence, 2005</xref>), indicating that these individuals are clearly disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Employment outcomes and conditions were generally unfavourable as well. Our findings indicated that prolonged underemployment was an issue for a substantial number of ex-prisoners. There was also some indication that weekly wage earnings from employment declined with time since release. Most of the participants with paid employment worked full-time on a casual basis, which meant that they were ineligible for benefit packages as well as potentially having fewer opportunities for job advancement. This is problematic given that employment conditions of ex-prisoners contribute to lower wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11415510">Taxman, Young, &amp; Byrne, 2002</xref>), and financial difficulties may foster a return to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11415510">Solomon, Johnson, et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the generally poor employment outcomes, housing conditions of participants appeared quite good following release and remained largely unchanged over the period under investigation. An advantage of positive family support is the provision of stable housing as well as effective through-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11415510">Baldry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11415510">Naser, 2006</xref>). The relatively high housing stability observed among our sample may be the result of attrition bias, whereby this subgroup was more likely to be available for subsequent interviews because of their residential stability.</p>
<p>In terms of social support, our findings indicated that the majority of ex-prisoners spent a significant proportion of their time with existing friends, some of whom they had known in the prison environment. A small proportion of ex-prisoners indicated that they had no family support and many remained without a friendship network over the period under investigation. Difficulties associated with family reunification, assuming responsibility within the family unit, and alienation are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11415510">Baldry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11415510">Travis &amp; Waul, 2004</xref>), and may contribute to a lack of social support for ex-prisoners. It is also apparent that there was generally low engagement in postrelease support programs. Despite the fact that postrelease support programs may be associated with reduced recidivism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11415510">Graffam et al., 2005</xref>), the role that program participation can play in relative success in reintegration remains unclear. Future studies that address this issue would be beneficial as well as those that consider issues of participant motivation and readiness for engagement. Moreover, the finding that participants self-reported an absence of reoffending should be treated with caution. Access to criminal justice information relating to reoffending would have benefited the present study and have negated inaccurate self-reporting of offending behaviour.</p>
<p>There are a number of theoretical and practical implications of the present study. A unique feature is that it presents a framework for conceptualising the outcome variable of success in reintegration as a function of the interaction between intrapersonal conditions, subsistence conditions, and support conditions. These domains may be conceptualised within an ecological framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11415510">Graffam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield, 2006</xref>), allowing a better understanding of how variables (conditions) specific to the individual and variables (conditions) in the wider environment may together influence success in community reintegration. As well, being able to track changes in individual conditions over time is an important contribution to understanding reintegration as a dynamic process. It is important for future research to continue to address issues of time-dependent change in reintegration experiences for ex-prisoners because those experiences are often variable and patchy. Likewise, analysis of time-dependent changes can inform policy and program development and promote the likelihood of success in reintegration for ex-prisoners. Future advancement may include development of a comprehensive register of Australian postrelease and through-care services for ex-prisoners as well as the establishment of formal partnerships between relevant agencies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11415510">Borzycki, 2005</xref>). Development of policy that provides for a continuum of care (where relevant) and that addresses the complex and diverse needs of this group is also needed. A requirement for criminal justice policy to place greater emphasis on the reintegrative and transitional support needs pertinent to mental health, drug use, and social marginalisation is also suggested.</p>
<p>On a practical level, the present work signals a need to shift away from what has been a principal focus on prerelease preparation and assistance to longer term postrelease support. It also highlights a need to recognise that the often complex and comprehensive support needs of ex-prisoners equate to conditions of multiple, ongoing disadvantage. Improvement in cross-linkages and referral processes in services directed to improving life conditions of ex-prisoners is clearly warranted. Numerous adaptations to prerelease and postrelease treatment programs are required to address the multiple and complex needs of this group and may include modifications to program content, delivery, intensity, and treatment duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11415510">Edens, Peters, &amp; Hills, 1997</xref>). The utility of a coordinated multiagency approach to provision of postrelease services over the longer term has been recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11415510">Social Exclusion Unit, 2002</xref>). Other factors including transparency of approach, systems of accountability, clear processes for information exchange/feedback, tracking of individual progress across areas of need, and open channels for multiagency communication may also foster postrelease success (e.g., refer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11415510">Social Exclusion Unit, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>It is possible that our findings may have been impacted by attrition bias. As well as the potential impact on housing stability indicated earlier, it may be the case that those individuals available for subsequent interviews were relatively healthier. If so, our results may present a more positive picture of health and drug use than is really the case for ex-prisoners generally. It is also possible that the final sample was more in need of money and sought out the payment for ongoing participation. In this case, our results may misrepresent the participants’ financial situation. Attrition bias may also have impacted on the findings relating to employment such that those who were underemployed or unemployed were more available (or more willing) to be reinterviewed. The additional possibility that participants who were not reinterviewed at the second postrelease point could potentially be involved in offending behaviour cannot be ignored. If this is the case, then the final sample may also present a more positive picture in terms of reoffending behaviour. Given that we were denied access to Department of Corrections records, we are unable to affirm this conjecture.</p>
<p>It is also apparent that there are individual differences in community adjustment. Many prisoners do achieve positive outcomes on release and succeed in reintegration over the longer term, and these initial findings may be indicative that many prisoners are on the “road to success.” The degree to which success in reintegration, in terms of achieving stable housing, employment, and financial independence, is related to the comprehensiveness of support received is a potential avenue for further research and one which adds a piece to the puzzle of what makes someone succeed in reintegration.</p>
<p>The present study is limited by the relatively small sample size of ex-prisoners as well as the relatively high drop-out rate over the period under investigation. We endeavoured to maximise the likelihood that participants would remain in the study over time, with repeated contacts made to participants between the two postrelease points. Regardless, many participants were transient and subsequently could not be located at the second point in time. Although the retention rate was quite low in the present investigation, it is typical for longitudinal studies with this population (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11415510">La Vigne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11415510">Nelson et al., 1999</xref>). Aside from sample size, it is possible that the length of time between measures was not sufficient for any noticeable improvement to be observed in life circumstances. Future studies that address the multiplicity of variables affecting reintegration with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period would be beneficial. A larger sample size would enable the use of more advanced data analytic techniques and allow for the testing of multivariate models that examine interactions between variables central to advancing an ecological systems approach. Additional follow-up interviews beyond 3 to 4 months post release would enable further examination of the variables that may influence “success” in reintegration.</p>
<p>In summary, the study of life conditions of ex-prisoners reveals a complex array of variables that may promote or inhibit reintegration, with ex-prisoners generally disadvantaged in reintegration outcomes. We believe that an explanatory and intervention model is needed that addresses the multiple variables that affect an ex-prisoner’s ability to successfully reintegrate into the community. The multiple variables are complex because they often change over time. An ecological model of prisoner reintegration may well provide the most appropriate and effective approach to understanding and addressing the complexity and interactivity of variables that influence community reintegration of ex-prisoners. Our related work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11415510">Shinkfield &amp; Graffam, 2009</xref>) has successfully applied an ecological systems approach to better understand how variables/conditions specific to the individual and the wider environment may together influence success in community reintegration for a group of ex-prisoners.</p>
<p>Multiple disadvantages is an important topic of investigation when studying reintegration of ex-prisoners. Simply focusing on desistance from crime as a measure of success ignores the more fundamental issue that successful reintegration is about lifestyle change and transformation. For many ex-prisoners, positive lifestyle change involves overcoming multiple conditions of disadvantage. Of course, it is important to recognise that many ex-prisoners do manage to achieve positive outcomes following release and despite having some areas of need, achieve successful reintegration in terms of becoming fulfilled and productive members of the community.</p>
