<p>I have long been an admirer of Sarah Pink’s work – not least for her uncanny knack of bringing innovative methodological approaches to bear on topical substantive issues. In <italic>Situating Everyday Life</italic>, she brings together material from a number of ethnographic projects to engage with theories of place and practice, and apply them to questions of sustainability (about which I know something) and activism (about which I know a lot less). As the title suggests, she places everyday life at the centre of her analysis and proceeds to unpack the activities and environments that shape the dynamics of lived experience whilst keeping an eye on the ways in which these relate to processes of social change.</p>
<p>Pink asserts that debates about sustainability and climate change invite a focus on everyday life, not just amongst the branches of the social sciences that are already dealing with it (sociology, but also anthropology and geography), but also across scholarly traditions (for example engineering and design) and into the realms of formal and cultural politics. I couldn’t agree more and her argument appears to parallel some of Elizabeth Shove’s discussion about the nature and purchase of social scientific engagement with climate change policy. However, Pink also reveals an ambition to bring cutting-edge ethnographic material into these debates (chapter 3) as well as re-orienting the conceptual apparatus used to do so (chapter 2). Further, she makes a plea for breaking down the boundaries between everyday life and activism by suggesting that both are implicated in the making of places and practices, both are worlds that we are ‘inevitably <italic>in</italic>’ (p. 12), and both are sites that harbor the potential for change. This concern runs through the substantive chapters that follow.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 focuses on kitchens and Pink expertly weaves a theoretical point concerning domestic spaces as ‘(unbounded) constellations or intensities of things in movement’ (p. 54) with ethnographic detail of the practices carried out therein before considering the implications of this for activism and sustainability. Chapter 5 accomplishes a similar feat with respect to domestic laundry, and, here, compelling insights are offered into the tension between how the experience of home is created and the normalization of high levels of energy consumption – a real challenge from the perspective of environmental sustainability. In my view chapters 4 and 5 are exemplary, however chapters 6, 7 and 8 – drawing on her research into the Cittaslow movement – are less consistent. They are interesting enough in their own right and do a decent job of showcasing different methodological approaches, however they do not sit well with the analyses that precede them.</p>
<p>For a start, there is a tacit assumption that the activities, places and representations associated with this (activist) movement will open up new possibilities for reconfiguring everyday life in a more sustainable register. However, the mechanisms by which this might happen are not made clear and any such assertion does not resonate with practice-based approaches to everyday life, nor does it help in breaking down the conceptual boundaries between everyday life and activism. Additionally, I find the automatic equation of the Cittaslow movement with environmental sustainability to be somewhat problematic and so the basis for this supposition should have been made explicit and/or with a degree of critical reflection. Of course, it could well be that I am just less interested in this material and, either way, Pink successfully brings everything together – and the book to a close (chapter 9) – with a convincing narrative that situates everyday life ‘within social, material, digital, sensory and environmental relations’ (p. 141).</p>
<p>As might be expected, Pink’s work is fascinating, well written and a pleasure to read. However, this book is not without criticism. It is ambitious and wide ranging and although this is not necessarily a bad thing, I was left with the feeling that it falls slightly awkwardly between a number of different possibilities. For example, had this book positioned itself more systematically in terms of using novel ethnographic techniques to interrogate the dynamics of everyday life, it would have been a much more powerful contribution to a number of live debates in sustainability research and policy. In fact, it would have been the ideal complement to Elizabeth Shove, Mika Pantzar and Matt Watson’s <italic>The Dynamics of Social Practice: Everyday Life and How it Changes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038513489859">2012</xref>). There is a sense, however, in which its relevance is diminished by trying to do too much within the confines of a single text. Allied to this, there are a number of theoretical points that appear confused or at least open to misinterpretation. For instance, some of the criticisms that she makes of practice theory (for example, that it does not adequately capture how practices intersect with other processes and things, p. 22) do not chime with the content of the extant literature from this camp. Similarly, her insistence on bringing individuals back into practice-based accounts of everyday life carries her far enough away from practice theory to raise questions about why she aligns herself to it in the first place.</p>
<p>More generally, one might argue that there is no particular logic to the theoretical and substantive themes brought together in this book. However, on reflection, I think that Pink pulls it off rather well and, in doing so, offers a lively introduction to a number of contemporary perspectives in the social sciences. Perhaps, then, the real appeal of this book is to those outside of sociology who are looking for a set of conceptual and methodological resources that can be used to engage with the challenges of sustainability and climate change. As Pink rightly points out, social scientists have a valuable role to play here and applied research ‘needs to be developed on the basis of critical and theoretically and methodologically coherent ways of understanding how everyday life practices are constituted and how they change’ (p. 149). Criticisms aside, this book makes significant progress in that direction.</p>
