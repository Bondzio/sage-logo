<p>The time is ripe to form strong alliances between professions and professionals with an interest investment in human lactation. We would all agree there is no other well-documented, evidence-based public health “intervention” that has better potential to effectively improve the short- and long-term population health. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to suggest that nutrition during pregnancy and early infancy has long-term effects on health and well-being through metabolic programming. The most convincing results are related to obesity and obesity-related disorders. The transgenerational effects of obesity make it a major public health issue, which has led to the development of global multicentered studies designed to examine this theory in detail. The Early Nutrition Project, which aims to examine the long-term effects of early nutrition on later health, began in February 2012, and the size of this study is staggering: With a budget of 11.12 million euro and 36 partners in 12 countries, it comprises 11 observational studies and 9 interventional studies, paralleled by animal studies and sampling of cohorts for placental, epigenetic, and metabolomics studies. It tests 3 hypotheses: (1) fetal overnutrition leading to accelerated transgenerational obesity (maternal diet and exercise), (2) mismatch of fetal and postnatal nutrition (undernutrition in utero versus overnutrition in infancy), and (3) accelerated postnatal growth (short duration of breastfeeding and excessive protein intake). This project has tremendous potential to strengthen the evidence for the benefits of breastfeeding and human milk and may elucidate the mechanisms by which benefits are conferred to both mother and child.</p>
<p>For such grand-scale studies to be well designed and, just as importantly, precisely implemented, we need buy-in from stakeholders with many backgrounds. Investment must come from scientists, physicians, lactation consultants, dietitians, nurses, and midwives, as well as policy makers and community organizations, such as the Australian Breastfeeding Association and Le Leche League. Input from all of these stakeholders is integral to any large study’s success.</p>
<p>Despite our common goal, it can be hard to build strong collaborations that translate into excellent outcomes with the involvement of so many professions, personalities, and perspectives. Communication difficulties among groups typically arise and are often generated by the stereotypical assumptions that we have regarding one another’s roles. It would benefit us to reflect on our own stereotypes (both negative and positive) and to ask ourselves whether we default to the stereotypes of others when negotiations become difficult or an unpopular decision is made. How often—let’s admit it—might our own prejudices lead us to label researchers as closeted and unapproachable old men, midwives as pushy, lactation consultants as overly zealous, and doctors as detached.</p>
<p>On the bright side, many groups have broken barriers, pushed aside stereotypical assumptions, and successfully worked together for a common goal. New Zealand has developed an all-encompassing approach for the implementation of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative and has made phenomenal progress, with 91% of maternity hospitals accredited and with an increase in initiation rates from 56% to 84% exclusive breastfeeding. Not only did New Zealand lactation clinicians successfully devise and implement a strategy to improve breastfeeding initiation rates to broaden their influence, but they also achieved buy-in from another important stakeholder—the government. Extending their alliances will ultimately improve their outcomes. Similarly, lactation clinicians have the potential to increase the power of studies such as the Early Nutrition Project. Skills such as recruitment of suitable study candidates, the ability to apply and monitor a clinical intervention properly and consistently, and the collection of accurate data are critical to studies that investigate lactation. In the past, data collected on lactation have been minimal at best and fraught with a lack of consistent universal definitions.</p>
<p>As we forge new alliances, we must guard against reverting to stereotypical assumptions, such as “What does a statistician know about breastfeeding?” or “What does the clinician know about research?” We need statisticians to make sure that our experiments are working. We need clinicians to ensure realistic methodology and accurate collection of data. As opportunities arise to shape the future of large-scale interdisciplinary studies, the time has never been better to discard obstructive stereotypes and forge strong relationships to support the study, monitoring, and understanding of human lactation.</p>
