<abstract>
<p>Phosphate glass fiber (PGF)-reinforced polypropylene (PP)/natural rubber (NR)-based unidirectional composites with four levels of fiber loading (5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%) were fabricated by compression molding. The influence of the addition of fiber loadings on the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, bending strength, tensile modulus, and percentage elongation at break of the composites was investigated. Based on the fiber loading, 20% PGF-reinforced PP composites yielded better mechanical properties compared with the PGF/NR composites. Degradation tests of the composites were performed in aqueous and soil medium, and it was found that PGF/NR composites lost much of its original strength and modulus compared with that of the PGF/PP composites. Interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of PGF/PP and PGF/NR systems was investigated using the single-fiber fragmentation tests. The IFSS of PGF/PP and PGF/NR systems appeared to be 5.5 and 1.1 MPa, respectively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the modern world, composites play an important role for the fabrication of construction materials, industries, military, automobiles, naval parts, space crafts, and biomedical applications mainly because of their excellent thermomechanical properties. Synthetic fiber-reinforced polymer-based composites gained huge attention in the last century. These composites are replacing conventional structural materials such as wood, metals, and reinforced concrete. Fiber-reinforced composites are widely used because of some of their extraordinary properties such as good processability, high stiffness, ease of installation, relatively good resistance to the environment, and so on. A good number of matrices and fibers with a wide range of properties are being used for processing composites.<sup>

</sup> Most of the composites are made of synthetic or natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Synthetic fibers that are used commonly as composite materials are carbon, aramid, glass, nylon, and so on. Biodegradable and biocompatible composites are used mainly in orthopedic fields. Currently, synthetic fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites are dominating the composite market due to their better durability and moisture resistance properties. Thermoplastic matrix materials are the most important part of the composites. Polypropylene (PP) was used as the matrix in the current study because it has some excellent characters for composite fabrication. PP is a thermoplastic engineering polymer and possesses several useful properties such as transparency, dimensional stability, chemical resistance, gas barrier properties, high impact strength, and so on. PP is also very suitable for filling, reinforcing, and blending. PP along with fibrous natural fibers is one of the most potential routes to create natural synthetic polymer composites.<sup>

<p>Natural rubber (NR; <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-polyisoprene) is a versatile raw material with unique chemical and physicomechanical properties that make it ideal for many dynamic applications. As NR is too soft to be used in its pure form, for most applications, the properties of NR are improved by reinforcing it with fillers such as carbon black, sulfur, or silica.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095244312439490">7</xref>

<p>Synthetic degradable fibers attracted scientist’s attention because of their potential application in the biomedical field. At present, there are several synthetic degradable fibers such as bioglass fibers, phosphate glass fibers (PGFs), organic polymeric fibers, and natural polymeric fibers used as reinforcing agents for biomedical composites. In phosphate-based glass fibers, the primary network is formed by phosphorous pentaoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), which forms the backbone of the glass structure by forming the tetrahedral comprising one phosphorus ion surrounded by four oxygen ions. Phosphate glasses have many unique properties, the most interesting of which is its ability to dissolve completely in aqueous media. PGFs can be synthesized to include ions found in the human body. These fibers have the potential for use as biomaterials because their chemical composition is close to that of natural bone. PGFs are studied for use in polymer composites intended for use as bone implants and dental materials. Phosphate fibers are also used for the insulation of pipes in submarines and similar naval uses. Since phosphate fibers absorb moisture, they have also been used as fillers for oil filters. Fibers have also been used to add texture to water-based paints, and it was noted that the paint dried more rapidly when it contained a few percentage of phosphate fibers. PGF papers are also used as asbestos substitutes for noise and fire control in air-conditioning ducts in homes and offices and in hair driers and similar domestic heating equipment.<sup>

<p>Now scientists are trying to prepare biodegradable polymer composites that can replace the metal implants currently in use. It is reported in the literature that carbon/polyether ether ketone has a significant history of invasive use. Bioglass with polyethylene and polysulfone matrices has been used for implant materials. Totally resorbable composites have been fabricated using polymers reinforced with higher organic polymer fibers of polyglycolic acid or polylactic acid. These glass fibers have a potential for use as biomaterials, because their chemical composition is close to that of natural bone.<sup>

</sup> In the case of polymer-fiber systems, the quality of the interface is very important as it controls the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. The interfacial properties of fiber-reinforced polymer composites can be measured by different methods. The most common are single-fiber fragmentation test (SFFT), fiber pull-out test, micro-bond test, and so on. The SFFT method has several advantages over the other methods, such as simple specimen handling, replication of the stress transfer characteristics in real composites, convenient monitoring of failure processes, and so on.<sup>

</sup> The present investigation involves measuring of the mechanical properties of the composites (PGF/PP and PGF/NR). Mechanical and degradation properties of the PGF/PP composites were compared with the PGF/NR composites. The interfacial properties of PGF/PP and PGF/NR systems were measured using the SFFT. The aim of this research is to compare mechanical, degradation, and interfacial properties of PGF/PP and PGF/NR composites.</p>

<p>Granules of PP were purchased from the Cosmoplene Polyolefin Company Ltd (401, Ayer Merbau Road, Singapore) and were used as received. Raw NR (Standard Malaysian Rubber) in the solid state was supplied by the Malaysian Rubber Board (Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia). Synthetic degradable fiber was synthesized from the phosphate salts of iron, sodium, magnesium, and calcium. Salts were purchased from Merck (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Appropriate ratios of the salts were mixed and placed into a platinum crucible and heated at 300°C for 6 h to dehydrate the salts. The crucible was then placed in a high-temperature furnace at 1050°C for 1 h. Fibers were generated using conventional hand-drawing technique from the molten glass. The composition (mol%) of the degradable glass fiber is as follows 14Na<sub>2</sub>O-24MgO-16CaO-6Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-40P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The diameter of the fibers varied from 30 to 60 μm. The fibers were collected from the small bobbin (20 cm circumference) connected to a motor and stored in a desiccator.</p>

<title>Composite fabrication</title>
<p>For making one PP sheet, granules of PP (about 6 g) was placed into two steel plates and placed into the hot press (Model 3856; Carver Inc., USA). The press was operated at 180°C. Steel plates were pressed at 5 bar consolidation pressure for 1 min. The plates were then cooled for 3 min in a separate press under 5 bar pressure at room temperature. The resulting PP sheet was cut into the desired size (150 ×120 × 0.25 mm) for composite fabrication. Composites were prepared by sandwiching three layers of fibers between four sheets of PP. Fibers were placed unidirectionally between the PP sheets. This was then placed against two steel plates and heated at 180°C for 5 min to soften the polymer prior to pressing 1 bar pressure for 1 min. The fiber weight fraction of the composites was calculated. Sheet of rubber was made at 140°C using solid NR (nonvulcanized) at the same press. PGF-reinforced NR-based composites were prepared at 140°C for 5 min at 5 bar pressure. Thickness of the composites was maintained using shims.</p>

<title>Mechanical properties of the composites</title>
<p>The tensile and bending properties of the composite samples were determined according to DIN 53455 and DIN 53452 standard methods by a universal testing machine (model H50 KS-0404, Hounsfield Series S, UK). The crosshead speed was 10 mm/min and gauge length was 20 mm, whereas for bending measurement the span distance was 40 mm. All the results were taken as the average values of at least five samples.</p>

<sec id="section7-0095244312439490">
<title>Degradation tests of the fibers and the composites in aqueous medium</title>
<p>Degradation tests of the fibers and composites were performed in deionized water at room temperature (25°C). Up to 120 days of degradation tests were carried out. The degradation specimens were placed into glass vials containing 250 mL of deionized water. At set time points, samples were taken out and dried over night at 100°C before being subjected to mechanical testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095244312439490">
<title>Soil degradation tests of the composites</title>
<p>Composite samples were buried in soil (having at least 25% moisture) for different periods of time. After a certain period, samples were withdrawn carefully, washed with distilled water, and dried at 105°C for 6 h and kept at room temperature for 24 h and then measured the mechanical properties.</p>

<sec id="section9-0095244312439490">
<title>The interfacial properties of the composites</title>
<p>The single fiber composite specimens were prepared using one single filament of fiber by compression molding. One aligned filament, kept in place with adhesive tape at the fiber tip, was sandwiched between two sheets of PP. The sandwich was then hot pressed (model 3856; Carver) at 180°C for 1 min at 1 bar pressure between two steel plates. The plates were cooled in a separate press (model 2518; Carver) using 1 bar pressure at room temperature. The thickness of the specimen was 0.40 mm. The single fiber composite specimens (25 mm × 5 mm × 0.40 mm) were loaded on the Universal Tensile Machine (Hounsfield series, UK) to bring out the repeated breakage of the fiber. A crosshead speed of 0.25 mm/min and the gauge length of 25 mm were used. The experiment was monitored by a microscope attached to a monitor. Fiber fragment length at the saturation point was the key measurement for this experiment. Then the number of fragments over the 25-mm gauge length at each load level (using 2 N increments) was counted. The critical length (<italic>l</italic>

<sub>c</sub> = 4/(3<italic>l</italic>

<sub>f</sub> is the average fragment length; <italic>l</italic>
<sub>f</sub> was calculated as the monitored length (25 mm) divided by the number of breaks observed within that length of the experimental fragment length distribution. To find out the critical length, the number of fragments was counted. Fiber tensile properties were obtained by tensile testing filaments using the international standard bending strength (BS) ISO 11566. A single fiber was mounted on a paper frame with a gauge length of 25 mm. The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of the composites was calculated from both the Kelly–Tyson and Drzal equations. Based on the force balance on a micromechanical model, Kelly and Tyson<sup>

<title>Effect of fiber contents on the mechanical properties of the composites</title>
<p>The tensile and bending properties of the composites were characterized by TS, BS, tensile modulus (TM), and elongation at break (Eb; %). Significant effect of fiber loading on TS, BS, and TM of the composites was observed. The tensile and bending properties of glass fiber-reinforced PP-based composites were evaluated and the results were presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095244312439490">Table 1</xref>. The TS and BS were found to be increased on increasing the percentage of fiber content in the composites. The highest fiber content in the composite taken was 20%. At this composition, the TS and BS of the composites were 43.4 and 47.3 MPa, respectively. Fiber content above 20% could not be taken because mixing of fiber and PP was not good as the amount of PP was not sufficient enough to diffuse into the fiber. Up to 15% fiber content, the TM increased with increasing fiber content in the composites. At that composition, the TM is 1585 MPa. Above 15% fiber content, the TM decreased with increasing fiber loading. So the composition at highest fiber content (20%) was taken to be the optimum composition. The Eb (%) decreased with increasing fiber content in the composites. The lowest Eb (11.5%) was obtained at 20 wt% fiber.</p>

<p>The effect of fiber loading on the mechanical properties of the composites may be explained by the homogeneity of fiber in composite and wettability of molten PP. Owing to the lower level of fiber in the matrix, nonhomogeneity of the fiber is observed in the composite material. As a result, the proper load transfer is not possible by the matrix. Moreover, PGF has much higher mechanical properties than that of PP. So enrichment of PGF improves the mechanical properties of the composites. Fiber matrix adhesion is the key to a strong interface. Optimum adhesion between fiber and matrix can be achieved by maximizing wetting tension.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095244312439490">26</xref>
</sup> Wetting tension can be maximized by maximizing the physical interactions at the molecular level between matrix and fiber and spontaneous wetting of the fiber surface with liquid matrix in order to maximize the flow density at the interface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095244312439490">26</xref>
</sup> At high level of fiber content, poor wettability of matrix and improper orientation of fiber is found in the matrix material. This may cause the decrease in TM of composites above 15% fiber content. On the other hand, percentage Eb (%) was reduced significantly because of low Eb (%) of the glass fibers compared with PP. From this investigation, it is clear that TS, BS, and TM improved significantly compared with the matrix material (PP). The TS, BS, and TM values improved to about 52%, 45%, and 65%, respectively. From this investigation, it is clear that the glass composites gained a significant TS, BS, and TM over the matrix material PP and thus indicated good fiber matrix adhesion.</p>
<p>The influence of fiber loading on tensile and bending properties of the PGF/NR composites was studied and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095244312439490">Table 2</xref>. It was found that the TS and TM of the solid NR sheets were quite low and that BS could not be determined. The NR used here is nonvulcanized and during hot press at 140°C (for making sheets), some TS might be lost. But using these NR sheets, the glass fiber/NR composites performed well in tensile and bending testing. The TS and BS were found to be increased with increasing fiber loading in the composites. The composites with 20% fiber have a TS of 18.3 MPa and a BS of 23.6 MPa. The TM increased with increasing fiber loading up to 15% and then decreased with increasing fiber loading. The Eb (%) decreased with increasing fiber content in the composites. The lowest Eb (72%) was obtained at 20 wt% fiber. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095244312439490">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095244312439490">2</xref>, it is clearly evident that glass fiber/PP composites had significantly higher TS, BS, and TM over glass fiber/NR composites. It was revealed that glass fiber/PP composites were found to be about 58% TS, 50% BS, and 92% TM higher than glass fiber/NR composites. In contrast, glass fiber/NR composites had about 84% higher Eb (%) over the glass fiber/PP composites, indicating rubbery properties of the composites. Mechanical properties of the natural fiber-reinforced polymer-based composites are published in the literature and the results found in this investigation are comparable with the reported values.<sup>

<title>Weight loss of glass fibers in water and soil</title>
<p>Degradation tests of the PGFs were performed in water and soil at ambient condition for up to 120 days. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312439490">Figure 1</xref>. It was found that with the increase in degradation time, weight loss was increased. After 7 days of degradation, weight loss of the fibers was found to be 1.3%, but 6.3% of weight loss was seen after 30 days. After 60 and 120 days, weight loss of the fibers reached 8.2% and 11.8%, respectively. From this investigation, it was clearly found that PGF continues to degrade in aqueous medium. It is reported<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095244312439490">30</xref>
</sup> that phosphate-based glasses dissolve in two stages. The first stage is controlled by the rate at which water diffuses into a volume of the bulk glass surface. This kinetics is obeyed only until the inorganic polymer chains (glass) at the surface are entirely surrounded by water. Totally hydrated chains can then disentangle from the partially hydrated chains still attached to the surface and float off into the solution resulting in a uniform glass dissolution and kinetics that are linear with time. During the degradation of the phosphate glass, the chain ends can be interconnected by hydrogen bonding, which reduces the degradation rate. It is also mentioned that this type of glass leach ions in the aqueous media. Since this research is concerned with the synthetic degradable PGFs, the degradation phenomenon in aqueous medium is quite similar to that reported for phosphate-based glasses. On the other hand, after 7 days of degradation in the soil medium, weight loss of the fibers was found to be 3.3%, but 9.6% of weight loss was seen after 30 days. After 60 and 120 days, weight loss of the fibers reached 11.7% and 14.8%, respectively. From the figure, it was also revealed that the weight loss of glass fibers in the soil medium after 120 days is 26% higher than that of aqueous medium due to the action of microorganism present in the soil, which is mainly responsible for degradation.</p>

It is quite clear that glass fiber/NR composites lost much weight compared with that of the glass fiber/PP composites. After 7 and 120 days of immersion, glass fiber/PP composites lost 0.12% and 0.37% of weight but 2.3% and 6.4% of weight is lost in case of glass fiber/NR composite. PGF and NR are biodegradable but PP is a petroleum-based nondegradable polymer. During degradation tests in aqueous medium, glass and NR degraded and as a result, the weight loss was found to be higher for glass fiber/NR composites. NR is a biodegradable polymer and consists of mainly <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-isoprene and minor amounts of nonrubber constituents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095244312439490">31</xref>
</sup> Leaching out of nonrubber materials occurred within a short time, but long-time immersion caused degradation of isoprene units and thus much weight loss was found for glass fiber/NR composites compared with that of the glass fiber/PP composites. NR is a natural biodegradable material. The dry weight of NR consists of more than 90% of <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-isoprene and less than 10% of nonrubber constituents, like proteins, lipids, carbohydrate, resins, and inorganic salts.<sup>

<title>Relative degradation of the tensile properties of the composites in soil medium</title>
<p>Degradation tests of the composites (glass fiber/PP and glass fiber/NR) were performed in soil at ambient condition for 120 days. Values of TS and TM of the composites are plotted against the degradation time and are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0095244312439490">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0095244312439490">6</xref>. It was found that the values of TS and TM of the composites decreased slowly. After 120 days of soil burial, glass fiber-reinforced PP composite lost 19% TS and 32% TM, while glass fiber-reinforced NR composites lost 51% TS and 62% TM. From this, it is clear that glass fiber-reinforced PP composites retained much of their tensile properties than the glass fiber-reinforced NR composites during soil degradation. During the soil burial test, water penetrated from the cutting edges of the composites in the glass fiber/PP samples and degradation of glass occurred resulting in a decrease in the tensile properties of the composites. The water molecules compete with free active side groups in the system to form a cross-link with the fibroin chains. As a result, the structure is loosened and there is a decrease in the force required to rupture the fiber. For this reason, the tensile properties of the composites decrease significantly. Again, NR is also biodegradable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095244312439490">32</xref>
</sup> Hence, the degradation of the composites is faster after 120 days of degradation, which explains the greater loss in tensile properties for glass fiber/NR composites.</p>

<title>Studies on the interfacial properties of glass/PP and glass/NR systems</title>
<p>To find out the IFSS, SFFT was carried out. Single filament of jute fiber-reinforced PP (and also NR) matrix composite was prepared by compression molding. Fragmentation test was performed using universal testing machine and the number of fragments was counted using a microscope operated in transmission mode. The results are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0095244312439490">Table 3</xref>. The PP and NR matrices are quite transparent, which facilitates the counting of the number of fiber fragments in the specimen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0095244312439490">Figure 8</xref> shows the fragments of the fiber inside the glass fiber/PP composite sample. The critical length of the glass fiber/PP system was found to be 3124.54 µm, TS of the fiber at critical length was reached at 761 MPa, and the diameter of the single glass fiber was found to be 45 ± 4 µm. The IFSS was found to be 5.48 MPa for glass fiber/PP system. On the other hand, the IFSS for glass fiber/NR system was found to be 1.06 MPa, which is significantly low compared with that of the glass fiber/PP system. From this investigation, it revealed that the composite has sufficient IFSS. It is reported<sup>

</sup> that the IFSS was found to be 4 to 7 MPa for PP/E-glass fiber system. The IFSS values found in this investigation is in the range of PP/E-glass fiber system, which is a good sign of the fiber matrix adhesion between PP and degradable PGF system. On the other hand, glass fiber/NR system revealed quite low IFSS values compared with that of the glass fiber/PP or E-glass fiber/PP system. Although NR is hydrophobic in nature, but the mechanical properties of NR is very low compared with PP as given in the data of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095244312439490">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095244312439490">2</xref>.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the current work, PGF-reinforced PP/NR-based unidirectional composites were fabricated by compression molding. The effects of the fiber content on the mechanical properties of PGF/PP and PGF/NR composites have been studied. The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results of this study:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The TS and BS of the composites increased with increasing fiber loading up to 20%; but above 15% of fiber loading, the TM decreased with increasing fiber content. Eb (%) of the composites decreased with increasing fiber content.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The results of mechanical characterization showed that the TS, BS, and TM of PGF/PP composites were higher than that of virgin PP, and even higher than that of PGF/NR composites. But Eb (%) of PGF/PP composites was lower than that of the PGF/NR composites.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Degradation tests of the composites were performed in aqueous and soil medium and indicated that glass fiber/NR composites lost much of its original strength and modulus compared with that of the glass fiber/PP composites.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>IFSS results indicated that glass fiber/NR composite has low IFSS values compared with that of glass fiber/PP composite. It can be concluded that tensile properties of glass fiber/PP composites were better than that of the glass fiber/NR composites, but glass fiber/NR composites showed excellent biodegradable properties.</p>
