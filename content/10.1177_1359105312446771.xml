<p>Best practice communication between healthcare professionals and patients involves using quality patient information leaflets (PILs). We assessed medical and physiotherapy students’ (<italic>N</italic> = 337) ability to appraise the readability, psychology theory content and quality of nine international smoking PILs. Flesch scores ranged from 52.8–79.7% (fairly difficult to fairly easy). Students identified components of the Health Belief Model (84–98%), Theory of Planned Behaviour (65–88%) and Transtheoretical Model (37–86%). Importantly, student-proposed additional theory-based content had no detrimental effect on readability scores. Overall quality scores indicated low–moderate quality. This assignment helped students critically evaluate the utility of PILs for communication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Communicating health information is a core skill required of all healthcare professionals. Communication skills training is now a core component of curricula across the healthcare professions, from medicine and nursing to physiotherapy and pharmacy. Communication skills are listed as a key clinical competency in literature focused on defining core learning outcomes for medical graduates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312446771">General Medical Council, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312446771">Simpson et al., 2002</xref>). The focus of such training is on upskilling and improving the communication skills of the individual student as future health professionals. However, the ability of the recipient to understand the information provided is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312446771">Baker, 2006</xref>), yet receives relatively less attention in health professional teaching and training. Health literacy is a set of individual capacities that allow an individual to acquire and use new information on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312446771">Baker, 2006</xref>). It has been defined as ‘the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312446771">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000</xref>: 20). The issue of health literacy is an important component of the communication skills ‘armoury’ and thus is a concept that students need to understand when developing their own communication skills.</p>
<p>The most commonly used method of communicating health information to patients and the general public is through use of patient information leaflets (PILs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312446771">Pander Maat and Lentz, 2010</xref>). Patients are often provided with such PILs during or after a healthcare consultation, and this information can be consulted by the patient long after the consultation is over. As such, the PIL consolidates the information provided in the consultation. Providing written information has been shown to be more effective in improving patient recall and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312446771">Coulter et al., 2006</xref>). There are a wide range of PILs available, from explaining medication use that are regulated in terms of their presentation within the European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312446771">European Commission, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312446771">Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures – Human (CMD(h)), 2006</xref>); to providing instruction on post-operative recovery – for example from total hip replacement surgery; to PILs aimed at health promotion, such as promoting screening uptake, or promoting health behaviour change, such as quitting smoking or increasing exercise uptake. PILs aimed at health promotion often rely on theories of health behaviour, for example the Health Belief Model (HBM), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Trantheoretical Model (TTM; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312446771">Armitage and Conner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312446771">Glanz and Maddock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312446771">Kok et al., 2004</xref>). These theories or their components are used to formulate PIL content in such a way as not only to maximize the motivational effect of the PIL, but also to provide practical assistance, with the aim of encouraging the reader to adhere to the PIL’s recommendations for behaviour change, screening uptake and so on.</p>
<p>However, for the PIL to have the intended outcome, readability is key. Ensuring that the average reader can read and comprehend PIL content is achieved by setting the reading age of a PIL at a sufficiently low level that will enable the content to be understood by a majority of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312446771">Williamson and Martin, 2010</xref>). Established methods exist which can be used to quantify the accessibility of information for comprehension by the general population. These include Flesch Reading Ease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312446771">Flesch, 1948</xref>) and Flesch–Kincaid grade-level formulae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312446771">Kincaid et al., 1975</xref>). Furthermore, while PILs may be readable, they may not always be accurate, or contain enough detail, or may be biased by companies who sponsor the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312446771">Cummins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312446771">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312446771">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). The overall evaluation of such PILs by health professionals is therefore important, to ensure that patients are receiving optimal information, and a number of ways exist to evaluate these. For example, the DISCERN tool was developed to enable patients and healthcare professionals to rate the quality of written information, and has been shown to be reliable and valid for judging the reliability of information and overall quality of PILs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>). In this case, quality is considered to be the reliability of the PIL (e.g. are sources of information balanced or biased?), or whether treatment choices are fully explained (e.g. are potential risks of treatments outlined?).</p>
<p>Students of the healthcare professions will become future users of PILs in patient interactions. In order for them to be confident that patients can read and understand PILs, and maximize their benefit, the future health professional needs to understand health literacy, the practical use of health psychology theory and the quality of the information that should be provided to patients. Such understanding should serve to improve interactions between these future healthcare providers and health service users, especially in cases where healthcare professionals are asked to write the PILs. We therefore describe a student project that requires engagement with indices of readability, theory content and DISCERN ratings of PILs on smoking.</p>
<p>The Psychology Department at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) is involved in teaching Health Psychology modules in an interdisciplinary setting to first year students in medicine and physiotherapy. In the first semester of the first year, students complete an assignment focused on health literacy in which they analyse a PIL aimed at health behaviour change. Students first receive teaching input on health behaviour theories and their importance in communicating health information. They are then provided with PILs aimed at promoting smoking cessation and they select one for detailed analysis. This detailed analysis involves the students conducting five tasks:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105312446771" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>assessing PIL readability using the Flesch Reading Ease formula;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identifying the health behaviour theories used to communicate the PIL information and motivate the reader to change their behaviour;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>suggesting a (theory-driven) way to improve the content of the PIL, not to exceed 100 words;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>reapplying the Flesch Reading Ease formula to assess improvements/disimprovements in readability of the PIL following the student’s modification; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>reporting a DISCERN rating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>), indicating the quality of the PIL in terms of the health information provided.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The aims of this article were two-fold: (a) we describe a unique educational intervention among first year medical and physiotherapy students to engage them with PIL readability, health psychology theory content and application, and PIL quality ratings; and (b) report the students’ analyses of international PILs on smoking in terms of these indices.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Of the class total of 357 medicine and physiotherapy students, 337 provided full informed consent (94%). Mean age was 20.2 (SD 1.8), 50% were women, and 92% were studying medicine, 8% were current smokers with 3% ex-smokers (longer than six months). Nationality was varied, and so was grouped by World Health Organization region (16 did not report nationality): Australia 1.2%; East Asia and the Pacific 0.9%; Eastern Europe and central Asia 0.6%; Latin America/Caribbean 2.6%; North African and the Middle East 18.4%; North American 11.7%; South and south-east Asia 33.3%; Sub-Saharan Africa 2.9%; Western Europe 23.7%.</p>

<title>PILs</title>
<p>A total of 10 PILs on smoking were used – two each from Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, the UK and the USA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312446771">Table 1</xref>). However, only five students chose to answer questions on the second USA PIL, so this was excluded from subsequent analyses. PILs were chosen to meet the following criteria:</p>

<title>Flesch scores</title>
<p>The Flesch readability index is a widely used formula (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312446771">Beauchamp et al., 2010</xref>) which assesses structural elements of the text (e.g. number of sentences, words, syllables, etc.) and provides an index of reading difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312446771">Flesch, 1948</xref>). Higher scores indicate easier readability, and scores range from 0–100. Scores less than 30 are considered to indicate readability at university level; with scores above 90 suitable for children aged 10–11 years. Students were told to paste their chosen PIL into Microsoft Word and use its readability tool to obtain the Flesch score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312446771">
<title>Psychological theory</title>
<p>Students received two lectures on health psychology models, focusing in particular on the HBM, TPB and TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312446771">Armitage and Conner, 2000</xref>), and one on learning theories (operant and classical conditioning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312446771">Klein and Mowrer, 2001</xref>). These models are also integrated into other lectures throughout this first semester module.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105312446771">
<title>DISCERN</title>
<p>The DISCERN instrument was developed to enable patients and healthcare professionals to rate the quality of written information on treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>). DISCERN has shown acceptable levels of agreement among 15 expert panel members in its original development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>), and substantial agreement for overall ratings between two independent raters of over 31 different PILs for prostate cancer treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312446771">Rees et al., 2002</xref>). DISCERN does not require specialist health knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>). The instrument consists of 16 Likert items in total, ranging from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better quality leaflets. This consists of one overall quality rating item; eight items on reliability (e.g. ‘Is it clear what sources of information were used to compile the publication (other than the author or producer)?); and seven items on treatment choices (e.g. ‘Does it describe what would happen if no treatment is used?’). Average scores for these subscales are reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105312446771">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The project is part of the Health, Behaviour and Society module delivered in RCSI during the first semester. The module comprises 23 didactic lectures, and focuses on psychological and social factors in understanding, preventing or managing health and disease. Sample topics include learning, memory, health psychology theory, health behaviours (smoking, alcohol use, risky sexual behavior, etc.), stress and human development. The assignment comprises 15% (medicine) or 20% (physiotherapy) of the final module total. The RCSI Research Ethics Committee provided approval for the study protocol, which was provided to students. Students were given a brief didactic introduction to the project, which lasted approximately 10 minutes, and was delivered prior to the two lectures on health behaviour theories and their importance in predicting, modifying and communicating health information. They were informed that they were required as part of their coursework to appraise a PIL on smoking for psychological theory content, readability and overall quality rating (DISCERN), and try to modify the PIL to incorporate information based on psychological theory. They were also informed that they should critically appraise their own modifications. It was stressed that while students had to do the project, they did not have to provide permission for their data to be used in this research. For further information the students were directed to a detailed protocol, set of instructions and a frequently asked questions document available on the RCSI virtual learning environment (Moodle). After this session, students then chose one of the provided PILs for appraisal and subsequent modification, with a re-assessment of readability, in order to determine whether theory-driven modifications had a positive or detrimental impact on Flesch score. They completed the DISCERN and other questions on Moodle, and also provided informed consent in this manner.</p>

<p>However, the key points that I’ve learned is that PILs should be tailored to all readers regardless of age and gender so that the majority of patients can benefit from it. Furthermore, information and material on PILs has to be clear, concise, relevant and written in simple language so that the message is conveyed best to patients.</p>
<p>Through the project, I have learned how various components of health models can be utilised to design a PIL and how to critically appraise and evaluate a PIL with DISCERN … important to take various factors into account when providing readers with the necessary information whilst not compromising the readability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The described student project acts as a learning opportunity to increase awareness of health literacy in a group of first year medical and physiotherapy students. The specific aspects of health literacy targeted were increasing awareness of the importance of health information readability, practical use of health psychology theory and quality rating of information provided to patients. Students were required to engage with these issues in a manner which should lead to a greater understanding of health literacy issues and an appreciation of the usefulness of health psychology to guide communication of health information. Interestingly, there were no differences in any of the outcomes when analysing data by grouping participants as being from English-speaking countries or not (data not shown), suggesting that the appreciation and application of the techniques in the present project was universal. In summary, the results showed that estimates of readability, theory content and DISCERN ratings were variable across PILs. Importantly, additional theory-based content, as proposed by students, had no detrimental effect on readability scores. However, many students reported a slight decrease in readability after adding text to the PIL which they thought would improve it. In this regard, students commented on the difficulties of communicating information which they consider to be clear, which they then see decreases readability, thus highlighting to them the challenges of communicating health information effectively. Furthermore, while it is possible that students may have shared their thoughts or ideas regarding the project, this was not documented in the current research. In future studies it would be interesting to determine the scale of such co-operation, or its effect on PIL ratings and assigned grades. Future research could also look at the impact of this type of project with pharmacy students, as Pharmacists are also a group that use PILs regularly.</p>
<p>The results of this study are based on self-report and students may have erred in the calculation of Flesch scores (e.g. when pasting the PIL text and not reformatting appropriately), the identification and application of theory and even misinterpreted DISCERN ratings. However, these limitations do not detract from the project, as its purpose was to provide an integrative learning opportunity for students to use and apply these factors in the area of health literacy and communication. It is known that similar projects provide vital integrative learning opportunities for students (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312446771">Higgs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312446771">Huber and Hutchings, 2004</xref>), and have even been shown to improve self-reported health behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312446771">Doyle et al., 2011</xref>). Student feedback on what they learned from the project covered the following themes: the importance of good readability, and the trade-off between providing more detailed data and decreasing readability; the utility of psychological theory, and the fact that using theory made the PILs more than simply passive reading material; the importance of providing balance in the PILs – not only providing consequences of continued smoking, but also positive outcomes of smoking cessation; the importance of targeting PILs to particular audiences, with emphasis on different aspects of behaviours that are most relevant for particular demographics; and the importance of providing unbiased data. It is therefore possible that such tasks would serve to improve interactions between these future healthcare providers and health service users. In hindsight, too many PILs were included, and this led to the exclusion of one PIL from the analyses due to the lack of responses. Future work should look at a narrower range of PILs to ensure a large enough number of ratings.</p>
<p>Student reported mean Flesch readability scores indicated that most PILs scored in the standard range, as has been found in researcher ratings of coronary heart disease leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312446771">Redfern et al., 2006</xref>). Malaysia 1 scored as more difficult, and USA 1 scored as fairly easy. The fact that USA 1 scored in this range, yet scored relatively well on theory content and DISCERN ratings, shows that it should be possible for other PILs to achieve better readability without compromising the quality of content. Probably more importantly overall, however, was that when students added their own suggested theory-driven content, the Flesch scores did not increase. This further indicates that it is possible to provide applied theory content without compromising readability. It should also be noted, however, that not all changes suggested by students would compromise readability – for instance the addition of graphics to the PIL (e.g. shocking images to enhance perceived severity) was often suggested. Furthermore, although on average readability did not change, for a proportion of students readability did decrease post-modification. This then reinforced the challenge of reaching standards of effective and clear communication.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the identified theories were mainly those which had been didactically taught to the class. While students were easily able to identify theory, they were less able to operationalize it in some instances. Faculty provided written feedback on the project, and used this as an opportunity to correct misconceptualisations or reinforce excellent applications of theory, thereby providing further learning opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312446771">Doyle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312446771">Higgs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312446771">Huber and Hutchings, 2004</xref>). What was also encouraging was not only the identification of learning theories, but also the identification of theories that were not covered in lectures. This again shows that a proportion of students engaged with the project beyond a superficial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312446771">Higgs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312446771">Huber and Hutchings, 2004</xref>). Future research could involve a more detailed analysis of components of theory most easily identified or proposed as additions.</p>
<p>The DISCERN overall ratings showed that the PILs were of variable quality. Interestingly, students consistently rated the quality of the PILs as being lower than their reliability scores. This is because PILs scored poorly (i.e. rated as less than 3 - ‘Partially’) in terms of information production and sources, and in referring to areas of uncertainty (data not shown). Given the nature of smoking cessation, and the possibility of quitting without pharmacological intervention, the DISCERN questions on descriptions of how treatment works and the risks of treatment become less relevant than with other medical treatments. These items were rated poorly in the quality subscale (data not shown). As outlined previously, DISCERN does not require specialist health knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312446771">Charnock et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, engaging students in its use provided an appropriate mechanism for engaging them in estimating PIL quality – a skill that they will need to develop throughout their careers. The DISCERN ratings appear similar to scores reported for PILs on coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312446771">Redfern et al., 2006</xref>), again highlighting the appropriate use of the instrument.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have described a project that aims to promote awareness of health literacy issues and the practical use of health psychology theory among future healthcare professionals. The techniques used required full engagement and integrative learning, and therefore may have the potential to improve interactions between healthcare providers and service users. Intervening with students at this very early stage in their training as healthcare professionals maximizes the learning potential of an important issue that will be built on through their learning of clinical competencies throughout the remainder of their curriculum.</p>
