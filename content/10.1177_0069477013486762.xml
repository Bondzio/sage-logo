<title>Hypertension</title>
<p>A meta-analysis of 11 trials including 3154 patients treated with vandetanib for metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and other malignancies was performed to assess the incidence and relative risk of developing hypertension. Overall incidence of hypertension ranged from 4.2% (metastatic breast cancer) to 39.6% (small-cell lung cancer). Incidence of high-grade hypertension ranged from 2.0% (metastatic breast cancer) to 16.7% (non-small-cell lung cancer), and the calculated summary incidence in all patients was 6.4% (95% confidence interval = 3.3% to 9.5%). The summary all-grade and high-grade incidences of hypertension for non–medullary thyroid cancer/non-small-cell lung cancer were 15.4% (95% confidence interval = 3.2% to 33.7%) and 3.4% (95% confidence interval = 1% to 11.1%), respectively. In comparison, the summary incidences of all-grade and high-grade hypertension in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were greater, 21.8% (95% confidence interval = 15% to 30.5%) and 7.6% (95% confidence interval = 2.8% to 18.8%), respectively. The incidence rate of all-grade and high-grade hypertension was the greatest in medullary thyroid cancer at 32.1% (95% confidence interval = 27.3% to 37.3%) and 8.8% (95% confidence interval = 5.9% to 12.9%), respectively. A significant difference was demonstrated between medullary thyroid cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer with regard to all-grade hypertension (relative risk = 1.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-1.77, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Vandetanib therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-grade hypertension in comparison with non–medullary thyroid cancer/non-small-cell lung cancer tumors (relative risk = 2.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.26-3.36, <italic>P</italic> = .004). In comparison to placebo, vandetanib therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of experiencing all-grade hypertension (relative risk = 5.1, 95% confidence interval = 3.76-6.92, <italic>P</italic> = .0000) as well as high-grade hypertension (relative risk = 8.06, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-19.04, <italic>P</italic> = .0000). Subgroup analyses according to cancer type demonstrated similar results.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that vandetanib therapy in cancer patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing hypertension. The proposed mechanisms were related to vascular endothelial growth receptor inhibition. The proposed mechanisms included decreased microvessel density due to impaired angiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction–mediated decreases in nitric oxide production and increases in oxidative stress, and alterations to neurohormonal factors or the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.</p>

<title>Vasculitis and Panniculitis</title>
<p>Three case reports of vasculitis and panniculitis associated with vemurafenib therapy for stage IV melanoma were described.</p>
<p><italic>Case 1</italic>. A 55-year-old woman developed tender, erythematous nodules on the shoulders and upper and lower extremities 7 days after initiating vemurafenib therapy. Significant laboratory values included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (87 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (16.4 mg/dL). Antinuclear antibody was minimally positive. Biopsy revealed mild neutrophilic and lymphocytic septal and lobar panniculitis. Treatment included temporary discontinuation of vemurafenib with subsequent dose reduction. Nodules resolved during treatment interruption but reappeared on reintroduction. Vemurafenib therapy was then permanently discontinued.</p>
<p><italic>Case 2</italic>. A 55-year-old woman developed a morbilliform eruption on her trunk, purpuric papules on the lower extremities, and 1 erythematous nodule approximately 15 days after initiating vemurafenib therapy. Biopsy specimens revealed deep mixed inflammatory infiltrates with neutrophils and lymphocytes surrounding blood vessel walls and focal erythrocyte extravasation. Laboratory analysis revealed positive antinuclear and anticentromere antibodies. Treatment included interruption of vemurafenib therapy for 1 week and reinitiation at a decreased dose resulting in symptom improvement.</p>
<p><italic>Case 3</italic>. A 53-year-old man developed fevers and a morbilliform eruption 10 days after initiation of vemurafenib therapy. Evaluation for infectious etiology was negative. Treatment included vemurafenib dose reduction resulting in symptom improvement. Subsequently, erythematous nodules developed. Significant laboratory values included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (130 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (18.3 mg/dL). Biopsy revealed vasculitis suggestive of chemotherapeutic effect. Treatment included further dose reduction. Nodules resolved without recurrence.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the vasculitis and panniculitis experienced by these patients was related to vemurafenib therapy. The proposed mechanism was paroxysmal transactivation of the wild-type small-molecule serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) mediating inflammation and neutrophil migration. They acknowledged the need for further research investigating the causative mechanism.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert: QT Interval Prolongation, Torsades de Pointes</title>
<p>On March 13, 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration alerted health care professionals regarding new safety data associated with the use of azithromycin, including fatal irregular heart rhythm. Risk factors for developing this adverse effect include existing QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, or the use of certain drugs used to treat abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. This alert was based on recent studies that assessed the potential for azithromycin to cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart. Azithromycin labeling has been updated to strengthen the <italic>Warnings and Precautions</italic> section with information related to the risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes. Health care professionals should consider the risk of fatal heart rhythms with azithromycin when considering treatment options for patients who are already at risk for cardiovascular events</p>

<sec id="section8-0069477013486762">
<title>Acute Liver Failure</title>
<p>A 73-year-old female patient developed worsening jaundice, malaise, and nonspecific abdominal pain over a 2-week period while taking the medication etodolac (600 mg every 12 hours) for the management of arthritis. She was taking no other concurrent medications. She had been taking etodolac for 6 months prior to onset of these symptoms. Physical examination revealed severe jaundice and laboratory tests included bilirubin (525 µmmol), alanine aminotransferase (1400 µmmol), alkaline phosphatase (274 µmmol), and prothrombin time (16.7 seconds). Early during hospital admission she developed grade 2 encephalopathy. Multiple records of past liver function tests revealed no abnormality. Etodolac was discontinued 1 week before patient admission and spontaneous clinical recovery ensued, liver function returned to normal within 3 months of drug cessation, and has remained stable for 2 years.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient’s acute liver failure was etodolac induced based on extensive laboratory, histopathological, and radiological investigation in addition to the spontaneous recovery following drug withdrawal. Etodolac is a cyclooxygenase 2 specific anti-inflammatory agent used in the management of arthritis. The exact mechanism of action of etodolac-induced hepatotoxicity is unknown but seems to be precipitated by a specific HLA haplotype. Acute liver failure is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of etodolac.</p>

<sec id="section10-0069477013486762">
<title>High Intraocular Pressure</title>
<p>A 67-year-old female developed elevated intraocular pressure in her right eye after carbamazepine and gabapentin intake for trigeminal neuralgia. Concurrent medications included carteolol hydrochloride, brimonidine tartrate, and travoprost for pseudoexfoliation glaucoma in her right eye. Intraocular pressures of 34 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively, were measured, and immediate measures were taken to lower the extremely elevated intraocular pressure (despite current antiglaucoma therapy). To reveal which psychotropic medication was the cause of the increased intraocular pressure, she returned for 2 subsequent visits to record baseline intraocular pressure and then hourly after the intake of medications. Gabapentin was given first and carbamazepine was given an hour later on the initial visit, and the opposite was applied to the second visit. Gabapentin and carbamazepine caused a recorded increase in anterior chamber depth and pupillary diameter.</p>
<p>The authors of this case report concluded that carbamazepine was associated with a significant increase in intraocular pressure independent of gabapentin use. The mechanism of action of increased intraocular pressure by psychotropic medications is by angle closure mechanisms. The increase in iridocorneal angle may be explained by the inhibitory effects on the ciliary muscle.</p>

<title>Epidural Anesthesia Related Dissociative Paraplegia</title>
<p>A 67-year-old female patient underwent abdominal surgery with administration of epidural anesthetic consisting of sufentanil (0.5 µg/mL) and ropivacaine 0.2% injected into the T7-T8 interspace, for the patient had previously experienced monoplegia of her left lower extremity 3 weeks after the death of her husband, with no primary cause found by a neurologist. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no recorded complications or major hemodynamic changes. Eight hours after the procedure, the patient developed complete lower extremity paralysis and loss of sensation from dermatome T5 and downward. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs; however, urinary retention occurred on postoperation days 2 and 3. Loss of sensation affecting the lower extremities, abdomen, and chest, with decreased strength of the lower extremities, was observed by a consultant neurologist on postoperation days 2 and 3. The lower limbs exhibited differing levels of muscle tone. Knee jerks were reported as brisk, and Achilles tendon reflexes were difficult to observe. Magnetic resonance imaging on days 1, 2, and 5 after surgery did not reveal any evidence of physical change to the spinal cord, conus, cauda equina, and did not show edema or bleeding. Laboratory blood work was normal. There were also no mental state abnormalities, though she was appropriately concerned about her motor abilities and quality of life. Intensive physical therapy was initiated 2 days after admission. Day 14 after admission, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation unit with the ability to ambulate without assistance. Follow-up 3 months later revealed that the patient had fully recovered and could walk at a normal gait.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that ropivacaine and sufentanil may have contributed to the dissociative paraplegia that occurred in this patient. However, it was noted that both anesthetics have short half-lives and that no blood was aspirated during catheter placement, eliminating intrathecal leakage and intravascular injection as possible causes.</p>

<title>Urinary Incontinence</title>
<p>A 71-year-old female patient developed urinary incontinence after taking hydroxychloroquine (250 mg daily). Past medical history includes hypercholesterolemia, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Concurrent medications included methylprednisolone, pantoprazole, and vitamin D (no dosages specified). Pelvic echography showed urinary bladder distention, but without abnormalities. The patient was switched from an initial regimen of chloroquine (250 mg daily) to hydroxychloroquine due to elevated C-reactive protein levels. After onset of urinary incontinence, hydroxychloroquine was stopped for 4 days, with symptomatic relief. Hydroxychloroquine was restarted after 5 days, but urinary incontinence recurred after 2 days. After the second occurrence, hydroxychloroquine was held for 8 days with complete resolution of incontinence.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that hydroxychloroquine may have contributed to urinary incontinence. However, age-related bladder dysfunction may occur due to age.</p>

<title>Erythematous Hypersensitivity Reaction</title>
<p>A 57-year-old male patient developed a rash after taking a dose of rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily). Concurrent medications included paracetamol (1 g up to 4 times daily as required) and tramadol (50-100 mg up to 4 times daily as required). Symptoms included an erythematous and itchy rash that spread from his groin to his trunk and upper limbs 5 days after discharge. On physical examination, the rash was found to have spread to his anterior chest, upper back, bilateral upper limbs, and face. Pustule formation was found on the upper arms and back. Laboratory work showed elevated white cell counts, neutrophilia, eosinophilia, and negative blood cultures. The patient was apyrexic, hemodynamically stable, and did not exhibit signs of infection. The rash was found to be maculopapular, and the patient was diagnosed with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Rivaroxaban was discontinued, and tinzaparin (4500 units) subcutaneously was used as an alternative anticoagulation agent. His condition improved after being prescribed oral antihistamines, topical mometasone, and liquid paraffin 50%/white soft paraffin.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that rivaroxaban was associated with the development of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is characterized by pustule formation and erythema, with rashes that can begin at the groin prior to spreading. Roughly 90% of cases may be related to drugs, given that the symptoms can develop within 48 hours of drug exposure.</p>

<title>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome</title>
<p>A 75-year-old male patient developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after starting pazopanib for stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Prior chemotherapeutic agents included sorafenib, sunitinib, interferon, and everolimus (no dosages specified). Symptoms included acute vision loss, bilateral throbbing headache, and vomiting 3 days prior to admission. On physical examination, blood pressure was elevated at 219/155 mm Hg. The patient was alert, but was not oriented, as he could not identify the date. Speech was fluent, but visual acuity was limited to light perception and hand motion. He was subsequently found to have Balint’s syndrome. Due to his hypertensive crisis, he developed acute chronic renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and mild troponin elevations. Magnetic resonance imaging supported the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome diagnosis. Pazopanib was discontinued, and nicardipine intravenously was administered for blood pressure control. Balint’s syndrome improved over 1 to 2 days, and the patient was later discharged home in a stable condition.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that pazopanib was associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Pazopanib affects vascular endothelial growth factor, possibly increasing cerebral vascular permeability of the blood–brain barrier. In turn, this may cause vasogenic edema by disrupting systemic endothelial function. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome may be due to disruption of normal endothelial function in the brain.</p>

<title>Pediatric Acute Liver Failure</title>
<p>In a retrospective review of an observational cohort study involving children with acute liver failure performed over a 7-year period, the characteristics and outcomes of patients with chronic exposure to acetaminophen were assessed. A total of 666 patients met the inclusion criteria and were retrospectively classified into chronic exposure, single exposure, and no exposure to acetaminophen groups. The chronic exposure group had a significantly smaller median reported acetaminophen exposure than the single exposure group (31 vs 258 mg/kg/day; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001); however, these groups did not have significant differences in serum acetaminophen levels. Patients in the no exposure group had significantly higher total bilirubin levels (median 13.1 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) compared to chronic exposure patients (median 3.2 mg/dL). Similarly, low but statistically significant total bilirubin levels were observed in the single exposure group (median 2.0 mg/L, <italic>P</italic> = .002). Compared to the chronic exposure group’s median serum alanine aminotransferase level of 2384 IU/L, the single exposure group had significantly higher levels (median 5140 IU/L, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and the no exposure group had significantly lower levels (median 855 IU/L, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Clinical outcomes were assessed at 21 days after enrollment, and 68% of patients in the chronic exposure group were alive without having received a liver transplantation at that time. The survival without transplant rate for the chronic exposure group was significantly worse than the rate seen in the single exposure group (92%, <italic>P</italic> = .0004) and significantly better than the no exposure group (49%, <italic>P</italic> = .008).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that pediatric acute liver failure patients with chronic exposure have worse outcomes than those with single exposure. They suggest that acetaminophen protein adduct testing in a large cohort of pediatric acute liver failure patients may be necessary for further information on chronic exposure to acetaminophen in this population.</p>

<sec id="section22-0069477013486762">
<title>Use of a Trigger Tool to Identify Events</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis was performed on 321 veteran patients residing in nursing facilities to assess the utility of an adverse drug event trigger tool. The trigger tool contained 27 triggers including abnormal laboratory/medication combinations and supratherapeutic medication concentrations. The number of medications per patient was 13.3. Of all patients assessed, 162 (50.5%) experienced at least 1 abnormal laboratory value. A total of 99 potential adverse drug events were discovered involving 146 medications in 65 residents. The adverse drug event trigger tool had a positive predictive value of 40.1% (a potential adverse drug event detected in 65 residents out of 162 abnormal values). The number of patient charts required to be reviewed in order to detect 1 potential adverse drug event was 2.5. On average, 8.8 minutes were required to review an individual assessment. The most frequently identified potential adverse drug events included acute kidney injury (30 residents), hypokalemia (18 residents), hypoglycemia (13 residents), and hyperkalemia (10 residents). Cardiovascular medications comprised the class most frequently implicated in adverse drug events.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the modified nursing facility trigger tool used in this assessment was an effective and efficient method for detecting potential adverse drug events in the Veteran Affairs nursing facility. They claimed that current adverse drug event detection and management in the nursing home facility are inadequate.

<title>Skin Necrosis</title>
<p>A 46-year-old female patient developed necrotic ulcerated lesions after 1 week of thrombosis prophylaxis with enoxaparin (1 mg daily) after an elective hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Concurrent medications were not mentioned. Five days after initiating enoxaparin, the patient began complaining of pain, redness, and swelling in both breasts, which soon developed into multiple necrotic ulcerated lesions with thick crusts and regular edges. A biopsy of the tissue showed coagulative necrosis and neutrophilic exudate, features consistent with thrombotic vasculopathy. Enoxaparin was then increased to full treatment dosing followed by an escalation of symptoms including fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea with resultant admission to an intensive care unit. Abnormal laboratory values included hemoglobin (7.8 g/dL), white blood cells (1.88 ′ 10<sup>9</sup>/L), creatinine (1.45 mg/day), serum urea nitrogen (71.0 mg/dL), direct Coombs test (positive), a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (2.12), proteinuria (620 mg/24 h), a positive antinuclear antibody, a positive lupus anticoagulant, a positive IgG anticardiolipin (50 µg/mL), and a positive β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein (50 µg/mL). The investigation for thrombophilia was negative. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythmatosus with antiphospholipid syndrome in light of positive antiphospholipid antibodies. Enoxaparin was discontinued with the hypothesis of heparin-induced skin necrosis. However, when the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex was determined to be negative, enoxaparin was reintroduced. The patient developed a new necrotic lesion on the left lower limb within 1 day of therapy, resulting in the discontinuation of enoxaparin indefinitely. Symptoms improved after enoxaparin was removed, and maintenance therapy with prednisone and aspirin was initiated. After 6 years of follow-up with scar debridements, all lab tests normalized and the patient remained asymptomatic.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the safety of using low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with systemic lupus erythmatosus and/or antiphospholipid syndrome may trigger immune reactions that must be further studied. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and low-molecular-weight heparin–induced skin necrosis are associated with the presence of anti–heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies, which may also be present in antiphospholipid syndrome. Heparin-platelet factor 4 tetramers can bind β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein molecules as well, causing recognition by the antibody, thus explaining part of the procoagulant tendencies of this syndrome.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert</title>
<p>On March 14, 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration announced an ongoing evaluation of unpublished research data that suggests an increased risk of pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, and precancerous cellular changes in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with incretin mimetics. Data were based on examination of a small number of pancreatic tissue specimens from patients after death from unspecified causes. The US Food and Drug Administration is further investigating the data to assess the potential pancreatic toxicity associated with the incretin mimetics. Patients are instructed to continue their medicine as directed until they can discuss this new information with their physicians.</p>

<title>Development of Glaucoma</title>
<p>A retrospective, population-based cohort study using an administrative database was conducted to investigate the risk of glaucoma development during the first year after being prescribed topiramate. The data for analysis in the study were retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 from Taiwan’s Bureau of National Health Insurance records. The date of receipt of the first topiramate dose was defined as the index date. Subjects were excluded from the study if they were less than 18 years old and if they had a history of any type of glaucoma (ICD-9 code) prior to index date. There were 1956 healthy patients included in the cohort analysis who received their first dose of topiramate between 2001 and 2007. A comparison cohort was conducted and 15 648 beneficiaries (8 for every patient in the cohort study) were matched with age, geographic region, urbanization level, and the year of index date. Compared with the comparison subjects, subjects prescribed topiramate had significantly higher glaucoma rates within the 1 month (0.36% vs 0.04%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), 3 month (0.41% vs 0.15%, <italic>P</italic> = .009), and 12 month (1.07% vs 0.61%, <italic>P</italic> = .016) periods after the index date. The adjusted hazard ratios for glaucoma subjects who were prescribed topiramate were 7.41 (95% confidence interval = 2.45-22.46), 0.56 (95% confidence interval = 0.07-4.29), and 1.35 (95% confidence interval = 0.74-2.47) as compared with comparison subjects during the first month, but not during the other periods of treatment.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that there is a significantly higher risk of topiramate-induced acute-onset glaucoma during the first month of initiating therapy, with no significant risk increase in the 2 to 3 month and 4 to 12 month periods. With the increased use of topiramate, the authors suggest that this potentially serious adverse drug reaction should be kept in the minds of practicing physicians.</p>

<title>Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013486762">*</xref>)</title>
<p>An 86-year-old female patient developed a widespread rash after starting dabigatran (75 mg twice daily) and iron protein succinylate (40 mg twice daily) for atrial fibrillation and gastrointestinal bleed, respectively. Concurrent medications included carvedilol (6.25 mg twice daily) and omeprazole (20 mg once daily). Nine days after the introduction of the iron and 5 weeks after the introduction of dabigatran, erythematous macules developed on her face, torso, back, and extremities; 72% of her total skin surface was involved and she was diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome. Abnormal laboratory findings included lymphopenia (10.2%), normocytic normochromic anemia (Hb 92 g/L), low total protein (56 g/L), and hypoalbuminaemia (25 g/L). Optimal supportive care was received with fluid management, nutritional support, analgesia, and wound care. Intravenous gamma-globulin was administered (1 g/kg/day) for 3 days. Levofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and teicoplanin (400 mg daily) were also started. Her clinical status improved gradually and she was discharged in good general condition.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that dabigatran in combination with the iron supplements contributed to this patient’s reaction.</p>
