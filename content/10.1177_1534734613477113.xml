<abstract>
<p>The treatment of chronic diabetic wounds remains complicated, despite new insight into the cellular and molecular basis of wound healing and cutaneous regeneration. A growing body of clinical trials has shown that platelet release has a notable effectiveness on refractory ulcer healing. However, patients with chronic diabetic ulcers usually have poor general health, and the large-volume blood absence required to produce autologous platelet-rich plasma often causes adverse effects. To overcome the limitation, the homologous platelet gel (PG) from healthy donor was used for the treatment of chronic diabetic lower extremity wound in the study. We show here that homologous derived platelets significantly enhanced EVC304 cell and HaCaT cell proliferation and homologous PG was capable of prompting cell migration. Twenty-one patients with refractory diabetic lower extremity ulcers, who had no response to conventional treatments, were treated in this study. Our data indicated that homologous PG was effective for the enhancement and acceleration of diabetic lower extremity wounds healing. We propose that homologous PG appeared to enhance vascularization and epithelialization, which might induce a quicker healing process and and encourage controlled studies in future.</p>

<body>
<p>Diabetic lower extremity wounds are one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus. They occur in about 15% to 25% patients with diabetes and are notoriously difficult to heal because of the complex pathophysiology. In fact, approximately 85% of all lower extremity amputations proceed by ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613477113">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613477113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613477113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613477113"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613477113">5</xref></sup> The strategy used to improve healing rates is based on the management of peripheral arterial disease, relief of high-pressure areas, aggressive debridement, and infection control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613477113">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613477113">7</xref></sup> Meanwhile, new treatments (ie, growth factors, bioengineered tissue or skin substitutes, extracellular matrix proteins, negative-pressure wound therapy, and various other products) are continuously being explored and have led to an improvement in healing rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613477113">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613477113">9</xref></sup> However, a significant number of foot wounds (as high as 49%) still fail to heal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613477113">10</xref></sup> indicating the vital need for further innovative therapeutic approaches that are economically feasible and applicable on a large scale.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting approaches is the use of platelet gel (PG), a blood component for topical use obtained from a platelet concentrate activated by thrombin in the presence of calcium. Recently, several clinical trials have shown the beneficial efficiency of PG on healing diabetic lower extremity wounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613477113">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613477113"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613477113">13</xref></sup> The healing effects might be attributed to the numerous growth factors released by the platelets after activation, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-β, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613477113">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613477113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613477113"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734613477113">17</xref></sup> However, the preparation and storage of autologous PG limited its use in clinic. In fact, the repeated requests for large amounts of autologous blood from individuals have become heavy burdens on patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613477113">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>To solve the problem, we studied the usefulness of a standardized method of homologous PG. Homologous apheresis platelets, as a transfusable blood product, is used for restoring low platelet counts. As it is prepared by cytapheresis using a special cell separator, we will apply homologous PG in clinic later. We hypothesized that homologous apheresis platelets could be used for effectively healing nonresponding wounds and thus designed this study to evaluate the efficacy of homologous apheresis platelets for the treatment of diabetic lower extremity wounds.</p>
<p>In this study, we prepared homologous PG and evaluated its biological function in cell proliferation and migration and describe our experience on the use of homologous PG in the treatment of patients with diabetic lower extremity wounds graded I and II on the basis of Wagner grade classification standard.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1534734613477113">
<title>PG Preparation</title>
<p>Homologous platelet concentrates were collected with an automated collection system, a discontinuous blood cell separator (MCS-3p, Haemonetics Corp, Braintree, MA). All the platelet concentrates in this experiment were ABO- and RhD-matched, serologically HIV-, HBV-, HCV-, and Lues-negative, HCV RNA–negative, leukocyte-depleted, and irradiated. All platelet-related procedures, including the bacteriology controls, were performed according to European Recommendation NR (95) 15, on the preparation, use, and quality assurance of blood components.</p>
<p>PG and PG supernatant were prepared as follows. Briefly, platelet ingredients were separated from single-donor platelet concentrates and then mixed with 100 U/mL bovine thrombin (BT) in 10% calcium gluconate solution (CGS; 13 mM sodium citrate, 30 mM glucose, 120 mM NaCl) at a ratio of 10:1 (vol/vol) to obtain PG. The mixtures were incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 153 × g to obtain a supernatant enriched of growth factors, which were released from activated apheresis platelets.</p>

<title>Effect of PG on Cell Proliferation and Migration</title>
<p>The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and the human vascular endothelial cell line ECV304 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. HaCaT cells (1 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well) or ECV304 cells (5 × 10<sup>3</sup>/well) in 96-well plates were incubated with 10% PG supernatant produced with different methods for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Cell proliferation was measured with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734613477113">19</xref></sup> Wound healing was analyzed with a directional cell migration experiment performed in a 24-well plate (6.5 mm diameter; Corning, Acton, MA) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734613477113">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734613477113">21</xref></sup> Briefly, the bottom chamber was filled with HaCaT cells (4 × 10<sup>4</sup>) or ECV304 cells (2 × 10<sup>4</sup>) in 100 µL of DMEM medium with 10% FBS. When the cells filled the wells, HaCaT cells or ECV304 cells were plated overnight to achieve a subconfluent cell layer. A scratch was made on the cell layer with a micropipette tip. The culture medium was then replaced with DMEM medium containing 10% PG supernatant. The cells that migrated into the wounded area or protruded from the border of the wound were visualized and photographed under an inverted microscope.</p>

<title>Application of PG in Patients</title>
<p>In the period from March 2010 to December 2011, we recruited 21 patients (8 males and 13 females), aged 45 to 84 years, for this clinical trial. Patients with chronic foot wounds who had undergone management according to international guidelines including debridement, offloading, treatment of infection, revascularization if needed, and local wound care but were unresponsive for at least 3 weeks were enrolled after obtaining their signed informed consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613477113">18</xref></sup> Different stenosis or occlusions of below-popliteal arteries were existed in 15 patients. Meanwhile, Doppler scan (Philips, HD11, Andover, MA) showed that vessel was open without atherosclerotic plaque in the other 6 patients. The surface area of the ulcer wound was calculated using a Kent digital planimeter (Jayco, Westride, Australia) as previous described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734613477113">22</xref></sup> and the depth of the sinus wound was measured using an antrum probe (M-J-0314, Zhongxing, Beijing, China). The patients were assessed as grade I (15/21) or II (6/21) on the basis of Wagner grade classification standard. All the patients were treated with ABO-compatible homologous PG.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria were type 2 diabetes combined with a lower extremity ulcer that did not show signs of healing for more than 3 weeks. The patients were diagnosed with diabetes based on the criteria of the diabetes diagnosis defined by the American Diabetic Association and the World Health Organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613477113">18</xref></sup> Exclusion criteria included patients with ulcers and significant lower extremity ischemia determined by an ankle brachial index less than 0.5. Patients who suffered from infection, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis diagnosed by microbiologic culture and nuclear magnetic resonance results were also excluded. Other exclusion criteria included chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 265 M), active tuberculosis, acute severe hepatitis, and uncontrolled hyperglycemia (hemoglobin Alc &gt; 9%).</p>
<p>At the beginning, the frequency of PG application to the wounds was twice per week. The wounds were covered with an occlusive dressing that was removed after 72 hours. Thereafter, the frequency of PG application was dependent on the status of the wound. Primary surgical debridements were necessary in almost all cases. The potential immune reactions relating to the use of homologous platelets were monitored by detecting anti-HLA/class I antibodies and anti-HPA (human platelet antigens) antibodies during the last treatment, using an in-house platelet immunofluorescence test and ELISA assay (PAK-12, GTI, Brookfield, WI).</p>

<title>Effects of Homologous PG on Endothelial Cell and Keratinocyte Proliferation</title>
<p>We initially evaluated the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on human endothelial ECV304 cells proliferation. Cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of platelets. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613477113">Figure 1A</xref>, PRP significantly induced ECV304 cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The data suggested that 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> platelets/mL may achieve the optimal activity for cell proliferation and 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> was comparable to it. Considering the cost and the risk of side effects in clinical treatment, we chose the latter dose for homologous PG generation and subsequent studies.</p>

<p>In previous studies, PRP was typically implanted in a gel form with the addition of 1000 U/mL BT in the presence of 10% CGS. Here, we use 2 doses of BT (ie, 100 U/mL and 1000 U/mL) for homologous PG generation. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in time length required for gel formation between these 2 different doses of BT (data not shown). Furthermore, similar activity of the allogeneic PG produced by different concentration of BT in promoting ECV304 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613477113">Figure 1B</xref>) or human keratinocyte HaCaT cells proliferation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613477113">Figure 1C</xref>). We used 100 U/mL BT for PG generation in our subsequent clinic trails accordingly.</p>

<title>Evaluation of Homologous PG on Endothelial Cell and Keratinocyte Migration in Response to Wound Scratch</title>
<p>To examine the effect of homologous PG on cells migration, we employed a well-established wound healing assay to characterize the cell migration response in ECV304 cells and HaCaT cells. A confluent layer of ECV304 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613477113">Figure 2A</xref>, top) or HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613477113">Figure 2B</xref>, top) was first incubated overnight. Wound scratch was introduced followed by adding complete medium either supplemented with homologous PG supernatant or FBS to stimulate migration, and the percentage of wound healing was observed over a 24-hout time course. ECV304 cells and HaCaT cells reached 40% and 50% healing at 6 hours in the presence of homologous PG, respectively, after wound scratch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613477113">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613477113">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). However, only 20% healing was observed in control group with FBS. At 24 hours, the wounds treated with homologous PG were 100% recovered, whereas the wounds treated with FBS only had about 40% healing. The data suggested that homologous PG accelerated wound-induced cell migration. Additionally, the activity of homologous PG generated by 100 U/mL or 1000 U/mL BT was comparable in cell migration. Therefore, the homologous PG in our clinical trials was generated by 1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/mL of platelets aggregated with 100 U/mL BT and 10% CGS.</p>

<title>Application Effects of PG in Patients With Diabetic Lower Extremity Wounds</title>
<p>The characteristics of the patients included sex, age, their vascular and diabetes history, and the duration and location of the skin ulcers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734613477113">Table 1</xref>). All the patients were treated with ABO-compatible homologous PG. No side effects were observed and no platelet or HLA class I antibodies were detected during the treatment (data not shown). No infections occurred during the treatments. All cases have positive responses that reflected a rapid formation of granulation tissue, a remarkable reduction of pain, and the reduction of the size of the wound especially in the first 2 weeks. The rate of healing completely was up to 86% (18/21). Three wounds (patients 14, 20, 21) did not respond. Patient 14 was a 75-year-old man who had diabetes mellitus for 20 years, complicated by uremia, hypertension, and heart failure. In addition, this patient had low blood circulation and a low skin temperature on his right lower limb. The sinus on his right sole measured 7.00/0.6 (size/depth [cm<sup>2</sup>/cm]) down to the periosteum of the phalanx, with nerve and soft tissue necrosis. The wound showed no healing tendency after 7 PG treatments, and the patient finally underwent an amputation of his right sole. The relevant recovered cases are presented below (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534734613477113">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613477113">Figure 3</xref>, we present 2 cases of patients with diabetic lower extremity wound in this study, wherein complete re-epithelialization was observed. Patient 4 was a 72-year-old woman who developed wound infection after amputation of her hallux on the right foot and who had low blood circulation in her right lower limb. The wound sinus on her right sole was measured 2.25/1.4 (size/depth [cm<sup>2</sup>/cm]) down to the periosteum. After 31 PG treatments, her wound recovered completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613477113">Figure 3</xref>, left). Patient 7 was a 45-year-old woman who had an ulcerative bulla on her left foot. The ulcer measured 32.50/0.2 (size/depth [cm<sup>2</sup>/cm]). After 16 PG treatments, her wound recovered completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613477113">Figure 3</xref>, right).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the novelty of PG and its more recent discovery, several studies have been conducted on the efficacy of homologous PG in human subjects. Homologous PG only or combined with skin graft has been reported to be effective in cutaneous ulcers and traumatic wounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613477113">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734613477113">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734613477113">23</xref></sup> Herein, we found that the use of homologous PG was successful in healing diabetic lower extremity wounds. The wound had been healed completely with low frequency of the medications (ie, once or twice a week), and a greatly enhanced quality of life was reported by the patients.</p>
<p>PG therapy was similar to the natural healing of wound, with the application of multiple growth factors in their biologically determined ratios.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734613477113">24</xref></sup> The nature of PG distinguishes it from recombinant human growth factors such as rhPDGF-BB, which are foreign molecules to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734613477113">25</xref></sup> In addition, growth factors may be more effective when directly delivered via PG, allowing a slow release of these factors rather than when administered in a single dose such as commonly performed with rhPDGF-BB treatment. Currently, autologous PG has been widely used in chronic wound and has been found to be effective in several case–control studies in addition to several noncontrolled clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613477113">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613477113">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734613477113">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734613477113"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734613477113">28</xref></sup> However, patients with chronic diabetic ulcers usually have poor general health and thus the large-volume blood absence required to come to autologous PRP have adverse effects.</p>
<p>In this article, we focused on the therapeutic effects of homologous PG on diabetic wound. We first assayed the activity of homologous PG on the proliferation of HaCaT cells and ECV304 cells, simultaneously, to determine the optimal platelet counts and BT concentration. We found that 100 and 1000 U/mL BT showed no difference in the time required for gel formation and activity of the PG. Considering the heterogeneity of BT, we used 100 U/mL BT for PG generation in our subsequent clinic trails.</p>
<p>Data demonstrated PG supernatant significantly accelerated ECV304 cells and HaCaT cells proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner. It is likely that mixed growth factors rich in PRP may accelerate new vessel generation and the keratinization process, which expanded our comprehensions of the effect of PG on the wound healing. Our experience concerning homologous PG use is based on treatment of patients with chronic nonresponsive diabetic ulcers, which has proven resistant to conventional medical treatments. In homologous PG treated patients, we observed an obvious acceleration of the healing process that was reflected in a faster return to normal activities. We considered that the acceleration of wound healing as observed on posttreatment days 10 and 15 is directly attributed to the promoting activity of these factors originating from platelets on the healing process. In this procedure, platelet concentration of homologous PRP is 5 times more than that of whole blood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734613477113">29</xref></sup> which leads to multiple growth factor releases from the platelet α-granules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734613477113">30</xref></sup> The biological safety of the homologous hemocomponents is high and comparable to that of autologous ones and there was no impact on the overall costs or to routine activities.</p>
<p>In summary, this uncontrolled study indicated that homologous PG showed promise as an effective treatment modality in the setting of diabetic lower extremity wound. Future controlled studies using homologous PG are indicated to establish its effectiveness.</p>
