<abstract>
<p>Experienced HIV prevention group facilitators have a unique perspective on sexual risk reduction interventions; however, their views are rarely reported in the research literature. To address this gap, the authors solicited input from four men and four women who served as facilitators in a randomized controlled trial of HIV risk reduction interventions. During focus groups or individual interviews, these facilitators commented on issues related to facilitation training and supervision, key facilitator characteristics, and challenges associated with intervention delivery. Facilitators reported that they valued training that was specific to the HIV context, the opportunity to observe workshops and to facilitate a mock workshop before facilitating themselves, and ongoing peer supervision. They recognized several important facilitator characteristics, including being open and nonjudgmental, being flexible, and being culturally competent. Finally, facilitators mentioned that facilitating workshops was made more difficult by the many psychosocial problems many low-income participants experienced, and that facilitating workshops with men was more difficult than with women. Observations such as these, provided by experienced facilitators, can help to improve intervention training and delivery, and may increase the likelihood that interventions will be adopted in community settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The first step in developing sexual risk reduction interventions is to identify a conceptual model of risk behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911419298">Fisher, Fisher, &amp; Shuper, 2009</xref>) that is then used to guide the development of intervention topics and activities. Interventions may then be piloted and refined based on feedback from the population of interest. Once an intervention is developed, primary-level evaluations provide evidence of efficacy based on self-reported sexual risk outcomes such as condom use and number of sexual partners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911419298">Carey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911419298">Carey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911419298">Carey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911419298">Carey, Senn, Vanable, Coury-Doniger, &amp; Urban, 2010</xref>). Next, meta-analyses indicate that certain population subgroups (e.g., men who have sex with men, heterosexual women) are more likely to benefit than other subgroups (e.g., adolescents; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911419298">Johnson, Scott-Sheldon, Huedo-Medina, &amp; Carey, 2011</xref>) and that certain types of interventions (i.e., those that include skills training as an intervention component; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911419298">Smoak, Scott-Sheldon, Johnson, &amp; Carey, 2006</xref>) lead to stronger effects. Thus, behavioral scientists use theory, qualitative work with the priority population, and quantitative primary-level and meta-analytic research to develop and refine behavioral risk reduction interventions.</p>
<p>Often missing from the intervention refinement processes are “data” from interventionists (e.g., health educators, clinical and health psychologists, nurses, and other professional and paraprofessional providers) who facilitate and deliver such interventions “in the trenches” of public health. These interventionists can provide prevention scientists with important insights into how their theoretically and empirically guided interventions “work” when implemented in real-world community and clinical settings. Both professionally trained interventionists, who understand the conceptual underpinnings of an intervention, as well as paraprofessional interventionists, who typically bring an intuitive empathy for the recipients of our interventions, have much to offer prevention scientists who seek to develop and refine HIV risk reduction programs. For example, in a qualitative study, HIV prevention service providers offered researchers several insights into developing HIV prevention interventions for heterosexual Latino couples, including the importance of including men in HIV prevention efforts; barriers to implementing couples-level interventions, such as women being unable to speak openly in front of their partners; and the importance of addressing the different needs of men and women in a couples-based intervention. They also provided suggestions for recruiting and retaining men in these interventions, and recommended important facilitator characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911419298">Perez-Jimenez, Seal, &amp; Serrano-Garcia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839911419298">Perez-Jimenez, Serrano-Garcia, &amp; Escabi-Montalvo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We recently completed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating two group-based, HIV risk reduction interventions for urban men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911419298">Carey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911419298">Carey, Vanable, Senn, Coury-Doniger, &amp; Urban, 2008</xref>). After the completion of the intervention phase of the RCT, we invited these group facilitators to participate in focus group sessions with the explicit aim of learning from their observations and experiences. We believe the insights provided by the facilitators will guide interventionists and researchers on issues of intervention design and refinement, facilitator training and supervision, and evaluation of HIV-risk reduction interventions, and will help bridge the gap between research and the practice of delivering HIV risk reduction interventions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1524839911419298">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with experienced facilitators, who facilitated safer sex interventions as part of a previous RCT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839911419298">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were four men and four women (five African American and three Caucasian) who had conducted sexual risk reduction workshops with patients from an STD clinic as part of an RCT. Facilitators came from diverse educational backgrounds, including nursing, psychology, education, and public health. Several facilitators were doctoral students; others were community members who worked in HIV/STD prevention. Facilitators conducted an average of 15 sexual risk reduction workshops (each 4 hours in duration) for the RCT. The focus groups and interviews were conducted within 3 months of the end of the intervention phase of the RCT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839911419298">
<title>Interventions in the Randomized Clinical Trial</title>
<p>The interventions were guided by facilitator manuals, and followed two separate curricula. Interventions were based on the information–motivation–behavioral skills model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911419298">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>), which posits that information about HIV and STD transmission and prevention, motivation to engage in safer sexual behaviors, and skills for engaging in safer sexual behavior are the antecedents of safer sexual behavior. One of the interventions focused exclusively on information; in this intervention, participants discussed truths and myths about HIV and other STDs. The other intervention included information about HIV and STDs and elements to motivate participants to engage in safer sex, but was largely focused on safer sex skills, including managing and problem-solving triggers to unsafe sex, role playing talking to a partner about safer sex, and practicing correct condom application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911419298">Carey et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants in each workshop were either all men or all women; the number of participants attending each workshop ranged from 2 to 17. The majority of workshops (91%) were led by a pair of male and female cofacilitators. Each workshop lasted 4 hours. Workshop participants were given lunch, a safer sex kit, and a $40 stipend for attending.</p>
<p>Before facilitating workshops, facilitators attended two, 2-hour group training sessions, which covered the theoretical framework of the interventions, counseling techniques, group dynamics, ethics, and the content of the intervention manuals. Facilitators were provided with background readings and copies of the intervention manuals. They were required to observe at least two information and two skills workshops before facilitating. In addition, facilitators could, if they wanted, facilitate a mock workshop. New facilitators were paired with experienced facilitators.</p>
<p>Facilitators attended peer supervision meetings every two weeks during the intervention phase of the RCT. At these peer supervision meetings, they were encouraged to discuss any problems or difficulties they encountered during the workshops. Other facilitators offered suggestions for how to handle similar situations in the future. Facilitators were periodically observed by the Project Director, and feedback was discussed during peer supervision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839911419298">
<title>Focus Group and Interview Procedure</title>
<p>For the current research, two, 2-hour focus groups (three facilitators in each group) and two individual telephone interviews were conducted. We chose to conduct both interviews and focus groups for two reasons: (a) to capitalize on the benefits of both methods (e.g., the richness of data that occurs through group discussion, and the more candid responses that may occur in individual interviews when peers are not present) and (b) because we were unable to schedule focus groups at a time when all interested facilitators could participate. Focus groups and interviews were moderated by the Project Director. Participants responded to a series of open-ended questions about workshop benefits, structural aspects of the workshop, workshop curricula, gender differences, facilitator characteristics, reasons for participant attendance, and facilitator training and supervision (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911419298">Table 1</xref>). Focus groups and interviews were audio-taped and transcribed for analysis by a trained research assistant. Verbal informed consent for participation and audio-taping was obtained from the facilitators. Dinner was provided to participants in the focus groups.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>A modified form of consensual qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911419298">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911419298">Hill, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>) was used to analyze the focus group and individual interview transcripts. A team member read through each transcript and developed core ideas (i.e., distilled each idea in the transcript down to its core words). These core ideas were reviewed by a second team member, who made suggestions for revising the core ideas, and the two team members met to come to a consensus on the core ideas. Finally, the core ideas were reviewed by the Project Director, who made suggestions and, with the team members, came to a consensus on the core ideas.</p>
<p>After coming to a consensus on the core ideas, the two team members met to generate categories for cross-analysis. Twenty core ideas were randomly chosen by the team members, and categories were generated from these core ideas. After categorizing the first 20 core ideas, an additional set of 20 to 30 core ideas was randomly chosen, and the team members decided whether each new core idea fit into an existing category or whether a new category needed to be created. This process was repeated until all core ideas were assigned to a category. The Project Director reviewed all categories and the placement of core ideas into categories, made suggestions, and met with team members to come to a consensus on the final data set of categorized core ideas.</p>

<sec id="section8-1524839911419298" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three related themes emerged from the focus group and individual interview sessions: (a) workshop preparation and supervision, (b) important facilitator characteristics, and (c) workshop facilitation challenges. Each theme is described separately below, with verbatim quotes provided to illustrate the core themes.</p>
<sec id="section9-1524839911419298">
<title>Workshop Preparation and Supervision</title>
<p>Facilitators were generally positive about the training and supervision they received. They thought the training was very relevant to the workshops, and they liked the focused nature of the training. One facilitator said about the training,
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . that was exactly what we needed, there wasn’t additional extraneous information that we didn’t need. What we had was exactly what was going to show up for those groups. It never felt like I was completely stumped, it was like okay, we covered this, we had a conversation about this, this was in the manual.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Facilitators commented on several specific aspects of the training that they thought were useful. They found it very useful to observe several workshops, which gave them an opportunity to observe different facilitation styles and techniques. One facilitator said, “I think the requirement to go and observe is good . . . you read the curriculum all you want and you can talk about it all you want, but you need to see it.” Facilitators also found it useful to facilitate a mock workshop. “I think that’s [mock workshops are] a great idea. Practice what you’re going to do with your peers or other study staff so you can actually feel the timing and the exercises and say the words.”</p>
<p>Facilitators reported that they engaged in their own preparation before a workshop. They would review the manual prior to a workshop; most also discussed preparing before a workshop with their cofacilitator to clarify each facilitator’s roles and responsibilities during the workshop. Finally, facilitators prepared themselves psychologically before a workshop. They found facilitating the men’s workshops to be particularly challenging, and they reported engaging in mental preparation before these workshops. One facilitator reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember . . . psyching myself up before I went in, like alright, you know they can’t say something to me that’s going to offend me and I’m going to show that confidence, like I really have to psych myself up for the men’s groups.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Facilitators noted several benefits of peer supervision. During peer supervision they would get ideas from other facilitators about how to approach an activity, or handle an issue that arose in the group. Peer supervision seemed to provide both practical and emotional support. One facilitator said, “I found it very, very helpful to hear what other people went through . . . and to hear their solutions for issues that I might have.” Facilitators liked that the person leading the supervision was experienced in facilitating the workshops, which made advice or suggestions given during the meeting more realistic and acceptable. Because the supervision was provided by peers, facilitators thought it was a comfortable and supportive environment in which to discuss and address issues. “It felt comfortable to discuss different situations without feeling like, because you discussed a certain situation that was challenging it didn’t mean you were an inadequate facilitator, it just meant that you were looking for some feedback.”</p>
<p>The main drawback of peer supervision was the lack of critique and specific feedback about areas for improvement. “They [other facilitators] weren’t critical [enough]. They could have been more critical.” The facilitators acknowledged that being critiqued can be difficult, but they wanted to improve their skills and so were willing to be critiqued. Facilitators suggested that their cofacilitators could be a valuable source of feedback after each workshop.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839911419298">
<title>Important Facilitator Characteristics</title>
<p>Facilitators identified several facilitator characteristics that they thought were necessary for successful workshop facilitation. They thought it was critical that facilitators be non-judgmental, open, and accepting. One facilitator said,
<disp-quote>
<p>There are definitely times when I disagree personally with a lot of the things, well, with a lot of the lifestyles . . . but even though I disagree with it I’m still accepting, and I’m still willing to help them and work with them to reach their goals.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Facilitators acknowledged that they have biases, but that it was important that they did not let these biases show during the workshop. In addition, it was important that facilitators be nonjudgmental about sexual behavior. “Even though some of the things I never heard about, never thought about, I think we could all . . . not be judgmental about people’s experiences and make them feel weird about it.” This nonjudgmental attitude was critical to the success of the workshops, because participants needed to feel comfortable sharing personal stories.</p>
<p>Facilitators also thought that facilitators needed to have some emotional toughness; in particular, several facilitators mentioned that one needed to be able to not take things said in the group personally. “I remember being like okay, alright, ride it out, let it go. . . .”</p>
<p>Flexibility and ability to improvise were identified as important competencies of facilitators. Much of the discussion about flexibility centered around finding a balance between letting participants tell their stories while making sure the curriculum was adequately covered. One facilitator said, “You definitely had to be flexible. Knowing when to let the group go off for a bit, and when to bring them back.”</p>
<p>Several facilitators mentioned that facilitators needed to view themselves as a facilitator of discussions among the participants, and not as a teacher. They thought that facilitators who approached the workshop as a lecturer or teacher were unable to engage participants in the material. One facilitator said, “Do not come in like you’re a lecturer, or you’re a teacher, you’re imparting divine knowledge. Because that crap is annoying.”</p>
<p>Facilitators identified cultural competence as a critical facilitator skill.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I do think that cultural competence, cultural appreciation, is hugely important, because…if you don’t understand that in a roomful of Black men, that they might have some underlying issues related to their unique experience as Black men, then that’s a huge disconnect.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was much discussion in the focus groups about what it meant to be culturally competent, which included understanding that people have different life experiences, and trying to understand how those experiences may have impacted a person’s beliefs and behaviors. Cultural competence was about more than just understanding that people of different races may have different life experiences. “. . . not just in terms of Black and White, but just lifestyles in general, that people are different.” Facilitators also discussed how one becomes culturally competent. They felt cultural competence was not something that could be taught in a class. One facilitator said, “You don’t get it in textbooks. You don’t get it in a lecture. You don’t get it in a video.”</p>
<p>Facilitators disagreed about whether race was an important facilitator characteristic. Some facilitators thought it was important to have facilitators matched to the race of participants. “I think just having facilitators of color too. . . . It makes a difference to a lot of people.” Having a facilitator of the same race as participants was thought to be particularly important for Black participants, who were viewed as being distrustful of researchers. One facilitator said,
<disp-quote>
<p>That’s such a prevalent mindset, this thing to harm Black people, and the legacy of Tuskegee is so real and alive, so I think it helps to have, it gives the study more street cred. “They’ve got Black people involved, so they’re not trying to kill us.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other facilitators thought that being able to relate to participants was more important than race.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For many, I agree, it [race] does matter a lot, but it only works if they have the personality. I think beyond race you have to look at the ability to connect with people, where they’re at, whether that be if they’re low SES, being able to have the terminology and some of the language. . . .”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One facilitator suggested that facilitator race may have made a difference at the beginning of a workshop, but once the workshop got started and participants became engaged in the workshop, facilitator race was no longer important.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it [race] matters for a lot of Black people. At least they think it should matter. . . . In reality, I think it’s true that personality matters a lot more in terms of getting whatever therapeutic, clinical success. But I think for the participants, it is helpful for them initially to come into the room and see faces that are reflective of where they’re coming from.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section11-1524839911419298">
<title>Workshop Facilitation Challenges</title>
<p>Facilitators identified several challenges to facilitating workshops. One challenge they faced was maintaining study integrity by following the manual. Facilitators found maintaining study integrity particularly challenging in the information-focused workshop,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1524839911419298">1</xref></sup> because they wanted to be able to motivate participants and wanted participants to be able to practice important safer sex skills. One facilitator said,
<disp-quote>
<p>People who come into this work as facilitators . . . because they really want to make a difference in people’s lives, and . . . you’ve been taught that information alone doesn’t change behaviors . . . but now you can’t talk about any motivational stuff. Don’t personalize it. Don’t get skills heavy, and just stick to the facts. And I think that’s hard to stay to that, not personalizing in the info[rmation only] group.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, facilitators found it difficult at times to defer other needs expressed by participants (i.e., non sexual risk reduction needs, such as life stress) in order to follow the curriculum. The facilitators reported that participants had many psychosocial needs beyond sexual risk reduction, including domestic violence, homelessness, addiction, and mental health needs. One facilitator noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was hard to just let those things go because we had to stick to the curriculum and make sure everything was covered, but at the same time recognizing that that person has some needs that are obviously not being met.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Facilitators would have liked more time during the workshops to discuss and process these issues, but because of time and curriculum constraints, most nonsexual health issues could not be addressed during the workshops. Instead, facilitators privately and discreetly provided referrals to participants for additional services.</p>
<p>The facilitators found the curricula challenging in several ways. They often felt there was not enough time to adequately cover all the material in the manuals. In some groups, facilitators had to choose between completing all the intervention activities or facilitating a relevant and important discussion. One facilitator said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It is really hard to squeeze [everything] into 4 hours. Because people have things that are, I would think are relevant, and certainly other people in the group think are relevant, because they start talking about it, and you really have to say, do I let this go on, because this is a really important discussion, particularly for them, or do I say stop, and risk losing my credibility or respect, just so we can get through the intervention.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The facilitators thought it was important to be able to figure out how to maintain intervention fidelity when pressed for time. They also thought facilitators needed to be able to balance being empathetic toward participants when they shared personal stories, while moving the group through the activities and sticking to the curriculum.</p>
<p>Behavioral simulations and role plays were particularly challenging to facilitate; facilitators described this section of the workshop as “a missed target every time.” Facilitators thought safer sex assertiveness was a difficult skill for participants to learn, because people in our society in general do not have good communication skills. It was especially difficult to engage the men in the role play exercises. Many men did not see a need to discuss safer sex with their partner, because they already controlled their sexual situations. One facilitator said of the men’s attitude toward discussing safer sex with a partner, “It was like, ‘Why would I do this with a woman? Why would I ask her? I control the situation.’”</p>
<p>In addition, the facilitators found the workshops with men to be difficult to facilitate in general. It was difficult to engage the men. One facilitator reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was definitely more animated when it came to the men, and I definitely was trying to be a little more active at least, anyway. Whereas the women, I think they did a lot of the work themselves, you didn’t have to work as hard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Facilitators found it difficult to motivate the men in part because many of the men were unable to personalize the motivational or skills portion of the curriculum. “And it was definitely frustrating, at least it was for me, feeling like you just didn’t reach the men. . . . I don’t think they were feeling it directly. ‘That’s those people, not me. . . .’” It was difficult for the men to discuss their personal concerns and issues. This inability to connect with the curriculum emotionally made the facilitators question whether the interventions led to behavior change for men. One facilitator noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>When the men were involved, it was just more on an intellectual level, on a cognitive level, not a real depth, emotional level that was going to propel them significantly . . . I felt like that wasn’t going to have a lasting impression for many of the men.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Facilitators also thought that men were resistant to changing their behavior, stating, “They [the men] definitely didn’t come for any behavior change, and a lot of them didn’t leave with any.”</p>
<p>The facilitators compared the male participants to adolescents, because of their seeming inability to realize the potential consequences of their sexual risk behavior. One facilitator stated, “It’s almost an immature approach. It kind of reminds me of adolescents, where you’re not really connected to the fact that you’re going to die at some point.” The men also made inappropriate comments to the female facilitators. Female facilitators spoke about consciously trying to look less attractive in the men’s groups, to lessen the inappropriate comments. One female facilitator said, “I remember at the beginning . . . people talking about the men’s group, and I was really terrified and prepared to be hit on constantly and have to, definitely conscious of making sure I look less like a woman.” Both male and female facilitators reported being less relaxed and joking less in the men’s groups. “I found myself definitely being more guarded as to what I would say in the men’s groups as opposed to what I would say in women’s groups.” The facilitators discussed several techniques they used for group management in the male workshops. They thought it was important to set clear boundaries early in the workshop, and to have a presence that said “we’re not going to have bullshit here.”</p>
<p>Several gender-related issues arose during the workshops. The facilitators described men as having power in their sexual relationships and thought that it was difficult for men to talk to their partners about safer sex, because that was viewed by the men as sharing power. Because sexual relationships were one of the few areas in which men had power, they were particularly reluctant to share this control. One facilitator observed,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think because they [men] have a leg up in the sexual system, so to speak. Because they’re men. . . . And now we’re kind of saying give some of that up and talk with this person. . . . We’re threatening something that may be very valuable to people who don’t have control in other parts of their lives, but they have control in the bedroom. And we’re saying give up some of that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The facilitators suggested that workshops could directly address these issues of power and control. One facilitator said, “One of the things I would have wanted to address with the men was definitely their treatment of women and how that relates to them and their health, and their family, and their relationships, and everything.”</p>
<p>Related to the issue of power/control in relationships was the issue of interpersonal violence (IPV). Facilitators reported that both men and women talked about IPV as if it were an accepted and acceptable part of sexual relationships. One facilitator said,
<disp-quote>
<p>You saw that from the women, too, this apparent nonchalance, and they would almost joke about it. “Oh, you know, he’ll just take it, if I ask him to put on a condom he’ll just take it, he’ll just rape me. . . . He’ll just beat my ass, or he’ll beat your ass girl,” laughingly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another facilitator commented that the men spoke as though love and violence existed comfortably. The facilitators found it difficult to address IPV with participants because it was not viewed as a problem. “But it’s hard to address it [IPV] when you’re talking to women who do not see that it’s a domestic violence issue.” Facilitators also commented that, for women, maintaining their relationship was often more important than their physical safety.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications for Practitioners</title>
<p>Public health intervention research typically focuses on intervention efficacy under controlled conditions implemented with highly motivated individuals. Consideration of how interventions are implemented in real-world settings is deferred pending efficacy trials. However, prevention researchers realize that efficacious interventions often are not widely adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911419298">Collins, Harshbarger, Sawyer, &amp; Hamdallah, 2006</xref>); even if they are adopted, efficacious interventions may not be effective on a larger scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911419298">Glasgow, Lichtenstein, &amp; Marcus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911419298">Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999</xref>). Thus, we need to translate research into practice and to have practice influence research to improve the public’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911419298">Glasgow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839911419298">Kerner, Rimer, &amp; Emmons, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911419298">Lenfant, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>One strategy that may increase the adoption of effective interventions is to seek input from experienced facilitators about what it was like to deliver an intervention “in the trenches.” In the present study, facilitators provided important insights into intervention training and delivery, which could be useful to agencies that want to adopt this or other safer sex interventions. They noted strengths and concerns in three areas: (a) training and supervision, (b) important facilitator characteristics, and (c) workshop facilitation challenges.</p>
<p>The facilitators identified important components of training and supervision, which could help organizations streamline and focus the training of facilitators. First, facilitators appreciated that the training was focused on concepts and issues directly relevant to the intervention. For our RCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911419298">Carey et al., 2010</xref>), we focused facilitator training on the theory behind the intervention, counseling and group management techniques, ethical issues, and the intervention tasks and activities. In addition, during training the project director discussed common participant reactions and problems that arose in earlier workshops. Anticipating these potential reactions and problems and discussing possible facilitator responses clearly helped facilitators feel prepared and confident to manage difficult situations.</p>
<p>Second, consistent with social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911419298">Bandura, 1977</xref>), facilitators reported that observation of ongoing workshops and behavioral “shaping” (by facilitating a mock workshop and receiving feedback) were particularly helpful in preparing them to facilitate workshops. Observation of “coping models” rather than “mastery models” is suggested by theory as the optimal way to promote skill development and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911419298">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Facilitators should be provided with the opportunity to observe and to practice facilitating before working with clients or participants.</p>
<p>Third, facilitators reported needing preparation time before each workshop to review intervention activities, coordinate with their cofacilitators, and prepare themselves psychologically for the workshops. Organizations delivering sexual risk reduction interventions may want to allot time for facilitators to prepare before each workshop. Especially when working with group participants who have many unmet needs, when following a demanding curriculum, or working with time constraints, it is helpful to mentally rehearse and prepare for this demanding work.</p>
<p>Fourth, facilitators found peer supervision to be beneficial not only for the suggestions provided by other facilitators but also for the social support they received. The facilitators suggested the peer supervision meetings would have been even more beneficial if facilitators provided each other with direct feedback. Prevention program implementers may want to train facilitators on how to deliver supportive and constructive feedback to other facilitators, so that peer supervision maintains its function as a supportive group while also fostering facilitators’ professional growth and skill development.</p>
<p>Facilitators identified important facilitator characteristics, including being nonjudgmental, being flexible, and being culturally competent (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911419298">Henny, Williams, &amp; Patterson, 2010</xref>). The importance of being nonjudgmental and flexible is consistent with many therapeutic orientations and frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839911419298">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839911419298">Rogers, 1957</xref>), and therapists and researchers are increasingly recognizing the impact of cultural competence on the therapeutic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839911419298">Sue, 1998</xref>). Program implementers may want to select facilitators who already exhibit these helpful characteristics. In addition, the importance of these characteristics to the success of the intervention could be emphasized during training. Although some facilitators did not think cultural competence could be taught, perhaps emerging cultural competence skills could be strengthened during initial training, and further addressed in peer supervision.</p>
<p>Finally, facilitators identified workshop facilitation challenges relevant to most sexual risk reduction interventions. Facilitators noted a need to consider the context of participants’ lives and the many psychosocial challenges faced by participants that were not addressed in the intervention (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839911419298">Williams &amp; Prather, 2010</xref>). No curriculum could address all possible needs; facilitators in our RCT were encouraged to provide referrals discreetly and privately, during breaks or after the workshops. Organizations that implement interventions should provide facilitators with a list of local agencies and services, so facilitators will be prepared to provide these referrals. During training, facilitators should be prepared for the fact that participants will raise many needs that they may not be able to address during the workshop.</p>
<p>The facilitators also found it challenging to complete the intervention activities in the allotted time. The present intervention was novel in that we attempted to cover in a single session a wide range of topics that are typically covered in multiple sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911419298">Kalichman, Rompa, &amp; Cage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911419298">Kamb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911419298">Shain et al., 2004</xref>) to prevent the problem of inconsistent attendance or intervention drop out. The workshop was 4 hours long, so it is infeasible to lengthen the duration of the workshop. In the future, activities that were deemed less important or relevant could be eliminated, to allow time for facilitation of relevant discussions, or the workshop could be broken up into multiple sessions.</p>
<p>Finally, the facilitators noted that it was more challenging to facilitate workshops with men than with women. There are few sexual risk reduction interventions for heterosexual men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911419298">Darbes, Crepaz, Lyles, Kennedy, &amp; Rutherford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911419298">Henny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839911419298">Seal &amp; Ehrhardt, 2004</xref>), so there was little guidance in the literature for developing the men’s workshops. Several facilitators’ comments have particular relevance for developing and refining interventions for urban, heterosexual men. The facilitators noted that the men did not see a need to discuss safer sex, because they controlled condom use. Safer sex skills may differ for men and women; for men, knowing how to apply a condom correctly is the important skill, whereas for women convincing a partner to use a condom is the important skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911419298">Amaro, 1995</xref>). The facilitators also noted that low-income and especially men of minority race may not have much power in most areas of their lives but they do have power in their sexual encounters. Asking these men to talk about condom use with a partner was akin to asking them to surrender their one source of power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839911419298">Whitehead (1997)</xref> noted that African American men often lack economic and political power; thus, maintaining sexual power may be particularly important. Future interventions with men could take the approach that men do not need to have skills in discussing safer sex because they control condom use. However, qualitative work suggests that in primary relationships condom use is not simply a matter of applying a condom correctly; rather, in a main relationship condom use implies a lack of trust and intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911419298">Corbett, Dickson-Gómez, Hilario, &amp; Weeks, 2009</xref>). Thus, it is likely important for men to be able to talk to their partners about condom use. Perhaps before discussing condom use negotiation with men, interventionists could facilitate a discussion of relationships, focusing on power in relationships and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>In conclusion, experienced facilitators provided us with numerous insights into our sexual risk reduction intervention, and identified areas where the intervention could be improved. We believe intervention developers should regularly solicit the perspectives of their facilitators and should use this information to improve intervention training and delivery. Adapting interventions based on facilitators’ insights about delivering the intervention in the real world may increase the likelihood that the intervention will be adopted and disseminated.</p>

<p>In the RCT, there were two interventions conditions: one was “information-only” and the second was a more comprehensive “information–motivation–behavioral skills (IMB)” workshop. The former served as a comparison condition for the latter, so it was important from a methodological perspective that these two interventions be implemented with fidelity, even though this facilitator clearly favored the IMB workshop.</p></fn>
