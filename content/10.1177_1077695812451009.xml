<abstract>
<p>This study evaluated attitudes toward interdisciplinary education by appraising the Interdisciplinary Health Communication (IHC) Certificate program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a case study. Sixteen affiliated faculty and thirteen students enrolled in the IHC program as of 2008–2009 were surveyed. Although the attitude was overall positive, multiple barriers exist (e.g., lack of administrative support, registration difficulties). The faculty developed courses and administered teaching strategies unique to the IHC program. Students expected certification would translate into better job opportunities. Recommendations for successful initiation and maintenance of interdisciplinary certificate programs are discussed along with suggestions for future research.</p>

<body>
<p>In March 2007, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) launched the Interdisciplinary Health Communication (IHC) Certificate program, bringing the schools of Journalism and Mass Communication (JOMC) and Information and Library Sciences (SILS), the departments of Health Behavior and Health Education and Nutrition in the School of Public Health, and the Department of Psychology in the College of Arts and Sciences into a joint venture to further scholarship and education in the field of health communication.</p>
<p>Health communication is “the process through which one person, group, or governmental or private organization uses various communication channels to educate, motivate, and perpetuate information, skills, and behaviors that are generally accepted to benefit (improve) the health of individuals and the public.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695812451009">1</xref></sup> Early health communication courses were introduced in Departments of Speech Communication at large universities (e.g., Minnesota, Pennsylvania State, Southern California) and medical schools (e.g., Illinois, Southern Illinois, North Carolina). Undergraduate and graduate courses in health communication were then offered on national and international scales with health communication majors now available in many universities (e.g., Maryland, Emerson College, Bowling Green State, South Florida, Northwestern, Rutgers, Ohio, Georgia, Michigan State, Stanford).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695812451009">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The IHC Certificate program was initiated by faculty who saw a need to bring together the expertise of faculty from across disciplines into a comprehensive program to focus on two core issues in health communication: effective message design and use of communication channels to disseminate health messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695812451009">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The IHC Certificate is an example of interdisciplinary programs. Interdisciplinary education represents the fusion of two or more disciplines in addressing an issue or a topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695812451009">4</xref></sup> Interdisciplinary education is grounded in a need to integrate and unify knowledge of distinct disciplines as a better approach to real-life problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695812451009">5</xref></sup> This “integrative lens” of knowledge is best taught and nurtured in interdisciplinary programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695812451009">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite a growing emphasis on interdisciplinarity in graduate education,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695812451009">7</xref></sup> interdisciplinary programs are not easy to set up or maintain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695812451009">8</xref></sup> This study aimed to evaluate attitudes toward interdisciplinary education by identifying factors that inhibit or promote interdisciplinary programs and the educational activities associated with an interdisciplinary certificate program. The UNC-CH’s IHC Certificate program is used as a case study. An evaluation of the IHC Certificate program at this early stage of its development provides a roadmap for continued assessment and recommendations for educational practice for the growth of this and other interdisciplinary health programs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695812451009">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Interdisciplinary education is characteristic of innovative institutions of higher education. A number of pilot interdisciplinary programs were founded in the 1960s and early 1970s (e.g., Pitzer College, University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, University of California, Santa Cruz).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695812451009">9</xref></sup> Since the mid-1960s, similar programs have been established in health education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695812451009">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, there has been a proliferation of interdisciplinary programs in the communication field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695812451009">11</xref></sup> Specific to health, interdisciplinary programs exist at the undergraduate,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695812451009">12</xref></sup> graduate,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695812451009">13</xref></sup> and professional levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695812451009">14</xref></sup> This interest in and need for interdisciplinary health programs reflect calls for interdisciplinarity as a better approach to health practice and research. For example, the Pew Health Professions Commission emphasized “interdisciplinary competence in all health professionals” in its recommendations for re-creating health professional practice in the twenty-first century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695812451009">15</xref></sup> Funding agencies, both federal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695812451009">16</xref></sup> and private,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695812451009">17</xref></sup> emphasize and fund<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695812451009">18</xref></sup> interdisciplinary programs.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary programs are effective in delivering and improving knowledge and skills as well as team functioning dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695812451009">19</xref></sup> Interdisciplinary programs increase positive attitudes toward and engagement in interdisciplinary activities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695812451009">20</xref></sup> and satisfaction among alumni and employers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695812451009">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although universities have embraced interdisciplinarity in theory, several factors inhibit the establishment and maintenance of interdisciplinary programs in practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695812451009">22</xref></sup> Structurally, most universities have a vertical layout of discipline-based academic departments, which, according to the proponents of discipline-based education, facilitates communication among members of the same discipline and conceptually cohesive teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695812451009">23</xref></sup> This structure is not conductive for, and often resistant to, interdisciplinary education, which involves horizontal collaboration across disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695812451009">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Financial and resource limitations impede interdisciplinary programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695812451009">25</xref></sup> For example, universities are financially pressured to satisfy core, rather than elective, courses required for academic degrees or accreditation purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695812451009">26</xref></sup> The cost involved in establishing new programs inhibits interdisciplinary programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695812451009">27</xref></sup> On an administrative level, interdisciplinary programs lack a central authority to manage budgeting and planning processes, which prevents the stable growth of these programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695812451009">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Faculty who participate in interdisciplinary programs work on an “overload basis,” taking on extra courses in addition to regular teaching assignments in their respective departments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695812451009">29</xref></sup> There is a lack of role models and training necessary for faculty engaged in interdisciplinary programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695812451009">30</xref></sup> Particularly, faculty lack training in developing and teaching interdisciplinary courses and dealing with diverse students with different educational backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695812451009">31</xref></sup> Finally, engagement in interdisciplinary programs is not supported nor recognized by the administration<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695812451009">32</xref></sup> and does not count in tenure and promotion decisions, which are usually based on contributions to traditional disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695812451009">33</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-1077695812451009">
<title>Certification</title>
<p>Certificate programs are “concentrated studies,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695812451009">34</xref></sup> that aim to increase mastery in a specific field of study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695812451009">35</xref></sup> These programs allow universities to certify “their graduates have achieved some minimal level of competency in understanding and using information and skills.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695812451009">36</xref></sup> Thus, certification serves as a brand—a name, term, symbol, and/or design that can easily classify the graduates of one university and distinguish it from the competition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695812451009">37</xref></sup> Branding functions as a “promise to the customer” that the product will meet a standardized quality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695812451009">38</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077695812451009">
<title>Certification has Negatives Connected to its Adoption</title>
<p>For example, in their comments about certification in psychology, Ilgen argued that “credentialing in any field is a defensive strategy,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695812451009">39</xref></sup> and Rogers stated that certification tends to freeze professions and discourage innovation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077695812451009">40</xref></sup> Many professional communicators, especially journalists, have shunned the notion of official certification in their respective fields.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077695812451009">41</xref></sup> To many journalists, certification appears too much like licensing and thus a prior restraint. But of course, the First Amendment protects against abuses connected only to <italic>government’s</italic> infringement of speech—not to the actions of professional and academic organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077695812451009">42</xref></sup> Thus, mainstream media have long relied on the journalism degree as “a certificate of competence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077695812451009">43</xref></sup> In a survey of editors and news directors, 85 percent of new hires by newspaper editors and 92 percent of those hired by television news directors held journalism degrees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077695812451009">44</xref></sup> However, some argue, certification is needed “as technology raises the noise level to a point at which the messages of real journalists are in danger of getting lost.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077695812451009">45</xref></sup></p>

<title>Attitudes toward Interdisciplinary Education: IHC Certificate–Affiliated Faculty</title>
<p>Seven members of the steering committee and nine other faculty affiliated with the Certificate program completed the survey for a total of sixteen faculty responses, a 51.6 percent response rate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077695812451009">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the first tasks of the steering committee was to look at requirements, operations, longevity, and purpose of fifty-two certificate programs at UNC-CH as well as existing health communication programs (e.g., Emerson-Tufts, University of Kentucky). As a steering committee member wrote, one lesson was learned: “to find balance between requiring everything a student might need to know and the practicalities of not keeping them in school forever.”</p>
<p>In articulating why health communication was ideal for an interdisciplinary program, faculty wrote that health communication “is by nature an interdisciplinary field crossing borders of health, communication, media, psychology,” “information/ library science, . . . medicine, pharmacy, [and] social work.” Because of these “different facets to health communication,” “multiple disciplines . . . offer different perspectives that help to improve the focus, timeliness and effectiveness . . . of communications.” “Future [health communication] practitioners must serve as bridges among communities (health care, communications, [information technology], the public), and an interdisciplinary program helps model and demonstrate the power, as well as difficulties, in doing so.”</p>
<p>IHC-affiliated faculty had a positive attitude toward interdisciplinary education (<italic>M</italic> = 3.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.40 averaged index) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695812451009">Table 1</xref>). The faculty agreed most strongly with the statement, “interdisciplinary efforts require support from campus administration” and least with the statement, “interdisciplinary academic programs are logistically difficult.” The faculty saw opportunities for external funding as a major benefit for interdisciplinary programs. One faculty member wrote that interdisciplinary programs seem “to be a current theme” where “most federal funding agencies and many foundations are now very interested in interdisciplinary work.” The faculty wrote of interpersonal benefits, not official incentives, for their participation in the program. Some benefits included “collaboration with colleagues,” “networking opportunities,” and “joining a community of scholars interested in interdisciplinary health communication.”</p>

<p>Although the overall attitude toward interdisciplinary education was positive, the faculty saw many barriers to establishing and administering interdisciplinary programs. The faculty rated a list of ten barriers, derived from Gardner<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077695812451009">50</xref></sup> (<italic>M</italic> = 3.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.45 averaged index). Lack of financial resources and administrative support topped the list of barriers (<italic>M</italic> = 3.75 each). Lack of reward for faculty was second (<italic>M</italic> = 3.60), while student acceptance trailed last (<italic>M</italic> = 2.06) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695812451009">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>When asked to elaborate on barriers specific to the IHC Certificate, the faculty pointed out “approvals at many levels”; “too many required courses in various disciplines, [which] make[s] it difficult to set up a cross-disciplinary curriculum”; “the graduate school’s new rules that only one course toward the Certificate can count toward the core degree program in which the student is already enrolled”; and “different degree programs require different final projects, so it is hard to require that these be related to the certificate” as identifiable barriers.</p>
<p>In developing courses for the Certificate program, the faculty said they “selected a variety of offerings within different disciplines that would expose students to the varied aspects of health communication.” They took into consideration students from diverse disciplines by assessing students’ knowledge of appropriate literature, assigning “additional background readings” when necessary, and “us[ing] examples and references from a variety of fields.” Faculty also “offer[ed] the opportunity for one-on-one meetings with students to help them with skills that might be lacking.”</p>
<p>The faculty said they use strategies similar to the ones they use in other unidisciplinary courses: “primary source readings,” a “mix of lecture and discussion,” and “guest speakers.” Others include group projects, case studies, and in-class exercises. Furthermore, faculty “team students from various disciplines together so that they can share their diverse background and skills,” in what one faculty member described “as a kind of cross pollination.” In the core course for the IHC Certificate, students are required to develop a “journal of tips on effective health communication practices gleaned from the reading and discussion, [and participate in a] semester-long project creating a [health] message strategy for a real client.” Students enrolled in the Certificate program also participate in a colloquium series sponsored by JOMC that focus on health communication topics and “online discussion forums [that] foster communication among faculty and [the] student community of scholars.”</p>

As one student summed up, “[The program] introduced me to many new perspectives, got to meet lots of talented people, and feel I got a broader education,” which is “important for producing innovative scholarship that crosses disciplines.”</p>
<p>The students noted several difficulties, which ranged from “not know[ing] who[m] to contact within the department about registering” to “limited [course offerings] and time conflicts” with “core classes.” Students had difficulty registering for classes to fulfill the requirements of the Certificate (<italic>M</italic> = 3.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.44). One student noted, “Finding an appropriate course being offered took a lot more investigating time than I had anticipated.” Students also cited conflicts in class schedules and that some courses were not offered during their tenure in a program. As a result, some students had to stay in school longer than originally anticipated (<italic>M</italic> = 2.53, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.45). Three students said they would stay an extra semester, while one said he or she would stay for an additional year. Those who would not extend their stay in school (54 percent) indicated they would have to take summer courses to complete the requirements of the Certificate. Others might not obtain the Certificate although they “have taken the equivalent coursework.” “I believe the partner departments should make it possible for students to complete the Certificate within the ‘regular’ amount of time required to complete the student’s primary degree,” one student commented.</p>
<p>Another potential concern was striking a balance “between professional development and basic research,” given that the program includes master’s and PhD students who have different educational goals. Master’s students tended to appreciate hands-on projects for real clients while PhD students sought more research opportunities.</p>
<p>An independent samples <italic>t-</italic>test showed students had significantly more positive attitudes than faculty toward interdisciplinary education, <italic>t</italic><sub>(<italic>df</italic> = 26)</sub> = 5.832, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<title>Discussion and Recommendations</title>
<p>This study evaluated attitudes toward interdisciplinary programs by appraising the IHC Certificate program for graduate students in affiliated schools and departments at UNC-CH. The Certificate program was designed to build on and help collaboration among academic units at UNC-CH by creating new career, teaching, and research opportunities for both students and faculty and by attracting funding for student fellowships, research, travel, and guest speakers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077695812451009">53</xref></sup> The initiation of this program—and others across the country—reflects a growing demand for interdisciplinary health education, research, and practice.</p>
<p>The results show an overall positive attitude toward interdisciplinary education from both IHC Certificate–affiliated faculty and students. Students were more positive than faculty. One potential explanation is certification. Consistent with previous studies, students expected that certification would translate into better job opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077695812451009">54</xref></sup> Certification may be a brand that sets the IHC Certificate graduates apart from their competition on the job market.</p>
<p>Challenges remained in developing and administering the IHC program. Faculty noted multiple barriers including lack of administrative support and official rewards for faculty participation. Students emphasized the need to accommodate their research and/or professional orientations. They expressed frustration over registration and conflicting schedules and struggled over whether to extend their time in school to complete the program.</p>
<p>Several recommendations for best practices in developing, sustaining, and evaluating interdisciplinary certificate programs emerge from the case study described here. Effective interdisciplinary programs should be grounded in an understanding of interdisciplinarity and the reasons for adopting an interdisciplinary approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077695812451009">55</xref></sup> A well-developed scope, curriculum development procedures and teaching methods, and regular evaluation systems have to be in place.</p>
<p>Although IHC-affiliated faculty grasp the reasons for adopting an interdisciplinary approach to health communication, there are “differences in definition about what IHC is,” as one faculty pointed out. The scope of health communication is vast, ranging from general topics (e.g., provider-patient communication, health campaigns,) to advanced specialized topics (e.g., health communication ethics).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077695812451009">56</xref></sup> The IHC Certificate steering committee needs to define the parameters of the content area in a clear mission statement.</p>
<p>In developing curricula for the IHC Certificate program, some courses were designed specifically for the IHC Certificate, whereas others are still housed in parent schools and departments. It is important for the IHC Certificate program “to invent a new subject, not just present the old subject in a different form.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077695812451009">57</xref></sup> Attention is warranted to structure coherent courses, with clear learning goals and evaluation procedures,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077695812451009">58</xref></sup> where interdisciplinarity is stated as an objective; connections between disciplines are emphasized within, rather than across, courses; and the methods for integrating different disciplines are provided to students, rather than leaving them to make the connections on their own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077695812451009">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding teaching methods, it is important to keep in mind “not only what is being taught, but to whom and their levels of knowledge and skills.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077695812451009">60</xref></sup> The IHC-affiliated faculty attended to this issue by assigning readings that engage students with different interests, knowledge, and skill levels. The faculty tended to draw on their own pedagogical practices mixed with more untraditional approaches (e.g., online discussions). The faculty should consider other methods conducive to interdisciplinary programs such as team-teaching. This entails having procedures for team selection and training sessions for instructions on best pedagogical strategies for interdisciplinary courses in place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077695812451009">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a need for continuous assessment and evaluation of program outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077695812451009">62</xref></sup> Evaluation methods include course evaluations, exit surveys, tracking students’ attitudes toward interdisciplinary education and research,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077695812451009">63</xref></sup> the professional performance of graduates,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077695812451009">64</xref></sup> and alumni and employer satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1077695812451009">65</xref></sup> Objective evaluations of the quality of interdisciplinary research (e.g., dissertations),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1077695812451009">66</xref></sup> collaborative activities,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1077695812451009">67</xref></sup> and funded projects are essential. Continuous evaluation gauges the changing needs and interests of students and faculty, which enhances and refines long-term goals of interdisciplinary programs.</p>
<p>On an administrative level, engagement in interdisciplinary education and research should be officially rewarded (e.g., tenure and promotion). Logistically, the IHC program could benefit from administrative support to facilitate recruitment, eligibility and application, scheduling, and registration issues.</p>
<p>Finally, it is noteworthy that certificate programs stimulate interdisciplinary education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1077695812451009">68</xref></sup> Certificate programs—like interdisciplinary ones—require procedures for quality control in the developmental, maintenance, and evaluation phases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1077695812451009">69</xref></sup> Future research should address the (dis)advantages of the interdisciplinarity-certification hybrid and the differences between interdisciplinary and certificate programs in effectiveness and pedagogical practices, if any.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077695812451009" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Limitations and Conclusion</title>
<p>As in all case studies, the findings from this analysis are not exhaustive. The small sample surveyed limits the generalizability of the results. The results and recommendations may or may not be applicable to interdisciplinary health communication certificate programs at other institutions with different characteristics, student population, and orientations (e.g., teaching schools). Comparative studies with other interdisciplinary programs (e.g., Johns Hopkins University), as well as traditional unidisciplinary programs,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1077695812451009">70</xref></sup> are beneficial to derive best practices in interdisciplinary health education and research and determine the effectiveness of interdisciplinary certificate programs.</p>
<p>The IHC is a promising program. UNC-CH has launched an IHC master’s track in addition to the Certificate program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1077695812451009">71</xref></sup> IHC students are managing an online blog, <italic>Upstream</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1077695812451009">72</xref></sup> which serves as a discussion forum for health communication scholars. In the future, the program can integrate several disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, pharmacy, psychiatry, sociology, social work); introduce interdisciplinary approaches to advanced undergraduates;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1077695812451009">73</xref></sup> serve as a nexus between community partners (e.g., RTI International)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1077695812451009">74</xref></sup> and academic units; and attract external funding through “more concerted efforts and initiatives,” as one faculty wrote. The IHC program has the potential to develop into the vision articulated by some of the affiliated faculty: “a full-blown Center [for health communication] . . . with institutional and administrative support . . . [with] at least 10 students a year taking the Certificate or master’s degree . . . [and] multiple grants funded with affiliated faculty . . . [and] a training grant for doctoral and postdoctoral students.”</p>

<p>Thirty-one faculty members from across campus are affiliated with the IHC program. To be “affiliated,” faculty needed to express an interest in working with the graduate students who were earning the Certificate and be teaching relevant classes and/or conducting relevant research. Eight of the affiliated faculty were on a self-appointed steering committee who had the vision and commitment to develop a structure for enhancing health communication instruction and research on campus. The steering committee worked for two years to develop and seek approval from the affiliated Schools and the Graduate School to offer the Certificate.</p></fn>
