<sec id="sec2-1741134311433261"><title>Falsified medicinal products</title>
<p><bold>Directive 2011/62/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2011 amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of falsified medicinal products provides the first definition of ‘falsified medicinal products’.</bold></p>
<p>This Directive 2011/62/UE has to be implemented by the Member States at last on January 2, 2013 according to article 2.</p>
<p>The definition of ‘falsified medicinal products’ has to be noticed:</p>
<p><italic>Article 1</italic></p>
<p><italic>Directive 2001/83/EC is hereby amended as follows:</italic></p>
<p><italic>(1) Article 1 is amended as follows:</italic></p>
<p> (…)</p>
<p><italic>‘33. Falsified medicinal product:</italic></p>
<p><italic>Any medicinal product with a false representation of:</italic>
<list id="list1-1741134311433261" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>(a) its identity, including its packaging and labelling, its name or its composition as regards any of the ingredients including excipients and the strength of those ingredients;</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>(b) its source, including its manufacturer, its country of manufacturing, its country of origin or its marketing authorisation holder; or</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>(c) its history, including the records and documents relating to the distribution channels used.</italic></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><italic>This definition does not include unintentional quality defects and is without prejudice to infringements of intellectual property rights.’</italic></p>
<p>There is an alarming increase of medicinal products detected in the Union which are falsified in relation to their identity, history, or source. Those products usually contain sub-standard or falsified ingredients, or no ingredients or ingredients, including active substances, in the wrong dosage, thus posing an important threat to public health.</p>
<p>Past experience shows that such falsified medicinal products do not reach patients only through illegal means, but <italic>via</italic> the legal supply chain as well. This poses a particular threat to human health and may lead to a lack of trust of the patient also in the legal supply chain.</p>
<p>The new definition provided by Directive 2011/62/UE should have an effect on this increasing threat.</p>
<p>The consequences of such a definition will be a strengthening of the traceability and of the packaging of the medicinal products. For instance, the package of medicinal products will have security features.</p>
<p>Safety features for medicinal products should be harmonized within the Union in order to take account of new risk profiles, while ensuring the functioning of the internal market for medicinal products. Those safety features should allow verification of the authenticity and identification of individual packs, and provide evidence of tampering.</p>
<p>Any actor in the supply chain who packages medicinal products has to be a holder of a manufacturing authorisation. In order for the safety features to be effective, a manufacturing authorisation holder who is not himself the original manufacturer of the medicinal product should only be permitted to remove, replace or cover those safety features under strict conditions.</p>
<p>This Directive implies a strengthening of the quality of supplying and distribution of the active substances and of the medicinal products by a reinforced system of authorisation, control, criteria of the good manufacturing practice.</p></sec>

<p>Judgment of the General Court (Third Chamber, extended composition) of September 9, 2011.</p>
<p>French Republic vs. European Commission (Case T-257/07)</p>
<p>Application for the suspension of operation of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 746/2008 of June 17, 2008, amending Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (OJ 2008 L 202, p. 11), in so far as it introduces, into Chapter A of Annex VII point 2.3(b)(iii), point 2.3(d), and point 4.</p>
<p>Operative part of the order of the President of the Court of First Instance of October 30, 2008 was:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Annex to the Commission’s Regulation (EC) No. 746/2008 of June 17, 2008, amending Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, laying down rules for the prevention, control, and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, is suspended until judgment has been given in the main action in so far as it introduces, into Chapter A of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 of May 22, 2001 point 2.3(b)(iii), point 2.3(d), and point 4.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Costs are reserved.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>On September 9, 2011, the General Court validated less restrictive measures than those of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 746/2008 of June 17, 2008, dealing with the check and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).</p>
<p>France considers that the adoption of those measures infringes on the ‘<italic>principe de precaution</italic>,’ and has reproached the Commission for not taking into consideration the persistent scientific uncertainties that exist in the reliability of tests that allow for the detection of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and has further reproached the Commission for making ‘<italic>une erreur manifeste d'appréciation</italic>,’ i.e. an obvious mistake in the assessment of the risk involved for human health.</p>
<p>The General Court underlined the large power of judgment of the institutions regarding this subject and the complexity of the scientific estimates, implying a limited jurisdictional control.</p>
<p>Moreover, taking preventive measures or on the contrary, the withdrawal of or relaxing of measures, cannot be subordinate to evidence of existence of any risk because such evidence is, generally speaking, not possible to be provided from a scientific point of view, since the zero risk does not exist.</p>
<p>The General Court has concluded that the Commission did not make any ‘<italic>une erreur manifeste d'appréciation</italic>’ in its consideration of the disputed measures.</p></sec>
