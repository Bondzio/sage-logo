<p>Assessment is a crucial part of teaching and learning. Reliable assessments reflect the effectiveness of teaching methods, materials, and learners’ skills and progress. They also provide feedback that can be used to improve teaching and learning. Accurate assessment instruments can enhance teachers’ understanding of students’ performances. Consequently, teachers benefit from a good foundation in test design and interpretation, for the information they gain from assessment tools aids in their decision-making and teaching strategies.</p>
<p><italic>Designing and Analyzing Language Tests</italic> was written for two main target groups: students in a fundamental course on assessment of language skills, and language practitioners, particularly novices, for whom the book’s information has practical applications in designing tests, evaluating existing tests, and analyzing language test results. This book provides basic knowledge related to language skills assessment, and includes discussion questions and exercises for readers to practice and check their comprehension.</p>
<p>The book consists of two main parts. The first part deals with basic concepts of language assessment, test purposes and types of test. It provides a thorough overview of planning, writing, analyzing and administering languages tests, as well as analysis of test results. Moreover, the book explains test reliability and validity, and covers validation processes. In addition, various related topics on language skills assessment are explored. Discussion questions at the end of each chapter encourage readers to relate contents in the chapter to their own experience. Following each chapter there is a list of resources for readers to find more in-depth information on topics of interest.</p>
<p>The second part of the book pertains to using an Excel spreadsheet for assessment purposes. It details how to use Excel to calculate and obtain descriptive statistics, such as correlation coefficients and reliability factors, that pertain to assessment instruments. Each chapter includes worksheets and step-by-step procedures for the readers to follow and practice. As further aid to the reader’s comprehension of the tasks, a DVD that comes with the book contains videos that demonstrate how to do each worksheet.</p>
<p>Both parts of the book include introductions and summaries in each chapter. The introductions prepare the readers for what they are about to learn, and the main points are repeated and emphasized in the concluding summary. Related content links within each chapter as well as between chapters provide a clear overview of the subject and facilitate the readers’ ability to make appropriate associations.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, key terms are highlighted in bold print for emphasis so that readers can easily scan for specific information. All highlighted terms are listed in a glossary that is appended to the end of the book for readers to review definitions without having to re-read entire chapters. The glossary includes abbreviations, acronyms, and Greek symbols for those readers who want deeper knowledge of the terminology.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion this book is ‘reader-friendly.’ The tone makes it seem that the writer is talking directly to the readers, giving readers the feeling that they are participating in a language assessment class. The book is written in a way that encourages readers to read through it quickly from start to finish to gain an understanding of its contents. Topics and chapters are arranged carefully and logically from basic ideas to deeper and more complex concepts, thus making it easy for readers to follow, understand, and even gain insights about assessment of language skills.</p>
<p><italic>Designing and Analyzing Language Tests</italic> is a worthwhile book for both students of assessment and English language practitioners. While it could be well utilized as a textbook for a foundation course in assessment of language skills, it is also a useful handbook for language practitioners to consult frequently as they engage in designing and analyzing assessment instruments.</p>
<p>I was particularly impressed with the following merits of the book. First, the author uses language that is not difficult for readers to understand. Second, the procedures of language skills assessment are explained clearly. New language teachers, as well as students – especially students who are not familiar with assessment terminology – are able to understand this book easily. Third, key terms are highlighted in the text and listed in the appended glossary. Readers can quickly retrieve words and phrases they may have forgotten. Fourth, the content of the book is enhanced by the accompanying DVD, which clearly demonstrates how to do the worksheets in the book. Readers can follow step-by-step instructions while watching how things are actually done in the DVD recording. Finally, the discussion questions at the end of each chapter of the first part of the book invite readers to use critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to freely discuss the issues raised in this book and better their understanding of <italic>Designing and Analyzing Language Tests</italic>.</p>
