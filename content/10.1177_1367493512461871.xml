<p>In the pursuit of ‘parent-led’ interventions, ‘strengths based approaches’, and developing ‘partnerships with parents’ we must keep a careful eye on how effective they are. Research on the success of parenting interventions for parents of young children and newborns yields a complex picture of their success. More consideration is needed about <italic>how </italic>services are delivered, rather than on <italic>what</italic> is delivered. With this, the emphasis is now shifting towards improving the integrity, that is, the quality and implementation of services, rather than focusing on the potential impact over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512461871">Riley et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A good example of this shift in focus is a 2002 study that used a qualitative approach to evaluate a Parents as Teachers (PAT) model of home visiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512461871">Hebbeler and Gerlach-Downie, 2002</xref>). In this study, the home visitors saw the importance of their work in encouraging parents to observe the child, and providing extensive praise, not just of the parents and child, but also the siblings, and any other care givers. This intervention was planned and purposeful. At the same time, poor parenting behaviours were not mentioned to parents, for fear that this would undermine the goal of empowering them. That is to say, how parents could improve their parenting behaviours was never actually explained, but praise was given for observed appropriate behaviours. The home visitors thought that as long as the parents felt good about themselves, good parenting would ensue.</p>
<p>On the other hand, participating families said they had expected to become better parents through the programme and that they believed they needed to learn from the home visitors. They felt the programme would have something to <italic>teach</italic> them as parents. The home visits, they said, made them feel good about their parenting and the relationship with the visitor was very close, actually ‘like a friend’. However, unlike the home visitors, the parents in this study saw the home visit alone as a specific intervention for the child. That is, a visit was seen as concentrated therapy for the child which was received once a month. They reported that they had not changed their parenting behaviour much and did not perceive the visitor’s behaviour as something they should actually implement themselves. The parents perceived the home visitor’s interactions with the child as therapeutic, whereas the visitors thought they were being role models.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this study the way in which a strengths-based approach was implemented resulted in poor child outcomes. The study revealed that about half of the children were lagging behind in normal development, and that the visitors had either not recognized this or were too committed to the approach to try something new. Influencing health and parenting behaviours in more accessible and targeted ways to parents of children and newborns should be at the forefront of our work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, building effective relationships is necessary but not sufficient for effecting parenting behaviours. There is still much to be done before we start to disentangle the complexity of working with families not only through provision of accessible and well-resourced universal programmes, but also with more complex families and those at risk of abuse and neglect. Principles of participatory care practices that involve parents in deciding what knowledge is important to them are effective in increasing parents’ sense of confidence and competence, but these characteristics do not necessarily result in safe parenting and stimulation of the child. I suggest that we consider how relationships with families can be better used to enhance parenting, carefully plan for evaluating the impact of the relationship, and factor into services the cost implications of doing so. This includes not only implementation and maintenance costs but also costs to provision of other, perhaps more useful, strategies.</p>
<p>Participatory care means that there are times when we should use our professional voice quietly – at the level of a whisper. However, participation does not mean we are mute; there are times when we need to use our voice directly and clearly.</p>
