<title>Antibiotic treatment often running too long for seniors in long-term care, says Canadian study</title>
<p>Many seniors in long-term care are taking antibiotics for longer than required, according to a new Canadian study published in the online issue of <italic>JAMA Internal Medicine</italic> on March 18, 2013.</p>
<p>The study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, was led by Nick Daneman of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto. Dr. Daneman and his team looked at antibiotic prescribing in 2010 for residents of long-term care facilities in Ontario.</p>
<p>The researchers found that 78% of the almost 67,000 residents they investigated received at least 1 course of antibiotics that year and that 45% of the treatments lasted more than 7 days.</p>
<p>Most long-term care residents with common bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics for 7 days or less, the study said, noting that high rates of institutional antibiotic use are increasing antibiotic resistance, adverse events and health care costs.</p>
<p>“Shortening that tail end of treatment, at which point antibiotics are putting people at potential risk without any potential benefit, seems to be a feasible way to reduce antibiotic overuse,” said Dr. Daneman.</p>

<title>Seniors 5 times more likely to be hospitalized for ADRs: CIHI</title>
<p>Canadian seniors are 5 times more likely than other Canadians to be admitted to hospital for adverse drug reactions (ADRs), said the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) in a recent study.</p>
<p>In 2010-2011, 1 in 200 seniors was hospitalized because of an ADR—an estimated total of 27,000—compared with 1 in 1000 for all other Canadians, according to the study released March 26, 2013. The medication category most commonly associated with ADR-related hospitalizations was blood thinners (12.6%), followed by chemotherapy drugs (12.1%) and opioids (7.4%).</p>
<p>In some cases, particularly for blood thinners and opioids, these reactions were related to challenges with determining and maintaining the proper dosage, the CIHI reported.</p>

<title>Liver disease a looming public health crisis, says Canadian Liver Foundation</title>
<p>Deaths from liver disease increased by close to 30% in Canada between 2000 and 2007, according to a report released by the Canadian Liver Foundation on April 2, 2013.</p>
<p>The foundation says the data signal a “ticking time bomb” that requires a concerted effort to ensure that effective screening, diagnosis and treatment options are more consistently implemented. The report, entitled “Liver Disease in Canada: A Crisis in the Making,” urges governments and health agencies to develop a national liver disease strategy, incorporating its 21 recommendations.</p>
<p>“With all major forms of liver disease on the rise, experts are saying continued inaction will lead to a costly public health crisis with a serious toll on lives and resources,” the report said.</p>
<p>An estimated 1 in 10 Canadians has some form of liver disease, and up to 25% of Canadians are affected by fatty liver disease linked to obesity, the foundation says. Other liver diseases include viral hepatitis, liver cancer and cirrhosis.</p>
<p>According to the report, the largest increases in liver disease are occurring in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.</p>

<title>WHO considers sending international team to China as number of people infected with new bird flu strain grows</title>
<p>In early April 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) was considering sending a team of international experts to China to help investigate a new strain of the avian flu.</p>
<p>By April 8, 2013, 24 people in China had been infected with the H7N9 bird flu virus, and 7 had died. This virus had previously not been known to infect humans.</p>
<p>Speaking in Beijing on that date, the head of WHO’s China office, Michael O’Leary, said that growing global interest in the virus had prompted his organization to consider dispatching a team to China. “WHO’s responsibility in part is to make sure that we serve as liaison and linkage between China and the rest of the world,” said Mr. O’Leary.</p>
<p>The infected people all lived in the eastern part of the country, but Chinese health officials were stepping up monitoring in other regions. The virus had been detected in live poultry in food markets where the human infections occurred—leading officials to say they believed most people had contracted the virus through direct contact with infected birds.</p>

<title>National and BC public health officials reassure Canadians they are monitoring bird flu situation in China</title>
<p>The provincial health officer for Canada’s western-most province says public health officials in British Columbia are working with national and international authorities to keep a close eye on the H7N9 avian flu situation in China.</p>
<p>In a statement released April 5, 2013, Perry Kendall reassured British Columbians that the level of risk from the new bird flu strain is currently considered low. “As well, to date in China, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission,” he said.</p>
<p>Protocols and surveillance mechanisms put in place since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provide officials with a number of tools to protect public health and to deal with any threats, Dr. Kendall said. “In addition, BC has stockpiles of antiviral drugs ready to deploy in the unlikely event that this virus should spread beyond China.”</p>
<p>On April 8, 2013, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) released information to the public about the avian flu in China. The agency noted that the strain causing illness in China has not been identified in birds in Canada.</p>
<p>“While there is no risk of catching the flu virus by eating affected poultry,” added the PHAC, “Canada, in fact, does not import raw poultry or raw poultry products from China.”</p>

<title>New coronavirus could be more deadly than SARS, say Hong Kong researchers</title>
<p>The novel coronavirus that has emerged in the Middle East is potentially more deadly than the SARS virus, researchers from the University of Hong Kong said in a study published in the <italic>Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> in late March 2013.</p>
<p>Unlike the SARS coronavirus, the novel coronavirus (NCoV) has the ability to damage many different organs in the body and kills cells more rapidly, the researchers said. On the other hand, they explained, the SARS virus infects very few cell lines.</p>
<p>The NCoV first appeared in the Middle East in the fall of 2012. As of March 26, 2013, the WHO had reported 17 cases and 11 deaths—a mortality rate of 65%. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS infected around 8000 people and killed 774, an 11% death rate. ■</p>
