<abstract>
<p>The goal of Project M2 was to develop and field-test challenging geometry and measurement units for K-2 students. The units were developed using recommendations from gifted, mathematics, and early childhood education. This article reports on achievement results for students in Grade 1 at 12 diverse sites in four states using the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) mathematics concepts subtest and an open-response assessment. Using HLM, as expected there were no statistical differences between the experimental (n = 186) and comparison (n = 174) groups on the ITBS (91% of the items focused on number). Statistically significant differences (p &lt; .001) favoring the experimental group were found on the open-response assessment with a large effect size (d = 1.88). Thus the experimental group exhibited a deeper understanding of geometry and measurement concepts on the open-response assessment while performing as well on a traditional measure that covered all Grade 1 mathematics.</p>

<p>International measures paint a dire picture of U.S. student achievement in mathematics, particularly in measurement and geometry. On the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), U.S. students scored significantly below 10 countries on geometry and measurement in fourth grade, whereas eighth-grade students in 14 countries outperformed our Grade 8 students in geometry. In fact, U.S. eighth graders’ average score in geometry was 20 scale score points lower than the TIMSS scale score average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0016986213479564">Gonzales et al., 2008</xref>). For gifted students, the news is worse. Whereas more than 40% of fourth and eighth graders in Singapore and other Asian countries scored at the most advanced level on this assessment, only 10% of U.S. fourth graders and 6% of eighth graders scored at this level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479564">Fuson (2004)</xref> points out, “Increasing learning in the early grades will make it easier to be more ambitious at the upper grades, where U.S. students are considerably behind” (p. 109). To make our students internationally competitive, we need to begin addressing this problem with all students in the early years of schooling.</p>
<p>In their position paper on Early Childhood Mathematics, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM; 2007b), states that “a high-quality, challenging, and accessible mathematics education provides early childhood learners with a vital foundation for future understanding of mathematics” (p. 1). Similarly, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and NCTM in a joint position statement declared that young students need a <italic>challenging</italic> mathematics curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0016986213479564">NAEYC &amp; NCTM, 2002</xref>). Coupled with this, leading experts in early childhood mathematics and gifted education believe that young children know far more complex mathematics than their teachers generally expect and curriculum programs provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986213479564">Copley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0016986213479564">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0016986213479564">Waxman, Robinson, &amp; Mukhopadhyay, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0016986213479564">NCTM (2000)</xref> has indicated that a significant amount of instructional time should be devoted to geometry and measurement at the primary levels. This is reinforced in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0016986213479564">NCTM <italic>Curriculum Focal Points</italic> (2006)</xref> in which one or two of the three main areas of focus for Grades K, 1, and 2 are geometry and/or measurement. This emphasis also is reflected in the <italic>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</italic> (Council of Chief State School Officers &amp; National Governors Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986213479564">CCSSO &amp; NGA], 2010</xref>), which lists geometry and/or measurement as critical areas at each of the primary grade levels. However, current primary curriculum and instruction often do not put this kind of emphasis on these content areas. Furthermore, instruction in geometry and measurement tends to be superficial in nature and concentrate on lower level concepts and skills. For instance, many young students remain at a visual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0016986213479564">van Hiele, 1999</xref>) in shape identification even though development through higher levels of thinking is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986213479564">Clements, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0016986213479564">van Hiele (1999)</xref>, experience is the key to advancing to higher levels of thinking. Thus, without exposure to advanced concepts and activities to spur them to higher levels, all students, especially our mathematically talented students who are so capable, are at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>A recent area of research for our gifted education field is infusing enrichment teaching and learning strategies with challenging curriculum for all students. For example, a scaling-up study completed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0016986213479564">VanTassel-Baska, Bracken, Feng, and Brown (2009)</xref> revealed that an elementary language arts curriculum designed for high-ability students was successful in raising the instruction level and improving critical thinking in all students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0016986213479564">Reis, McCoach, Little, Muller, and Kaniskan (2011)</xref> also found that using the School-wide Enrichment Model-Reading with all students was found to be as effective or more effective than a traditional whole-group basal approach across five elementary schools. However, no such studies to date have been conducted in mathematics.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of our project, Project M<sup>2</sup>, was to create challenging geometry and measurement units for all primary-level students using enrichment teaching and learning strategies and test their efficacy. We used the curriculum design approach for high-ability students that we created with our previous U.S. Department of Education Javits research grant, Project M<sup>3</sup> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0016986213479564">Gavin, Chapin, Dailey, &amp; Sheffield, 2006</xref>) and broadened the scope of our work to target all students K-2. In this article, we report on the achievement results of our Grade 1 intervention. In an effort to situate the reader, we first discuss our prior project, Project M<sup>3</sup>, followed by the curriculum design and development of Project M<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<sec id="section2-0016986213479564">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Since Project M<sup>2</sup> was built on the philosophy and pedagogy of Project M<sup>3</sup>, this section expands on the curriculum design of Project M<sup>3</sup>. Influenced by research and standards from the gifted and mathematics education fields, the Project M<sup>3</sup> curriculum was designed specifically for mathematically promising students of Grades 3 to 5. Mathematical promise is an expanded definition of mathematical talent that recognizes and develops traditionally underserved students, such as those from diverse or disadvantaged backgrounds as well as those traditionally identified as gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0016986213479564">Sheffield, 1999</xref>). The Project M<sup>3</sup> units, which focused on number, algebra, geometry, measurement, data, and probability concepts, were implemented with two cohorts of students progressing through the curriculum across Grades 3 to 5 in 10 diverse schools in Connecticut and Kentucky. Results indicated statistically significant differences favoring the Project M<sup>3</sup> students over a comparison group of like-ability students within the same schools with effect sizes ranging from .29 to .59 for the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) Concepts and Estimation subtest and .69 to .97 for the open-response assessments based on released items from the TIMSS and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessments. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0016986213479564">Gavin, Casa, Adelson, Carroll, &amp; Sheffield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986213479564">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>, for further information.)</p>
<p>Building directly on the success of Project M<sup>3</sup>, Project M<sup>2</sup> is a 5-year National Science Foundation curriculum research project focusing on geometry and measurement instruction for all students in Grades K to 2. The main goal of the project is to help young students, including those with mathematical promise, learn more complex mathematics and achieve at higher levels by exposing them to advanced content and high-level critical and creative mathematical thinking. To do this, geometry and measurement curriculum units at each grade level were developed that integrate recommendations and best practices from three fields: gifted education, mathematics education, and early childhood education.</p>

<title>Our Philosophy: Focus on the Practices of Mathematicians</title>
<p>Having students think and act like practicing professionals is a deeply ingrained hallmark of gifted pedagogy. This philosophy is delineated in both <italic>The Multiple Menu Model: A Practical Guide for Developing Differentiated Curricula</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0016986213479564">Renzulli, Leppien, &amp; Hays, 2000</xref>) and in the Curriculum of Practice, a component of the <italic>Parallel Curriculum Model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0016986213479564">Tomlinson et al., 2009</xref>). Leading gifted education experts, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0016986213479564">Renzulli et al. (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0016986213479564">Tomlinson et al. (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0016986213479564">Kaplan (2009)</xref>, believe that encouraging students to behave like professionals within a given field allows students to better understand the concepts of the respective discipline more profoundly and make connections within and across disciplines more readily. These researchers also advocate for opportunities that allow students to use the tools and methods of the disciplines they are studying.</p>
<p>Our overall approach in curriculum development in both Projects M<sup>3</sup> and M<sup>2</sup> was to embrace this philosophy and encourage students to take on the role of a practicing mathematician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479564">Gavin &amp; Casa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986213479564">Gavin, Casa, &amp; Adelson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986213479564">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0016986213479564">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>). This emphasis on disciplinary thinking leads to a curriculum steeped in problem solving and reasoning that is in line with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0016986213479564">NCTM Process Standards (2000)</xref> and the CCSSM Mathematical Practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986213479564">CCSSO &amp; NGA, 2010</xref>). With this philosophy at the heart of our program, we used recommendations from mathematics education and early childhood education research to compliment the gifted education approach and used all to inform the geometry and measurement content and the mathematical practices included in the units.</p>

<sec id="section5-0016986213479564">
<title>Key Characteristics</title>
<p>There are five key characteristics that carry out our philosophy of having students embody the practices of a mathematician. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0016986213479564">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the rationale behind these characteristics and how the gifted, mathematics, and early childhood education fields influenced these decisions. The characteristics include a focus on important and advanced mathematics, depth of understanding and complexity, differentiated instruction, mathematical communication, and a nurturing classroom environment.

<p>As in the Project M<sup>3</sup> units, the content for the Project M<sup>2</sup> units identifies significant mathematical concepts, following the guidelines of the Core Curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0016986213479564">Tomlinson et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the ways in which students are positioned to make sense of the mathematics is beyond what is typically expected of students at this grade level.

<title>Depth of understanding and complexity</title>
<p>The U.S. mathematics curriculum has long been criticized for being a “mile wide and an inch deep” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986213479564">CCSSO &amp; NGA, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479564">Fuson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0016986213479564">Schmidt, Wang, &amp; McNight, 2005</xref>). Conversely, taking our cue from gifted education experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0016986213479564">Kaplan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0016986213479564">Tomlinson et al., 2009</xref>), we took an approach that would allow students to study the mathematics in depth and realize the complexity between concepts. For example, students not only use Venn diagrams to describe and sort shapes but are also exposed to two other ways to model the relationships among shapes, namely, tree diagrams and Carroll diagrams. With a tree diagram, students can focus on one attribute of a shape at a time (e.g., a black triangle goes on the black branch and then it goes on the triangle branch; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0016986213479564">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentiated instruction</title>
<p>If the units are advanced, how then do we meet the needs of all students in the class? The authors focused on writing advanced curriculum that raises the bar beyond what is typical at the grade level and provides resources for teachers to differentiate the lessons. We believe that the rigor and level of challenge is much higher for <italic>all</italic> students when advanced material is developed. Furthermore, differentiating advanced curriculum for support to accommodate learners’ needs rather than trying to differentiate typical curriculum to motivate and challenge talented students helps ensure that the curriculum is indeed challenging enough for them.</p>
<p>Each lesson offers specific suggestions to differentiate the learning experiences for students needing extra support and greater challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0016986213479564">Tieso, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0016986213479564">Tomlinson &amp; Eidson, 2003</xref>). To make Project M<sup>2</sup> accessible to all students, we have employed more extensive differentiation than in our Project M<sup>3</sup> curriculum. As in Project M<sup>3</sup>, where we had a strong emphasis on meeting the needs of traditionally underserved mathematically promising students, we provide Hint Cards in each lesson to help students who do not have the necessary background or prior experiences to move forward in their mathematical thinking. Moreover, we added a section titled “Supporting Students” with suggestions about how to scaffold learning and strengthen conceptual understanding for students who struggle (e.g., create a boundary outside the Venn diagram loops so students can make note of what shapes do not have the given properties). To challenge our most talented learners, we include “Think Beyond” questions that focus on even more advanced mathematics and require high levels of critical and creative thinking (e.g., have students apply their understanding of two-loop Venn diagrams by composing a three-loop diagram).</p>

<title>Mathematical communication</title>
<p>In an effort to encourage students to mimic the role of practicing mathematicians at a personally challenging level, students were encouraged to communicate in both verbal and written forms to make meaning of the mathematics. Teachers used talk moves adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0016986213479564">Chapin, O’Connor, and Anderson (2009)</xref> to facilitate discussion among students, including repeat and check (rephrase another students’ idea, then have the student confirm that his or her intention was understood); add on (expand an idea); agree, disagree, and why (debate and provide reasoning); wait time (take a moment to organize your thoughts); and partner talk (begin to make sense of your own ideas and exchange thoughts). Furthermore, to aid in more precise mathematical exchanges, the learning of mathematical vocabulary was infused throughout the unit. For instance, word wall cards that included important terms and a corresponding card depicting several different representations of the term (e.g., several different types of triangles in different orientations) helped address student misconceptions. The use of a talk frame helped bring attention to the verbal communication while making connections for students to the writing component. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0016986213479564">Figure 4</xref>, the <italic>talk frame</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986213479564">Casa, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0016986213479564">Williams &amp; Casa, 2011/2012</xref>) is a graphic organizer on the board that has teachers take notes on student ideas as the class makes sense of the mathematics.</p>

<italic>Classroom Rights and Obligations</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986213479564">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>) to be more explicit for primary-level students with respect to their roles as speakers, listeners, and writers of mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986213479564">Gavin et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0016986213479564">2012b</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<p>The purposes of the study reported in this article specifically addressed the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0016986213479564" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Is there an increase in mathematics achievement, as measured by the ITBS mathematics subtest and the open-response assessment for the Grade 1 intervention group after exposure to the Project M<sup>2</sup> units?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Is there a difference between the Grade 1 intervention and comparison groups with respect to mathematics achievement, as measured by the ITBS mathematics subtest and the open-response assessment?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The school-based context of the study required a quasi-experimental design. Our hypotheses for each of the research questions were as follows. First, the mathematics achievement for the Project M<sup>2</sup> Grade 1 intervention group would be significantly higher after exposure to the Project M<sup>2</sup> units as measured by both the ITBS mathematics subtest and the open-response assessment (further description subsequently provided). Second, since our units on geometry and measurement were longer than what is typically devoted to these topics, and these topics represented only 3 out of the 35 questions on the ITBS mathematics concepts subtest, we did not expect the intervention group to outscore the comparison group on this test. Rather, we hypothesized that the mathematics achievement for the Project M<sup>2</sup> Grade 1 intervention group would be as high as the comparison group on this measure. Finally, we hypothesized that the mathematics achievement for the Project M<sup>2</sup> Grade 1 intervention group would be significantly higher than the comparison group, as measured by the open-response assessment that focused on geometry and measurement concepts.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The 24 classrooms selected to participate in the study included 10 in Connecticut, 6 in Kentucky, and 4 each in South Carolina and Texas. These classrooms provided a diverse student population based on gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and learning needs (i.e., need for support in mathematics beyond the regular classroom; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986213479564">Table 2</xref>). Pairs of Grade 1 teachers from each school site agreed to participate in the study. One teacher from each of these pairs was randomly assigned to teach the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 186), and the other was assigned to teach the comparison group (<italic>n</italic> = 174). The intervention teachers attended a 4-day workshop in the summer and a 1-day session before each unit during the school year. Professional development staff visited each classroom once a week across the approximate 12 weeks of the intervention to document fidelity of implementation including adherence to the unit content and instructional strategies.</p>

<p>Except for English-language learner (ELL) status, the proportion of students for each demographic variable did not significantly vary between experimental and comparison groups. There were significantly more ELL students in the comparison group due to the fact that one class was created as a bilingual class with some students learning English and some learning Spanish. The school reported that 100% of these students were in an ELL class, although approximately half of these students had English as their first language. Note that this did not influence the group equivalence at pretesting.

<title>Data Collection and Outcome Measures</title>
<p>Quantitative data related to the mathematics achievement of the Grade 1 students in the intervention and comparison groups were collected using two outcome measures. These included the mathematics subscale of the ITBS and a researcher-developed open-response assessment. Both assessments were administered by members of the research team to the intervention and comparison groups at the beginning and end of the 2009-2010 academic year.</p>
<sec id="section14-0016986213479564">
<title>Mathematics subscale of the ITBS</title>
<p>An aim of the study was to determine the overall sense of the impact of the units, and a nationally normed standardized assessment would allow for an objective investigation. Such readily available tests provide an overall assessment of students’ mathematics achievement. We selected the mathematics subscale of the ITBS, Level 6, Form A. Our goal was to investigate whether extended time invested in geometry and measurement, topics often minimized in the primary grades, would hinder the learning and achievement of other Grade 1 mathematics concepts such as number and operations. The ITBS is a norm-referenced standardized measure of mathematics achievement across mathematics content areas that includes number and operations, geometry, measurement, and data analysis and probability for Grade 1. The reported internal consistency reliability is .793 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0016986213479564">ITBS, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0016986213479564">
<title>Open-response assessment</title>
<p>Given the nature of the ITBS as a more general mathematics assessment, it also was important to evaluate more specifically measurement and geometry content and our pedagogical approach that included having students develop their mathematical reasoning as expressed through their writing. At the time of the study, we were unaware of any commercially available open-response assessments addressing higher-level concepts in the areas of geometry and measurement with adequate psychometric properties for students in the primary grades. Thus, we were obligated to create an assessment along with a scoring rubric to measure students’ mathematics achievement using an open-ended response format. Items for the open-response assessment similar in nature to geometry and measurement open-response questions on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and state mastery tests were developed in the Fall of 2008 and sent out for content validation by mathematics professors, mathematics and gifted educators, and primary and gifted teachers. The reviewers evaluated each of the items to identify the mathematics content area the item assessed (geometry or measurement), the relevance of the item to assess students’ knowledge of the specified mathematics content area, and the level of difficulty of each of the items. The ratings from the reviewers were analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine which items would be included in the pilot version of the open-response assessment instrument. During the Spring of 2009, the pilot version of the open-response assessment was administered to both students who had engaged in the pilot of the curriculum and those who had not. The results of this pilot test were analyzed and revisions were made, as necessary. Revisions that were needed involved mostly clarification of wording in the directions for students during the administration of the assessment.</p>
<p>Additionally, a rubric, which would serve as the scoring guide for the open-response assessment, was developed and refined. Each open-response item was awarded a specific number of points based on the different components of the question, the level of difficulty of each component, and the varied levels of understanding. The rubric was revised four times throughout the pilot phase of the study while various members of the research team evaluated responses from students who were learning from the Project M<sup>2</sup> pilot units and a like-ability group of students not exposed to the curriculum.</p>
<p>The revised pilot test and rubric served as the Project M<sup>2</sup> Grade 1 open-response assessment instrument. The open-response assessment was administered to the 24 classes of field-test intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and comparison groups (<italic>n</italic> = 12). The open-response assessment was double-scored by members of the research team trained in scoring the assessment using the rubric. There was 95% agreement between the two scores for all the items. Any item for which there was a discrepancy between the two scores was scored independently by a third member of the research team. The final score reflected an internal consistency of the Grade 1 open-response assessment to be .79.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To address Research Question 1, the intervention group data collected using the mathematics subscale of the ITBS and the open-response assessment were analyzed using paired <italic>t</italic> tests. This analysis was conducted to determine if the difference in mathematics achievement for students in the intervention group was significantly higher at posttest, as compared with pretest, on the two mathematics achievement outcomes. Significance was determined based on the &lt;.001 Type I error rate.</p>
<p>To address Research Question 2, investigating the differences in mathematics achievement between the intervention and comparison groups using the ITBS and open-response assessment, analyses of the data were conducted using two series of two-level hierarchical linear models (HLM) version 6.06 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0016986213479564">Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, Congdon, &amp; du Toit, 2004</xref>). HLM was used due to the fact that students were nested within classrooms and therefore to account for the nonindependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0016986213479564">McCoach &amp; Adelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0016986213479564">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>) of students on the dependent variables for each series of two-level models: the students’ scaled scores for the ITBS at posttest and students’ total scores for the open-response assessment at posttest. The restricted maximum likelihood estimation method was used to conduct the analyses due to the Level 2 sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0016986213479564">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>For each of the series of HLMs, the first model analyzed was the unconditional model. This model only contained the dependent variable at Level 1, and the results were used to estimate each model’s intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which is a measure of the proportion of variance between classes. In educational research, ICCs of between .10 and .20 are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0016986213479564">McCoach, 2010</xref>). The random coefficients model was specified and analyzed next. To adjust for student’s prior knowledge and any differences between the intervention and comparison groups prior to the intervention, students’ scores at pretest (grand mean centered) on the respective assessment were included in the model as a Level 1 covariate. The proportion of variance explained by this covariate was calculated. The final model to be specified was the contextual model. The treatment variable, coded 1 for the intervention group and 0 for the comparison group, was included in the models as a Level 2 predictor, since teachers were randomly assigned to the intervention or the comparison groups.</p>

<p>The coefficients were interpreted based on this model and the method of coding the variables, as previously stated. γ<sub>00</sub> was the predicted student score on the post-ITBS for a student in the comparison group who scored at the mean on the pre-ITBS. γ<sub>10</sub> was the predicted effect of the pre-ITBS score; for every 1-point increase in the pre-ITBS score, a student’s post-ITBS score was predicted to increase by 0.91. γ<sub>01</sub> is the parameter of interest to the research question and represents the predicted effect of being in the intervention or comparison group. In this case, the predicted post-ITBS score for a student in the intervention group would be 3.16 points higher than the comparison group after adjusting for the pre-ITBS score. This difference is not statistically significant. Therefore, based on the results of the contextual model, there was no difference in the post-ITBS scores between the intervention and comparison groups.</p>

<p>The parameter estimates for the full contextual model were analyzed to determine statistical significance and interpreted. γ<sub>00</sub> is the predicted student score on the post open-response assessment for a student in the comparison group who scored at the mean on the pre open-response assessment. γ<sub>10</sub> is the predicted effect of the pre open-response assessment score and is a significant predictor. For every 1-point increase in the pre open-response assessment score, a student’s post score is predicted to increase by 8.66. The parameter of interest for the research question is γ<sub>01</sub>, which represents the predicted effect of being in the intervention or comparison group on the post open-response assessment score after adjusting for the pre open-response assessment score. In this study, it would be predicted that the post open-response assessment score for a student in the intervention group would be 6.31 points higher than a student in the comparison group after adjusting for the pre open-response assessment score. This is a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>In summary, the results of the HLM analyses indicate that there was not a statistically significant difference between the intervention and comparison groups on the post-ITBS. However, the difference between the intervention and comparison groups was statistically significant on the post open-response assessment.

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that advanced geometry and measurement units from Project M<sup>2</sup> that infuse gifted, mathematics, and early childhood education tenets had a positive impact on Grade 1 students’ achievement in these areas. Large effect sizes in favor of the intervention group were found on the open-response assessment. This may have practical implications for students being able to engage in and successfully solve mathematical problem-solving tasks as well as being able to explain their reasoning process and defend their solutions. As purported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0016986213479564">NCTM (2000)</xref> and the CCSS for mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986213479564">CCSSO &amp; NGA, 2010</xref>), this is a primary purpose for studying mathematics. Although open-response items are not the focus of most state tests and standardized assessments used in schools today, that is going to change shortly and radically with the new CCSS assessments. On these new assessments, students are required to solve open-ended problems and justify their solutions in writing. As gifted educators in STEM, our standards and expectations have always exceeded the current school assessments, and it is refreshing to see and relevant to the results of this study that the new assessments will raise standards to a higher level. The results of the ITBS, which focuses mainly on number, indicated no difference between groups, which is what the researchers hypothesized. This implies that although an extensive period (12 weeks) was allotted to geometry and measurement instruction, students did as well as the comparison group on a standardized test that assessed learning of Grade 1 mathematics concepts. The results of this study provide “proof of concept” (NCTM, 2007a, p. 2) support for the efficacy of the Project M<sup>2</sup> first-grade units.</p>
<p>Although the scope of the current study does not include an examination of which features are responsible for influencing these outcomes, we conjecture which ones are the most salient. First, we believe that challenging mathematics with a focus on complex tasks that require students to reason at high levels was an essential component. Second, instructional strategies that encourage students consistently to explain their reasoning both verbally and in writing was another important element. We believe that integrating instructional strategies with mathematics content should be an integral component of curriculum. Recently, the advent of the <italic>Common Core State Standards</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986213479564">CCSSO &amp; NGA, 2010</xref>) has brought attention to the critical need to integrate the mathematical content that students should learn together with the process by which they should learn it; this, in fact, was foundational to the development of our curriculum. Thus, we believe that challenging mathematics explored in depth coupled with teaching strategies together as a package may be primarily responsible for the study’s findings. Features of the study that strengthen the results include the use of random assignment of teachers to experimental or comparison group, a comparison group from the same schools that were equated on the preassessments to the experimental group, and the use of HLM to account for class differences.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that prior to the Grade 1 implementation, which is the subject of this article, Project M<sup>2</sup> created and field-tested Grade 2 units. The results for the Grade 2 intervention mirrored these Grade 1 results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0016986213479564">Gavin, Casa, Adelson, &amp; Firmender, in press</xref>). Pre/post ITBS and open-response assessments results showed highly significant gains for the intervention group. There were no significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups on the ITBS math subtest, which again focused heavily on number. However, there were highly significant differences on the open-response scores with a large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.89).</p>
<p>Professional development was an important part of the intervention process. Although professional development is imperative for the successful implementation of all new curriculum materials, the weekly presence of project team members necessary during the initial field-testing phase to ensure fidelity of implementation is not reflective of typical classroom practice. However, as a result of our work with teachers during the classroom implementation, we were able to incorporate into the units specific teaching suggestions (e.g., what to look for in responses to Think Deeply questions, possible difficulties students might have and how to address them, and tips on implementing the talk moves) that normally would be part of a professional development session. This may lessen the amount of professional development needed to successfully implement the units. However, the amount of professional development in the study and the small number of classrooms limit generalizability.</p>
<p>The overall findings in this study complement other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0016986213479564">Reis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0016986213479564">Van Tassel-Baska et al., 2009</xref>) in which gifted education researchers used enrichment teaching and learning for all students and found academic success. The Project M<sup>2</sup> study is the first of this kind addressing the primary grades as well as mathematics. Our future studies will report on the achievement of kindergarten students using Project M<sup>2</sup> units to see if the results are similar for these young children. Further research in raising the bar for all students by increasing challenge with the use of gifted education curriculum and instructional strategies is warranted.</p>
<p>In addition, based on the research success we have experienced with the 12 curriculum units in our prior Project M<sup>3</sup>, we are encouraged to create additional primary units using our approach of challenging content with an emphasis on students acting like practicing mathematicians. We believe that it is possible to develop a complete primary mathematics curriculum that is “a mile deep” rather than “a mile wide” with more time on fewer topics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0016986213479564" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we have found that the coupling of exemplary instructional practices in gifted education with advanced standards-based mathematics curriculum has enabled all students to gain a much richer and more complex understanding of geometry and measurement concepts with a significantly greater ability to explain their reasoning than their counterparts in the comparison groups. Thus, these new curriculum units contribute to raising student achievement and provide high-level materials for young students in these areas. Given the relevance and practical use of geometry and measurement in students’ daily lives and the current poor international performance of our students, curriculum that promotes advanced thinking in these areas becomes even more important.</p>
