<p>‘It is the province of knowledge to speak and it is the privilege of wisdom to listen’ (from <italic>The Professor at the Breakfast Table</italic>, chapter 1, Oliver Wendell Holmes, 1809–1894)</p></disp-quote>
<p>This book on practical deliberations in the people professions has been formed from 15 contributions in three equally balanced parts which relate to practical wisdom and the need to communicate it between professions; to the personal and affective dimensions; and to legislation, regulation and judgement.</p>
<p>Each of the four editors from different subject areas within the University of Edinburgh contributes a chapter which draws on their own experience within either education, social work, counselling, or the Ministry. The book begins by two of the editors, although in different departments and separate fields of study of education and social work, realizing by talking to each other, that each field of study has overlapping concerns. These concerns lead to talking about moral and ethical considerations. In fact, it is the essence of the book that such values should be central in education and training in the people professions rather than basing training on specific scientific approaches. Accepting that this should be so means that the focus should be on empathy, care, support, continuity and a close relationship within clients’ social and psychological settings. In addition, practitioners would need to have insight into their own feelings and have allotted space to share these within a built in tutorial system and as part of supervision, both within placements and later in practice. Apart from the editors’ own background, this is shown to apply to nursing, practical theology, and to volunteers, child law consultants and therapists. Indeed, each of the other chapters has a value for the reader in professional training and practice.</p>
<p>After the two colleagues crossed the boundaries of the two different departments further talking crossed over national boundaries to Canada. This led to an International Conference in 2008, in Edinburgh, where the ‘virtue’ ethics of caring, supporting and sympathetic understanding of the situations that confront nurses, social workers, teachers, pastors and counsellors were put forward. The Conference, in turn, led to this much-needed book where the papers therein reach an even greater number in settings where practitioners realize their own feelings and emotions surfacing when the patient or client or user – individual or family – draw upon the service sought, or are offered it by others. The authors constructively consider how such affective qualities arise spontaneously and may be realised, shared and discussed.</p>
<p>Some of the chapters introduce the reader to other concepts. Dunne’s contribution faces the fact that many practitioners have missed, in their own training, a basic understanding of philosophy. A brief history of practical wisdom is shown to stem from Aristotelian phronesis. The reader meets new words to define and use which may help when, in turn, new clients and users are met who need understanding and the application of wisdom. Time and a ‘thinking space’ is part of the process, too.</p>
<p>Further reflections are considered on Aristotelian thought put forward by Kristján Kristjánsson. Elizabeth Campbell also puts forward the case for pre-professional training in philosophy, where moral and ethical consideration could then underpin later practice. Chris Clark contributes a chapter on evidence-based practice which he sees as ‘mute’ on moral grounds but even so he recognises that wisdom also has ‘strengths and limitations’. However, the quality and existence of a degree course, particularly in nursing or social work could be seen to depend on peer reviewed, evidence-based research papers. Without such publications there are examples leading to the closure of people profession courses, especially in health and social work.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the case put forward in this book on professional wisdom will be taken into account by those who determine the closure or continuation of professional degree courses. It is a book that should be taken to heart.</p>
