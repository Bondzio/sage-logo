<p>From its beginning in 1993, this journal was ‘intended to act as a forum for research on childhood and children, as a forum where disciplines can meet, where findings can be presented and where new understandings and new perspectives can be generated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568212461592">Frønes, 1993</xref>). By providing a meeting-place for researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds, the journal would assist in developing the study of children and childhood into a multidisciplinary field and, with increasing familiarity with the work of others and enhanced collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, even towards interdisciplinarity. In his editorial to the first issue of <italic>Childhood</italic>, the journal’s first editor Ivar Frønes noted that ‘we could already speak of such disciplinary subfields as the sociology, the anthropology and the history of childhood’, and that ‘considerations of childhood and children were beginning to come to the front also in other disciplines, such as economics and political science’. (Developmental psychology is of course the oldest among ‘childhood disciplines’ within the social sciences, and did not get a mention in Frønes’ short list of emerging ‘new’ childhood disciplines.)</p>
<p>In 2012, as the journal will soon start its 20th volume, the field of childhood studies seems to have become a truly multidisciplinary one. Today the field is populated not only by psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and historians, but also by geographers, philosophers, ethicists, economists, and many more. The recognition is that that childhood and ‘the child’ are indeed complex phenomena; understanding them properly, and not just partially, compels any disciplinarian to consult researchers from other disciplinary fields, and to develop efficient forms of communication and collaboration with them. The goal would be to integrate the central guiding vision(s) of the social study of childhood with compatible notions of children and childhood originating in other major disciplines concerned with children: an integrated, overarching framework for interdisciplinary childhood research.</p>
<p>How far are we from reaching such a goal? Or even from establishing and solidifying links of meaningful communication and collaboration with colleagues in other disciplines, to start with?</p>
<p>Many of us already seem to describe the field as an <italic>inter</italic>disciplinary field of study (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568212461592">Thorne, 2007</xref>). Frequently – and increasingly so in recent years – one can read in articles published in <italic>Childhood</italic> mentions such as the ‘growing body of interdisciplinary childhood studies’ or the ‘interdisciplinary umbrella of childhood studies’. But also arguments are being made to the effect that childhood studies would now need to start engaging in a conversation across disciplinary boundaries and to start working to make the field genuinely interdisciplinary (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568212461592">Morrow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568212461592">Prout, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568212461592">1</xref></sup> In preparing ourselves for a true beginning we need to ask questions that Barrie Thorne raised in her editorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568212461592">2007</xref>) on what this claim of the field’s interdisciplinarity might mean. What animates scholars and practitioners to move across traditional disciplinary boundaries? What are the grounds for fruitful interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration in the study of children and childhood?</p>
<p>There is a widespread belief that interdisciplinary research is a good thing and something to strive for. Interdisciplinarity has had, for some time already, a high priority for science policy and research funding, and it is also a growth area in studies on knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568212461592">Jacobs and Frickel, 2009</xref>). A central reason for the goodness and significance of interdisciplinarity is that it is believed to push the frontiers of knowledge forward and create knowledge that helps to solve the problems of the world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568212461592">Weingart, 2000</xref>). Many of the problems that we face today, also as objects of research, appear to be highly complex and multifaceted, and will not respect disciplinary boundaries. Therefore, to find coherent solutions to them requires that researchers collaborate with colleagues outside their home disciplines. It is further argued that collaboration across disciplines increases the likelihood that the proposed solutions will also be more effective than discipline-based solutions. A common belief is also that interdisciplinarity enhances creativity, and to the extent that it does, the possibility of finding innovative solutions to the problems at hand is likely to increase. A further advantage of engaging in interdisciplinarity is that it will help researchers to rethink their own discipline in new ways. New ways may result from considering questions from outside one’s own discipline, from learning new methods of answering questions and from considering the possible significance of the findings of other disciplines for one’s own work (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568212461592">Strober, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>‘Interdisciplinarity’ is commonly understood to mean something like the emergence of insight and understanding of a domain of problems through the integration of epistemologies, concepts and methods from different disciplines in some novel way. During the last 50 years or so, interdisciplinarity has become a major topic in its own right, within academic discourse on knowledge production, and has given rise to new studies that deal with the defining characteristics and challenges of these activities. Interdisciplinarity moreover is not just one thing: multiple ‘interdisciplinarities’ are said to exist ‘from simple borrowings and methodological thickening to theoretical enrichment, converging sites, and a general shift … to new ‘cross-’, ‘counter-’, and ‘antidisciplinary’ positions that front the problem of how meaning is produced, maintained and deconstructed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568212461592">Klein, 1996</xref>). So where, why and how are we to promote interdisciplinarity in childhood studies?</p>
<p>‘True’ interdisciplinarity is difficult to achieve. Interdisciplinarity scholars contend that more often than not it remains an elusive goal and in practice many interdisciplinary enterprises actually work at the level of being multidisciplinary. This is the case when a group of researchers from different disciplines collaborate by working together on a shared problem, but continue to use theories, tools and methods from their own discipline, and only occasionally use the output from each other’s work: working practices remain disciplinary.</p>
<p>Many of the reasons for the difficulty are well known. There are barriers within the university system itself for genuinely interdisciplinary communication and collaboration. <italic>Structural</italic> barriers concern the organizational structure of science, including the mechanisms of pressure and incentives that are built into the organization. The academic reward structure for hiring, promotion and grants provides powerful incentives to specialize narrowly, and few incentives and opportunities to integrate knowledge from other fields of study. There are also <italic>knowledge</italic> barriers that are constituted by the lack of familiarity that scientists often have with other disciplinary fields. This may cause misunderstandings and failed communication, and also contributes to an absence of visions of possible connections between the disciplines. <italic>Cultural</italic> barriers are formed by differences in the cultural characteristics of different fields of inquiry, particularly the language and the style of argumentation used, as well as differences in epistemologies and values (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568212461592">Bruun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568212461592">Strober, 2010</xref>). All these make cross-disciplinary forays onerous and discourage cross-disciplinary work among researchers.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of driving childhood studies towards interdisciplinarity, it is worth keeping in mind that disciplinarianism and interdisciplinarianism are not adversaries: they should not be seen to compete with each other; rather, there is a sense of interdependency between them. As the purpose of interdisciplinary collaboration is to draw on disciplinary expertise in two or more disciplines, in order for one to be interdisciplinary one must <italic>first</italic> be proficient in one’s own discipline. Consequently, to make interdisciplinary childhood studies thrive we need to have a strong <italic>sociology</italic> of childhood, solid <italic>historical</italic> studies of childhood, a thriving <italic>geography</italic> of children, and so on. But this in turn requires that the subdiscipline builds up and nurtures strong connections to its ‘mother discipline’ and develops a strong disciplinarian identity. There may be problems if this route is not followed.</p>
<p>The case of childhood sociology provides a pertinent example of the situation that is most probably shared by many of subdisciplinary fields that presently meet under the umbrella of childhood studies. Should childhood sociologists make the multi- and interdisciplinary childhood studies their main, and even only, field of reference, and should they prioritize the identity of a childhood researcher, there is a risk of (self-)exclusion within their own mother discipline (sociology). And as the subfield of childhood sociology continues to struggle to be recognized and to gain its due status within the mother discipline, it is paramount that strong connections are sought for and practiced with general sociology, its theory and research.</p>
<p>To develop childhood studies towards greater multidisciplinarity and even interdisciplinarity this provides a timely lesson to be learned across the field of childhood studies.</p>
