<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Increased recognition of issues related to early-childhood obesity resulted in a recent Institute of Medicine consensus statement: “Preventing obesity in infants and young children holds promise toward both reversing the epidemic of childhood obesity and reducing obesity in adulthood. . . . [However] efforts must begin before children ever enter the school system.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812440841">1</xref></sup> The focus on preschoolers and the need to take urgent, weight-related action to develop interventions in this underprioritized age-group is an area of rapidly growing interest;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812440841">2</xref></sup> however, engaging at-risk families in behavior change remains a key barrier. It is for this reason that the consensus statement also stresses that provider communication with parents of preschoolers must be improved such that parents are made aware of and may more readily achieve the revised recommendations related to age-appropriate eating and physical activity habits.</p>
<p>Achieving optimal communication with parents of preschoolers regarding child weight has been the subject of numerous studies exploring beliefs on child growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440841">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812440841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812440841"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812440841">6</xref></sup> and parental preferences as to how to approach these issues in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812440841">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812440841"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812440841"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812440841">10</xref></sup> A systematic review by Pocock et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812440841">11</xref></sup> illustrated that we have a broad understanding of parental knowledge, barriers, and motivators for addressing early-childhood obesity. However, understanding how parents prioritize this vast array of complex factors is lacking. Providers must also be selective in the number of behaviors or factors they address with patients, as prior work has demonstrated a lower likelihood to engage and/or retain this guidance when pediatricians offer 3 or more recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812440841">12</xref></sup> The clinical application of qualitative reports of parental obesity-counseling preferences, therefore, remains a challenge for health care providers, who may have inadequate time, awareness, and skill in addressing family-specific risks, barriers, and motivators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812440841">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812440841"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812440841">15</xref></sup> Known disparities in early-childhood obesity risk in low-income populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812440841">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812440841">17</xref></sup> make it especially important to define parental preferences in this population.</p>
<p>To improve efforts related to family-centered obesity prevention counseling for low-income preschoolers, our primary objective was to evaluate how parents prioritize known obesity-related factors. By using card-sorting exercises that incorporated known risks, barriers, and motivators taken from prior work, we sought to understand the relative value placed on these items and subsequently identify how they may interrelate. Card-sorting has been used successfully to measure patient values and preferences in overweight adolescents;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812440841">18</xref></sup> however, it has not previously been used to describe values in parents of low-income, urban preschoolers. Our secondary objective was to compare rankings between parents of healthy weight and overweight children and determine whether specific values may be associated with child weight outcomes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0009922812440841">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A sample of parents/guardians (herein referred to as parents) who presented for well-child care with a child aged 2 to 5 years at our urban, academic-based clinic were recruited for this study. Eligible participants were identified by reviewing clinic schedules and approached to complete an interview and to release anthropometric data from their child’s current medical visit.</p>
<p>Individuals were excluded if the index child had an obesity-related condition, such as diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, or current/prior use of a gastrostomy tube for nutrition. More details on recruitment have been previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812440841">9</xref></sup> The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all the study participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922812440841">
<title>Data Instruments</title>
<p>Participants were first given a 20-item, self-administered, written questionnaire that surveyed parent and child demographic information including child age, child race/ethnicity, and parent education level. After completing this questionnaire, parents completed in-person, semistructured interviews that explored their perceptions of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on risks, barriers, and motivators for achieving a healthy weight for their child. Whenever possible, interviews were performed and data collected by research staff prior to the clinical encounter. Child weight category was not discussed during the interview, to promote unbiased reports of parental perceptions of child weight. All interviews were audio recorded.</p>
<p>Card-sorting exercises corresponding to open-ended questions were completed to assess the relative rank of parent perceptions. Syntax and phrases used in the card-sorting exercises followed those used in Miller’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812440841">19</xref></sup> Personal Values Card Sort, a method frequently implemented during motivational interviewing to facilitate discussions of what a patient deems important. The following 3 questions were asked:</p>
<list id="list1-0009922812440841" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Risk factors</italic>: What factors do you feel contribute most to your child’s risk of being overweight?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Motivators</italic>: If your child were overweight, what would be the reasons that would make you want to help him/her get to a healthy weight?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Barriers</italic>: If your child were overweight, what would be some things that you would find difficult in helping him/her get to a healthy weight?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>On each of these questions, the participants were instructed to rank written options in order from 1 to 5 (“1” representing the most valued option). Response items were chosen from prior qualitative research that incorporated similar interview questions and were those felt to best represent previously reported risks, barriers, and motivators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440841">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812440841">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812440841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812440841">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812440841">20</xref></sup> To enhance participant comprehension of the exercise, card statements were accompanied by visual images symbolizing the written statement (available on request for review). Our interview protocol was periodically reviewed, and the research staff were randomly observed throughout the study period to ensure adherence to the study content and objectives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922812440841">
<title>Anthropometric Data</title>
<p>Children were weighed without shoes and in light clothing on digital scales. Stadiometers were used to measure child height in a standing position. Height and weight measurements were performed for all index children and electronically recorded by nursing staff trained in standard anthropometric techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922812440841">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Child body mass index (BMI) percentiles were computed from clinical measurements using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2000) Reference Epi Info 3.5 (CDC, Atlanta, GA). The respondents were grouped into 4 weight categories based on the child’s BMI (&lt;5th, 5th-84th, 85th-94th, ≥95th percentile). For the purposes of our analyses and in support of recent AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812440841">21</xref></sup> we defined a healthy weight child as one with a BMI within the range of 5th to 84th percentile and <italic>at-risk</italic> children as those with a BMI ≥85th percentile.</p>
<p>For the 3 card-sorting exercises, we report the frequency with which the participants ranked each of the 5 card-sort statements as the most important, or <italic>top-ranked</italic>, item. Pearson’s χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812440841">2</xref></sup> tests and Fischer’s exact test (when appropriate) were used to examine differences in proportional ranking between parents of healthy weight and at-risk children. Mean ranks were additionally calculated, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine subpopulation differences in mean ranking due to nonparametric distribution of responses. All analyses were performed using Stata 10.0 (Intercooled Stata 10.0, StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Two hundred and sixty parents accompanying a child 2 to 5 years of age for a well-child visit were approached to participate in the study over an 8-month period (July 2008 to April 2009), of which 210 were considered eligible. Sixty were unable to complete the survey because of participant refusals (n = 41) or limited staff support (n = 19). The final analytic sample included 150 parent–child dyads. The overall mean child age was 39 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 37.3-40.7). Non-Latino black children were the racial/ethnic majority in our sample (91.3%). Eighty-three percent of the respondents were the child’s mother, 10.8% were the child’s grandparents or other relatives, and 6.1% were the child’s father. The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 19.3% and 13.3%, respectively, with a total of 32.7% (n = 49) children with BMI ≥85th percentile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812440841">Table 1</xref>). A majority of our sample were publically insured (88.7%). The demographics were consistent with the clinic’s norms.</p>

<title>Rankings of Perceived Risk Factors for Preschooler Obesity</title>
<p>“Purchasing and preparing unhealthy foods” was the most frequently top-ranked risk factor for early-childhood obesity, with 37.6% of the participants placing this card first in the exercise (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812440841">Table 2</xref>). Parents perceived rewarding their child with food and asking their child to finish the food on the plate as other important risk factors (28.8% and 23.5% respectively). These 3 statements reflected the majority of parental report (90%) of top risk factors for obesity. Using food as a reward was observed to have the highest mean ranking in the sample (2.3; 95% CI = 2.1-2.5), with comparable means observed among parents of at-risk and healthy weight children (<italic>P</italic> = .63). There were no statistically significant differences in top-ranked proportions between the 2 child weight groups.</p>

<p>Few parents in our sample considered low levels of physical activity as the top risk factor for obesity in their child (7.4%). This underreporting of low activity as a top risk factor was supported with a low (5 being the lowest numeric report) overall mean rank in the general sample (3.7; 95% CI = 3.5-3.9). Parents of at-risk children were observed to have a statistically significant trend toward a higher ranking of low physical activity (healthy weight mean rank = 3.8, at-risk mean rank = 3.5, <italic>P</italic> = .05). A similar trend was noted for the ranking of “the food choices of my child’s caretakers” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812440841">Table 2</xref>) in that, relative to the other card-sort statements, parents of healthy weight children appeared to rank food choices of their child’s caretakers as a higher risk factor than did parents of at-risk children. This difference did not, however, achieve statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .07).</p>

<title>Rankings of Perceived Barriers to Achieving a Healthy Child Weight</title>
<p>The top-ranked barrier, “I cannot control the foods offered to my child by others,” was chosen by 34% of parents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922812440841">Table 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, nutrition and feeding-related factors including purchasing and preparing unhealthy food, using food as a reward, and asking children to finish the food on their plate were reported as top risk factors for early-childhood obesity by 90% of parents. This finding supports prior work suggesting that parents are keenly aware of the risks of poor diet in their young children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440841">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812440841">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812440841">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812440841">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812440841">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812440841">23</xref></sup> but may feel limited by their child’s behavior and an intense emotional connection to their child’s dietary needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812440841">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812440841">24</xref></sup> These behavior patterns suggest that our anticipatory guidance efforts for families of preschoolers should build on, and not underestimate, existing parental awareness of these factors. We observed that parents may specifically recognize that using food as a reward is associated with an unhealthy child weight, as this statement was observed to have the highest overall ranking in the risk factor category. Although this behavior may not have been proportionately ranked as the top-perceived risk factor, it was the most consistently ranked risk factor by parents, and this did not differ by child weight group. The data, in light of prior qualitative work that describes the difficulty that many parents must face in achieving a balance between using food as positive reinforcement and as a behavioral bribe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812440841">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812440841">24</xref></sup> indicate that a focus on improving parenting skills may alleviate the need for resorting to food to attain desired behaviors. Low-income parents may especially benefit from this guidance, where limited support systems may predispose them to placating their child with food.</p>
<p>Of note, despite recent national campaigns endorsed heavily by <italic>WIC</italic> and <italic>Head Start</italic>, few parents in our sample considered low levels of physical activity as a top risk factor for obesity in their preschooler (7.4%). Similarly, only 3% of parents considered having their preschooler be “fit” as the top motivator for healthy weight. It is possible that parents perceive their preschoolers to be very physically active and thus do not prioritize physical activity relative to other aforementioned issues related to healthy weight. We suspect that a majority of parents of preschoolers consider their child to be “active” as children in this age-group are known to be busy, inquisitive, and with “high energy.” Because the parents in our study were asked to consider whether low physical activity was a risk factor for their child, this statement may have been underprioritized given each parent’s personal experience with his or her child. In numerous recent studies, preschoolers were noted to be sedentary for up to 85% of their day, based on accelerometer measurements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812440841">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812440841"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812440841">27</xref></sup> supporting the idea that parents do not prioritize physical activity often enough. Though much research demonstrates increased sedentary behavior of preschool children related to television viewing and other media use,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812440841">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812440841">29</xref></sup> parents may not perceive media use to contribute to low physical activity in their child. Finally, the term <italic>fit</italic> may have been interpreted in different ways by the participants. Although our goal was to use a simple term that would prompt thoughts of their child’s overall physical activity level, some parents may have felt the term to be indicative of the child’s muscle mass or other physical features.</p>
<p>In both urban and rural settings, parents are limited in terms of their child’s access to a safe environment for physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812440841">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812440841">31</xref></sup> Although federal, state, and community efforts to make play areas safer and more accessible have targeted this issue, in our study of a low-income urban sample, parents did not highly rank access to physical activity as a top barrier to achieving a healthy weight in their child. Whether access was not considered a major barrier because parents did not value physical activity in this age-group still needs to be determined. However, we found that physical activity, fitness, and access to safe environments for physical activity were consistently undervalued in comparison with other statements across categories. Thus, our data suggest that an intentional emphasis on innovative and developmentally appropriate methods to promote physical activity in early childhood is necessary to address the gap between provider and parental values on physical activity.</p>
<p>Finally, we noted that feeling unable to control alternate caretakers’ food choices was considered the greatest barrier to achieving a healthy weight in their children by parents. The influence of family dynamics on child feeding and activity is well known in the qualitative literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440841">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812440841">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812440841">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812440841">32</xref></sup> with parents often feeling undermined or threatened by opposing concepts of child size, discipline, TV-viewing habits, and dietary choices among their close friends and family. Also, it appeared that parents of healthy weight children considered the food choices of alternate caretakers a greater risk factor for their child than did parents of at-risk children, when comparing mean rank reports relative to low physical activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812440841">Table 2</xref>). Although the small differences in mean rankings may be difficult to translate into clinical associations, this pattern may reflect understudied issues relating to how parental and alternate caretaker dynamics affect early-childhood growth.</p>
<p>With nearly 80% of preschool-age children of working mothers spending greater than 40 hours/week in child care centers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922812440841">33</xref></sup> many have recognized the undeniable influence of child care centers and alternate caretakers on preschool weight risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812440841">34</xref></sup> Accordingly, in 2011, the Let’s Move Child Care campaign was launched in an effort to help parents and child-care centers better collaborate on nutrition, physical activity, and screen-time goals for preschoolers. In light of our data, we propose that health care providers should play an key role in enhancing parental self-efficacy in controlling outside influences, by (<italic>a</italic>) inquiring about the child’s other food influences, (<italic>b</italic>) validating parents’ current appropriate feeding practices, and (<italic>c</italic>) providing written instructions to caretakers (or child care centers) regarding the child’s nutritional and physical activity recommendations. Our prior work indicates that pediatricians are highly valued as nutritional counselors by parents of preschoolers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812440841">9</xref></sup> thereby underlining the impact that their messages may have on parents’ efforts and self-efficacy in modifying their children’s behavior.</p>
<p>The strengths of our study include the use of a quantitative technique, card sorting, to assess parental values as they relate to early-childhood healthy weight and obesity in low-income, publicly insured patients who are at highest weight risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812440841">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812440841">17</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this is the first study to use this technique in the context of early-childhood obesity and to compare rankings between healthy weight and at-risk children. Limitations of the study include the wording and restriction of the card sorts to 5 items within each category. With a health problem as multifactorial as early-childhood obesity, it would not have been feasible to include all previously reported risks, barriers, and motivators in our study. Thus, ranking can only be interpreted in relationship to the other options offered. Failure to detect differences in parental rankings between the 2 weight groups may have been due to a type 2 error, in that our study was originally powered for other purposes. Since our sample was from a single site, the results may not be generalizable to other populations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Parents of preschoolers are aware of high-risk feeding behaviors; however, they do not prioritize physical activity as a risk factor for their child relative to dietary factors. This suggests a need for more focused education regarding age-appropriate activity goals and limits on sedentary behavior during health counseling and in other educational efforts. Parents also identified their inability to control the food choices of other caretakers as a barrier to healthy eating. Supporting parents in their efforts to engage other influential caregivers in weight-related goals for young children should also become a more consistent approach. This may aid parents to address their perceived inability to control the food choices of alternate caretakers. Interventions to broaden the reach of anticipatory guidance regarding nutrition to such caretakers need further study and action.</p>
