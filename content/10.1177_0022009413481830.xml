<p>In 1950s Japan, films about the Second World War, especially the conflict in the Pacific, were very popular. Though some of them concentrated on misery and suffering, others were surprisingly positive in their portrayal of Japanese soldiers. The 1950s have the reputation of a pacifist decade in Japan, when people were only too glad to forget the war as they turned instead to the future. This orthodox view is undermined, however, by the undeniable fact that a great many people wanted to see cinematic dramatizations of the war. The movies they watched left room for pride, dignity, the recognition of Japanese military power and even nostalgia for the war years. They were an important means by which people explored the meanings of the recent conflict. In particular, they explained and dramatized what had happened; presented examples of heroic soldiers and sailors; and contributed to the reintegration of ordinary soldiers who had been convicted as war criminals back into Japanese society. In doing so they played a vital role in reclaiming and validating the actions of military men, and in promoting the idea that there had been positive aspects of the war experience, despite the suffering the conflict had undoubtedly brought.</p>

<p>Popular culture flourished in Japan in the 1950s, including the cinema, which enjoyed a golden age. In the peak year of attendance, 1958, film audiences reached 1127 million.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009413481830">1</xref></sup> Assuming that cinema-goers were at least 10 years of age, this means that on average, every person went to the movies more than 15 times that year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009413481830">2</xref></sup> The cinema contained its share of escapism and romance, especially in the many Hollywood films shown in Japan. Less well known, however, is that Japanese movie theatres were also full of feature films about the war: in fact, the Second World War was one of the most prominent of all cinematic themes in the 1950s. War films were not arthouse products appealing to a small elite. They attracted very large audiences and some were blockbusters. The 1950s have the reputation of a pacifist decade in Japan, when people were only too glad to forget the war as they turned instead to the future, first in an effort to survive and then in an increasing pursuit of consumerism as the economy recovered and began to grow. This orthodox view is undermined, however, by the undeniable fact that a great many people wanted to see cinematic dramatizations of the war.</p>
<p>The 1950s war films that are best remembered today are those that portrayed the conflict as a hopeless one and soldiers and sailors as miserable figures. Prominent examples include <italic>Kike wadatsumi no koe</italic> (Listen to the Voices of the Sea, 1950), a tale of unrelieved suffering and defeat among Japanese soldiers in Imphal, based on a published collection of soldiers' writings, and <italic>Biruma no tategoto</italic> (The Harp of Burma, 1956), based on a novel by Takeyama Michio, which features a group of exhausted soldiers at the end of the war in Burma and one conscience-stricken individual in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009413481830">3</xref></sup> Many 1950s war films, however, were not like this. War movies could be exciting and could even portray the Japanese side of the conflict favourably, at least up to a point. They often highlighted battle scenes in which Japanese forces were skilled and powerful, and many focused on admirable, even heroic, military figures. Some took up the cause of convicted war criminals, explaining the circumstances of soldiers whose actions had been condemned after August 1945, defending them as ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances, and demanding sympathy for their plight. In this period when television had not yet made serious inroads into the number of cinema-goers, films attracted a truly national audience in Japan, as elsewhere. War films, then, were an important means by which people explored the significance of the recent conflict and its aftermath. According to one reckoning, 175 dramatic films (<italic>geki eiga</italic>) about the Second World War were produced in Japan between the day of defeat and 1963.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009413481830">4</xref></sup> Almost all of them were in fact made after 1952, when the Allied Occupation and its censorship ended. War films, by which I mean films that took war as a major and direct theme, then began to appear in considerable numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009413481830">5</xref></sup> Such movies had a particular appeal for men, who might be seeking to revisit their wartime experiences, or to understand what their older relatives and friends had endured and they themselves might only narrowly have escaped.</p>
<p>War films in the 1950s presented versions of the conflict that were often surprisingly positive in their portrayal of Japanese soldiers. Their interpretations frequently differed both from the Occupation-period, American-dominated versions of the war contained especially in political pronouncements by the occupiers, in which the majority of Japanese had been misled by a few rapacious military leaders, and from the complementary Japanese trend evident in cultural products of all kinds, including memoirs, novels and some films, in which all Japanese were portrayed as victims of the war. Though the cinema did dwell on Japanese suffering at times, 1950s war films also left room for pride, dignity, the recognition of Japanese military power, and even nostalgia for the war years. They reinforced the affirmation in the growing number of memoirs produced by former military men from the late Occupation period onwards that the Japanese military had not been entirely bad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009413481830">6</xref></sup> In almost all cases, such films focused on the Pacific War rather than the war in China: it would have been much more difficult to portray Japanese soldiers' actions in China in a positive light. The fact that movies about the Pacific War attracted large audiences suggests that people did not see themselves only as victims, and that there was a public appetite for complex renderings of the war that retained at least some of the values of the wartime and pre-war years. At the same time, recognition of the complexity and ambiguity of 1950s war films undermines any lingering stereotype of a sharp division between a ‘pacifist’ people and a conservative, reactionary state.</p>
<p>War films performed several important functions in the 1950s. In particular, I argue here that they explained and dramatized what had happened; presented examples of heroic soldiers and sailors; and contributed to the process of reintegrating those ordinary soldiers who had been convicted as war criminals back into Japanese society. In doing so they played a vital role in reclaiming and validating the wartime actions of military men, and more generally in promoting the idea that there had been positive aspects of the war experience, despite the suffering and hardship that the conflict had undoubtedly brought.</p>
<p>War films had a particular impact in informing people about what had actually happened at the battlefronts. In 1945 and afterwards, many Japanese had only a sketchy understanding of what had occurred. Soldiers' knowledge was usually limited to their own experience and perhaps that of their friends, while civilians at home had been given very restricted information about the conditions of fighting, and especially about battles that Japanese forces had lost. In Japanese films made during the war itself, very little combat footage had been shown,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009413481830">7</xref></sup> and up to 1952, Occupation censorship had restricted knowledge of wartime events, partly out of fear of reigniting Japanese militarism. In November 1945 the Occupation's Civil Information and Education Section had issued a list of ‘problematic’ cinematic themes including those that ‘played up militarism’, ‘involved nationalism’ or ‘were chauvinistic and antiforeign’. In March 1946 the Civil Censorship Detachment, a subdivision of the Occupation's Civil Intelligence Section, decreed that ‘films with a military background are prohibited, except when militarism is shown to be evil’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009413481830">8</xref></sup> Under these circumstances, screening any films about the war at all was a difficult undertaking; even Hollywood films dealing with the conflict in Europe or in the Pacific could be banned if they were deemed to glorify war or to emphasize individual heroism, blind obedience or self-sacrifice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009413481830">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The truth about the June 1942 Battle of Midway, for example, had been comprehensively hidden from the Japanese public during the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009413481830">10</xref></sup> It was only afterwards that people found out that it had been a debacle for the Japanese navy. One channel of information at the popular level was a 1949 US film entitled <italic>Task Force</italic> and starring Gary Cooper, shown in Japan in 1953 under the title <italic>Kidō butai</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009413481830">11</xref></sup> It incorporated actual combat footage, including scenes of Midway. At least one reviewer in a prominent magazine confirmed that he learned about Midway for the first time through this film, commenting on the length of time for which the truth had been concealed from the Japanese people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009413481830">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Postwar films made in Japan also offered dramatic battle sequences, sometimes using archival footage from US sources and sometimes relying on specially built models and miniatures. The resulting scenes were not only informative but often thrilling and spectacular, and audiences were excited by what they saw. <italic>Taiheiyō no washi</italic>, or Eagle of the Pacific, was made in 1953 by Honda Ishirō, who later went on to create the original Godzilla film and many of its successors. <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> was the Tōhō studio's first war movie after 1945. It had a big budget, starred well-known actors, and earned over 163 million yen, becoming the third-highest-ranking film of 1953 in terms of takings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009413481830">13</xref></sup> Honda later recalled that it was the first movie for which Tōhō could count its takings in units of hundreds of millions of yen (<italic>oku</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009413481830">14</xref></sup> The film centres on Yamamoto Isoroku (1884–1943), Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Combined Fleet and planner of Japan’s naval and air strategy in the Pacific, including the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway. In near-documentary style, it follows Yamamoto from the late 1930s to his death in April 1943, when his aircraft was shot down over the Solomon Islands in an ambush by American fighter planes. <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> contains spectacular battle scenes and special effects, especially in representing Midway. The combat footage was compiled from US sources and from Tōhō's own archive, which contributed scenes from the 1942 Tōhō film, <italic>Hawaii-Marei oki kaisen</italic> (The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya), ‘the most influential war film of the entire Pacific War period’ in Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009413481830">15</xref></sup> In addition, two model aircraft carriers were made for <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> at one-tenth scale: the construction of just one of them required the labour of 800 people for a month.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009413481830">16</xref></sup> One of the Midway scenes is famous among special-effects enthusiasts for Japan's first-ever fire stunt, in which a pilot is set on fire when his Zero fighter is hit while on the deck of an aircraft carrier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009413481830">17</xref></sup> The original trailer for <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> makes it clear that dramatic combat scenes were expected to be a major attraction for potential audiences.</p>
<p><italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> was a great success for the Tōhō studio, indicating, in the director's view, how deeply the public thirsted for knowledge of the Pacific War at that time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009413481830">18</xref></sup> Encouraged by its success, Honda made another war movie the following year, this time centring on veteran pilots stationed in Rabaul in the final stage of the conflict. <italic>Saraba Rabauru</italic> (Farewell Rabaul) portrayed the pilots' aversion to war and their despair at their hopeless situation, but it, too, incorporated dramatic battle scenes, and in particular, some thrilling aerobatics by the hero, Captain Wakabayashi, pilot of a Zero fighter. Models and special effects were again a feature: each aeroplane made for <italic>Farewell Rabaul</italic> reportedly cost 1.5 million yen to construct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009413481830">19</xref></sup> A second film about Yamamoto, made in 1957 by Tazaki Jun and entitled <italic>Gunshin Yamamoto gensui to Rengō kantai</italic> (The War Hero Admiral Yamamoto and the Combined Fleet), again features complex special effects and dramatic scenes of Midway.</p>
<p>Such scenes were an exciting drawcard in themselves, as trailers, reviewers' comments and reports of audience reactions indicate, but they also conveyed the often unexpected message to Japanese viewers that the Japanese military had been a skilled, powerful and disciplined force that the enemy had feared rather than despised. Films made during the war itself, as well as other cultural products and official pronouncements, had certainly been designed to convince audiences that the Japanese military was invincible and that individual soldiers epitomized bravery and strength. After August 1945, however, the story was very different. As one former soldier remarked, since the war ended, Japanese people had only ever been told that their military forces had failed and that everyone had died like a dog.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009413481830">20</xref></sup> Many of the popular 1950s war films reversed this impression yet again. The same former soldier was greatly struck by scenes of suicide pilots in action in the 1956 documentary film <italic>Nihon kaku tatakaeri</italic> (This is How Japan Fought). Footage of the ‘special attack forces’ (<italic>tokkōtai</italic>) proved to him that not everyone had fought poorly and died miserably.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009413481830">21</xref></sup> Viewers apparently sat mesmerized during this film, holding their breaths and hoping that the <italic>kamikaze</italic> pilots would hit the US ships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009413481830">22</xref></sup> A member of the audience for the US film <italic>Task Force</italic> (<italic>Kidō butai</italic>) commented that while people were accustomed to thinking of their military as it had been at the war’s end – that is, small and weak – newsreel footage from earlier stages of the conflict showed that Japanese forces had once been strong, that the US side had acknowledged this strength, and that Japanese soldiers had in fact fought well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009413481830">23</xref></sup> A housewife told a journalist that seeing the film had made her proud of what her country had been.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009413481830">24</xref></sup> The film's reviewer in the weekly news magazine <italic>Shūkan asahi</italic> noted that <italic>Task Force</italic> had a salutary role in reminding Japanese audiences of the intensity of attacks from both sides. He had been especially impressed by the scenes (presumably of the Battle of Midway) in which Japanese torpedo planes passed under fierce shelling from the enemy to plunge into the sides of US ships, and also by the scenes showing suicide pilots. Though he was not as frank in his admiration of the Japanese effort as the audience members quoted above, this reviewer seems to have responded to the film in a very similar way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009413481830">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two films about Admiral Yamamoto portrayed Japan’s military, or at least the navy, as a force of which people could be proud. In contrast to early postwar reactions to defeat in which military men had been derided as deluded at best and criminal at worst, Japan’s military forces had been condemned as puny and the war itself dismissed as chaotic, irrational and hopeless from the beginning, the Yamamoto films offer an alternative view. The navy is presented as disciplined and patriotic; its senior leaders are loyal but also reasoned, sceptical of the wisdom of going to war, and extremely capable. Comparatively few figures from outside the navy appear in <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> at all. Strikingly, reference to the emperor is almost entirely absent. Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki is not shown and is hardly referred to. It is almost as if the entire war, up to Yamamoto’s death in 1943 when the film ends, had been fought by the navy; and because of the 1943 end-point, the navy in this cinematic version is conveniently not involved in the traumatic final stages of the war. The navy was a good candidate for such treatment for another reason too: as the sea-going service it was not implicated nearly as much as the army in the incarceration of prisoners-of-war, the capture of enemy cities or other aspects of the conflict that sometimes led to accusations of war crimes. The navy's war could thus be presented as a conveniently ‘clean’ one in this respect. The attractiveness of naval themes is confirmed by the appearance in the same year of <italic>Senkan Yamato</italic> (Battleship Yamato), in which sailors are once again presented largely as heroes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009413481830">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unlikely as it may seem, the war even became something to remember with fondness. As early as the 1950s, nostalgia for the war years was evident in audience reactions to cinematic representations of the conflict, and film-makers capitalized on this emotion. People watching <italic>Task Force</italic> applauded at the sight of the Japanese fleet and also when the suicide pilots appeared. The very sound of certain words not heard since wartime seemed to draw applause: words like ‘<italic>kamikaze</italic>’ and ‘<italic>Zerosen</italic>’ (the Zero fighter), for example.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009413481830">27</xref></sup> Even progressive intellectuals were not immune. After seeing the 1957 Yamamoto film, the well-known left-wing commentator Tsurumi Shunsuke wrote about the good cheer and light-heartedness of the young fliers it featured; for him the film portrayed the beauty of courageous youth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009413481830">28</xref></sup> He later confided that hearing wartime songs made him feel good because the songs recalled the shared experience of the past, and specifically the emotion of self-sacrifice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009413481830">29</xref></sup> Nostalgia for war was adroitly exploited by film-makers. For Honda Ishirō, who made the first Yamamoto film, the choice of <italic>Farewell Rabaul</italic> as his next war movie was no accident. By this time the ace pilot of the Zero fighter had become an iconic cultural figure, and a hit song had been released with the title <italic>Saraba Rabauru</italic> (Farewell Rabaul)<italic>.</italic> Honda chose the topic, setting and, no doubt, the title of his 1954 film partly in order to cash in on that nostalgia. Reviewers said that characters, set and location were unimpressive and too obviously fake, but this was hardly the point. Indeed, Honda seems not to have intended to make a particularly serious film, but rather to build a relatively cheerful love story around the existing and very popular song.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009413481830">30</xref></sup> Nostalgia for certain aspects of the war, in other words, had become a commercial proposition.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, part of the nostalgia was certainly about the specific experience shared by men. According to one estimate, film audiences in this period were commonly 56 per cent male and 44 per cent female,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009413481830">31</xref></sup> but observers at several of the 1950s war films reported that 80 per cent or more of the viewers were men. Tsurumi reported that he saw <italic>The War Hero Admiral Yamamoto and the Combined Fleet</italic> in a full house that was all male.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009413481830">32</xref></sup> The attraction of such films for men is not surprising. As the original trailer for <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> pointed out, the film was about ‘the Pacific War, which was written in blood by you, and your father and your brothers’.</p>
<p>War films of the 1950s openly presented individual military figures as heroes. Their heroism lay not necessarily in opposing or avoiding war, but often in the outstanding performance of their military duties. In fact, cinematic war heroes of the 1950s in many ways embodied the qualities that ideal military men had represented during the war itself. Though the leading men of the 1950s war films discussed here do not talk about the emperor or Japan’s mission in the region or the world, they are nevertheless patriotic. They are reserved in personality but are resourceful, independent, brave and disciplined. All are good or even brilliant soldiers and leaders of men. The fact that such military figures were attractive heroes to very large cinema audiences in the 1950s shows that many of the values associated with soldiers continued to be prized in Japanese society. Military men still represented leadership, service and action as few others did.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isoroku is again a prominent example. He is a clear hero in both <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> and <italic>The War Hero Admiral Yamamoto and the Combined Fleet</italic>, even though he was so closely associated with the strategy of Japan’s failed war. He is portrayed as a principled, able and intelligent officer, a brilliant strategist who did not want to go to war, but devoted all his energies to trying to secure victory for Japan once the conflict was underway. He is calm, rational, dignified and professional. Yamamoto was an acceptable hero for a Japan emerging from defeat principally because of his anti-war credentials. He opposed the Tripartite Alliance signed by Japan, Germany and Italy in September 1940, on the grounds that it was likely to lead to conflict with the USA and Britain as well as the Soviet Union. He had experience of life in the West, having studied at Harvard University and served as naval attaché in the US Embassy in Washington in his earlier years. Like other senior naval figures, he argued against going to war with the USA in late 1941, famously telling Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro that he could not guarantee the success of the Imperial Japanese Navy for more than a year (or six months or two years, in varying reports of the remark) in a war against America. Further, he was killed before the war's end, and thus did not have to answer for his actions in any war crimes trial: as the architect of both Pearl Harbor and Midway he certainly would have been a prime candidate for indictment at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo had he survived. In <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic>, Yamamoto's last thoughts as he plunges to his death again express his opposition to the war.</p>
<p>Yamamoto's anti-war credentials are emphasized in the very first scene of <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic>, in which a young man from a right-wing terrorist organisation, arrested by the police, is naming the prominent figures on his group's assassination list. He cites the usual suspects from the political and business world, but then adds Yamamoto. When the police express surprise, he explains that Yamamoto deserves to be on the list because he is well known for his pro-Western views. In the 1957 film, Yamamoto is confronted in his own home by right-wing youths, who draw their knives on him. The emphasis on Yamamoto's opposition to the war helps to explain how major studios could make such out-and-out war movies so soon after Japan's defeat. The admiral's anti-war credentials were apparently crucial to the making of the 1953 film in particular. Honda, the director, believed the film told the ironical story of the military man who in his heart was the most reluctant to fight, yet was compelled to fight right up at the front-line. Yamamoto's was thus a war story that could be told at this early point, in Honda's view, whereas other possible topics might still be too sensitive: Honda had initially wanted to make a film about suicide pilots which would have been very critical of the senior officers who had sent the young fliers to their deaths, but opted for the Yamamoto story instead when his studio demurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009413481830">33</xref></sup> <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> pays lip-service to contrition about the war. Unusually for a 1950s war film, it states that responsibility for the conflict belongs to all of the Japanese people. Moreover, it is framed by printed statements on screen at the beginning and end that are nominally anti-war, observing that the dead will not return, but that it is necessary calmly to look at the past in order not to repeat its mistakes. Despite these platitudes, <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic>, as noted above, glories in its spectacular battle scenes. Reviewers did notice a contradiction. In the influential cinema magazine <italic>Kinema junpō</italic>, for example, the leading critic Ueno Ichirō wrote that the film seemed uncertain of its goal. If the aim was to show the tragedy of Yamamoto, there was no need for such emphasis on special effects in the second half of the movie. If spectacle were the main point, the film should have concentrated on that. Either way, Ueno believed, the result would have been a more articulate film. In any case he was not very impressed with the special effects; he thought the best of them were contained in the Pearl Harbor scene, which had been borrowed from <italic>The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya</italic>, and thus concluded that the Tōhō studio's special effects had not advanced much since 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009413481830">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both the films about Yamamoto present a towering personality who cannot possibly fit the stereotype of an irrational, fanatic military leader rushing headlong into a hopeless war. Only on one occasion, in the 1953 film, do we witness an extreme though very controlled expression of grief – in a scene after the loss of the Battle of Midway in which Yamamoto withdraws from his subordinates to agonize privately in his cabin. In fact, at least one reviewer criticized the portrayal of Yamamoto by the leading actor Ōkōchi Denjirō as overly wooden and lacking in spirit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009413481830">35</xref></sup> In the 1957 version, Yamamoto is even more grave and disciplined. There are no displays of emotion at all, and he even refuses to rejoice in Japan’s early victories in the war. On the other hand, he has a more domestic side in the second film: there are scenes depicting his home-town (Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture), a brother, wife, children, friends and neighbours. Throughout the film he maintains an association with a young recruit from his home-town. He is also depicted visiting a subordinate in hospital in Rabaul. Thus, compassion and kindness are added to his other sterling qualities, and Yamamoto perhaps becomes a hero with whom everyone can identify. He is also a leader who inspires his subordinates by his moral and military example: all his subordinates serve him eagerly and even passionately. Ultimately, according to the later film, Yamamoto’s attributes were so outstanding that but for his death, he could even have made a difference to the outcome of the war. In an enigmatic final statement printed on the screen, we are told: ‘If Admiral Yamamoto had lived, Japan would have been able to avoid making a mistake on that page of the nation’s history’. It is impossible to imagine that Yamamoto could really have changed the course of the war after 1943, but the message that he was an irreplaceable hero is clear.</p>
<p>The drama of Yamamoto's story and his apparently superb personal qualities have proved to hold enduring appeal. Not only are the 1953 and 1957 films still commercially available, but two more movies about Yamamoto have since been produced. The major star Mifune Toshirō played Yamamoto in Maruyama Seiji's 1968 <italic>Rengō kantai shirei chōkan: Yamamoto Isoroku</italic> (Yamamoto Isoroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet). Another film with the same title was released by the Tōei studio in December 2011. Directed by Narushima Izuru and made with the co-operation of the Ministry of Defence at a reported cost of one billion yen, it stars the leading actor Yakusho Kōji. In advance commentary on the film, the theme of leadership was prominent, suggesting that it is Yamamoto's qualities as a leader that are the key to his continuing cinematic popularity. Production staff declared that their aim was to show ‘what a Japanese leader should be’, explaining that Yamamoto was someone who ‘thought about human life and the future of Japan, and … possessed decisiveness and a forward-looking international sensibility’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009413481830">36</xref></sup> One film publication added: ‘Because of Japan's current plight due to the recent Tohoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear crisis, the staff [on the movie] also hopes to somehow present the meaning of true leadership’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009413481830">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Honda’s <italic>Farewell Rabaul</italic> also features a superlative military hero. Captain Wakabayashi, the ace pilot of the Zero fighter, may be disillusioned with the war, but he still fights well, unlike some of his fellow pilots who are drunken and demoralized and not necessarily very skilful anyway. At the end of the film, Wakabayashi is killed after a series of daring aerial manoeuvres among the mountains over Rabaul in which he downs an American plane that has been threatening the Japanese base. Wakabayashi's fatally damaged plane plummets into the ocean in full sight of a Japanese ship about to leave Rabaul, taking the woman he loves, along with a large number of other nurses and other women, home to Japan. By this stage, planes are few in Rabaul and many pilots are dead. Watching his plane crash into the ocean, one of the women remarks gravely to the others that he is ‘Rabaul's last hero’.</p>
<p>The theme of the heroic fighter caught in a useless war is taken much further in Kobayashi Masaki's epic trilogy <italic>Ningen no jōken</italic> (The Human Condition), based on Gomikawa Junpei's bestselling novel, made for the Shōchiku company in six parts between 1959 and 1961 at a reported cost of 700 million yen, and screening for over nine and a half hours in total.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009413481830">38</xref></sup> The ideological stance of this movie differs markedly from those of the other films discussed here, as does its quality and its place in cinematic history: the British film critic David Shipman asserted in 1984 that <italic>The Human Condition</italic> was ‘unequivocally the greatest film ever made’, while acknowledging that it was also (at the time) the longest film ever shown.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009413481830">39</xref></sup> Kobayashi's masterpiece is relentlessly anti-war and anti-military. It deals with the war in China, not in the Pacific, and thus immediately introduces moral complications that are not evident in the films I have discussed so far. It also contrasts markedly with the films on war criminals, which, as we will see below, aim to justify and normalize even the actions of soldiers who were later convicted of war crimes. <italic>The Human Condition</italic>, on the other hand, constitutes a profound meditation on complicity and individual conscience in wartime. In its handling of the themes of war and the military it is thus enormously more sophisticated than the Yamamoto movies or <italic>Farewell Rabaul</italic>, let alone the films about war criminals. It is all the more striking, then, that <italic>The Human Condition</italic> shares at least some common features with these other war films.</p>
<p>At the start of <italic>The Human Condition</italic>, Kaji, a progressively-minded, idealistic university graduate, is an employee of the South Manchuria Steel Company. He has a particular interest in labour management and after writing a treatise on the subject for his superiors, is transferred to Manchuria in 1943 to work in the interior as a labour supervisor at a Japanese mine. Because of the importance of his work he has been exempted from military service, but as part of his punishment for attempting to protect Chinese forced labourers against Kenpeitai cruelty his exemption is revoked and he is conscripted into the army. At the end of the war he is taken prisoner by the Soviet military. He escapes, and eventually dies while trying to walk an immense distance across Manchuria to safety. The military of which Kaji is a part is brutish and irrational, and Kaji struggles uselessly against the abuses it heaps upon Chinese forced labourers and prisoners-of-war, upon its own new recruits, and upon himself. Kaji's military is thus a far cry from the disciplined, effective naval force in the Yamamoto movies: indeed, the Japanese military, rather than any foreign force, is Kaji's real enemy, as the film states explicitly at one point. Yet Kaji himself is a brilliant soldier: if he had not been, as the film's director remarked much later, he would not have survived.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009413481830">40</xref></sup> He is not only compassionate, moral and humane, but is also a superb fighter and survivor and an expert marksman. He is brave, resourceful and at times ruthless. Whatever else he may be, Kaji is certainly a military hero, even though he fights against the force of which he is a part.</p>
<p>One of the central themes of <italic>The Human Condition</italic> is that good and evil do not exist in obvious contrast with each other; in extreme circumstances, anyone is capable of reprehensible actions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009413481830">41</xref></sup> At the same time, the film differs from other war movies of the decade in its frank portrayal of bad soldiers and unprincipled behaviour. Kaji may be a hero but others are not. Brutish Kenpeitai officers abuse Chinese workers in Manchuria, execute their leaders at any hint of rebellion, and take violent retributive action against Kaji when he stands up for the prisoners; Kwantung Army officers (Japanese officers stationed in Manchuria) refuse to discipline their subordinates after those subordinates have callously mistreated new army recruits; soldiers in the crumbling Kwantung Army at the war's end either cannot recognize defeat when it stares them in the face, or fail to show bravery and resourcefulness in the dire circumstances they must confront. The main impact of these counter-examples, however, is to increase Kaji's stature as the principled but ruthlessly effective soldier, albeit one whose own moral sense is progressively degraded as the conditions in which he finds himself deteriorate. Kaji was in fact idolized in Japan in the late 1950s. Schoolgirls appeared to be in love with him, men admired him and his literary creator, Gomikawa Junpei, was inundated with fan letters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009413481830">42</xref></sup> After the film trilogy was completed it was sometimes shown in its entirety in all-night screenings; it is reported to have played to full houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009413481830">43</xref></sup> Arguably, Kaji in both book and film was the most prominent popular hero of the decade in Japan, even though he was a soldier, and indeed partly because he was a soldier. Shipman goes so far as to rate him ‘the definitive hero of this [twentieth] century’ in world terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009413481830">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Admiral Yamamoto, the pilot Wakabayashi and <italic>Human Condition</italic>'s Kaji all oppose the war in some way: Yamamoto argues against it on military and political grounds, Wakabayashi is disillusioned with it and considers his personal situation hopeless, and Kaji opposes it for ideological reasons. Their critical stance on the conflict was doubtless essential to the making of a successful war movie in the circumstances of the 1950s, after Japan’s comprehensive military defeat and occupation by foreign powers. Yet, stripped of their anti-war credentials, all three figures are surprisingly close to the ideal men of the wartime era. This is a striking parallel in view of the fact that the director of <italic>The Human Condition</italic>, at least, cannot be suspected of trying to make a film affirming the war. Respect for soldiers, or at any rate some individual soldiers, evidently transcended differences in ideology, scale of endeavour and artistic purpose in the 1950s Japanese cinema.</p>
<p>The films dealing with convicted war criminals, by contrast with other war movies, contain very few heroes, and very few bad soldiers. Rather, these films can be classed as ‘hymns to the ordinary man’. They do not deal with the ‘Class A’ war criminals, that is, the leading military and political figures tried at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo between 1946 and 1948 in the equivalent of the Nuremberg trials. Instead they focus on representatives of the 5700 Japanese soldiers tried for the direct commission of war crimes in the ‘Class B and C’ or ‘lesser’ war crimes trials that took place in numerous courtrooms around Asia and the Pacific between 1946 and 1951. The central characters of these movies are not particularly brave or resourceful and they are certainly not leaders. Nor, on the other hand, are they bad. The point made in cinema, as in memoirs and other cultural products of the decade, was that the men accused of so-called ‘lesser’ war crimes were very much ordinary soldiers, doing their duty in an ordinary and unspectacular way. If Yamamoto is presented in the two 1950s films about him largely as a military man, and Kaji is portrayed both as soldier and as individual human being, then the central characters in 1950s films about war criminals can be regarded as common men who happened to be soldiers. To the extent that anti-heroes exist in these movies, they are superior officers who force their subordinates into actions that are later deemed by the Allies to be criminal, and then make their own escape, leaving the lower-ranking soldier to his unenviable fate.</p>
<p>In the early part of the decade, social and political attitudes to war criminals were changing in Japan, after an initial postwar reaction against all military men and their families, and especially against accused war criminals. In particular, people were becoming more sympathetic towards ‘ordinary’ war criminals rather than the higher-profile figures prosecuted in the Class A trials. Discussion of war criminals had naturally been restricted during the Occupation, but after mid-1952, popular movies both contributed to and reflected the changing public mood.</p>
<p>The 1952 hit film, <italic>Sugamo no haha</italic>, or Sugamo Mother, directed by Adachi Nobuo, was one of a sub-group of ‘<italic>haha mono</italic>’ films (films focusing on mothers) that portrayed war criminals and their longsuffering mothers. <italic>Sugamo Mother</italic> is about a poor, widowed mother who has lost three sons in the war and at the beginning is waiting longingly at the port for the fourth, a former prison-camp guard, Komori Sueo. As soon as he does come back, however, Sueo is arrested as a suspected war criminal. The film emphasizes the emotional tie between mother and son, and the poverty and difficult circumstances of the old mother: in the words of the critics Joseph Anderson and Donald Richie, it was one of a group of movies that ‘sought to prove that imprisoning mothers’ sons was very immoral since their captivity caused mothers so much anguish’. These films, according to Anderson and Richie, showed that ‘mother still loved and waited for her imprisoned boy, no matter how many people he had tortured’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009413481830">45</xref></sup> Komori Sueo, however, was not supposed to have tortured anyone in any real sense. In an echo of a claim often made in contemporary commentary about the alleged triviality and even normality of the ‘crimes’ for which Japanese soldiers were tried, at least in the early period, Sueo is apparently prosecuted for something that ‘often happened during the war’ – slapping prisoners-of-war who because of communication difficulties had not followed the guards' orders or perhaps had tried to steal food behind their backs. Eventually Sueo is sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment with hard labour. Mrs Komori, whose neighbours refer to her as ‘<italic>Senpan-san</italic>’ (Mrs War Criminal), is forced to leave her lodgings, by implication probably because she is the mother of a war criminal, and is reduced to earning money by shining people’s shoes on the street in the bleak, cold weather. At one stage she cannot afford the train fare to visit her son in prison and has to walk. Eventually she becomes exhausted and falls gravely ill. Helped by Ariyoshi, a sympathetic Japanese warder who had been his wartime comrade, Sueo is temporarily released from jail on compassionate grounds to visit her deathbed, arriving just as she is about to expire. He makes his mother happy by lying to her for the first time in his life, telling her he has been released permanently. In fact he is taken back to prison as soon as she draws her last breath.</p>
<p>Kobayashi Masaki, who was later to direct <italic>The Human Condition</italic>, also made a movie about convicted Class B and C war criminals which takes the clear view that such ordinary soldiers should not be considered criminals in any normal sense of the word. The fact that the director of the deeply principled <italic>Human Condition</italic> made such a movie provides compelling evidence that the issue of ‘lesser’ war criminals crossed ideological and political boundaries. Kobayashi's <italic>Kabe atsuki heya</italic> (The Thick-Walled Room) was made in 1953 but not released until 1956,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009413481830">46</xref></sup> evidently because of wariness about how the US military would react, even after the end of the Occupation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009413481830">47</xref></sup> Based on a collection of published writings by convicted war criminals, it focuses on a small group of prisoners incarcerated in Cell 3M25 in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo in 1951–2. Yamashita, one of the four main characters, had been convicted by the French of unnecessarily killing a friendly ‘native’ so that he could take his food. In fact, First-Class Private Yamashita had been ordered by his superior officer, Lieutenant Hamada, to kill the native to prevent him informing others of the Japanese soldiers' presence in the area. Yamashita had twice demurred but on the officer's insistence, eventually killed the man. At the trial, Hamada gave false evidence against Yamashita, claiming that his subordinate had killed the native on his own initiative and completely unnecessarily. Yamashita is sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, whereas Hamada himself is sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, and is released around 1951. A second prisoner, Yokota, is also the victim of a more senior officer. An interpreter at a prisoner-of-war camp containing US soldiers, Yokota has to interpret for a non-commissioned Japanese officer when a prisoner is caught stealing biscuits from the store. Dissatisfied with Yokota's interpreting, the senior Japanese soldier forces him to beat the American with a leather belt. The prisoner is later made to parade naked before his fellow soldiers, whereupon he collapses and dies. Yokota is imprisoned for his part in these events. A third prisoner in Cell 3M25 is a Korean who had merely worked as a driver in a construction business that used prisoners-of-war as labour; he believes that someone had probably given false evidence against him in secret. The only one of the group who appears willingly to have participated in the mistreatment of the captured enemy, in this case in China, is so haunted by the memory that he hangs himself in the cell – suggesting that even those who were guilty had repented of their crimes. Characters in the film express anger not only against superior officers, but also against Class A war criminals; large financial conglomerates (<italic>zaibatsu</italic>) and the emperor for starting the war and thus for holding the real responsibility for the conflict; and Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru for not protecting the interests of ‘lesser’ war criminals in the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1952 by arranging for control of their sentences to be passed to Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009413481830">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another 1953 film told the story of Yamashita Tomoyuki, the Japanese general who, as the first defendant in the ‘lesser’ war crimes trials, was prosecuted for his ‘command responsibility’ for atrocities in the Philippines and Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009413481830">49</xref></sup> According to one reviewer, Yamashita was treated as a hero in the film but was entirely unconvincing as a human being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009413481830">50</xref></sup> By far the most prominent movie about war criminals, however, was the blockbuster of the late 1950s, <italic>Watashi wa kai ni naritai</italic> (I Want to be a Shellfish), which in 1958 was an enormously popular, award-winning two-part television drama, and then the following year appeared as a feature film directed by Hashimoto Shinobu, who had also written the script. Hashimoto was later to script the 1968 film <italic>Yamamoto Isoroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet.</italic> While <italic>Sugamo Mother</italic>, <italic>The Thick-Walled Room</italic> and <italic>Yamashita Tomoyuki</italic>, all made in 1952 and 1953, can be classed as films that attempted to influence the general view of war criminals at a time when public opinion on the subject was still evolving, <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic> was surely cashing in on an existing public mood. By the time it was made, only a few convicted criminals remained in jail; indeed, the television version was shown just as the last of them were unconditionally released. The story of the ‘lesser’ war criminals had by then become fodder for commercial exploitation. In fact, the original version of <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic> was an important event in the history of television itself. In these early years of Japanese television, relations between the television and film worlds were often tense and television had little access to established movie stars. Moreover, programmes were usually no longer than 30 minutes or so. This was the first time that television had offered a production to rival the quality of the studio films, with a popular lead actor in Frankie Sakai and an established scriptwriter in Hashimoto.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009413481830">51</xref></sup> The fact that the makers of <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic> committed such resources to the project strongly suggests that the situation of Class B and C war criminals had become a mainstream cultural topic. The appearance of <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic> greatly reinforced this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Based in part on the writings of Katō Tetsutarō, a convicted war criminal incarcerated in Sugamo Prison, the film tells the story of Shimizu Toyomatsu, a humble and likable Shikoku barber who is conscripted into the army late in the war and takes part in the defence of the homeland from within Japan. On one occasion, Shimizu and a comrade are instructed by their superior officer to bayonet a captured American flier. Though they falter the first time, they are forced to try again. Shimizu's weapon misses its target and he succeeds only in injuring the prisoner's arm, but the American is killed by the other bayonet. At the war’s end Shimizu returns happily to his wife, his child, his village and his business, but is later arrested and tried at Yokohama for war crimes. He protests his innocence but is convicted and executed. Just before he is hanged he bitterly proclaims that if he must be reborn in a future life, he does not want to come back as a human or any other sentient being: he would rather be a shellfish<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009413481830">52</xref></sup> clinging to a rock at the bottom of the sea, because such a creature feels no emotion, suffers no pain or anxiety, is never taken as a soldier and never goes to war. The television drama was so widely watched that the phrase ‘I want to be a shellfish’ had become fashionable even before the cinema version of the film was made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009413481830">53</xref></sup> (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022009413481830">Figure 1</xref>) The television drama was remade in 1994 and 2007, and a new film appeared in 2008, with a revised script by the original writer, Hashimoto Shinobu, now 90 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009413481830">54</xref></sup> The enduring popularity of <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic> suggests that this interpretation of the plight of Japanese war criminals has remained dominant or at least appealing. Even in 2008, claimed one critic, the phrase ‘I want to be a shellfish’ came readily to Japanese people's minds when they thought of war criminals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009413481830">55</xref></sup>

</p>
<p><italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic> makes the point very strongly that Shimizu had no choice but to bayonet the prisoner; the penalty of non-compliance with his superior's order would have been death. Shimizu was simply an ordinary soldier and an ordinary Japanese man, caught in circumstances well beyond his control, but made to suffer extreme consequences. The real criminals, it was implied, had managed to escape. The commentator Tsurumi Shunsuke was convinced by this kind of argument despite his avowed disapproval of the war and of patriotism, indicating again that the issue of ‘ordinary’ war criminals crossed ideological boundaries. After seeing <italic>The Thick-Walled Room</italic>, he commented that those convicted of Class B and C crimes had indeed been following the orders of their superiors. Ultimately they were the victims of a state that had forced them to commit terrible deeds, a state which later turned its back on them and sought to rewrite the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009413481830">56</xref></sup> The progressive novelist Enchi Fumiko wrote in a newspaper column, after seeing the advance notice of the film <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic>, about the horror of Shimizu's situation: he had been ‘dragged off to war, knowing nothing’, only to be accused of war crimes when the conflict ended and then executed. Ordinary Japanese people, she believed, must never be allowed to die like this again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009413481830">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>Films on war criminals, along with reporting in the popular media, played a key role in the process of rehabilitating regular soldiers who had been convicted of war crimes and reintegrating them into Japanese society. Komori Sueo, in <italic>Sugamo Mother</italic>, the prisoners in <italic>The Thick-Walled Room</italic> and Shimizu Toyomatsu, in <italic>I Want to be a Shellfish</italic>, were clearly ordinary men who had behaved according to the normal pattern for Japanese soldiers. While political and military leaders and superior officers might be culpable, Komori, Shimizu and others were presented as lower-ranking soldiers who had simply followed orders, men whose actions demanded sympathy and perhaps respect; indeed they were men ‘who had committed no crime’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009413481830">58</xref></sup> They deserved, according to the films that portrayed them, to return to their mothers, wives and children, to their villages and their former occupations.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of <italic>The Human Condition</italic>, 1950s war films in Japan as elsewhere were primarily a form of entertainment. They were produced because they made commercial sense at a time when mass culture was expanding rapidly. Critics were generally unenthusiastic. In 1953, for example, <italic>Eagle of the Pacific</italic> was the third most popular Japanese film in terms of takings and <italic>Battleship Yamato</italic> was number seven; <italic>Task Force</italic> was number six among foreign films. Of the 33 critics whose views were canvassed by the cinema magazine <italic>Kinema junpō</italic>, however, not one chose any of these films in his lists of the ‘top ten’ Japanese and foreign movies of the year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009413481830">59</xref></sup> Audiences had a different view. The popular war films were exciting, innovative in their techniques and special effects, and starred handsome leading men. They catered to nostalgia about brave young fliers, tropical locations, fast planes, big ships, military comradeship and the supposed social unity of wartime. As in other countries in this decade, war films provided for ‘a therapeutic pride in the glories of the past and a temporary escape from today's doldrums’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009413481830">60</xref></sup> Moreover, there is something distinctly transnational in the observation that ‘the public goes for the military man’, as the 1950s British matinee idol and former soldier Anthony Steel remarked when talking about his fan-mail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009413481830">61</xref></sup> The fact that most of the films discussed in this article are currently commercially available, and that several have been remade, suggests that the more positive aspects of the war experience have had long-term resonance for Japanese audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009413481830">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>War films did more, however, than provide entertainment and cultivate nostalgia for the lost experience of solidarity and sacrifice and the glory of young manhood. In the 1950s they helped to rewrite the story of the Second World War in Japan. They filled gaps in people's knowledge, presented them with heroes they could admire, and promoted the idea that ordinary soldiers convicted as war criminals were not so bad. War films of the 1950s were diverse in their aims, ideological stance and quality. Many, however, suggested that not everything about the war was bad, and that Japan's military had been essentially good and decent. People had certainly suffered terribly, but Japanese military forces had not been hopeless after all, Japanese soldiers had performed well and perhaps brilliantly, all had been patriotic but some nevertheless had understood the folly of the war, and even those deemed to have committed crimes had probably not done anything very dreadful when one knew the circumstances – or if they had, they had repented. Films about the conflict thus contributed to a broader process of national re-evaluation in which the war became a more respectable part of the collective Japanese experience, and in which those who had fought in that war were more easily absorbed back into a society now turning to the new preoccupations of economic growth.</p>
