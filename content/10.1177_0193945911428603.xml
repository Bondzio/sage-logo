<p>In October 2010, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute of Medicine jointly released the report <italic>The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911428603">Institute of Medicine, 2011</xref>). The <italic>Future of Nursing</italic> (<italic>FON</italic>) report envisions a health care system better able to provide high quality, affordable health care to a wider number of different patient populations than the current system, and it posits that nurses can and should play a central role in creating this improved system. The report identifies barriers and challenges to nurses fulfilling this role, suggesting that if nurses are to transform health care, then the nursing profession itself must be transformed. The report makes numerous specific recommendations with regard to changes in nursing practice, education, and leadership. As the <italic>FON</italic> report points out, health care is a complex, knowledge-driven system and data will be required to guide decision making at every level.</p>
<p>If nurses are to play a role in creating the health care system envisioned in the <italic>FON</italic>, by implication they will have to be adept at collecting, managing, analyzing, and interpreting data. This goes not just for research nurses—we already know that they must have these skills—but also for practitioners, educators, administrators, managers, policy makers, and thought leaders. Nurses will need to understand data collection quality procedures to ensure valid information is retrieved. They will need to know how to manage data sets. They will need to be able to calculate some statistics and interpret statistical results.</p>
<p>As I read the <italic>FON</italic> report, it struck me that an important question we should be asking is whether the nurses we are graduating have the skills necessary to understand data that they may be asked to gather or interpret in the course of their work. Presently, nursing students must fulfill certain math prerequisites prior to beginning clinical coursework, but these requirements may be insufficient under the new paradigm proposed by the <italic>FON</italic> report. In fact, I would argue these prerequisites may be inadequate even under our current system. It is common knowledge that some undergraduate nursing students are math challenged; undergraduate nursing programs are finding it necessary to test basic math skills related to calculating dosages, sometimes every semester. Instructors of graduate-level nursing courses often bemoan their students’ lack of statistical skills.</p>
<p>One might argue that nurses don’t need these advanced skills because they can hire expert consultants to manage data and conduct statistical analysis for them. But to uncouple statistical analysis from substantive understanding of where the data came from and how it will be used is a risky business. If we want autonomous, accountable nursing practice, then nurses should to be able to conduct and interpret analyses themselves so results are placed in the proper context. While statistical consultation may be essential for advanced analyses, nurses must possess adequate knowledge to meaningfully interpret findings produced by statistical consultants.</p>
<p>That math skills should be included among nurses’ core competencies is really not such a radical concept. Nursing’s famous and revered founder, Florence Nightingale, recognized the importance of systematic collection and analysis of data as a means for improving patient outcomes. A gifted statistician who excelled in data presentation, Nightingale was elected to Great Britain’s Royal Statistical Society and was also an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that acquisition of mathematic and analytic skills replace any of the traditional elements of nursing education related to compassionate, holistic patient care. Rather, familiarity and comfort with quantitative methods will augment nurses’ capacity to provide quality patient care by giving them the flexibility to readily examine evidence to solve practice problems and address challenges of quality assurance or workforce deficiencies.</p>
<p>The word mathematics is derived from the ancient Greek word <italic>máthēma</italic> and modern Greek word <italic>mathaino</italic>, which both mean “to learn.” In the future envisioned in the <italic>FON</italic> report, nurses will have to be able to learn through numbers. And that may require raising the bar with respect to the numeric competency of prospective nursing students and graduates alike.</p>
