<abstract>
<p>This article explores how social scientists, ethicists, and nanotechnologists construct research decisions together, while engaged in a Flemish participatory technology assessment on nanotechnologies. It finds that they routinely probe one another to make substantive contributions but avoid the argumentative initiative itself through various discursive strategies, such as reversing roles and delegating responsibility. It argues that these strategies emanate through the project’s methodology of co-inquiry, which depends on sharing and partnership, whereas some members resist participating on initiators’ terms. It links such “noncommunicative” action to unresolved disagreements between participants about project ends, conflicting approaches to decision making, and divergent appreciations of “uncertainty.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Flanders, Belgium, the Flemish government is funding a participatory technology assessment (pTA) project titled “Nanotechnologies for Tomorrow’s Society” (NanoSoc). Like related contemporary TA approaches,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1075547011408926">1</xref></sup> NanoSoc aims to integrate societal concerns into technological research and development before such processes close down or become locked in, thereby shifting the emphasis from control and prediction of technological impacts toward broad public involvement in technology at an early, “upstream” stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547011408926">Macnaghten, Kearnes, &amp; Wynne, 2005</xref>). To facilitate such aims, NanoSoc hosts successive deliberations involving both technical and nontechnical communities, such as stakeholders and citizens, over a 4-year period (2006-2010).</p>
<p>This article examines how social scientists, ethicists, and nanotechnologists in the NanoSoc “research consortium” (RC), or steering committee, jointly construct decisions concerning the project’s content and methods. It thus addresses the question as to how participatory, multiparty inquiry into nanotechnology and its social implications is established and specifically considers the difficulties and challenges such inquiry generates on a project level. Although it looks into a fairly specific context comprising Flanders, pTA, and nanotechnology, the significance of the analysis extends well beyond such specifics. This is because “cooperative inquiry,” which emphasizes the participation of most subjects in crafting research problems, designing inquiry methods, and distilling useful interpretations from findings, is an integral feature of action-oriented research across academic disciplines, professions, and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011408926">Oates, 2002</xref>). The inherently interdependent and complex nature of modern day problems defies a purely scientific, rational technique to problem solving. In the case of emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology, it is widely acknowledged that one cannot even address the challenges without sharing knowledge and actively communicating across fields.</p>
<p>However, sustained empirical examination of cross-disciplinary collaboration is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547011408926">Oborn &amp; Dawson, 2010</xref>). Nor has the role of language and communication in such endeavors been thoroughly investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547011408926">Monteiro &amp; Keating, 2009</xref>). It thus merits consideration to ask how cross-scientific, participatory inquiry is done, with the aim of better understanding the multiplicities of pooling subjects, resources, and disciplines, particularly as collaborators themselves acknowledge the difficulties of integrating different disciplinary paradigms and vocabularies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011408926">Davies, Wetherell, &amp; Barnett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011408926">Klein, 1990</xref>). More fundamentally, in focusing on the participation process itself (rather than on the outcomes participation produces), micro-level empirical research provides an important <italic>analytical lens</italic> through which participation realities are rendered more explicit. These realities take on the form of mutual exchange and reciprocity on behalf of those involved, as well as strategic behavior and contests over identity and power, which potentially hinder joint problem solving.</p>
<p>Last, understanding the intricacies of knowledge production is important from a science policy perspective, as decisions about new and emerging technologies, such as “nano,” are in formation and would benefit from appropriate analytical tool kits now, while research decisions are negotiated, crafted, and increasingly put to the test. As such, events of communication and collaboration between multiple participants set a context for political action.</p>
<p>To shed light on the co-inquiry process, we draw on participant observation and conversation analysis. Specifically, we analyze how turns are organized in NanoSoc teamwork meetings. The concept of turn taking is grounded in the understanding that speakers design their talk in specific ways—for instance, by restricting themselves to asking questions or to providing answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011408926">Hutchby, 1996</xref>). Thus, speakers seek not only to make a substantive contribution to discussion by “saying something” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547011408926">Schiffrin, 1987</xref>, p. 87) but also to orient the conversation so as to effectuate particular social actions. Of particular importance is Sacks’s observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547011408926">1992</xref>, p. 350) that “first-position” speakers, who initiate argumentative discourse or carry it forward, are in a weaker position than “those that get to go second, since the latter can argue with the former’s position simply by taking it apart.” Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011408926">Hutchby (1996</xref>, p. 578) argues that “[g]oing first means having to set your opinion on the line, whereas going second means being able to argue merely by challenging your opponent to expand on or account for his or her claims.” Consequently, in communicative interaction, one finds speakers trying to avoid first position or maneuvering others into taking first position. As we shall illustrate, these maneuvers materialize in the NanoSoc RC as well, where decisions to move forward rely on the group as a whole.</p>
<p>Having identified strategies in interaction, we ask how these persevere in the research setting we examine. We argue that the project’s guiding principle of co-inquiry provides a harmonious context for communicative exchange that fails to account for, and appreciate, power dynamics between participants. This is to say that co-inquiry as it is deployed in NanoSoc makes an abstract appeal to participants’ sense of sharing and partnership without providing correctives for “noncommunicative” interaction that subverts these principles. As a consequence, it is easy for participants to counteract collaboration, for instance, by resolutely downplaying other viewpoints. We read such strategizing action not just as a contestation of project means (e.g., how to deliver agreed benefits such as project funds) but also as resistance against the participatory arrangement in which actors play a part. In particular, members resist the consultative approach to research, which designates the responsibility of organizing research to <italic>all</italic> involved.</p>
<p>In what follows, we first present data extracts from one NanoSoc consortium meeting covering almost half an hour of conversation, to establish how parties to the pTA contest the central agenda item and refute one another’s commitments through a sequence of turns (the section Action and Resistance in the Research Consortium). Presenting a progression of immediate turns from the same meeting rather than isolated instances from different ones has the significant advantage of offering the reader insight into how the negotiations unfold. In this case, successive “unfoldings” foreground the principle of co-inquiry itself, which induces a tension between participants about the participatory effort. We argue that the way the tension comes about and how it is discussed are symptomatic of the closing down of co-inquiry in NanoSoc, as certain actors repeatedly resist the invitation to participate. Subsequently, by way of counterexample and as a means of better understanding how co-inquiry within the same context occasionally does effectuate some degree of “sharedness,” we explore a second RC meeting in which participants demonstrate a resolve to move forward (the section The Asymmetry of Co-Inquiry). Based on our findings, we conclude that participation is best understood not only as a coinquisitive, integrative activity, as it is often conceptualized in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1075547011408926">2</xref></sup> but also as a contested space in which the politics of resistance are a potentially determining dynamic. Accordingly, we explore contextual factors that sustain contestation in NanoSoc and derive broader suggestions for co-inquiry (the Discussion section).</p>

<title>Action and Resistance in the Research Consortium</title>
<p>Although its composition may vary slightly from meeting to meeting, the NanoSoc RC typically consists of 5 to 10 individuals, including project initiators (social scientists working in the area of TA), ethicists, and nanoscientists—a broad category comprising personnel from a nanotechnology research center and an academic research institute in Flanders. The group may be designated as being small task and consensus oriented because decisions are forged through deliberation and agreement—that is, no voting procedures are involved. Outcomes, rather, must be mutually ratified and sought in negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011408926">Diamond, 1996</xref>). Consequently, dissent and disagreement between members tend to be voiced indirectly, with speakers looking for openings to reject, evade, or silence others’ contributions and identities without seeming disrespectful or uncollegial, as we will see.</p>
<p>All data of the communicative interactions were collected using a digital audio recorder, which the first author operated and which did not appear to significantly affect group dynamics, as research participants barely cared to notice it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1075547011408926">3</xref></sup> Out of a total of eight recordings (20 hours and 8 minutes of conversation), one recording was discarded because of its inaudibility, leaving us with seven meetings (18 hours and 33 minutes) to examine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1075547011408926">4</xref></sup> Using our personal notes from participatory observation as a guide (containing summary descriptions of events, notes on nonverbal cues, explanations for long pauses, etc.), we considered independently from one another the instances where actors negotiate agenda items and probe each other for input in order to reach some kind of decision. We each transcribed verbatim these sections in Dutch, thereafter comparing our selections and listening again to the recordings countless times to ensure the accuracy of the final transcriptions and to weigh up our respective interpretations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1075547011408926">5</xref></sup> Based on this cross-comparison, we identified “noncommunicative” discourse in the interactions between participants as a prominent, if not central, feature of negotiation in the meetings examined. The portions of data we present thus reflect our reading of joint inquiry in the RC as a predominantly oppositional process in this phase of the NanoSoc project. Moreover, as these data embed themes that emerge time and again, such as “decision making,” “method,” and “uncertainty,” they touch on the bigger, ever-returning debate between members as to what constitutes the project’s aims and purpose, a point we pick up in the Discussion section.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1075547011408926">Table 1</xref> offers a concise overview of the first meeting under examination, including participants, location, main topic, and duration. Participants are subdivided into three categories to indicate the professional heterogeneity of the group and to accentuate that social scientists formally initiate the pTA project, which has potential implications for how RC members conduct themselves in relation to one another. Speakers appear in order of seniority from left to right, with Art, Chris, Terry, and Steve assuming a relatively higher rank than those behind them. We mention these differences in age and social status as seniors hold the floor for extended periods of time and tend to carry more weight in decisions, whereas those occupying a junior rank remain silent throughout meetings, thus contributing to a rather uneven participation overall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1075547011408926">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>Last, we stress our own parts in the participatory effort we examine, with the first author in the role of <italic>observer</italic> (hence confining himself to observing interactions, recording conversations, and taking notes) and the second author more fully engaged as <italic>participant</italic> in ways that will become apparent shortly. To reflect this distinction between us, the first author is not included as an RC member in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1075547011408926">Table 1</xref>, whereas the second appears under the name Harry.</p>
<sec id="section3-1075547011408926">
<title>Reporting on a Report</title>
<p>In the following data extracts, 9 RC members are seated at a large rectangular table in a university meeting room. They are there to discuss a report Harry drafted for project initiators Art and Chris, which outlines the issues, concerns, and recommendations stakeholders brought up for discussion at the 2008 NanoSoc Stakeholder Forum (SF). Stakeholders on this occasion comprised organizations representative of Flemish civil society, which were asked to identify “societal needs” in relation to nanotechnologies and offer suggestions on how to integrate such needs into institutes’ research and development agendas. In addition, as these questions bore a direct significance on the two nanotechnology organizations involved in the NanoSoc project, several nanotechnologists from these institutes were invited to participate in the SF as well.</p>
<p>As an indication of recommendations that arose at the event, one group of participants suggested implementing techniques of long-term scenario planning in research organizations as a form of strategic learning. Another suggested anchoring, and more rigorously applying, the principles of precaution and sustainability in research, as well as having an independent watchdog scrutinize industry performance.</p>
<p>Most of the RC members, including those encountered in the data extracts below, were also present at the SF, where they either witnessed, or took part in, the subgroup deliberations between civil society spokespersons, members of research institutes, civil servants, and others. Social scientists confined themselves to observing the interactions between the various parties and to jotting down stakeholders’ concerns. Harry then crafted a report summarizing stakeholders’ recommendations, including the two examples above. In Extract 1, Harry has just run through the “key findings” of his report by way of a 15-minute PowerPoint presentation. We enter the meeting at a moment when Terry, who is the first RC member to take the floor after Harry’s presentation, professes to have doubts about Harry’s conclusions.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig1.tif"/>
<p>In this interaction, Terry (T) tells Harry that it is not wise to use the report as a basis for subsequent action in NanoSoc (line 5) and that he is hesitant about bringing it into connection with research strategy (lines 6-8). Terry’s professed hesitancy in line 7 prompts a response from project initiator Chris (C), who asks Terry to expound on his reservations (lines 9-10). Terry in turn points to one of three bullet points on a handout Chris provided to all RC members. His answer in lines 12 and 13 suggests that he takes issue with the “third objective” of constructing a (nanotechnology) research agenda on the basis of Harry’s report, as the slide on the handout proposes and as is the avowed aim of the NanoSoc project. However, Terry does not motivate the grounds for his hesitancy. He merely suggests there is something wrong with the objective, leaving open a range of possible interpretations.</p>
<p>We do not speculate as to why Terry leaves his question in the open but point to two interrelated features of his intervention as the conversation now stands. First, in quickly addressing Harry in response to Chris’s question (line 17), Terry does not answer the question he is asked. Second, Terry does not present an opinion. Rather than suggesting how the report could be improved, he asks for more clarification. Let us now consider how the conversation ensues in Extract 1 continued.</p>
<p>In line 18, Chris does not wait for Harry to respond to Terry. Instead, he tells Terry that the report elucidates “information” and “visions” and suggests that it should render visible such (worthwhile) data (line 24). Possibly in an attempt to reach out to Terry, he indicates that the report is open to extension (line 23) and, hence, modification, based on additional input. Terry’s response is polite, if not conciliatory, as his assertion that he agrees with Chris suggests (line 25). Yet he does not respond to Chris’s invitation but instead again confronts <italic>Harry</italic> after Harry tentatively enters the conversation in line 26. In lines 28 and 29 and thereafter, Terry reiterates some of his earlier points and criticizes Harry’s report accordingly. Apart from urging Harry to do justice to the “fine quality of the discussions” (line 36), he does not make concrete suggestions to amend the report’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>The implication of Terry’s intervention is that he is picking apart the report on the table without substantiating an alternative view on how to proceed with the analysis (and with the NanoSoc project in general). Rather than answering to Chris, who does not reemerge in the conversation until several minutes later, he has moved Harry to first position, while also avoiding first position for himself by addressing Harry throughout his talk. What is more, shortly after Terry’s intervention Steve (S) challenges the report as well in Extract 2.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig2.tif"/>
<p>In this interchange, Steve reiterates an earlier argument of Terry’s, notably that drawing statistically significant conclusions from the SF is impossible as not all relevant stakeholders were present in the event (lines 2-3). He adds that he is in full agreement with Terry on this matter, emphasizing that he and Terry share a mutual concern (line 1). Steve thus uses “Terry” as a discursive marker to challenge the report; more specifically, in line 11, he suggests the need for a “conceptual framework” that permits “us” to make sense of the data. However, like Terry before him, Steve does not offer suggestions for how such a task can be accomplished. Rather, he pushes <italic>other</italic> members to come up with (better) ideas, as his next exchange with Harry in Extract 3 indicates.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig3.tif"/>
<p>In both lines 1 and 3, Harry seeks to promote a more substantive contribution from Steve by probing him for methodological answers. But in line 2, Steve replicates his earlier argument (establishing “the inventory” is not enough), again leading Harry to request more information. Then in lines 4 to 7, Steve draws on an obdurate role distinction between social and natural scientists that is to be heard both within and outside NanoSoc. Here, he attributes the responsibility of coming up with a method to sociologists, that is, project initiators. Rather than making methodological suggestions or arguing a particular counterposition in the debate, Steve claims not to have the social-scientific competence to devise a methodology. What is more, by declining the participant status Harry attributes to him, he avoids first position.</p>
<p>Following Steve’s remarks, a brief interaction ensues between Art and Steve about method, after which Chris responds as follows in Extract 4.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig4.tif"/>
<p>Here, Chris expounds on the interactive rationale that characterizes NanoSoc in reaction to Steve’s remarks. He suggests that various stakeholders can make a substantive contribution to scientific decision making by voicing their perspectives, just as citizens and scientists did in previous NanoSoc events (lines 7-9). Then in lines 9 to 10, he picks up on Steve’s earlier comment that NanoSoc lacks an “overarching theory,” which allegedly restricts findings to a descriptive inventory. Steve again singles out points of criticism in his reply: He stresses the word <italic>any</italic> in line 16 and describes the inventory as “ordinary” in line 18. More significantly still, he concludes by throwing Chris’s question as to what constitutes a “relevant distinction” (lines 20-21) back at him (line 22), again turning the tables. The conversation ensues with Chris and Art arguing their views and Steve asking more questions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1075547011408926">
<title>The Asymmetry of Co-Inquiry</title>
<p>The sequences above are indicative of the discursive strategies certain actors in NanoSoc deploy to resist agenda items and commitments. It is important to recognize that these dynamics play out regularly in the meetings we analyzed, particularly as given the RC’s limited membership, one or two members may stall or deadlock group decision making. This is because all parties depend on the mutual ratification of topics and procedures to execute the common agenda, as no one is in a position to make decisions for others. However, an unintended consequence of this consensual arrangement is that no substantive answers are coproduced when members avoid the burden of (shared) responsibility, as do Terry and Steve in the examples above.</p>
<p>We return to these points shortly. For now, let us consider how the meeting develops. Members Bruce and Al, who have thus far largely restrained from participating in conversation, make attempts to reinvigorate it, with Bruce urging the consortium to move on with the project despite its alleged methodological shortcomings. Similarly, Steve’s criticism prompts a lengthy response from project initiator Art, as follows in Extract 5.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig5.tif"/>
<p>Art’s account is noteworthy for at least two reasons: First, like Chris previously, he is arguing the merits of an interactive approach in answer to Steve, whom he references explicitly in lines 3 and 14. Second, he does not prescribe a particular method or end goal of participation. Rather, he exclaims that method needs to be validated collectively even if it is “still abstract” (line 12), a view he substantiates rhetorically by forcefully appealing to “togetherness” no less than three times (lines 2, 3, and 8) and again in a softer tone in lines 7 and 13, as well as through his usage of an inclusive “we” throughout his talk. Art thus foregrounds the process of collective, cooperative inquiry rather than the (technological) outcomes such inquiry generates. We designate this repertoire he draws on as <italic>harmonious co-inquiry</italic>, as he is casting inquiry in terms of collective searching and unforced consensus seeking in which the act of participation outweighs the end results that the process generates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1075547011408926">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Art’s utterances elicit mixed responses from RC members, with Steve being the first to answer. Although he acknowledges Art’s explanation (lines 15-16), he subsequently declares that the data the project generates need to be fitted in a larger theoretical “framework.” He thus reiterates his earlier argument that NanoSoc lacks a methodology that enables “meaningful” data analysis. His remarks again threaten to deadlock conversation. However, in an interesting move that repositions him as a contributor to the conversation rather than as a challenger only, Terry, who has thus far argued in opposition to Harry and project initiators (see Extract 1), now rejoins the discussion to probe Steve for a contribution, as follows in Extract 6.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig6.tif"/>
<p>In lines 1 to 3, Terry shifts the focus from “method” in the abstract toward technological “road mapping,” thereby pushing Steve to make his own suggestions based on methods and procedures Steve is familiar with, while adding that the rest of the consortium may learn from his experiences (line 1). By inviting Steve to construct a course of action for other members, Terry positions Steve as a “resource person” who brings in ideas and creates policy for others to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011408926">Diamond, 1996</xref>, p. 95).</p>
<p>Yet Terry’s persistent probing does not lead Steve to accept a lead role, as Steve avoids the responsibility that comes with first position: In line 5, he implicates other agents (located outside the NanoSoc project) in the task at hand. Subsequently, he shifts the task of coming up with a reply to Bruce (line 11), who then complies to answer. What follows is a lengthy exploration of road-mapping strategies, often laden with jargon, understanding checks, and silences. The conversation on this topic comes to a close several minutes later with a vague resolve to move forward but with no articulation of commitments on behalf of contributing parties to the meeting.</p>
<p>We stop here to consider the way conversation is structured in the RC. The language of co-inquiry, which normatively directs deliberation (and which Art seeks to instigate in Extract 5), induces a power asymmetry between interlocutors when some of them do not adhere to the dialogical constraints of sharing and partnership that are meant to govern their interactions. Actors who commit to these principles must systematically answer to “second positioners,” whereas the latter are given free reign to construct their discursive attacks and avoid having to provide substantive answers themselves, as Terry’s and Steve’s contributions in particular indicate.</p>
<p>Obviously, this does not mean that those in second position always take advantage of their discursive prerogative or that they rigidly stick to opposition only (compare Terry’s “positionings” in Extracts 1 and 6). Nor does it imply that those in first position confine themselves to that role in each meeting. The point, rather, is that the participatory framework provides no counteractive for “noncommunicative” action, other than an abstract appeal to collaboration (as again Art’s plea in Extract 5 makes clear).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1075547011408926">8</xref></sup> It is this feature that enables participants to continuously pass on the responsibility of coming up with answers to one another. As we have seen, Terry and Steve attribute the responsibility of coming up with answers to members other than themselves (even to one another), whereas Art and Chris contribute it to the RC as a whole (Extracts 4 and 5, respectively). In each case, however, the actors in question commit <italic>other</italic> parties to the task at hand, while it is unclear how they commit themselves.</p>

<title>Reorienting Debate</title>
<p>Thus far we have explored how resistance unfolds in the RC and have argued that the principle of co-inquiry enables a context conducive to “noncommunicative” action on pTA terms. Based on our observations, we see participation in the RC emerge as a twofold process of opposition and delegation; a process that leaves ample room for the mutual exploration of viewpoints and certainly allows for the agency of others but paradoxically also induces an environment in which participants routinely do not accept decision-making accountability. This does not mean, however, that participants always attack and defend set positions. On some occasions they do demonstrate a concern of coming up with answers together. As such occurrences can provide indications as to when and how co-inquiry is more effectual, we single out sequences from an RC meeting held prior to the SF in which members explore how to organize the event (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1075547011408926">Table 2</xref>). We suggest that “sharedness” between participants is achieved partly through the input of two non-RC members, that is, facilitators external to the NanoSoc project who have been asked to mediate the interactions between stakeholders at the SF and are therefore also present in this particular meeting. In addition, it appears that <italic>opposition</italic> to a proposed line of action induces joint inquiry, insofar as it reinvigorates debate. Let us now consider how this condition is attained. The meeting is 1 hour underway when Steve criticizes the “plan of action” for the SF, which the two facilitators have come up with in close consultation with project initiators. His intervention follows a previous comment by Terry, who expressed a concern that the SF format “underestimates” the extent to which stakeholders are knowledgeable about nanotechnology, because it requires them to reflect like “citizens.” Terry here refers to a previous deliberative activity in NanoSoc in which members of the public were invited to talk about their day-to-day experiences with modern technologies and which project initiators and facilitators appear to propagate vis-à-vis stakeholders as well. In Extract 7, Steve picks up on Terry’s reference to citizens to question the SF format as it now stands.</p>

<p>Above, Steve and Terry build on one another’s inputs to question how facilitators envision the SF. In line 14, Terry explicitly invites Steve to elaborate on his concerns, thus inciting (more) mutual questioning of the method on the table. Steve responds by suggesting that stakeholders involved in policy making must be addressed in a very different manner than citizens who participated in an earlier stage of the NanoSoc project (line 16), which is in line with Terry’s earlier remark. Note also that Steve proclaims not to know what stakeholders have thus far been told (presumably, by those initiating the SF) in relation to the upcoming event (lines 18-19) and may therefore not be in a position to “judge” the scenario he is probing (line 17). Although he adds that stakeholders may be expecting an “informative discussion” (line 19), he does not suggest what such a discussion could look like.</p>
<p>Thus far, the conversation bodes ill for joint decision making, as Steve and Terry resist the approach on the table in ways that resemble their interventions in the previously examined meeting. Yet this dynamic changes through the following exchange in Extract 7 continued, between Steve and facilitator Percy (P).</p>
<p>In this sequence, Percy twice urges Steve to build his own view of the SF format. First he asks Steve whether <italic>he</italic> thinks the SF should take the form of an informative discussion (lines 21-22); then he asks Steve to expound on <italic>his</italic> expectations in relation to the event (line 32). Yet, in line 23, Steve responds that it is important to take into account what “they” (i.e., stakeholders) expect from the event. Subsequently, in line 33, he appears genuinely surprised that he is asked to voice his own expectations.</p>
<p>The point of interest here is the mismatch between Percy’s questions and Steve’s answers, as Steve’s insistence on taking into account stakeholders’ needs shifts the orientation of the conversation from debating the needs of “NanoSoc” and/or his own toward exploring stakeholders’ expectations (as does his proposal in line 38 to construct a “win-win situation”). This subtle reorientation instantly reinvigorates debate, as in the next 15 minutes facilitators and various senior RC members consider how to meet the latter’s expectations of the SF.</p>
<p>In other words, through their interaction Percy and Steve have (unwittingly) provoked a reinterpretation of the question at hand. Whereas prior to their interchange conversation centered primarily on how the SF is to have value for the NanoSoc project, it now explicitly revolves around exploring stakeholder concerns in relation to the event. Consequently, nanoscientist James suggests that project initiators devote more time to presenting the NanoSoc endeavor at the start of the SF, as stakeholders are not familiar with the project, to which Chris responds by proposing that he and Art refer to similar initiatives in other countries to add weight to their presentations. While such suggestions may appear trivial, the point is that they are jointly explored through argumentation <italic>and</italic> counterargumentation, particularly as Chris is in disagreement with James as to how much time is to be allotted to explaining the project up front. Chris’s proposal to incorporate examples from abroad in his presentation could thus be read as a counteroffer intended to meet James’s concern.</p>
<p>What is more, Terry, who so often argues in opposition to project initiators, acknowledges Chris’s contribution and then goes on to make a concrete suggestion as to how stakeholders at the SF are to be addressed as seen in Extract 8.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1075547011408926-fig8.tif"/>
<p>In lines 1-2, Terry challenges one of several questions facilitators intend to ask stakeholders. Yet, rather than merely disputing the question’s validity, he explains why the question in its present form is redundant (as Steve will have addressed it in a presentation prior to the SF; lines 5-6) and attempts an alternative (lines 13-14). Thus in this brief moment, the customary first and second positions are reversed, as Terry brings a relatively new suggestion to the table, which other members are in a position to attack without having to set out an argument. What follows after Terry’s intervention, however, is quite different from the adversarial debate we witnessed in the previously examined meeting. Instead of attacking Terry’s proposal, participants finish each other’s utterances or chains of thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1075547011408926">9</xref></sup> Percy, in particular, makes an attempt to concretize Terry’s counterproposal (lines 21-22 and 24-25), to which Terry responds affirmatively (line 23).</p>
<p>The above conversation suggests that occasionally, reflective exchange of viewpoints and joint exploration is feasible in the RC, even if participants subsequently struggle to make operational their joint understanding and certain members again contest proposals without debating them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1075547011408926">10</xref></sup> The feel of these interactions is also distinctly more optimistic and good spirited than in the meeting after the SF: a point worth noting although it is hard to support empirically.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings raise a number of questions and concerns about co-inquiry in NanoSoc and about action research founded on participation in general, as they provide clues as to how such research is stimulated or, conversely, disrupted. One factor that potentially impedes participatory research is <italic>design related</italic>, as participants are given free reign to subvert the terms of participation on which co-inquiry depends. Yet the fact that participants resort to strategizing action does not, in itself, explain why they are compelled to do so. In this section, we cautiously propose three interrelated factors that induce resistance in the RC: conflicting approaches to decision making, unresolved disagreements between participants about the project’s ends, and divergent appreciations of “uncertainty.” We turn again to the empirical data to extract each of these but also broaden our understandings to include both participants’ and our own experiences beyond the confines of the RC.</p>
<sec id="section7-1075547011408926">
<title>Approaches to Decision Making</title>
<p>A central issue of contention in the first examined meeting (hereafter M1) concerns “method.” Terry criticizes Harry for his lack of precision in defining key notions such as “privacy” in his report (Extract 1 continued, line 35), whereas Steve argues that Harry’s report does not exceed basic descriptive analysis (e.g., Extract 2). Project initiators stress that method has to be constructed collectively through both ongoing consultation and exchange of viewpoints (Extract 4, line 1, and most of Extract 5). It is clear, however, that neither Terry nor Steve respond to the invitation of building a method collectively. In the meeting held prior to the SF (hereafter M2), Terry is more forthcoming and Steve contributes to reorienting the conversation in ways that temporarily incite mutual exploration of the approach at hand. However, Steve does not actively participate in such exploration himself. Moreover, the reorientation he induces was not accomplished by means of collaborative inquiry; rather, one could argue it came about through opposition (Extract 7).</p>
<p>So where does Terry and Steve’s reluctance, if not refusal, to engage in debate with other RC members come from? We suggest factors are at play that rest as much on seemingly trivial misunderstandings between actors as on differences across professional identities. At the outset of the project, Steve exclaimed to Art that he sought not to “intrude” on the terrain of the social sciences, as this would prove “uncollegiate” and denigrate the “disciplinary uniqueness of sociology.” Thus, he expressed a concern with respecting the integrity of disciplinary identities, including those of project initiators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1075547011408926">11</xref></sup> Other RC members, as well as participants more tangentially involved in the project, have likewise argued that “social scientists” must initiate the project’s design, with one natural scientist exclaiming, “It is inevitable that you [social scientists] devise procedures with which we can work, because we do not have the know how.” Project initiators, on the other hand, have repeatedly sought to involve all participants in decisions about both content and method (by inviting them to contribute as much as possible) and have uttered their frustration that not all participants contribute equally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1075547011408926">12</xref></sup> From their perspective, research is necessarily an experientially grounded, extractive process that is negotiated and relearned by every participant and every group in every new instance. Hence, it makes little sense epistemically to develop a method of inquiry independently of the other actors involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011408926">Klein, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547011408926">Reason, 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1075547011408926">
<title>Project Ends</title>
<p>In M1, the issue of project ends is embedded in the question, “Data to which ends and for what purpose?” Terry, for instance, is hesitant about using the data derived from the SF as a basis for ensuing action in NanoSoc (Extract 1, line 7). The issue becomes more pronounced in Extract 5, where Art expounds on the project’s rationale. The fact that Art goes to considerable lengths to address the project’s purpose and carefully articulates his perspective vis-à-vis contending interpretations suggests its importance. In M2, participants disagree on how to approach stakeholders at the SF. Yet debate is temporarily reinvigorated when attention shifts away from considering the needs of NanoSoc toward debating the expectations of stakeholders. Arguably, this reorientation both makes the discussion more tangible and gives it more weight, as it appears easier for Steve and Terry to deliberate stakeholders’ interests in nanotechnology than to define the goals of a pTA project in the making. It is also clear from their utterances that the two of them are eager to leave a good impression on stakeholders (Extract 7, lines 12-13 and 16-17). Hence, they have an investment in the outcome of the conversation, which is much less the case in M1.</p>
<p>Ironically, one reason Terry and Steve resort to opposition may thus have to do with the limited access <italic>they</italic> have to cultural and rhetorical resources (despite the fact that they operate from a potentially powerful “second position”). Whereas project initiators foreground the process of searching for common answers as an experimental learning process, Steve and Terry struggle to develop a voice in a process that does not fix the end terms of the experiment. In other words, they cannot draw on existing role models, traditions, or prior experiences to make sense of their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011408926">Felt &amp; Fochler, 2010</xref>). Although project initiators would no doubt answer that they are in the unknown as much as anyone else, it may make sense to consider the discussion about method and validity in this light.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1075547011408926">
<title>Notions of “Uncertainty”</title>
<p>The dispute about method may be referred to again. Choosing established methods and categories rather than fabricating new approaches can help actors overcome the difficulties of a potentially disrupting decision-making situation. Hence, in M1 Terry and Steve refer to more familiar, statistical approaches in an attempt to cope with the uncertainties that confront them. Project initiators, on the other hand, appear more comfortable with showing their own doubts and internal struggles (or so at least does Art in relation to “method,” for instance in Extract 5, line 12), which they see as valuable to the processes of learning and reflection through experimentation.</p>
<p>On a more critical note, however, instigating new designs to cope with uncertainties implicitly amounts to denouncing existing ones, as these are found deficient and are therefore in need of improvement. Prompting new approaches can even contribute to “locking up the existing government frame even more firmly,” as it puts its adherents on the defensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011408926">Termeer, 2009</xref>). Thus, in M1, perhaps Steve and Terry resist the search for new methods because they feel that more “statistical” means of analysis and learning technique, which they find useful, are disregarded. Steve’s assertion that NanoSoc has never held the “pretension” to yield statistically relevant data (Extract 2, line 5) then reads as an implicit criticism that the project ought to generate such data or at least accommodate established methods and techniques, as without these Steve has fewer resources to work with.</p>
<p>From our close observations of interaction in the RC and our—concise—attempt to derive broader interpretations through them, we infer that actors in NanoSoc resort to “noncommunication” because of mutual misunderstandings, different expectations, and motivations in relation to participation, among <italic>a range of other possible causes</italic> that remain to be explored and properly understood. While it is possible to read strategizing action between members as deliberate attempts at effectuating contrary actions or even as malicious manipulation, a more modest interpretation suggests that participants serve concerns that are established in interaction in a given conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547011408926">Dewulf, Craps, &amp; Dercon, 2004</xref>). The fact that Terry cooperates in M2 adds weight to this suggestion, as does the SF itself, where Steve was noted to produce more supportive accounts in his exchanges with stakeholders. Hence, resistance to co-inquiry within the RC should be understood as principled opposition not to sharing and partnership but to the ways these norms are enacted in the consortium with its inherent procedures, programs, and etiquettes.</p>
<p>We ground this reading also in our tacit knowledge of NanoSoc as a whole—that is, based on our intimate involvement in the project. Although it is impossible to uncover the full range of such experience in a single space as this one, it may be noted that project initiators and other RC members recognize many of the dynamics we describe and even take our analysis as a source of insight. For instance, Al acknowledges our observation that RC members avoid first position in team meetings and therefore suggests that the RC engages “a neutral moderator” to guide conversation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1075547011408926">13</xref></sup> While we agree that a moderator can invigorate debate, we believe NanoSoc would benefit most from adding more voices to the mix, as with a few more participants in the room it is much harder for just one or two actors to obstruct conversation and get away with it. This measure could also sway challengers such as Terry toward collaboration (see Extract 8).</p>
<p>However, the aim should not be to exclude argument or to restrain opposition. As suggested earlier, in M2 the mutual exchange of ideas comes about despite, or even through, Steve’s resistance to a proposed line of action. It is through his unwillingness to oblige, and another participant’s probing, that a fruitful exploration of viewpoints is prompted. As such, there is more need in NanoSoc for an open discussion about problem definitions, the various interests at stake, and the nature of the pTA itself than for a neutral moderator who ensures that all members have a say.</p>
<p>Paradoxically then, oppositional discourse can produce, and help sustain, the generative dialogue NanoSoc initiators are after. In line with this finding, we stress that while deadlock is clearly a problematic feature of interaction in the RC, it should not be perceived of in negative terms only. Rather, it provides a resource for individual and group agency. Perceived in this manner, unintended effects such as deadlock can enrich our appreciation of participatory inquiry and open alternatives. Clarifying how actors conduct themselves in relation to one another and to the participatory format opens a possibility of realistically dealing with divergent needs, understandings, and interests as they are expressed through complex processes of negotiation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article illustrates how members of a Flemish pTA on nanotechnology wield conversational strategies to resist participatory inquiry. It finds that core members of the project’s RC systematically maneuver other speakers into “first position,” thereby obliging the latter to take the argumentative initiative, while they themselves refrain from engaging on the same terms. As a result, joint decision making is frequently impracticable. The article argues that opposition of this kind is conditioned through the discourse of harmonious co-inquiry, which guides the project and which requires that all actors share their views and knowledge but eludes the possibility of “noncommunicative” action. It grounds such action in participants’ different appreciations of decision making, project ends, and uncertainty, among other reasons. The article may hence be read as an attempt to establish how calls to cooperative research impose specific engagements on participants, such as the burden of joint inquiry, to which participants respond by exploring the possibilities of refusal.</p>
<p>The significance of rendering explicit the discerned microresistances is at least threefold and concerns researchers and practitioners of participatory inquiry across disciplines and professions. For one, understanding how power actually operates through participation is a necessary prerequisite to ensuring more symmetrical dialogical relations, as without concern for the concrete dynamics at play, asymmetries between participants may intensify and harden, as we have seen.</p>
<p>Second, conceiving of participation as a political activity, imbued as it is with ongoing processes of contestation and subversion, complicates overtly optimistic conceptions of participation as a shared process toward mutually gratifying outcomes. While there is little doubt that co-inquiry frameworks such as NanoSoc provide valuable opportunities for social learning, consensus seeking, and knowledge building, it should be possible to consider their effectiveness also in terms of the possibilities they envisage for those involved to withstand such predefined aims. Hence, effectiveness as well as “communication” may be broadened to incorporate the manners in which participants revoke and alter their context of interaction, even if this implies refusing participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011408926">Foucault, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547011408926">Quaghebeur, Masschelein, &amp; Nguyen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, it is relevant to draw out the broader “worldviews” that sustain actors’ values, needs, and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011408926">Johnson, 1998</xref>). When conflicting views on participation are not easily communicated, discussed, and confronted, actors may coconstruct a setting that is barricaded rather than communicative. While such a context may well produce favorable results in particular instances, as a general strategy it hinders the process of joint decision making, with potentially devastating effects on mutual images and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011408926">Termeer, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcription/Translation Procedure</title>
<p>All data in this article are translated from Dutch, the language in which audio material was analyzed. Below, we present a parallel translation of Extract 1 (37:05:05) in the article. The original Dutch transcript is in the left-hand column, followed by the English translation on the right. The extract illustrates how we adopted a word-for-word translation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011408926">ten Have, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As both Dutch and English are Germanic languages, the order of words and some sounds are similar. This alikeness is reflected in the extract below, where the translation has been kept as truthful to the original as possible, with minor modifications to preserve the natural feel or tone of conversation. For instance, in line 20, we have translated Chris’s utterance in Dutch, “<italic>Maar verduidelijk een keer Terry . . .</italic>,” as “But could you clarify Terry . . .”; that is, we have added the auxiliary “could” to Chris’s request for clarification rather than opted for the literal translation “But clarify (<italic>verduidelijk</italic>) Terry . . .,” which is an uncommon way of making a request in (formal) English and fails to capture the degree of politeness in the question.</p>
<p>Overlaps, latches, pauses, hesitations, self-corrections, and so on are kept in place in the English translation, albeit with a few language-related limitations. Hence, in line 23 a single question mark at the end of Chris’ utterance indicates his rising intonation in the English transcript, whereas in Dutch a rising inflection is audible in the word <italic>precies</italic>. These minor adaptations aside, the English transcripts are almost literal translations of the Dutch versions.

<p>It may be added that senior members from one of the involved research institutes showed up only occasionally or not at all at team meetings. Junior attendees and those occupying a middle rank between juniors and seniors were present far more often, although the latter were occasionally seen to be checking emails and reading articles on their laptops.</p>

<p>Art deploys the same repertoire at different moments in the meeting, calling on RC members to make decisions “together” based on “discussion and deliberation” (00:00:24) and again arguing that developing method is done by “working together” (1:37:00).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011408926">Flyvbjerg (2001)</xref> makes a similar argument in relation to Habermas’s discourse ethics, which appeals to a universal reason on behalf of citizens but fails to provide the necessary “checks and balances” that regulate power and organize the processes of democracy at large.</p>

<p>Some issues that were debated subsequently remained in the open; for example, a discussion developed between project initiators and RC member/nanotechnologist James on how to define the roles of RC members at the SF. Although the issue was twice brought up (early in the meeting and again much later), it remained undecided. As a consequence, RC members adopted different, if not divergent, roles at the SF: an outcome James, in particular, had sought to avoid.</p>

<p>To give an example from M1: On discussing the issue of collaboration between RC members, Art deplores the uneven division of labor between “human scientists” and “nanoscientists,” with the former assuming a heavier task load and taking more initiative (03:10:75).</p>
