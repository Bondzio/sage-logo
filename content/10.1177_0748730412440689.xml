<p>Females of the Indian meal moth, <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic>, and females of the Mediterranean flour month, <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic> (both Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), exhibit daily rhythms in calling behavior.

This behavior turned arrhythmic in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> females in constant darkness (DD) and remained arrhythmic in constant light (LL), whereas <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> females showed a persistent rhythm in DD and suppression of the behavior in LL, indicating regulation by a circadian clock mechanism.

<body>
<p>Daily rhythms in sexually relevant behaviors are commonly regulated by circadian clocks in insects. In most moth species, females rely on sex pheromones to attract males before mating, and several mechanisms have been proposed to prevent costly interspecific attraction. Several studies have focused on temporal isolation of sexual activity in closely related insect species. A prime example is the Queensland fruit flies <italic>Bactrocera tryoni</italic> and <italic>Bactrocera neohumeralis</italic>, which occur as sympatric species even though laboratory hybrids, including all backcrosses, are fully fertile. Whereas <italic>B. neohumeralis</italic> mates at high light intensity and during the midday, <italic>B. tryoni</italic> prefers mating at low light intensities and at dusk. This difference in behavior causes practically complete reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730412440689">Smith, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Another example is the sympatric noctuid moths <italic>Spodoptera latifascia</italic> and <italic>Spodoptera descoinsi</italic>; they share their main sex pheromone component but the latter species is sexually active during the second half of the scotophase and the former species is active during the early scotophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730412440689">Monti et al., 1995</xref>). Similar differences have been described in the closely related <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> and <italic>Lymantria monacha</italic> (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). These species also share the same main pheromone component, but the daily peak of males trapped with pheromone baits shows that mate search occurs at different hours of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730412440689">Giebultowicz and Zdarek, 1996</xref>). These distinct differences between closely related species suggest an adaptive pressure on the temporal phase of sexually relevant daily rhythms.</p>
<p>This study focuses on 2 species of pyralid moths, the Mediterranean flour moth, <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic>, and the Indian meal moth, <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic> (both Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), which are cosmopolitan pests that feed on a wide variety of stored products. These species are almost exclusively found indoors and have most likely been dispersed from their original habitats by transportation of food products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412440689">Palm, 1986</xref>). Like the majority of moth species, <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> females rely on sex pheromones to attract males before mating, and several sex pheromone components have been identified in both species (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730412440689">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730412440689">Ryne, 2001</xref>). Like the mentioned <italic>Lymantria</italic> and <italic>Spodoptera</italic> species, <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> share the same main pheromone component, (<italic>Z,E</italic>)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate (Z,E-9,12-14:OAc), which is also used by several other closely related species, such as <italic>Ephestia elutella</italic> and <italic>Cadra cautella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412440689">Kuwahara and Casida, 1973</xref>). As this compound alone is sufficient to attract males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730412440689">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730412440689">Kuwahara and Hara, 1971</xref>) and several species may occur in sympathy, mechanisms to avoid interspecies attraction have likely evolved even though the 2 species never crossbreed. The primary aim of this study was therefore to compare circadian rhythms of sexually relevant behavior in <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> to find indications of divergent phase shifts in behavioral activity.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical investigation was focused on neuropeptide pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN), corazonin (Crz), and pigment dispersing factor (PDF), supposedly involved in the circadian signal output regulating the daily activities. PBAN is a 33 or 34 amino acid peptide stimulating sex pheromone production in female moths and plays a key role in temporal regulation of pheromone communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440689">Raina et al., 1989</xref>). The undecapeptide corazonin was discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730412440689">Veenstra (1989)</xref> as a cardioaccelerator in cockroaches and subsequently was found in other insects including moth species <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730412440689">Hua et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730412440689">Hansen et al., 2001</xref>), and <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412440689">Wise et al., 2002</xref>). Crz-immunoreactivity (Crz-ir) in neurons that express clock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412440689">Wise et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412440689">Qi-Mao et al., 2003</xref>) links it to circadian output pathway. PDF is an insect homologue of the pigment dispersing hormone that was isolated as a regulator of pigmentation in crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412440689">Rao and Riehm, 1988</xref>) and functions as a key mediator in the circadian clock of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730412440689">Taghert and Shafer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We studied daily rhythms in female calling behavior (pheromone release) of both species under a light-dark cycle (LD), continuous darkness (DD), and continuous light (LL). The results confirm not only temporally separate peaks in sexual activity but also major differences in their responses to constant light conditions. We also present comparative data of PBAN-immunoreactivity (PBAN-ir), Crz-ir, and PDF-immunoreactivity (PDF-ir) in the brain-subesophageal complex and in the neurohemal organs of the 2 moth species.</p>

<p>For behavioral experiments, we used laboratory cultures of <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> maintained at the Department of Ecology, Lund University (for their origin, diet, and rearing conditions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730412440689">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730412440689">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>). For immunocytological experiments, we used laboratory cultures of both species maintained at the Institute of Entomology BC ASCR in Ceske Budejovice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730412440689">Vítková et al., 2007</xref>, and references therein).</p>

<title>Calling Behavior in LD, DD, and LL</title>
<p>Prior to emergence, female pupae were transferred to individual transparent plastic cups (height: 8 cm, diameter: 6.5 cm) and kept in separate climate cabinets in a 17-h:7-h LD cycle (23 °C, 60% relative humidity). Adult females were transferred to continuous darkness or light just after emergence for observation in DD or LL. Observations of individual calling behavior began the day after emergence, every hour for 7 consecutive days. Female adults were regarded as calling when their abdomens were elevated, accompanied by extrusion of the ovipositor. In darkness, observations were performed with a red flashlight.</p>

<sec id="section4-0748730412440689">
<title>Locomotor Activity</title>
<p>Locomotor activity of individual adult males placed in a 9-cm Petri dish was recorded under LD, DD, or LL at 25 °C by an automated system previously used to record behavior of firebugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730412440689">Hodková et al., 2003</xref>) and house flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730412440689">Codd et al., 2007</xref>). The activity record (15- or 30-min bins) was analyzed using Flytoolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730412440689">Levine et al., 2002</xref>) in Matlab software (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). The activity of 25-30 males recorded for 7 days under different LD regimes was averaged and plotted in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</p>

<sec id="section5-0748730412440689">
<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Heads of adults were collected at ZT 4 (the mid-photophase) and ZT 16 (the mid-scotophase). At least 4 females and 2 males at each time point were tested. Dim red light (660-670 nm wavelengths) was used for dissecting brains during scotophase. Immunocytochemistry was performed on cephalic ganglia of adult males and females of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> and <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730412440689">Závodská et al., 2009</xref>) and outlined in the supplementary online material.</p>

<title>Calling Behavior</title>
<p>The calling activity of <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> females showed a distinct diel rhythm and did not change appreciably with age in an LD cycle. Females began to call during the first scotophase after emergence, and practically all individuals were observed calling at the onset of each photophase. The proportion of calling females decreased gradually during each photophase, and the behavior was almost totally suppressed around the onset of each scotophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1A</xref>). The daily rhythm in calling was persistent for several days in continuous darkness, but the proportion of calling females gradually decreased with age. Calling was not entirely suppressed at the beginning of the expected scotophases, resulting in a gradually more vague rhythm after a few days in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1B</xref>). Continuous light suppressed calling behavior, which resulted in an abolished rhythm and a severely reduced number of calling females at practically all hours of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>The calling activity of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> also showed a diel rhythm, and females started to call during the latter half of the first photophase after emergence. Calling activity reached its peak at the onset of each scotophase, when practically all observed females were calling. In contrast to <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> females, calling was never entirely suppressed at any time of day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1D</xref>). The rhythmic calling pattern of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> was apparently lost in continuous darkness, although the highest proportions of calling activity were persistently obtained at the hours around lights-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1E</xref>).

<title>Locomotor Activity</title>
<p>Both <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> males showed persistent rhythms in constant darkness (Suppl. Fig. S1), suggesting that locomotor activity is regulated by a circadian clock mechanism in both species. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Figure 1G</xref>, the peak in <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> activity occurred at the end of night in LD regimes, whereas the activity peak of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> occurred at light-off and the beginning of night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1H</xref>). This trend was most profound under short-day conditions. Under long-day conditions, both species displayed bimodal activity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">H</xref>). In the LL regime, locomotor activity of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> was suppressed and <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> activity stopped completely (Suppl. Fig. S2).</p>

<sec id="section10-0748730412440689">
<title>PBAN-ir</title>
<p>We observed a similar pattern in distribution of PBAN-ir in the brain-subesophageal ganglion (SOG) complexes and neurohemal organs in both species of moths, <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> and <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2</xref>). Clear cytoplasmic staining in 6 and 8 cells occurred in the <italic>pars intercerebralis</italic> (PI) in each hemisphere of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> and <italic>E. kuehniella</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">L</xref>). Neuronal fibers of the PI cells passed across medial protocerebrum to the base of the inferior protocerebrum, dispatching branches to ipsilateral cardiacal nerves 1+2 (NCC 1+2). The PBAN-ir pattern of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> included 8 perikarya located in the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">B</xref>), and 2 cells resided in the area of the lateral horn at the superior part of the protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">C</xref>) in each hemisphere. The SLP neurons are divided into the medial and the lateral clusters, each consisting of 4 cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We conclude that the daily temporal allocation of female calling behavior differs in the 2 pyralid moth species <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic>. Females of the 2 species release the sex pheromone to attract males at different times of the night, dawn and dusk, respectively, and the calling behavior is affected differently by constant light conditions. The calling rhythm in <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> shows characteristics of circadian regulation as the rhythm is persistent in constant darkness and the behavior is suppressed by constant light. On the contrary, females of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> turn arrhythmic in DD but continue to call in both constant dark and light. Males of both species show persistent daily rhythms in locomotor activity in constant darkness.</p>
<p>The original habitats of our studied species are not known, and they are almost exclusively found indoors, that is, in artificial and—from an evolutionary perspective—recent environments. It is therefore hard to speculate how the asynchrony in daily sexual behaviors has evolved. However, several of the closely related pyralid species share the same main pheromone component, and indirect selection on males occurs already during the mate search and localization of females by sex pheromone cues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730412440689">Wiley and Poston, 1996</xref>, for a general discussion of indirect female choice). In a competitive environment with more than 1 species present, it is therefore plausible that a shift of the activity peak may have been beneficial to avoid costly and time-consuming interspecific attractions.</p>
<p>A closer examination of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> calling in constant darkness reveals that even though females never ceased calling at any time of day, the highest numbers of calling females were persistently obtained at hours corresponding to lights-off. This suggests that the onset of calling behavior may nevertheless be regulated by a clock mechanism but that the termination of calling is dependent on the lights-on cue. However this hypothesis is contradicted by high calling activity in constant light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440689">Fig. 1F</xref>). Since <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> females showed no calling rhythm in constant darkness from the very beginning, it is unlikely that desynchronization between individuals caused the overall arrhythmicity. However, desynchronization would explain the gradual dampening of the <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> rhythm in DD.</p>
<p>Circadian clocks use changes in light conditions to synchronize with the environment, and if constant light suppresses calling behavior in <italic>E. kuehniella</italic>, why do <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> females continue to call in constant light? One explanation is that the suppression of calling behavior in <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> occurs independently of the clock mechanism. This would require, however, that the 2 species show differences in a secondary light input system, which affects the behavior independently of the clock function. We find it more likely that either the calling behavior in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> is disconnected from the circadian clock mechanism or the clock output signal that regulates calling differs between the 2 species.</p>
<p>Male mate search, and subsequently reproduction, require locomotor activity, and we therefore use locomotor activity as an indicator of hours when mate search would primarily occur. <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> males showed highest locomotor activity at the end of the scotophase, which corresponds very well with the observed peaks in female calling activity. The locomotor activity rhythm in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> was highest during hours corresponding to the early scotophase.</p>
<p>The performed immunostainings showed minor differences in distribution or localization of PBAN-ir, Crz-ir, and PDF-ir in the cephalic ganglia of both species (Suppl. Table S1). The neuropeptides PBAN, corazonin, and PDF have all been proposed to be essential for clock output and showed strong staining patterns in both <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> brains. No differences in distribution of PBAN-ir, Crz-ir, and PDF-ir were revealed with respect to both the sex and the time points of the LD cycle (see Suppl. Table S1, Suppl. Figs. S3, S4).</p>
<p>PBAN polypeptides are members of the pyrokinin family with different physiological functions in insects and are characterized by a common C-terminal sequence called FXPRLamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730412440689">Abernathy et al., 1996</xref>). The PBAN-ir does not differ substantially between the 2 species, apart from an additional group of 5 small cells in the medial SLP in <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> (Suppl. Table S1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2G</xref>). The strongly stained cells in the SOG were found in the Mdb, Mxl, and Lb neuromere of the SOG in both species. Previous studies revealed that 3 clusters of neurosecretory cells in the midventral SOG showed strong immunoreactivity with antiserum against PBAN in several other moths as well: <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730412440689">Ma et al., 1996</xref>), <italic>Agrotis ipsilon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412440689">Duportets et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>Agrotis segetum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730412440689">Závodská et al., 2009</xref>), and tortrix <italic>Adoxophyes</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730412440689">Choi et al., 2004</xref>). In both examined moths, immunopositive fibers from the <italic>pars intercerebralis</italic> led into the <italic>nervi corporis cardiaci</italic> (NCC1+2) and ramified in the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">K</xref>), where immunostained cells in the tritocerebrum likely sent their processes via the NCC 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440689">Fig. 2J</xref>). These results suggest that PBAN-like peptide synthesized in both <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> and <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> brain neurons is transported to the CC before its release into the hemolymph and transfer to the pheromone gland.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412440689">Nässel (2002)</xref> suggested that corazonin, an 11 amino acid neuropeptide, functions as both a humoral factor and a neuromodulator, which are both plausible roles in output pathways of circadian clock. Its linkage to circadian clock pathways is based on its co-expression in cells expressing clock protein Period in the <italic>Antheraea pernyi</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730412440689">Sauman and Reppert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730412440689">Sauman et al., 2005</xref>) as well as in the <italic>M. sexta</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412440689">Wise et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the distributions of Crz-ir in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> and <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> do differ (Suppl. Table S1). Whereas <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> shows 2 stained cells in the SOG with no equivalent in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic>, the latter species shows 2 cells in caudal part of ventrolateral protocerebrum and 4 small cells in the tritocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412440689">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> we detected prominent Crz-like staining in photoreceptors and fibers running over frontal surface of lamina and medulla neuromere in the OL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412440689">Fig. 3N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412440689">O</xref>), which is a unique Crz-ir distribution not only in moths but even in other insects tested previously (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730412440689">Sehadová et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730412440689">Závodská et al., 2008</xref>). We observed positive immunostaining with antiserum against [His 7]-corazonin in photoreceptors of all 12 examined <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> heads but never saw an immunopositive signal in the photoreceptors of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic>, although samples of both moth species were treated together under the same conditions. In addition, we observed clear staining in 4 perikarya in CC of <italic>E. kuehniella</italic>. Although it cannot be entirely excluded that an artifact in the eye and CC occurred during the immunohistochemical process, which gave an unspecific staining, we are convinced that the positive reaction in photoreceptors and cells in the CC was specific considering the reliability of antiserum against [His<sup>7</sup>]-corazonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730412440689">Roller at al., 2003</xref>). We would not venture to claim that the Crz-like substance recognized by the antibody in the photoreceptors is also produced in these cells or attempt to assign any function to this compound in the photoreceptors, yet it is remarkable that such differences in the staining pattern were observed in the 2 species. The differences in expression patterns between these closely related species at least suggest that corazonin was subjected to a selective pressure over time.</p>
<p>PDF is an 18 amino acid neuropeptide that is essential for maintained locomotor activity rhythms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730412440689">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730412440689">Helfrich-Förster, 2005</xref>). PDF homologues (which usually differ only by 2 amino acid substitutions) have been identified in diverse insect species (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730412440689">Hamasaka et al., 2005</xref>). Both examined species of moths possess 4 small but clearly stained cells in the Pfv region of the OL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730412440689">Fig. 4</xref>), which is a typical location of PDF-ir cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730412440689">Sehadová et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748730412440689">Závodská et al., 2003</xref>). Expression patterns of PDF-ir vary only slightly in the number of SLP, PI, and SOG cells in moth brains, but no equivalent cells in the interior medial protocerebrum were detected in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> (Suppl. Table S1).</p>
<p>To summarize, the circadian regulation of the sex pheromone communication in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> and <italic>E. kuehniella</italic> shows remarkable differences. The restriction of their sexual activity to different hours of the day suggests that the differences may be due to temporal divergence in the sex communication, between either these or other species relying on the same sex pheromone components. Since effective reproduction requires synchronized behaviors in both sexes, this temporal shift in activity has affected both males and females, as would be expected. The variances in the expression patterns of especially corazonin indicate that differences between the 2 species occur also on a molecular level and in the pathways by which the circadian rhythms are regulated.</p>
