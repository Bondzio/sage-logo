<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease and is the most frequent genetic cause for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812441390">1</xref></sup> In contrast, the actual incidence of NPHP in Japan remains unclear because details of only about 30 Japanese patients have been reported so far.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812441390">2</xref></sup> Till date, mutations in 9 NPHP genes (<italic>NPHP1-9</italic>) have been identified in NPHP subtypes 1 to 9. The first identified NPHP gene <italic>NPHP1</italic>, which is localized on chromosome 2q13, encodes nephrocystin. Based on the timing for ESRD, the following 3 clinical variants have been described: infantile, juvenile, and adolescent. Of these, juvenile NPHP (NPHP1) is the most common form, which accounts for 5% to 10% of ESRD cases in Caucasian children. To our knowledge, only 2 previous studies have reported on Japanese patients with NPHP in whom genetic diagnosis was made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812441390">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812441390">3</xref></sup> Here, we report on a girl with NPHP1 who initially visited a local hospital because of general fatigue and was referred to our hospital as she demonstrated anemia associated with chronic renal insufficiency. However, no abnormal findings had been noted during annual school urinary screenings conducted over a long period of time.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 14-year-old girl visited a local hospital because of general fatigue and weight loss since 2 years. She had been previously healthy with no prior medical problems. No abnormal findings had been noted during annual school urinary screening programs held in Japan. Her family history was unremarkable. Blood examination conducted at the hospital showed severe anemia associated with renal failure. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital.</p>
<p>On admission, her blood pressure was 122/80 mm Hg. She was 159.8 cm (+0.52 SD) tall and weighed 38.9 kg (−1.7 SD). No edema was noticed on the face or extremities. Neurological examination was negative. Ophthalmological examination showed no abnormal findings.</p>
<p>Laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell count, 4900/µL; erythrocyte count, 250 × 10<sup>4</sup>/µL; hemoglobin, 7.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 21.3%; and platelet count, 26.3 × 10<sup>4</sup>/µL. Total serum protein was 8.0 g/dL; albumin, 4.8 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 89 mg/dL; creatinine, 6.81 mg/dL; uric acid, 8.1 mg/dL; calcium, 8.0 mg/dL; phosphate, 6.7 mg/dL; and potassium, 3.0 mEq/L. Serum immunoglobulins were normal, and M protein was not observed. Antinuclear antibodies were negative. Serum complement levels were normal. Urinalysis showed proteinuria without hematuria or pyuira. Urine specific gravity was 1.008. The urinary β2-microglobulin level was 20 958 µg/L (normal &lt;250 µg/L).</p>
<p>An abdominal echogram revealed slightly small kidneys with increased cortical echogenicity. A voiding cystourethrogram did not show any evidence of vesicoureteral reflux. Open renal biopsy was performed to examine the cause of renal failure.</p>

<title>Histological Findings</title>
<p>Renal biopsy specimens for light microscopy contained 50 glomeruli, of which 35 glomeruli showed collapsed glomerulosclerosis and 15 showed collapsed tuft with capsular fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812441390">Figure 1</xref>). The interstitial architecture was markedly destroyed showing severe interstitial fibrosis and moderate round cell infiltration. Irregular thinning/thickening of the tubular basement membrane and tubular atrophy with cyst development were observed. In an immunofluorescent study, staining was negative for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, complement, or fibrinogen in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy revealed thickening and irregular layering in tubular basement membrane and occasional epithelial detachment.</p>

<title>Genetic Analysis</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral lymphocytes of the patient using a DNA isolation kit (GenTLE; Takara Shuzo, Otsu, Japan). We analyzed deletion mutations in <italic>NPHP1</italic>. Sequences of polymerase chain reaction primers used in the diagnosis of <italic>NPHP1</italic> were the same as described by Komatsuda and coworkers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812441390">3</xref></sup> The polymerase chain reaction products were directly sequenced using a DNA sequencing kit (BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit; Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) and an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 377; Perkin–Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequence analysis and mutation identification were performed using the Sequencing Analysis software (Perkin–Elmer Applied Biosystems). The results revealed a large homozygous deletion of <italic>NPHP1</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812441390">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>NPHP is an autosomal, recessive, genetically heterogenic disorder with mutations in a number of genes that encode proteins involved in the functioning of primary cilia, basal bodies, and centrosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812441390">4</xref></sup> It was initially described by Smith and Graham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812441390">5</xref></sup> in 1945 and by Fanconi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812441390">6</xref></sup> in 1951. Traditionally, NPHP has been subdivided into infantile, juvenile, and adolescent forms on the basis of age of onset of renal failure. The juvenile form in which patients develop ESRD at a mean age of about 13 years is the most common variant.</p>
<p>Clinical manifestations of NPHP1 are related to tubular dysfunction that leads to reduced urine concentrating ability. Loss of sodium conservation occurs early in the course of the disease, whereas glomerular filtration rate remains normal. A low specific gravity of the first-morning-void urine sample, which should be concentrated, is a characteristic feature of this disease. The concentrating ability rarely exceeds 400 mOsm/kg of water. Patients with NPHP1 can have extremely dilute urine; thus, any proteinuria is masked on dipstick screening, thereby resulting in delayed diagnosis until the patients develop ESRD. Other disorders that can present with renal insufficiency and a bland urine sediment in children and young adults include renal dysplasia, medullary cystic kidney disease, autosomal recessive and dominant polycystic kidney disease, reflux nephropathy, oligomeganephronia, Dent’s disease, hyperoxaluria, and extremely low birth weight infant. Molecular genetic analysis of NPHP genes has been performed in patients mainly from Europe and North America. They insisted that this analysis should be initiated before the invasive procedure of renal biopsy is performed, that is, when the clinical manifestations and renal imaging are suggestive of NPHP. However, molecular genetic analysis is not popular in Japan, and most cases are diagnosed by clinical symptoms and renal biopsy. To our knowledge, genetic diagnoses were made for only 2 cases in Japan. Takano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812441390">2</xref></sup> reported on an 11-year-old boy with NPHP1 who had a homozygous deletion of <italic>NPHP1</italic>. He first showed unusual extrarenal manifestations of cerebellar ataxia and nystagmus due to hypoplasia of the brain stem and vermis, but NPHP1 could not be diagnosed until he developed ESRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812441390">2</xref></sup> Komatsuda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812441390">3</xref></sup> also described a 19-year-old girl with NPHP1 who had a novel deletion mutation including about half of the <italic>NPHP1</italic> exons. She visited a family doctor because of fever and was referred to a tertiary hospital as she demonstrated anemia associated with renal insufficiency. Until then, no abnormal findings had been noted during school urinary screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812441390">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>If we can detect and diagnose NPHP at an early stage using molecular genetic analysis, then patients and their parents will have sufficient time to adjust to treatment prospects. They may then be better prepared to deal with dialysis or transplantation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We presented the case report of a girl with NPHP1 who showed no extrarenal abnormalities and abnormal findings during annual school urinary screening for over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Although regular urinalysis is widely performed in schools across Japan, it is important to recognize that NPHP1 cannot be detected by dipstick screening for proteinuria in patients with dilute urine, which is caused by NPHP1. Measurement of urine specific gravity and urinary β2-microglobulin levels could be useful for early detection of NPHP1 in patients.</p>
