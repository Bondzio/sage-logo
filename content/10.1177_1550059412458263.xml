<abstract>
<p>The breach rhythm is sometimes considered the consequence of reduced resistance between the cortex and the scalp electrode in the region of a skull defect. On the other hand, the electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after craniotomy were attributed to an activation of EEG activity by meningocortical adhesions with admixed gliosis. We report changes of the breach rhythm in a patient with astrocytoma, which give further evidence that the breach rhythm is not merely the result of physical changes in the area of a skull defect. In our patient, the breach rhythm was no longer detectable before a new tumor progression took place, showed up again, and at the end changed into localized slowing before the deterioration of the patient’s general medical condition. This case suggests that in patients with brain tumors, the loss or attenuation in frequency of an established breach rhythm might be considered as an indication of a new tumor progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a recent review,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412458263">1</xref>
</sup> the breach rhythm was considered to represent unfiltered brain activity through a skull defect, which may be attenuated by the progression of the tumor. However, already Cobb et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412458263">2</xref>
</sup> noted that there are different changes in EEG activity after craniotomy, which cannot solely be attributed to the skull defect as a cause of reduced resistance between the cortex and the scalp electrode. Breach rhythm developed several months after the craniotomy, and did not resolve in many cases after replacement of the bone. Sometimes, breach rhythm showed responsiveness to fist clenching like a µ-rhythm, and sometimes it was unresponsive like the mid-temporal “third rhythm” of Niedermeyer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412458263">3</xref>
</sup> Niedermeyer acknowledged that there may be a second alphoid rhythmical activity in more anterior portions of the temporal lobe, which he considered to be of abnormal nature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412458263">4</xref>
</sup> In 1952, it was proposed that EEG changes after craniotomy represent enhanced EEG activity, secondary to meningocortical adhesions with admixed gliosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412458263">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412458263">6</xref>
</sup> For Cobb et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412458263">2</xref>
</sup>, this seemed to be reasonable in some of their cases, if one adds the restriction that there must be a specific form of reaction in the central regions, since they did not see these rhythms in occipital and frontal areas. In any case, breach rhythm represents a modification of the local brain activity, sometimes only as the consequence of a reduced attenuation of higher frequencies, and a reduced resistance between the cortex and the scalp electrode, and sometimes as the result of an activation by meningocortical adhesions. We describe breach rhythm changes in relation to tumor progression in a patient with astrocytoma.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 52-year-old patient presented with recurrent partial seizures with olfactory hallucinations. Magnetic resonance imaging ([MRI] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412458263">Figure 1</xref>) revealed an intracranial tumor in the right frontal and temporal lobe with infiltration of the basal ganglia. The tumor could only partially be removed. The tumor was histopathologically classified as “fibrillary astrocytoma World Health Organization (WHO) II.” Two days after the craniotomy, the patient developed a generalized tonic–clonic seizure. After antiepileptic treatment with levetiracetam (LEV) 4000 mg, seizures were reduced to partial seizures, with olfactory hallucinations, and sensations of epigastric rising twice a day. Five months later, EEG showed breach rhythm, with a frequency of 14 Hz in the right temporal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412458263">Figure 2</xref>; for time course of MRI and EEG data see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059412458263">Table 1</xref>). By adding lamotrigine (LTG) 100 mg to LEV 4000 mg, the seizure frequency was reduced to 2 partial seizures weekly. After increasing LTG to 300 mg, the seizure frequency was reduced to 2 partial seizures per month, with sensations of epigastric rising only. Three months after the EEG, MRI showed signs of tumor progression, and biopsy classified the tumor histologically as an astrocytoma WHO III. Chemoradiotherapy with temozolamide and 54 Gy radiation was begun. Eight months after the second biopsy, EEG continued to show the breach rhythm, but with reduced frequency of 11 Hz and later 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1550059412458263">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412458263">4</xref>). MRI showed regression of the tumor diameter of about 1 cm. The frequency was 1 or 2 partial seizures per month, with sensations of epigastric rising. Three months later, 11 months after the second biopsy, a new tumor progression was seen, and a second radiotherapy with 30 Gy stereotactic radiation was added to a daily treatment with low-dose temozolamide. A month later, MRI again showed tumor regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1550059412458263">Figure 5</xref>), and breach rhythm was no longer visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1550059412458263">Figure 6</xref>). Another 2 months later, MRI revealed a new lesion, with gadolinium enhancement in the tumor region. This was interpreted as sequel of the radiation. EEG again showed breach rhythm, with a frequency of around 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1550059412458263">Figure 7</xref>). However, another 4 months later, a new tumor progression was revealed by MRI. Dexamethasone was added by the oncologists. Breach rhythm was now seen again but with a frequency reduced to 8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1550059412458263">Figure 8</xref>). Due to the appearance of new dyscognitive partial seizures, pregabaline was added to LTG and LEV. Over the next 5 months, MRI showed no further tumor progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1550059412458263">Figure 9</xref>). Breach rhythm was no longer visible again, and localized slowing was seen in the left frontotemporal, temporal, and frontal leads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1550059412458263">Figure 10</xref>). A few weeks later, the patient developed psychotic symptoms, Cushing syndrome, and a marked reduction of his general medical condition. He was referred to a palliative care center. Up to that time, no focal neurological deficit had ever been seen.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Breach rhythm changes in our patient give further evidence that breach rhythm is not merely the result of physical changes in the area of a skull defect. There are 3 case reports relating a breach rhythm to skull abnormalities without craniotomy. The first case, although published in 1994<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412458263">7</xref>
</sup>, dates from 1970, with breach rhythm seen in relation to an osteolytic skull metastasis. Since no computed tomography or MRI was performed, additional brain pathology cannot be excluded. In the second case,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412458263">8</xref>
</sup> MRI clearly showed epidural extension of the multiple myeloma, so that a meningeal involvement leading to meningocortical adhesions cannot be ruled out. In the third case, breach rhythm was related to congenital bone thinning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412458263">9</xref>
</sup> However, since there was an arachnoid cyst, reaching into the same region, meningocortical adhesions at the border of the arachnoid cyst cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, a skull defect seems to be a necessary condition for the occurrence of a breach rhythm. However, the expression and frequency of the breach rhythm may be modulated by other factors.</p>
<p>In our patient, there were no changes in the skull defect in the later course of tumor progression. Nevertheless, breach rhythm disappeared, showed up again, and in the end changed into a localized slowing. The first disappearance of breach rhythm was followed by a new gadolinium enhancement in MRI, which at a first glance was considered to be only a sequel of the radiation. The second disappearance of breach rhythm was followed by global clinical deterioration, and no further MRI was performed. In both situations, activation of local cortical rhythms by meningocortical adhesions may have been counteracted by the localized loss of activity over the area of the tumor. This loss of activity occurred in both situations before new tumor progression was detected by MRI, or clinical deterioration was seen. This case report suggests that in patients with brain tumors, the loss or attenuation of frequency of an established breach rhythm might be an indication of new tumor progression.</p>
