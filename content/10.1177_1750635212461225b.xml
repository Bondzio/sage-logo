<p>In <italic>Battles to Bridges</italic>, Dr RS Zaharna presents readers with a compelling narrative of US public diplomacy between the years 2001 and 2008. Seeming to span the gap between critical and administrative traditions, Dr Zaharna’s analysis employs critical frames while concluding with recommendations aimed at aiding the cause of public diplomacy, but perhaps not in a way that its framers would envision.</p>
<p>Zaharna appropriately takes up her examination of US public diplomacy after September 11, 2001 when, as she argues, international attitudes toward the United States ‘went from an outpouring of global sympathy and support … to a palpable wave of anti-Americanism’ (p. 11). Zaharna argues that because of strategic incoherence, contrary foreign policy choices, domestic pronouncements, and an ‘information battle’ approach, public diplomacy could not have been successful in this period. These four themes run throughout the text, providing context and powerful explanatory power.</p>
<p>In setting out the justification for public diplomacy, Zaharna reiterates the now common understanding that national security and public diplomacy are tied together. But, she argues, this is where the perceptual link ends, which is evidenced in the disconnected nature of the Bush Administration’s foreign policy choices and public diplomacy strategy. She argues that US public diplomacy was not developed in concert with foreign policy during the period. Rather it was focused narrowly on US image and values, and largely excluded reference to policy or politics. This disconnect, along with the failure to appropriately understand the target audiences and the dramatically negative perception of the mostly unilateral Iraq War, constrained the potential success of US public diplomacy during the period under study.</p>
<p>Against the idea that the public diplomacy problem is one of how the US story is told, Zaharna argues that ‘even if U.S. public diplomacy were to greatly expand the number and sophistication of its relational initiatives that alone would not be enough to ensure that U.S. public diplomacy is any more effective or strategic tomorrow than it is today’ (p. 157). This is because analysis at this level lacks the kind of grand strategy approach that she thinks is required to truly improve US public diplomacy. Making reference to the work of Carl Botan, Zaharna goes on to explain that US public diplomacy suffered from the transplantation of the Cold War public diplomacy model without adequate evaluation of its appropriateness in the post 9/11 environment.</p>
<p>This information battle approach emphasized the use of mass communication and promoting the increased volume of information. It works, she argues, when domestic and foreign audiences can be separated and when information sources are able to control the content and delivery of information (p. 164). None of these features are present in today’s environment. Rather, Zaharna argues that US public diplomacy requires a new grand strategy that takes into account changes in the global context and that aligns with US foreign policy. In particular, she argues that the multidimensional global context requires that US public diplomacy becomes more cooperative, focuses on quality over quantity, relinquishes control over the message, develops comprehensive strategies to communicate with audiences and focuses on the process of communication over the product (pp. 166–170). In short, Zaharna recommends that the US should develop a more relational or networked approach to public diplomacy: by focusing on relationship building, foreign attitudes and cooperation with the US will improve. As she states on page 1: ‘the two-prong goal of U.S. public diplomacy entailed promoting U.S. values, while trying to marginalize and isolate the terrorists’ message’, and it is Zaharna’s contention that these goals are more readily achieved through relational public diplomacy.</p>
<p>Two potential criticisms of this book are related to the less than critical analysis of the relational/network approach. For instance, as part of her analysis of the Cold War public diplomacy strategy that was employed in the post 9/11 environment, she argues that it ‘aimed at favorable or neutral publics’ (p. 64). A relevant criticism for sure, but one that should also be levied against the relational approach as well. On the face of it, it appears as though the relational approach would also require favorable or at least neutral partners. Further research in this area and more explication of its application in practice is required as a next step in this research agenda. Less important, but still worth noting is that, while the relational approach appears to have better potential for achieving (and recalculating) US strategic communicative aims, it also appears to be untested in practice. As Zaharna states, ‘examples of relational initiatives are less easy to find’ (p. 150). In short, they are not prominent in contemporary practice, and to advocate as she does, for an untested technique is risky. These two criticisms notwithstanding, Zaharna’s <italic>Battles to Bridges</italic> is an interesting, thorough, and accessible piece of scholarship. It is well written, and for academics in fields related to international relations, mass communication and politics it is well worth a read.</p>
