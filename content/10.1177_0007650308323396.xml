<abstract>
<p>An “interest-based” view of stakeholder action—a view that stakeholders act against organizations to safeguard or promote their own interests—underlies much research in stakeholder theory. In this article, the author uses two motivation theories—equity theory and expectancy theory—to address the general research question, “What are the conditions under which stakeholders will take action against an organization?” Doing so allows for a more explicit elaboration of an interest-based approach to understanding stakeholder action. Applying these theories, the author develops propositions concerning the conditions that are likely to precipitate stakeholder sanctions directed at a focal organization and develops a basic framework for understanding when such stakeholder action is likely. Finally, the author discusses the theoretical and practical implications of this work.</p>

<title>The Imposition of Sanctions by Stakeholders</title>
<p>In 2003, Planned Parenthood officials faced a problem concerning the construction of an abortion clinic associated with their offices in Austin, Texas: A wide variety of suppliers and subcontractors refused to contribute to the project, resulting in the builder abandoning the enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650308323396">Anonymous, 2003</xref>). Contractors in lumber, cement supply, foundation building, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning, windows, flooring, roofing, insulation, and landscaping—hundreds of subcontractors altogether—agreed to participate in a boycott of Planned Parenthood’s construction project organized by a concrete contractor and antiabortion activist. Telephone and letter-writing campaigns arranged by the activist urged more than 750 Austin- and San Antonio-based businesses not to provide supplies or services for the construction of the clinic and to join his organization, the Texas Contractors and Suppliers for Life Association. Some members of the public joined the effort, as did the antiabortion group Texas Right to Life and many churches, contacting relevant contractors and warning them not to take part in the project.</p>
<p>This example illustrates a common circumstance in the environments of organizations: A disgruntled or dissatisfied stakeholder (or stakeholders) takes action against a focal organization (FO) in response to some action (or inaction) by that organization. Stakeholder actions against organizations are commonplace. Such sanctions may include tactics such as boycotts, divestitures, strikes, the withholding of resources, protests, letter-writing campaigns, and innumerable other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650308323396">Frooman, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential for conflict, such as that described above, is an underlying feature of firm-stakeholder relationships: Implicit in much of the stakeholder literature is a supposition that if the needs, desires, or interests of stakeholders are not met, those stakeholders may impose sanctions on (i.e., take action against) the FO. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650308323396">Frooman (1999)</xref> stated that stakeholder theory is primarily concerned with managing the potential conflicts that come from divergences of interests, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0007650308323396">Lampe (2001)</xref> asserted, “Ultimately, conflict, or at least the potential for conflict, gives the stakeholder concept meaning and a reason for being” (p. 166). Thus, a driving force underlying the stakeholder approach (at least from the perspective of the FO) is dealing with the possibility of negative outcomes to the FO resulting from conflict between it and its stakeholders. Stakeholder actions represent a critical issue for managers, as they can have a severe impact on the performance of the FO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0007650308323396">Lampe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0007650308323396">Ulmer, 2001</xref>); therefore, it is vital that stakeholder researchers attempt to identify the conditions that are likely to precipitate stakeholder action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although many (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650308323396">Cordano, Frieze, &amp; Ellis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0007650308323396">Rowley, 1997</xref>) acknowledge that further advancements in stakeholder theory depend in part on the development of a greater understanding of how and why stakeholders respond to organizations, very little work in the stakeholder literature has investigated when stakeholders will be inclined to act against an FO: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650308323396">Cordano et al. (2004)</xref> noted that managers have limited means for understanding and predicting stakeholders’ actions, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650308323396">Hendry (2003)</xref> noted, “Few researchers have attempted to determine why [stakeholders] would exert pressure on a specific organization” (p. 268). With the exception of work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref>, research in the stakeholder literature has not addressed variables influencing the likelihood of action against the FO by stakeholders.</p>
<p>A prominent question that remains to be addressed within the stakeholder literature, then, is: “What are the conditions under which stakeholders will take action against an FO?” Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref> have addressed the subject of stakeholder action in describing their “logic of stakeholder action,” they do not provide a unifying theoretical basis for the relationships they suggest. They hint at the importance of variables such as visibility and expectancies—“Stakeholder groups must be cognizant of the firm’s behavior, be willing to take action to influence the firm, and have the capabilities to do so” (p. 409)—but do not develop these ideas further.</p>
<p>To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref>, “the stakeholder perspective includes the notions that stakeholders have interests [and] mobilize to protect or enhance those interests” (p. 207). However, although stating that most stakeholder action is indeed “interest-based,” they differentiate between an interest-based view of stakeholder action and one based on social identity. They then focus on social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0007650308323396">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>) as a determinant of stakeholder action, asserting that stakeholder action can occur as a result of social actors’ desires to express their social identification with a group or organization. They do note, however, that two key variables (other than the desire to enhance social identity) leading to stakeholder action are discontent with the FO and the ability to act.</p>
<p>My goal in this article is to more fully articulate a framework for understanding stakeholder action that is based on stakeholder interests rather than on social identity: Indeed, I submit that, in fact, the social identity considerations articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> fit comfortably into an interest-based view. The implication of the interest-based view is that the desire to protect or maintain stakeholder interests <italic>motivates</italic> stakeholder action; thus, one way of incorporating stakeholder interests into a model of stakeholder action is to use motivation theories to describe the phenomenon. I make the (perhaps trivial) assumption, similar to motivation theorists’ assumption that motivation is a prerequisite to effort directed by individuals toward task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0007650308323396">Steers &amp; Porter, 1979</xref>), that a prerequisite to stakeholder action against an organization is the motivation to undertake that action.</p>
<p>To describe the conditions that precipitate stakeholder action, I invoke equity theory (which incorporates the concept of discontent because of one’s interests not being met) and expectancy theory (which addresses the perceived ability of the stakeholder to act against the FO), two of the best developed theories of motivation. In the remainder of this article, then, I introduce the literatures concerning stakeholder theory, expectancy theory, and equity theory; present propositions concerning the conditions that promote the likelihood of stakeholder attempts to impose sanctions on (i.e., take action against) the FO; and develop an basic equity- and expectancy-based framework for understanding stakeholder action.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650308323396">Donaldson and Preston (1995)</xref> noted three distinct “justifications” of stakeholder theory: “normative,” “descriptive,” and “instrumental.” Recently, these three aspects of stakeholder theory have tended to be used as a typology for categorizing research in stakeholder theory rather than simply as justifications for the stakeholder approach to management. Thus, as a normative theory, stakeholder theory identifies ethical guidelines for how an organization ought to be run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0007650308323396">Waxenberger &amp; Spence, 2003</xref>)—usually by identifying stakeholders and/or the ways in which they ought to be treated based on moral grounds—and as a descriptive theory, stakeholder theory describes the nature of the organization and its relationships with its stakeholders and is concerned with whether or not managers actually <italic>do</italic> take the interests of stakeholder into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650308323396">Gibson, 2000</xref>). As an instrumental theory, on the other hand, stakeholder theory develops a framework for assessing the relationships between stakeholder management and the goals of the organization. This approach hinges on the fact that stakeholders can have a great impact on whether or not an organization achieves its objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650308323396">Berman, Wicks, Kotha, &amp; Jones, 1999</xref>). Generally speaking, this area of inquiry attempts to specify the types of outcomes that will be obtained if certain behaviors are taken with respect to the FO’s stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0007650308323396">Jones &amp; Wicks, 1999</xref>). Typically, however, this work addresses a more specific topic: the performance implications of effective or ineffective stakeholder management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650308323396">Gibson, 2000</xref>), and the usual premise adopted is that “good” stakeholder management leads to improved FO performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650308323396">Jones, 1995</xref>). Whereas the Donaldson and Preston typology is imperfect—for example, identification of an “instrumental” relationship seems inherently “descriptive”—the present article perhaps most warrants an “instrumental” designation, as I imply herein that a refusal to “deal with” the interests of stakeholders may result in action by those stakeholders, with the assumption that that action may have a detrimental effect on some aspect or aspects of the performance of the FO.</p>

<title>The Interest-based View of Stakeholder Action</title>
<p>Despite the lack of <italic>explicit</italic> acknowledgment in much of the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref>, as noted above, asserted that an underlying assumption in stakeholder research is that stakeholder action, when it occurs, is interest-driven; that is, stakeholders act to promote or protect their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650308323396">Frooman, 1999</xref>). Indeed, they suggest that the stakeholder perspective in general may be based on this position. Stakeholders tend to be defined in terms of their interests, or “stakes,” which are seen to be affected (and perhaps put at risk) by the actions of the FO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650308323396">Carroll, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley &amp; Moldoveanu, 2003</xref>), and enhancement or protection of these interests is generally seen as providing the purpose behind stakeholder action. Thus, stakeholders may attempt to influence or “manage” the firm to forward their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650308323396">Brouthers &amp; Bamossy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650308323396">Frooman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650308323396">Gibson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0007650308323396">Mitchell, Agle, &amp; Wood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0007650308323396">Waxenberger &amp; Spence, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential for stakeholder action is therefore dependent, in part, on the degree to which the FO’s actions are related to the fulfillment of the stakeholder’s interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0007650308323396">Savage, Nix, Whitehead, &amp; Blair, 1991</xref>). From this point of view, stakeholders are quasi-rational actors (subject to “bounded rationality” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0007650308323396">Simon, 1957</xref>]), whose actions in response to the behaviors of the FO are founded in assessments of those actions’ utilities in promoting or protecting their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley &amp; Moldoveanu, 2003</xref>): Generally speaking, stakeholders will act when they perceive that actions taken (or not taken) by the FO impede their abilities to have their interests met. It is worth noting that my focus in this article is on stakeholders’ <italic>perceived</italic> interests (given that it is possible for a stakeholder to make erroneous assessments of what is truly in its interests), and I regard interests as including both needs (e.g., employees’ need for a living wage) and wants or desires (e.g., consumers’ desire for less expensive products).</p>
<sec id="section3-0007650308323396">
<title>Stakeholder Interests and Motivation</title>
<p>Stakeholders have, from the inception of stakeholder theory, been seen as entities that have motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0007650308323396">Mitroff, 1983</xref>); however, a motivation-based approach to looking at stakeholder action has not been described. Therefore, integral to my approach is addressing what it is that motivates a stakeholder to act against an FO (i.e., to attempt to impose sanctions upon it). In particular, I focus on stakeholder perceptions of the equity of the stakeholder–FO relationship, as well as the stakeholder’s expectancies concerning its ability to mount a successful action against the FO to have its interests met. I take the position that explanations derived from equity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650308323396">Adams, 1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">1965</xref>) and expectancy theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0007650308323396">Vroom, 1964</xref>) can account for much of why stakeholders are (or are not) motivated to act against an organization. In short, I assert that a stakeholder’s motivation to take action against an organization is critically dependent on its perception of the fairness of its relationship with the FO, the importance of the outcomes (i.e., interests) at stake, its perception that it can successfully take action against the FO, and its perception that successful actions will lead to desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Although speaking of perceptions in situations where a stakeholder is not an individual might seem unusual, it is clear that in many situations the actions of a stakeholder group or organization are guided to a large extent by particular individuals, such as key decision makers and others who <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650308323396">Frooman (2000)</xref> termed “influencers”; thus, the motivations of these critical individuals have a vast impact on the actions of the stakeholders they “represent,” and their motivations, to an extent, can be seen as a proxy for the motivations of the larger stakeholder entity. Such an approach was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650308323396">Frooman (2000)</xref>, who used the opinions of key decision makers within environmental organizations to assess the likelihood of those stakeholders’ uses of various influence strategies. In other instances, action by stakeholder groups or organizations is largely a result of the perceptions of those individuals that the stakeholder comprises. For example, whether employees at a workplace (as a whole) vote to go on strike depends to a great extent on the perceptions of those individual employees. For these reasons, discussion of individual-level motivators behind the actions of stakeholder groups and organizations is not unwarranted.</p>
<p>A different rationale for addressing the motivations of stakeholders by looking at individual-level perceptions is apparent from recent discussions of the idea of “stakeholder groups.” Stakeholder groups are generally defined based on shared objectives and interests, “claims,” or “stakes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650308323396">Donaldson &amp; Preston, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0007650308323396">Key, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0007650308323396">Welcomer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0007650308323396">Winn, 2001</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0007650308323396">Winn (2001)</xref> argued that stakeholder groups are socially constructed, their names and groupings being founded in culture and history, and that the assumption of the internal homogeneity of these generic stakeholders is inappropriate: In her opinion, treating generic stakeholders as if they are homogeneous is risky, because it is likely that there is substantial heterogeneity within groups, which can lead to wide variability in behaviors. This position suggests that the individual level of analysis is perhaps, in some cases, more appropriate when investigating stakeholder–FO relationships than are higher levels. Indeed, a number of students of stakeholders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650308323396">Cordano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0007650308323396">Key, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0007650308323396">Winn, 2001</xref>) suggest that the effects of individual-level constructs on stakeholder behaviors have tended to be neglected by researchers in the field and warrant considerable investigation.</p>

<title>Equity Theory</title>
<p>Equity theory addresses issues surrounding perceptions of fairness (and the ramifications of perceptions of unfairness) in social exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1973</xref>). The goal of equity theory is to understand when people will perceive that they are being treated fairly or unfairly, and how they will react when faced with an unfair situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0007650308323396">Walster, Berscheid, &amp; Walster, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0007650308323396">Wilkens &amp; Timm, 1978</xref>). Equity theory is perhaps the most widely studied theory of fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650308323396">Grau &amp; Doll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650308323396">Greenberg, 1990b</xref>) and represents “a broad theoretical framework for understanding the manner in which social cues lead to perceptions of fairness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650308323396">Darke &amp; Dahl, 2003</xref>, p. 330); it is thus a “cognitive theory,” one that focuses on people’s perceptions.</p>
<p>Equity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650308323396">Adams, 1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">1965</xref>) asserts that people are most satisfied when they perceive that they are being treated fairly—that is, equitably—in their relationships with other people, or with groups or organizations; motivation stems from attempts to redress unfairness, or “inequity” in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0007650308323396">Wilkens &amp; Timm, 1978</xref>). Although much early work in equity theory focused on perceptions of fairness in employee-employer relationships, equity researchers generally take the position that <italic>any</italic> type of exchange relationship can be perceived as fair or unfair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0007650308323396">Weick, 1966</xref>). Even though the results of some studies of allocation decisions have suggested that individuals sometimes eschew equity norms in favor of norms based on need or equality in the allocation of rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0007650308323396">Wagstaff, 1998</xref>), equity theory remains critical to the analysis of perceptions of fairness in relationships. Indeed, more recent augmentations of equity theory such as “equity sensitivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0007650308323396">Miles, Hatfield, &amp; Huseman, 1989</xref>) actually implicitly take into account preferences for non-equity-based norms. Equity theory has been tested in hundreds of studies in laboratory and field settings. Although it was originally developed to explain motivation in employee-employer relationships, it has been successfully applied to explain diverse phenomena in other types of relationships, such as those between consumers and retailers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650308323396">Darke &amp; Dahl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0007650308323396">Hoffman &amp; Kelley, 2000</xref>), taxpayers and governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0007650308323396">Kim, 2002</xref>), health care providers and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0007650308323396">Van Dierendonck, Schaufeli, &amp; Buunk, 2001</xref>), children and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0007650308323396">Ingersoll-Dayton, Neal, Ha, &amp; Hammer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0007650308323396">Vogl-Bauer, Kalbfleish, &amp; Beatty, 1999</xref>), and between team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0007650308323396">Wilke, Rutte, &amp; Van Knippenberg, 2000</xref>), friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0007650308323396">Roberto &amp; Scott, 1986</xref>), and spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0007650308323396">Webster &amp; Rice, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0007650308323396">Zuo &amp; Bian, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Equity theory hinges on the inputs that social actors make into an exchange relationship and the outcomes they derive from that relationship. Inputs represent “investments” in the exchange relationship, for which the contributor expects some reciprocal return. They thus include all those factors that the individual sees as relevant reward-worthy contributions to the relationship in which he or she is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650308323396">Campbell &amp; Pritchard, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650308323396">Cosier &amp; Dalton, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0007650308323396">Weick (1966)</xref>, for example, defined an input as “anything that a person regards as relevant in the exchange and for which he expects a just return” (p. 417). Thus, inputs are perceived to be such by the social actor who contributes them, although they will not necessarily be perceived as such by the other actor in the exchange relationship: As long as the former sees an input he or she contributes to the relationship as relevant to it, that input becomes an important factor in her perception of the equity or inequity of the relationship. The criteria that are perceived as inputs may vary widely across individuals and will also vary with the nature of the relationship (e.g., employee-employer versus buyer-seller).</p>
<p>On the other side of the exchange relation are resources, returns, rewards, or compensation that the actor derives from the relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams (1965)</xref> called these receipts “outcomes.” In the most general terms, outcomes can be conceived of as any consequences to the person of his or her participation in a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0007650308323396">Hunt, Kernan, &amp; Mizerski, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650308323396">Kabanoff (1991)</xref> took the position that outcomes are “conditions and goods that affect well-being, which includes psychological, physiological, economic, and social aspects” (p. 417). Outcomes, like inputs, are perceived, and their relevance to the exchange relationship stems merely from their recognition by the “receiver” as outcomes, whether or not they are perceived as such by the “giver.” The determination of what constitutes a relevant outcome also varies across individuals and the context of the relationship; indeed, the perceptions of exchange partners as to what is a valuable outcome may differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0007650308323396">Scheer, Kumar, &amp; Steenkamp, 2003</xref>). Contemporary equity theorists usually distinguish between “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” rewards or outcomes: Extrinsic rewards are those administered by an entity external to the individual, or those not <italic>directly</italic> associated with engaging in a given task or behavior (e.g., financial rewards), whereas intrinsic rewards are those that are “administered” by the self or are directly associated with engaging in a given task or behavior (e.g., satisfaction with task accomplishment).</p>
<p>The key process in the development of perceptions of equity or inequity in exchange relationships is a social actor’s comparison of its inputs to and outcomes from the relationship with the inputs and outcomes of the other party in the relationship, others who are in similar exchange relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0007650308323396">Oldham, Kulik, Stepina, &amp; Ambrose, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0007650308323396">Ronen, 1986</xref>), or the actor’s historical self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650308323396">Bretz &amp; Thomas, 1992</xref>).

For example, an untenured faculty member at a university might develop his or her perceptions concerning the degree of equity in his or her relationship with the school by comparing his or her inputs and outcomes with those of another untenured faculty member in the same department, although the comparison-other, or referent, need not be so similar to the person; the comparison-other may even be an abstraction based on a class or category of others (e.g., untenured faculty members) rather than a specific individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650308323396">Campbell &amp; Pritchard, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650308323396">Cosier &amp; Dalton, 1983</xref>).</p>

<p>Inequity for a social actor exists when he or she perceives that the ratio of his or her outcomes from an exchange relationship to his or her inputs to the relationship is different from the corresponding ratio of the comparison-other.

<title>Equity Theory and Stakeholder Action</title>
<p>Given that stakeholder management implies, in part, making decisions concerning the allocation of resources among a variety of constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650308323396">Freeman, 1984</xref>), concerns of fairness (i.e., equity) in the distribution of resources—and the implications of fairness for stakeholder support of the FO—are implicitly acknowledged in much of the stakeholder literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0007650308323396">Husted, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0007650308323396">Husted (1998)</xref> pointed out that, although concepts of justice are commonly applied in the context of employee-employer relationships, such concepts are also easily applicable to relationships between the FO and its other stakeholders. Thus, stakeholders compare their inputs to the FO to the outcomes they derive from it and use this comparison to make assessments concerning the fairness of the FO’s resource allocations. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams (1965)</xref>, the “person” and the “comparison-other” in the exchange relationship need not refer to individuals: They may also represent groups or organizations. Stakeholders and FOs exist in exchange relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650308323396">Hill &amp; Jones, 1992</xref>) that are susceptible to perceptions of inequity by either party; therefore, equity theory can be applied without undue extension to understanding the role of fairness in relationships that exist between FOs and their stakeholders. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0007650308323396">Husted (1998)</xref> argued, “Fairness in . . . decisions . . . is logically an essential element in stakeholder perceptions of the firm <italic>and in their willingness to support the firm</italic>” (p. 647).

<title>Underrewarded stakeholders</title>
<p>The perception of underreward often leads to conflict when attempts to rectify the inequity are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650308323396">Kabanoff, 1991</xref>), and this can be the outcome in stakeholder–FO relationships. Consider a situation in which a stakeholder perceives that the ratio of outcomes it derives from the FO (whether they be tangible resources or some less tangible consideration) to what it contributes to the FO is less than the corresponding ratio of the FO. In situations where this relation holds, the stakeholder will perceive itself as underrewarded, will find the relationship inequitable, and will be motivated to take action to remedy that inequity. Reducing such inequities might require a stakeholder to take action against the FO to increase the outcomes it derives from the relationship, reduce the inputs it contributes to the relationship, or reduce the outcomes the FO derives from it. Thus, a stakeholder’s propensity to act against an FO is positively related to the degree to which it perceives underreward inequity in its relationship with that organization.</p>

<p>Threat of stakeholder action because of the perception of underreward underlies most stakeholder–FO relationships. For example, all stakeholders can use voice, potentially a very low-cost action, to make their opinions of their relationship with the FO known. Threat of severance of the relationship is another general approach that stakeholders may use when their interests are not being met (although this may be a higher cost option), because such a move can deny the FO critical resources that may, in extreme cases, threaten the survival of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650308323396">Hill &amp; Jones, 1992</xref>): A dissatisfied customer, for example, can shop elsewhere or, worse for the FO, convince others to likewise sever their relationships with the firm; employees can quit; shareholders can divest stock. The repertoire of potential stakeholder actions taken against the FO is vast.</p>

<title>Resource dependence in stakeholder responses to underreward</title>
<p>The degree of resource dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0007650308323396">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>) that a stakeholder exhibits with respect to the FO should be a critical moderator of its responses to underreward inequity. One’s tendency to respond to inequity will be tempered if such response is very costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0007650308323396">Watson, Storey, Wynarczyk, Keasy, &amp; Short, 1996</xref>). Therefore, if a stakeholder is highly dependent on the FO for a critical resource (e.g., if no substitutes are available), the propensity to act against the FO—especially by severing the relationship—will be moderated because of the increased costs of action. In such circumstances, cognitive rather than behavioral responses to perceived inequity may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0007650308323396">Watson et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, sanctions in general, and severance of the relationship in particular, will be less common if the stakeholder exhibits a great deal of resource dependence on the FO. This is consistent with the position of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0007650308323396">Ring and Van de Ven (1994)</xref>, who stated that severance is more likely if alternative relationships exist that can satisfy one’s needs. (If such alternatives are not available, a higher degree of resource dependence exists.) For example, an underrewarded employee who has no other job opportunities because of a lack of skills or a very tight job market will be more likely to cognitively adjust or submit to the inequity than to quit. On the other hand, if many job opportunities are available to him or her, quitting is a very viable option.</p>
<p>Resource dependence may also temper responses to inequity because of its influence on cognitive variables such as attributions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650308323396">Kabanoff (1991)</xref> asserted that resource dependence is inversely related to power and stated that in a relationship characterized by power imbalance, the less powerful (i.e., more dependent) party is less likely to perceive “objective” violations of equity by the stronger party as such. Furthermore, should the weak party in fact object to underreward, the stronger party may be in a favorable position to provide a justification for the inequitable reward distribution. Thus, in a relationship characterized by a substantial power imbalance (i.e., a high degree of resource dependence for one party), the weak party in a relationship may be less likely to respond to underreward inequity, and motivation to restore equity will be weak, difficult to sustain, or lacking completely. In relationships characterized by low resource dependence (for either party), on the other hand, participants are more likely to engage in overt conflict aimed at remedying the inequity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650308323396">Kabanoff, 1991</xref>).</p>

<p>How a stakeholder will respond to the second type of inequity condition, overreward inequity, is less clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams (1965)</xref> posited that a social actor perceiving overreward inequity will be motivated to reduce it. Some recent work has looked at the effects of equity perceptions on organizational citizenship behaviors—discretionary behaviors that promote the employer’s interests but are not within the employee’s job description. Such behaviors can be regarded as a specific instance of the more general concept of “pro-social” or “helping” behaviors. Citizenship behaviors appear to be positively related to perceptions of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650308323396">Deluga, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0007650308323396">Moorman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0007650308323396">Niehoff &amp; Moorman, 1993</xref>).

<p>It must be noted that the outcomes a given stakeholder derives from an FO may also be associated with the interests of <italic>other</italic> stakeholders, or even those of non-stakeholders. Therefore, perceptions of inequity on the part of one stakeholder can be based in part on the FO’s treatment of another stakeholder or a non-stakeholder.

<title>Expectancy Theory</title>
<p>Expectancy theory has been called “perhaps the most widely accepted theory of work and motivation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0007650308323396">Wahba &amp; House, 1974</xref>, p. 121) and the “dominant paradigm” for workplace motivation research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650308323396">Connoly, 1976</xref>). In basic terms, expectancy theory posits that people’s behavior results from their expectations about the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of analyzing actions using expectations and subjective values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650308323396">Feather, 1992</xref>). Early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0007650308323396">Lewin (1938)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0007650308323396">Tolman (1959)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0007650308323396">Rotter (1955)</xref>, and others converged into an approach to motivation in industrial and organizational psychology that came to be called <italic>expectancy theory</italic> (although it is also sometimes referred to as <italic>VIE theory</italic> [for valence, instrumentality, and expectancy theory] or <italic>expectancy X valence theory</italic>). The theory was popularized in organizational studies through the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0007650308323396">Vroom (1964)</xref>. Like equity theory, expectancy theory focuses on individuals’ perceptions. However, rather than concentrating on perceptions of fairness, expectancy theory states that motivation comes from perceptions of one’s likelihood of achieving or obtaining specific outcomes and the values, or valences, one ascribes to those outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650308323396">House, Shapiro, &amp; Wahba, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0007650308323396">Reinharth &amp; Wahba, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>In expectancy theory, behavior is seen as being motivated by a desire by boundedly rational individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0007650308323396">Simon, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>) to maximize certain outcomes (e.g., rewards, satisfiers) and minimize others (e.g., punishments, dissatisfiers, negative reinforcements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0007650308323396">Isaac, Zerbe, &amp; Pitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0007650308323396">Vroom, 1964</xref>). As in equity theory, outcomes can be either intrinsic (e.g., satisfaction with a job well-done, a sense of camaraderie) or extrinsic (e.g., financial rewards) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0007650308323396">Oliver, 1974</xref>). In the decades since its initial development, expectancy theory has been “subjected to rigorous academic testing and has been shown to have strong support” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650308323396">Fudge &amp; Schlacter, 1999</xref>, p. 296): Each of the components of expectancy theory has been confirmed to have a positive influence on motivation, and the theory has been applied to an astonishing variety of topics.</p>

<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0007650308323396">Vroom (1964)</xref> was the first to apply expectancy theory to the study of behavior in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0007650308323396">Mitchell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0007650308323396">Sheridan, Slocum, &amp; Richards, 1974</xref>), a number of writers after him developed their own expectancy theories or further developed Vroom’s model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650308323396">Graen, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650308323396">Lawler &amp; Porter, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0007650308323396">Porter &amp; Lawler, 1968</xref>). Contemporary expectancy models typically regard motivation as a multiplicative function of effort-performance expectancy (E→P expectancy), performance-outcome expectancy (P→O expectancy), and the valence of outcomes or rewards (V). These components are further described below.</p>
<sec id="section12-0007650308323396">
<title>Expectancies</title>
<p>E→P expectancy is the person’s subjective estimate that expending effort will lead to a first-level outcome—successful performance of an intended behavior, task, or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0007650308323396">Pool, 1997</xref>): For example, an employee appointed to a particular task will have an E→P expectancy concerning the relationship between putting forth effort and successful accomplishment of the task—the employee might think he or she has a 50% chance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650308323396">Lawler (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">1994</xref>) asserted that this expectancy should be regarded as varying from zero to one; it is a subjective probability estimate. E→P expectancies may be derived from sources such as the objective situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>); communications from other people, especially those with experience with the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0007650308323396">Naylor, Pritchard, &amp; Ilgen, 1980</xref>); personality factors such as self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1973</xref>); and previous subjective experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650308323396">Feather, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0007650308323396">House, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>P→O expectancies concern the perceived relationship between the first-level outcome—for example, successful task performance—and various other consequences, or “second-level outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0007650308323396">Pool, 1997</xref>). For example, an employee might have a P→O expectancy concerning the connection between successful task accomplishment and the receipt of a promotion. Because a successful behavior may be related to many outcomes, several P→O expectancies may be associated with a given act. P→O expectancies are influenced by factors such as the objective situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>), past experiences with the situation and reinforcement history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0007650308323396">Maki, Overmier, Delos, &amp; Gutmann, 1995</xref>), communication from others about the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0007650308323396">Galbraith &amp; Cummings, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0007650308323396">Naylor et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0007650308323396">Smith, Jones, &amp; Blair, 2000</xref>), the nature of the outcome (i.e., positive or negative) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650308323396">Lawler, 1994</xref>), and personality factors such as locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650308323396">Broedling, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650308323396">Giles, 1977</xref>) and attributional approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650308323396">Feather, 1992</xref>). Many P→O expectancies can be influenced directly by policy makers: For example, organizations can manipulate the relationship between performance and pay, which should influence employees’ P→O expectancies.</p>
<p>Some researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650308323396">Lawler &amp; Porter, 1967</xref>) collapse E→P and P→O into one effort-reward expectancy, which represents the subjective perception of the likelihood that desired rewards will follow from certain effort levels: This has been a common approach in empirical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0007650308323396">Mitchell, 1974</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0007650308323396">
<title>Valence of outcomes</title>
<p>The valence of an outcome is a representation of the anticipated satisfaction associated with the outcome, although it is common to interpret the term <italic>valence</italic> as the desirability or importance of an outcome. An outcome is positive in valence if the person prefers attaining the outcome to not attaining it, and negative in valence if the person prefers not attaining it to attaining it.

<p>Which outcomes are valued (and the degree to which they are valued) can vary drastically across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0007650308323396">Isaac et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0007650308323396">Snead &amp; Harrell, 1994</xref>).

Perceptions of outcome valences can also be developed through communication from others concerning the desirability of the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0007650308323396">Lewin, 1951</xref>).</p>
<p>As in equity theory, both intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes are important in expectancy theory. Early expectancy researchers tended to focus on extrinsic outcomes; that is, those such as pay, recognition, or promotion, which are administered by others and are not directly associated with engaging in a given behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0007650308323396">Isaac et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0007650308323396">Powers &amp; Thompson, 1994</xref>). However, later researchers noted the importance of intrinsic outcomes. As noted earlier, intrinsic outcomes are those that motivate because of subjectively administered rewards: those psychological rewards associated with, for example, working on a task, completing a task, or performing well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650308323396">Campbell &amp; Pritchard, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650308323396">Graen, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0007650308323396">House, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0007650308323396">Mastrofski, Ritti, &amp; Snipes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0007650308323396">Naylor et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0007650308323396">Porter &amp; Lawler, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0007650308323396">Lawler &amp; Hall, 1970</xref>).

<p>The motivation function is conceived as a product because both positive valence and positive expectancies are seen as necessary but not sufficient conditions for motivation. For example, an outcome high in valence does not motivate if the expectancy that that outcome can be achieved is zero, whereas, conversely, an outcome that is certain to be accomplished (i.e., has a very high expectancy) does not motivate if one does not care whether or not the outcome is achieved (i.e., the outcome has a valence of zero).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0007650308323396">Vroom (1964)</xref> asserted that when choosing between alternative acts, the one with the strongest positive (or weakest negative) motivational force is the act that will be chosen. For example, if pay increases and job security might potentially be achieved through negotiation as well as through unionization, the activity that will be undertaken is the one with the greater motivational force. This criterion also holds for non-acts. For example, if unionization has a strong motivational force, but not unionizing has a greater force, attempts to unionize will be unlikely to occur. People also choose between levels of effort based on the motivation scores associated with effort levels.</p>

<title>Expectancy Theory and Stakeholder Action</title>
<p>It is readily apparent that not all discontented stakeholders will take action against the FO. For example, in her book <italic>Nickel and Dimed</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650308323396">Barbara Ehrenreich (2001)</xref> documented how employees at a Wal-Mart store, though clearly feeling underrewarded by the company, showed little interest in taking action to rectify the situation. Therefore, in addition to perceptions of inequity, other forces must be at work in determining stakeholder action against the FO. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0007650308323396">Mitroff (1983)</xref>, stakeholders are usually conceived of as rational, calculating entities. Indeed, he states, “The most important property of stakeholders . . . is the presumption of rationality” (p. 43). It is the rationality or, at least, the <italic>subjective</italic> rationality of stakeholders (i.e., their propensities to choose actions that appear suitable, given the available facts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0007650308323396">Ryall, 2003]</xref>), that leads to a contingency noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref>: A stakeholder must perceive that it has the ability to take action, or it will not do so. Both these concepts—subjective rationality and perceptions concerning ability—are concisely addressed in the concepts of expectancy theory. Hence, expectancy theory seems to be an appropriate framework for discussing what motivates stakeholders to act.</p>
<p>My application of expectancy theory to stakeholder–FO relationships is based on three assumptions concerning stakeholders, which are derived by generalizing from similar assumptions (about individuals) that are the basis of expectancy models of motivation. First, a stakeholder will have preferences concerning outcomes influenced by the FO. For example, employees might prefer more pay and more job security to less pay and less job security, or customers could prefer higher levels of service to lower levels. Furthermore, the various outcomes influenced by the FO will vary in valence, the degree to which they are of import to the stakeholder. On the basis of the tenets of expectancy theory, a stakeholder should be motivated to protect outcomes it prefers, especially those particularly high in valence.</p>
<list id="list6-0007650308323396" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Proposition 6</italic>: A stakeholder is more likely to act against an FO if a highly valued outcome (i.e., an outcome high in valence) is at stake.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Second, stakeholders have expectancies concerning their abilities to undertake particular actions (i.e., they have E→P expectancies). For example, employees might have expectancies concerning the likelihood that attempts to unionize will, in fact, lead to unionization. According to expectancy theory, E→P expectancies should be positively related to motivation, all else being equal. Therefore,</p>
<list id="list7-0007650308323396" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Proposition 7</italic>: A stakeholder is more likely to act against an FO if it believes that it can successfully undertake the proposed action (i.e., E→P expectancy is high).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, stakeholders have expectancies about the likelihood that particular outcomes will follow from successful action (i.e., they have P→O expectancies). For example, employees might have expectancies concerning the extent to which a successful attempt to unionize will lead to higher pay and greater job security. According to expectancy theory, P→O expectancies should be positively related to motivation, all else being equal. Therefore,</p>
<list id="list8-0007650308323396" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Proposition 8</italic>: A stakeholder is more likely to act against an FO if it believes that successful action is likely to substantially promote attainment of some valued outcome (i.e., P→O expectancy is high).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>On the basis of these assumptions about stakeholders and the tenets of expectancy theory, then, I assert that stakeholders will be motivated to act against the FO when the following conditions hold. First, the stakeholder must believe that taking a given action against the FO will lead to particular outcomes (i.e., it must have a positive P→O expectancy). Second, the stakeholder must ascribe positive values (i.e., positive valences) to those outcomes. Third, the stakeholder must have some degree of belief that it can successfully undertake the proposed action (i.e., it must have a positive E→P expectancy). If any of these conditions does not hold, a stakeholder will be unlikely to take action.</p>

<title>Visibility and Stakeholder Action</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650308323396">Chen and Miller (1994)</xref> used expectancy theory to explain competitive retaliation by one firm to the strategic moves of another firm. In doing so, they add another variable to their expectancy-based framework—visibility. They note that motivation models typically tacitly assume that one must be aware of a threat to respond to it and posit that the more obvious a competitive attack by an organization, the more likely is retaliation by competitors who are threatened by that attack. Visibility is likewise taken here to be an important component in eliciting from stakeholders responses to activities of an FO. Simply put, a stakeholder that is not aware of the ways in which the FO influences the outcomes that accrue to it is unlikely to act against the FO. Therefore, in a model of stakeholder action, some degree of visibility of (at least) some relevant subset of activities of the FO must be present for equity, outcome valences, and expectancies to have any effect on a stakeholder’s propensity to act. Visibility can thus be seen as a prerequisite for the equity- and expectancy-related effects proposed here and should be positively related to stakeholder action.</p>
<list id="list9-0007650308323396" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Proposition 9</italic>: An FO whose actions are high in visibility is more likely to have stakeholder action directed toward it than is an FO that is low in visibility.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It is noteworthy that manipulation of visibility is, in fact, one way in which stakeholders may act against an FO. Specifically, a stakeholder may attempt to bring the actions of an FO to the attention of other stakeholders (i.e., increase visibility of the FO’s actions to those stakeholders) in an attempt to elicit support for its position—and further action against the FO—from those other stakeholders. As an example, anti-fur activists have been quite successful at influencing consumers’ opinions concerning fur by videotaping seal hunts in the Canadian arctic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650308323396">Guy, 2000</xref>). By increasing the visibility of hunters’ and furriers’ activities to consumers, they have successfully convinced many consumers to “jump on the anti-fur bandwagon,” so to speak.</p>

<title>An Equity/Expectancy Framework for Understanding Stakeholder Action</title>
<p>Although there have been only a few attempts to look at expectancy and equity concurrently (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650308323396">Harder, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650308323396">1992</xref>), perceptions of equity and expectancies will combine in their effects on stakeholder motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650308323396">Cosier &amp; Dalton, 1983</xref>). Thus, it makes sense to consider the effects of both on stakeholder action simultaneously. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0007650308323396">Figure 1</xref>, I present an equity/expectancy framework for understanding stakeholder propensities for action directed against an organization.

<title>Dimensions of the Framework</title>
<p>The framework includes two dimensions. The first dimension is “type of inequity,” which represents the type of inequity the stakeholder perceives in its relationship with the FO. Of course, real equity perceptions are a continuous variable; however, for the sake of simplicity, and because reaction to inequity hinges pivotally on the <italic>type</italic> of inequity encountered in addition to its degree, I follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0007650308323396">Mowday (1979)</xref> in reducing the inequity continuum to two conditions, underreward and overreward. The underreward condition represents a situation where the stakeholder perceives that its ratio of outcomes from to inputs to the stakeholder–FO relationship is lower than the corresponding ratio for either the FO (i.e., O<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> &lt; O<italic><sub>f</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>f</sub></italic>) or a comparison-other stakeholder (i.e., O<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> &lt; O<italic><sub>co</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>co</sub></italic>). The overreward condition represents a situation where the stakeholder perceives that its ratio of outcomes from to inputs to the stakeholder–FO relationship is greater than the corresponding ratio for the FO (i.e., O<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> &gt; O<sub>f</sub>/I<sub>f</sub>) or a comparison-other stakeholder (i.e., O<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> &gt; O<italic><sub>co</sub></italic>/I<italic><sub>co</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>The second dimension is “expectancy.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650308323396">Lawler and Porter (1967)</xref> advised that effort-reward probabilities can be determined through a multiplicative combination of the effort-performance and performance-reward probabilities. Such a multiplicative approach to defining overall expectancy has also been suggested by several other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0007650308323396">Kopelman &amp; Thompson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0007650308323396">Seybolt &amp; Pavett, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0007650308323396">Steers &amp; Porter, 1979</xref>). Accordingly, this dimension represents the multiplicative combination of the stakeholder’s E→P expectancy (i.e., the expectancy that it can successfully undertake a given action directed against the FO) and its P→O expectancy (i.e., the expectancy that successful action against the FO will lead to desired outcomes). Like perceptions of equity, expectancy, which represents subjective probabilities, is a continuous variable. However, to simplify the framework, I have reduced it to two levels, high and low.</p>
<p>The framework does not include a dimension representing outcome valence. It presumes that the FO has at least partial discretion over an outcome or outcomes that are of reasonably high positive valence to the stakeholder. It also presumes reasonable levels of visibility; that is, FO activities that influence outcomes to the stakeholder and are relevant for making judgments of equity are apparent to the stakeholder to some extent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0007650308323396">
<title>Explanation of the Framework</title>
<p>Different combinations of the equity and expectancy dimensions will lead to different stakeholder propensities to act against the FO. Consider first the northwest quadrant. In this situation, action by the stakeholder against the FO is likely. Underreward inequity will result in motivation for the stakeholder to take action against the FO; simultaneously, because of the high expectancy, the stakeholder will see attempting to take action against the FO as likely to be successful and to lead to desired outcomes, which will also motivate it to do so. In this case, then, equity and expectancy considerations will be compounded to produce a strong propensity for action by the stakeholder against the FO; that is, the stakeholder will be likely to impose sanctions on the FO. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650308323396">Greenberg (1990a)</xref> found that groups of employees whose pay was temporarily reduced had significantly higher theft rates than groups that did not experience pay cuts. The equity/expectancy framework explains this result in this manner: Some members of the former group suddenly perceived themselves as underrewarded relative to members of the latter. Furthermore, they saw theft as an achievable endeavor and a potential means to remedy the inequity (i.e., they had high expectancy). Therefore, they engaged in theft.</p>
<p>In the northeast quadrant, the stakeholder experiences overreward in its relationship with the FO combined with a high expectancy that action directed against the FO will be successful and will lead to desired outcomes. Extrapolating from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams (1965)</xref>, overreward should lead the stakeholder to either increase its contributions to the stakeholder–FO relationship or reduce the outcomes it derives from that relationship, and indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650308323396">Harder (1992)</xref> found that overreward was positively related to team-oriented, cooperative behavior on the part of the overrewarded party. In this condition, then, the stakeholder may, because of the overreward, be very cooperative and even engage in pro-social, or “helping” behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0007650308323396">Masterson, 2001</xref>) in its relationship with the FO.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as noted earlier, overreward inequity is often tolerated, so stakeholder behaviors aimed at reducing this inequity may not ensue. Indeed, a stakeholder’s overreward threshold may be such that it behaves in an “aggrandizing” manner, striving to get more from its relationship with the FO, despite the overreward. Such aggrandizing behavior may occur in this quadrant because of the high expectancy: The stakeholder will believe that successful action against the FO leading to desired outcomes is a strong possibility. Thus, whether this overreward/high-expectancy condition leads to cooperative or aggrandizing behavior is in part dependent on the degree to which the stakeholder is tolerant of overreward in its relationship with the FO.</p>
<p>In the southeast quadrant, where the stakeholder perceives itself to be overrewarded in its relationship with the FO and the expectancy of successful action against the FO leading to beneficial outcomes is low, the stakeholder is not likely to engage in action directed against the FO. A stakeholder in this quadrant may exhibit a great deal of cooperation with the FO or undertake pro-social behaviors, and it will not act against it. Despite the fact that overreward may be tolerated, aggrandizing behavior on the part of the stakeholder is not likely in this quadrant because of the low-expectancy condition: Even if tolerance for overreward is very high, the stakeholder will not perceive that action against the FO is likely to be successful and to lead to desired outcomes. Therefore, even if a stakeholder experiencing this combination of equity and expectancy conditions does not exhibit cooperation or pro-social behaviors, it is not likely to act negatively against the FO, instead exhibiting “contentedness.”</p>
<p>In the southwest quadrant, where a stakeholder perceives underreward inequity in its relationship with the FO and low expectancy, the stakeholder is likely to be dissatisfied with its relationship with the FO but will not see attempting to act against it as likely to succeed and to produce desired outcomes. Therefore, in this case, the stakeholder may submit to the inequitable relationship. Such submission to an inequitable situation because of low expectancies is evident in the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0007650308323396">Makoul and Roloff (1998)</xref>, who observed that the propensity to withhold relational complaints was negatively related to the expectancy that such complaints would lead to a change in the behavior of the subject’s partner.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams (1965)</xref>, though, asserted that severance of a relationship is one way to reduce the dissonance that results from an inequitable relationship. So, alternatively, a stakeholder in the underreward/low-expectancy condition might choose to sever its relationship with the FO. This latter notion is consistent with the position that the perception of equity in a relationship is positively related to its maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650308323396">Dubinsky &amp; Levy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0007650308323396">Vogl-Bauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0007650308323396">Walster, Walster, &amp; Traupmann, 1978</xref>) and the suggestion that a relationship characterized by the perception of underreward inequity is more likely to dissolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0007650308323396">Griffeth &amp; Gaertner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0007650308323396">Kunkel, 1997</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams (1965)</xref> saw withdrawal from a relationship as a last resort in situations of inequity, because individuals will tend to choose the least costly approach to inequity reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650308323396">Cook &amp; Hegtvedt, 1983</xref>). Therefore, one factor that will have a very strong influence on which recourse—severance or submission—is undertaken is the degree of resource dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650308323396">Barney, 1991</xref>) that characterizes the stakeholder–FO relationship, given that resource dependence on the part of the stakeholder increases exit costs (i.e., the costs associated with severance of the relationship) substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650308323396">Hill &amp; Jones, 1992</xref>). Thus, if the stakeholder is subject to a high degree of resource dependence on the FO, exit from the relationship will be unlikely because of its high cost, and submission of the stakeholder to the inequitable relationship will be the probable outcome in the southwest quadrant. On the other hand, where the stakeholder’s resource dependence on the FO is low—for example, if it can easily find a substitute for the resources provided to it by the FO—exit may be a low-cost means of inequity reduction, and severance of the stakeholder’s relationship with the FO becomes a very viable option. This position is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650308323396">Floyd and Wasner’s (1994)</xref> finding that relationship commitment results, in part, from the limited availability of desirable alternative relationships.</p>

<title>Interest-Based Stakeholder Action</title>
<p>The conditions that lead to stakeholder action have not been well described in the literature to date. One exception to this statement is work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref>, which focuses on stakeholder action based on attempts to establish, enhance, or maintain social identity. However, as noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> acknowledged that social identity reinforcement is not, in fact, the basis for most stakeholder action. This work provides an alternative view to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> by identifying the connection between stakeholder interests, stakeholder motivation, and stakeholder action. Stakeholder interests (i.e., outcomes) provide the impetus for stakeholder action through their impacts on stakeholders’ motivations to act against the FO. These interests are taken into account through the outcome/input ratio that drives motivation in equity theory: Higher outcomes increase the stakeholder’s ratio and, all else being equal, should reduce the stakeholder’s propensity to take action against the FO by leading to either reduced perceptions of underreward or increased perceptions of overreward. Stakeholder interests are also taken into account in expectancy theory: In particular, high valence outcomes (i.e., important interests) will motivate stakeholders to take action against the FO if stakeholder expectancies that such action will promote or preserve those interests are sufficiently high. Thus, this work provides an explicit articulation of an interest-based view of stakeholder action, particularly by identifying the processes through which FO actions that affect stakeholder interests are translated into stakeholder motivation and the propensity of the stakeholder to act against the FO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0007650308323396">
<title>Equity and Expectancy in Stakeholder Action Resulting From Social Identity</title>
<p>It is also my position that an interest-based approach to understanding stakeholder action, founded in equity theory and expectancy theory, can, in fact, subsume the social identity perspective advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref>. These authors assert that an interest-based view of stakeholder action cannot explain, for example, why some stakeholders pursue lost causes. I submit that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu’s (2003)</xref> position stems from an unnecessarily narrow view of the definition of <italic>stakeholder interests</italic>. This narrow definition of interests is implied when they state, “Despite the lack of material or pecuniary benefits, individuals may still participate in group action toward the focal organization” (p. 208). They assert that social identity processes are behind stakeholder action in such cases. Material and pecuniary benefits, though, only represent extrinsic rewards—those administered by entities outside the individual and not associated with the activity itself—thus, their definition of interest ignores another type of reward that has been identified in the equity theory and expectancy theory literatures, namely, intrinsic rewards—those rewards, such as psychological gratification, that result merely from undertaking a given activity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> suggested that when one pursues a lost cause, “the expected rational benefits of the action are negligible or negative” (p. 208). However, if stakeholder interests are seen to include intrinsic rewards, pursuit of a lost cause can be seen as interest based and rational: It is in the stakeholder’s interest to feel a sense of gratification, and acting, even in pursuit of a lost cause, can be a source of gratification. So, for example, the feeling of solidarity and reinforcement of identity with a group that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> argued can serve as bases for stakeholder action, if they are viewed as intrinsic rewards, become interests that the stakeholder might “rationally” pursue. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> came close to explicitly acknowledging the importance of intrinsic rewards in social identity–based stakeholder action. They state, “Group membership and the identity gained from this association are strongly related to value rationality—the pursuit of a cause or principle that has intrinsic value independent of (and that may supersede) the related outcomes” (p. 211). From an equity/expectancy perspective, then, stakeholder action taken to emphasize a social identity is, in the end, interest based. In short, stakeholders act to promote their interests, whether these interests are material or symbolic, extrinsic or intrinsic.</p>

<title>Identified Precursors to Stakeholder Action as Influences on Stakeholder Expectancies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> listed a number of factors that can influence the likelihood of stakeholder action. Many of these variables can readily be seen to have effects on the likelihood of such action through their effects on stakeholder expectancies. One such precursor to stakeholder action is resources, whether material (e.g., computers, manpower) or non-material (e.g., leadership; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley &amp; Moldoveanu, 2003</xref>). Simply put, stakeholders who perceive that they lack the resources to organize, mobilize, or otherwise undertake the required action are unlikely to do so. I submit that resource constraints affect the propensity for stakeholders to act, in part, by acting on expectancies: stakeholders who perceive that they do not possess the necessary requirements to undertake a given action directed against the FO will have a low E→P expectancy and so will be less likely to take that action.</p>
<p>Another precursor of stakeholder action identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> is past action against the FO. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> pointed out that groups that have organized in the past are more likely to do so again because the relationships, norms, and common understandings developed in the past concerning their interests, along with experience with the action, make it easier for stakeholders to monitor the FO and coordinate with one another in taking action. In addition, costs (to the stakeholder) of action may be reduced when group infrastructure and a shared understanding of group goals have been developed through previous action.</p>
<p>The relationships, norms, and reduced costs of action should increase the stakeholder’s E→P expectancies: Experience with taking action in the past, reduced costs, and the existence of relationships to facilitate such action should lead to heightened perceptions that the stakeholder can successfully undertake the action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0007650308323396">Rowley and Moldoveanu (2003)</xref> also noted that “the influence of past action is transferable across focal organizations” (p. 210); that is, past action by a stakeholder against one FO should raise the likelihood of it taking action against another FO. This should also be reflected in expectancies. For example, a stakeholder that has successfully organized a boycott in the past will have a higher expectancy that it can do so again to stand against a different FO: Its E→P expectancy will be heightened with respect to organizations in general, not a specific FO. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref> posited that successful actions by stakeholders (i.e., ones that result in positive outcomes for those stakeholders) against an organization increase the propensity of stakeholders to act against the FO. Such past actions by stakeholders against an organization will increase their and other stakeholders’ perceptions that (a) future actions can also be successfully undertaken (i.e., stakeholders’ E→P expectancies will be elevated), and (b) that such action will lead to the desired outcomes (i.e., P→O expectancies will be elevated). These conditions will increase stakeholder motivation to act.</p>
<p>Past actions against an FO may also lead to the development of an infrastructure that is supportive of future actions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref> suggested that the existence of such infrastructures increases the likelihood of stakeholder action. Again, an equity/expectancy approach provides an explanation for this proposition: Such infrastructures represent facilitating mechanisms that should raise a stakeholder’s E→P expectancy, thereby increasing stakeholder propensities to act against the FO. Other conditions proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0007650308323396">Rowley and Berman (2000)</xref>, such as low costs of action, the importance of the industry to the larger social system, and the existence of a collective consciousness of action, will similarly enhance stakeholder expectancies and so also affect stakeholders’ propensities to act.</p>

<p>The essence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650308323396">Jones’s (1995)</xref> argument is that opportunistic behaviors on the part of a firm’s managers leads to contracting inefficiencies (i.e., difficulties in forging or maintaining stable; cooperative; and, especially, trusting relationships with stakeholders), such that the firm’s performance will suffer relative to that of non-opportunistic firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650308323396">Jones, 1995</xref>). Jones’s propositions articulate how behaviors by firms such as the use of shark repellant, poison pills, or greenmail, the payment of disproportionately high levels of compensation to executives, the use of many suppliers, the contracting out of work, and the use of external rather than internal labor markets may be seen as opportunistic behaviors and may generate negative effects on firm reputation and erode trust between stakeholders and the FO, which, in turn, can have a negative impact on firm performance.</p>
<p>Although Jones’s argument concerning the performance effects of the negative firm reputation that can result from opportunism is compelling on its own, it is noteworthy that the majority of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650308323396">Jones’s (1995)</xref> propositions are also consistent with an equity/expectancy approach to understanding stakeholder action in stakeholder–FO relationships. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650308323396">Jones (1995)</xref> proposed that disproportionately high executive compensation, contracting out of work formerly done by employees, and reliance on external labor markets represent opportunism and a lack of trustworthiness on the part of managers, which can lead to suboptimal performance because of its detraction from firm relationships with key stakeholders. Such performance effects can be predicted from an equity/expectancy perspective: Disproportionately high executive compensation is likely to lead to perceptions of underreward inequity on the part of key stakeholders such as employees, stockholders, and the like, who are likely to compare their outcome/input ratios with those of highly visible executives. Similarly, contracting out work formerly done by employees and reliance on external labor markets will likely result in employees feeling underreward inequity. If these stakeholders possess high expectancies that they can successfully act against the firm and that such action will lead to positive outcomes, they will be motivated to take action against the firm, which may be detrimental to firm performance.</p>
<p>Thus, an equity/expectancy approach to stakeholder action can be seen as reinforcing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650308323396">Jones’s (1995)</xref> instrumental stakeholder theory. In general, it seems that opportunistic behavior by firms can lead to difficulty in maintaining relationships with stakeholders because (a) it produces a lack of trust that has negative effects on firm reputation (as posited by Jones), (b) it leads to perceptions of inequity between the firm (or its managers) and other stakeholders, and (c) it may have negative effects on outcomes that have high valences to stakeholders. These conditions can precipitate a lack of willingness on the part of the stakeholders concerned to continue to deal with the FO (i.e., severance of the relationship) or a retaliatory reaction by those stakeholders against the firm, both of which are likely to detract from firm performance. Whereas Jones’s theory relies on the transmission between stakeholders of information concerning opportunism, such that negative effects on firm reputation occur and negative performance effects result, an equity/expectancy position accounts for additional negative performance effects of opportunism that do not rest on the assumption that information relevant to firm reputation will be transmitted across stakeholders: Stakeholder action can result from stakeholders’ own observations of opportunism and the perceptions of inequity that result. The additional benefit of an equity/expectancy approach as an augmentation of Jones’s position is that it provides insight into when opportunistic behavior by a firm is likely to lead to action by stakeholders and when, on the other hand, such opportunism is unlikely to elicit a reaction from stakeholders (e.g., because of low expectancies).</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>An equity/expectancy approach to understanding stakeholder action represents a model that can assist managers in determining when an action taken by their organization is likely or unlikely to elicit a reaction from the stakeholders affected by it. Specifically, assuming a high-valence outcome is at stake, reaction is most likely to occur in response to firm actions that are highly visible and indicate or create underreward (from the stakeholder’s perspective) in the stakeholder–FO relationship if the expectancies are high that (a) stakeholder action will lead to the successful performance of activities or establishment of conditions that may lead to a positive outcome for the stakeholder and (b) the performance of such activities or establishment of such conditions will, in fact, lead to a positive outcome for the stakeholder.</p>
<p>The ramifications of this are manifold and suggest several directions for managerial attention. Expectancy considerations require that managerial attention be directed toward the determination of what stakeholders really value; that is, the outcomes that are particularly high in valence to them. Typically, expectancy theorists assert that identifying what individuals value is important so that they can be rewarded with high-valence outcomes for successful performance. The intention underlying clear identification of what stakeholders value highly is somewhat different. Because an objective of the FO would presumably be to <italic>inhibit</italic> stakeholder motivation to act against it, those outcomes that are high in valence to a stakeholder are those that should not be “interfered with” by firm actions—if such noninterference is possible—because impeding a stakeholder’s attainment of high-valence outcomes may motivate action against the firm by that stakeholder. By explicitly identifying the outcomes that are high in valence to its stakeholders, managers can gain insight into which outcomes should not be jeopardized by firm activities.</p>
<p>Adoption of an equity/expectancy point of view also leads to the conclusion that it may be in the interests of managers to pay attention to stakeholder perceptions of expectancies concerning potential actions against the FO. Generally speaking, stakeholder action against the FO should be less likely when expectancies are low, that is, when the stakeholder perceives that it would be very difficult to engage in the proposed action and/or it perceives that the proposed action is unlikely to lead to desired outcomes. It may be possible for FOs to take actions that reduce the perceived likelihood that stakeholder actions can be undertaken successfully (and so lower E→P expectancies) or that reduce perceptions of the connection between successful stakeholder action and outcomes valued by that stakeholder (and so lower P→O expectancies). For example, six months after the workers at a Wal-Mart store in Jonquiere, Quebec, won union certification, Wal-Mart announced it would close the store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650308323396">Anonymous, 2005a</xref>). Although Wal-Mart asserted that it was unable to reach an agreement with the union that would allow it to operate the store profitably because of the fact that union demands would have required increased hiring and additional hours for workers, this contention was disputed by the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW). Wal-Mart’s actions in this case can be regarded as an attempt to reduce employees’ expectancies concerning the efficacy of union certification. Essentially, Wal-Mart was signaling that, even if unionization is possible, it will not lead to better outcomes for employees: Wal-Mart was acting to reduce P→O expectancies concerning the likelihood that unionization will lead to valued outcomes for employees. Such actions could reduce the likelihood of unionization by employees at other Wal-Mart stores. Indeed, after the announcement of the store closure, the spokesperson for the UFCW acknowledged that Wal-Mart’s action would make other Wal-Mart employees think twice before voting for union accreditation. The next month, employees at a Wal-Mart in Windsor, Ontario, voted nearly three-to-one against union certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650308323396">Anonymous, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>Equity considerations imply that managers of an FO should find ways to make sure that stakeholders are equitably treated or, at least, <italic>perceive</italic> that they are being equitably treated. Becoming informed of stakeholders’ perceptions of the degree of equity in the relationship thus becomes an important managerial task, as does attempting to make sure that those perceptions are positive ones. Extrapolation from studies in the procedural justice literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650308323396">Conlon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0007650308323396">Thibaut &amp; Walker, 1975</xref>) suggests that giving stakeholders a voice in the decision process can positively affect their perceptions of fairness. Although this is not likely to be feasible in all situations, it is possible in some and could help promote perceptions of equity on the part of the stakeholder, thereby helping the FO avoid having action directed against it by that stakeholder. Providing an explanation of outcomes can also promote perceptions of equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0007650308323396">Williams, 1999</xref>) and reduce the dissonance associated with underreward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0007650308323396">O’Malley &amp; Davies, 1984</xref>), which suggests that managers would do well to make sure that important stakeholders are given reasonable explanations for any negative outcomes they may experience because of the firm’s activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, managers of the FO would be wise to undertake to understand which other stakeholders in its network a given stakeholder is likely to use for purposes of comparison. Stakeholders in a similar industry or possessing a similar relationship to the FO (e.g., suppliers) may be likely candidates for comparison, as may stakeholders whose inputs to or outcomes from the FO are widely known. Knowledge of the referents a stakeholder is likely to use for comparison purposes in assessments of equity is important, because the choice of a comparison-other can have an impact on whether one perceives equity or inequity in her relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0007650308323396">Griffeth et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, equity theory posits that what is an input into a relationship is determined by the <italic>possessor’s</italic> opinion concerning its relevance to the exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650308323396">Adams, 1965</xref>). Inequity may be perceived by one party in the relationship if things it considers are relevant inputs are not seen to be relevant inputs by the other party. Thus, a stakeholder may perceive inequity in its relations with the FO if things it considers to be relevant inputs into the relationship are not considered to be such by the FO. For example, a supplier to an organization might regard reliability as a relevant input to its relationship with the FO, whereas the FO regards the resource supplied as the only relevant input. The supplier who would not be compensated in any form for such reliability might feel underreward inequity, and such inequity might motivate the supplier to act against the FO—by seeking alternative customers or refusing to supply the resource, for example. Therefore, if one adopts an equity/ expectancy-based approach to understanding stakeholder–FO relationships, it becomes clear that the FO, if it wishes to avoid having stakeholder action directed against it, must make an effort to understand what its <italic>stakeholders</italic> consider to be inputs into their relationships with the firm—what they contribute to the FO’s well-being. By doing so, the FO can have a better understanding of its stakeholders’ perceptions of the degree of equity in their relationships with the firm, and perceptions of inequity that could lead to a stakeholder sanctioning the FO might be avoided.</p>
<p>An equity/expectancy approach to thinking about stakeholder action also suggests particular behaviors by those hoping to involve stakeholder groups in undertaking sanctions against an FO. For example, a leader or “influencer” of a stakeholder group could facilitate support for action by reinforcing among others in the stakeholder group the notion that they are underrewarded and by taking actions designed to bolster expectancies that successful action can be undertaken and will lead to desired outcomes. Likewise, one stakeholder might use a similar approach to convince other stakeholders to support its action against the FO. As an example of the former possibility, the faculty union and administration at a Canadian university recently managed to avert a strike by faculty. During early negotiations, though, influential members of the faculty union made numerous attempts to convince faculty that they were underrewarded by the university (e.g., by comparing faculty salaries at their university with those of other universities in the area), thus reinforcing a perception of underreward. They simultaneously presented substantial evidence that a strike could successfully be undertaken and would be likely to result in better outcomes for faculty (by, among other things, presenting evidence concerning recent successful strikes by faculty at other universities), thus raising expectancies. These activities, among others, resulted in overwhelming faculty support for a strike.</p>

<title>Avenues for Future Research</title>
<p>Several potential areas of future work pertain to the effects of the nature of the stakeholder–FO relationship on stakeholder propensities to take action against the FO. The type of relationship between the individual and the other in the exchange relationship appears to influence reactions to inequity; it may be the case that a similar effect exists in stakeholder–FO relationships. Key relationship characteristics that might be investigated include relationship history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650308323396">Cosier &amp; Dalton, 1983</xref>), relationship duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650308323396">Folger &amp; Martin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650308323396">Greenberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0007650308323396">Weick, 1966</xref>), attraction between parties to the exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0007650308323396">Griffith et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0007650308323396">Weick, 1966</xref>), and the degree of intimacy or closeness that characterizes the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0007650308323396">Wagstaff, 1998</xref>). For example, one might hypothesize, based on evidence from research in equity theory, that stakeholder action is more likely when the stakeholder–FO relationship is not exemplified by a high degree of closeness or when there has been a long history of underreward.</p>
<p>Work by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650308323396">Greenberg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0007650308323396">Holmes &amp; Levinger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0007650308323396">Hunt et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0007650308323396">Kuijer, Buunk, &amp; Ybema, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0007650308323396">Wagstaff, 1998</xref>) suggests that attribution of the cause of the inequity in its relationship with the FO could also have an impact on a stakeholder’s response to it. A stakeholder, for example, might attribute its underreward to the FO, but it might alternatively attribute the inequity to causes external to the FO that are not within the FO’s sphere of control. In the latter case, the FO’s role in the creation of the inequity might be “discounted,” and the stakeholder’s response to the inequity might be moderated accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, cultural standards may limit the applicability of norms of equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0007650308323396">Ring &amp; Van de Ven, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0007650308323396">Scheer et al., 2003</xref>), such that stakeholders in some cultures may be less likely to respond to inequity, favoring instead norms based on equality or need, for example. In such cases, the above model may not be applicable. This possibility should be considered.</p>
<p>Students of stakeholders should also focus more attention on the conditions that precipitate stakeholder actions that help, rather than hinder, the FO’s attainment of its goals. In a similar vein is the idea of coincidence of the interests of the stakeholder and the FO. As noted, this article has been founded mainly in an assumption, prevalent in the stakeholder literature, that conflict exists between the interests of the stakeholder and those of the FO. Thus, the stakeholder that perceives underreward and the possibility of correcting it may act against the FO to forward its own interests. However, some stakeholder–FO relationships may not be best characterized as exhibiting conflict between the interests of the two parties. For example, employees may be involved in profit sharing or might own part of the business that employs them. Clearly, such relationships, where the interests of stakeholders and the FO coincide to a substantial degree, would be characterized by different stakeholder propensities for action against the FO. Future work in stakeholder theory should address such situations, where the coincidence of stakeholder and FO interests is likely to make action against the FO less desirable.</p>
<p>Finally, it may be that other motivation theories can also offer insights into a stakeholder’s propensity to take action against the FO. For example, stakeholders may set particular goals that they strive to achieve; hence, goal-setting theory may also help us understand how stakeholders will act with respect to the FO. Addressing the needs and drives of key members of stakeholder organizations could also shed light on the issue of stakeholder action.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My primary goal in this article has been to address the conditions under which stakeholders will take action against an FO. I adopted two of the most well-established motivation theories, equity theory and expectancy theory, on the basis of which I developed a framework for understanding when a stakeholder is likely to take action against the FO. I assert that stakeholders are most likely to take action when they perceive underreward inequity in their relationship with the FO and they have high expectancies that they can successfully take action to remedy that inequity.</p>
<p>These premises are based on the idea that stakeholders will attempt to pursue what they perceive to be their own interests. It is worth noting, however, the possibility of stakeholder action that is not driven solely by stakeholder interests. Because my focus in this article has been an interest-based view of stakeholder action, I have emphasized stakeholders’ perceptions of their own interests as a fundamental source of such action; however, this need not preclude the existence of other bases for stakeholder action, which certainly may exist. For example, some might argue that true altruism (i.e., altruism not driven by the self-interest associated with psychological egoism) underlies some stakeholder action. Although I have argued that the social identity perspective concerning stakeholder action can be subsumed by an interest-based approach, still one need not assume that the interest-based view of stakeholder action, despite being the prevalent view, is the only relevant perspective on this topic. I believe that this work, in elaborating on the interest-based view, makes an important contribution to the limited literature concerning stakeholder action; however, it is clear that much more work remains to be done in this area.</p>
