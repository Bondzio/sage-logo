<title>Global social policies: Redistribution, regulation and rights</title>
<sec id="section2-1468018113491330">
<title>Redistribution</title>
<p>While considerable attention has been given to the leak of national tax revenues from countries due to strategic tax planning by multinational companies (see Regulation section), discussion about anything as radical as a global tax, raised by a global tax authority for global public goods, is significant by its absence. Given that there is little progress on global redistribution by means of taxes, it is even more worrying that official development aid fell by 4% in real terms in 2012, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD DAC) recently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018113491330">1</xref></sup> The continuing financial crisis and euro zone turmoil has led several governments to tighten their budgets, which has had a direct impact on development aid. Still, Richard Manning is critical of the OECD for ‘encouraging finance ministries to get away with murder as they seek to massage reported aid upwards at minimum costs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018113491330">2</xref></sup> In addition, there is a noticeable shift in aid allocation, away from the poorest countries and towards middle-income countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468018113491330">3</xref></sup> The shift is surprising, given that future development goals or processes are being intensively discussed as the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaches.</p>
<p>It is not only that proposals for global taxes are not receiving support; the proposed global fund for social protection is not attracting substantial support, either.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468018113491330">4</xref></sup> While the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria continues, health is receiving little attention in major international meetings and debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468018113491330">5</xref></sup> In terms of aid for trade, according to WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, ‘significant progress in securing additional financial resources’ has been made, but ‘sustaining financing flows in the continued tight fiscal environment is going to be tough’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468018113491330">6</xref></sup> In other words, another pillar in development aid might begin to totter.</p>
<p>At the same time, official development aid <italic>as such</italic> is not uncontested. Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, that Africa ‘can’t be dependent on donors’, and demanded innovation, infrastructure and jobs created by the private sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468018113491330">7</xref></sup> As the last point suggests, the aid business is increasingly focused on aiding private business as a means to alleviate poverty, as the Canadian Council for International Co-operation’s report, ‘Investing in Business of Development’ suggests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468018113491330">8</xref></sup> Needless to say, the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC’s) support points in exactly this direction,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1468018113491330">9</xref></sup> while Duncan Green’s recent blog post, ‘Aid and the private sector: a love story’ is critical of such ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1468018113491330">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the transnational tax issue might be more successfully addressed at a regional, rather than a global level, other mechanisms of redistribution and influence have shifted to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations, facilitated by the economic and political rise of the BRICS, which is documented in the latest United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1468018113491330">11</xref></sup> This, in turn, is changing the nature of the debate about Northern-driven aid. The China Development Bank, for example, is now the world’s largest institute for overseas loans and is playing a leading role promoting Beijing’s economic interests abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1468018113491330">12</xref></sup> In a potentially historic challenge to Western-dominated financial institutions, the five BRICS countries have agreed in principle to create a development bank worth $4.5 trillion (£3 trillion) to provide initial funding for infrastructure projects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1468018113491330">13</xref></sup> The key phrase at the meeting, from which Western politicians were conspicuously absent, was ‘new paradigm’. This raises the important question of how developing countries are managing the new aid landscape, where they have choices between donors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1468018113491330">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inequality remains an important issue in the intensified debates about the post-2015 development agenda. Kevin Watkins, the UK Overseas Development Institute’s (ODI’s) recently appointed executive director, made the case for ‘putting inequality at the heart of the agenda’ because it violates basic human rights, and ‘will act as a break on progress towards vital post-MDG goals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1468018113491330">15</xref></sup> Joseph Stiglitz’s discussion of the causes and consequences of growing inequality can be viewed in a webcast and live blog from the World Bank.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1468018113491330">16</xref></sup> Similarly, at a Global Consultation Process Meeting, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said ‘[a]ddressing inequalities is not a choice – it’s a moral and practical necessity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1468018113491330">17</xref></sup> A more ‘quantitative’ approach to inequality can be found in the World Bank’s recent report, ‘Inequality of Opportunity, Income Inequality and Economic Mobility: Some International Comparisons’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1468018113491330">18</xref></sup> The official communiqué from the High-Level Panel’s meeting in Moravia in February 2013, however, did not make inequality a main focus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1468018113491330">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UN System Task Team’s second report examines the possible features for the global partnership for development (the flawed Goal 8 of the MDGs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1468018113491330">20</xref></sup> The ODI’s Development Progress programme offers a valuable opinion on the post-2015 in a recent post, ‘Show me the money: Development finance in the post-2015 era’, which confronts the increasingly uncertain question of where the money will come from to pay for the post-2015 agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1468018113491330">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468018113491330">
<title>Regulation</title>
<p>On the issue of private sector engagement in the post-2015 development agenda, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development submitted a Joint Report to the High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1468018113491330">22</xref></sup> It claims ‘a genuine shift in the minds of many business leaders … [who] have come to understand that there are both commercial and ethical imperatives in relation to the global sustainable development agenda’. These are said to include natural resource constraints and environmental degradation, sustainable economic growth, human rights and human welfare, governance and morality and ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1468018113491330">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>A more radical contribution to the debate about regulating the global economy to limit carbon emissions and resultant climate change damage came from the World Social Forum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1468018113491330">24</xref></sup> The OECD study ‘Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’, commissioned by the G20, shows that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… some multinationals use strategies that allow them to pay as little as 5% in corporate taxes when smaller businesses are paying up to 30% … [and] some small jurisdictions act as conduits, receiving disproportionately large amounts of foreign direct investment compared to large industrialised countries and investing disproportionately large amounts in major developed and emerging economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1468018113491330">25</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A related publication, ‘Aggressive Tax Planning Based on After-Tax Hedging’, demonstrates the value of international tax cooperation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1468018113491330">26</xref></sup> ‘Tax Us if You Can’ (second edition) issued by the UK-based Tax Justice Network shows how $32 trillion are stored away from tax inspectors in tax havens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1468018113491330">27</xref></sup> Finally, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released its first report from a 15-month investigation that cracks open the historically impenetrable world of offshore tax havens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1468018113491330">28</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-1468018113491330">
<title>Rights</title>
<p>Discussions of the post-2015 development agenda have also become central in the area of global social rights. Placing human rights, equality and non-discrimination at the centre of discussions has been stressed by the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, which argues that the MDGs have remained silent on inequality (see Redistribution section) and that there should be a ‘stand-alone goal on equality in order to foster more inclusive forms of development’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1468018113491330">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>This year’s International Women’s Day (8 March) focused on the theme of ‘A Promise is a Promise: Time for Action to End Violence against Women!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1468018113491330">30</xref></sup> Adding further consideration to these issues was an UNICEF panel that discussed the importance of early intervention and quality education to end violence against girls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1468018113491330">31</xref></sup> Focusing on the topic of discrimination against women was the 54th Session of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.</p>
<p>Empowerment of people was at the core when the Commission for Social Development convened its 51st session, where Larysa Belskaya, vice-chair of the Commission’s bureau, said that:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>…</italic> empowering individuals and social groups requires a comprehensive set of policies and institutions. From education and health care to economic and social policy, activities that seek to empower people are expected to increase opportunities and improve people’s quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1468018113491330">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Commission’s current priority theme is the ‘empowerment of people in achieving poverty eradication, social integration and full employment and decent work for all’. To this end, Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stressed that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The right to work is a fundamental human right that is inseparable from human dignity. Not only does it provide individuals with the means to make a living and support their families; insofar as work is freely chosen or accepted, it contributes to their development and recognition within their communities. Work carries no less meaning to persons with disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1468018113491330">33</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The rights of persons with disabilities were also dealt with extensively in the 22nd session of the Human Rights Council (HRC).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1468018113491330">34</xref></sup> The fifth annual interactive debate on the rights of persons with disabilities (6 March) focused on the work and employment and the HRC adopted a resolution on the work and employment of persons with disabilities, which calls upon state parties to adopt and implement appropriate measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy the right to work on an equal basis with others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1468018113491330">35</xref></sup> The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has commissioned a ‘study on the situation of indigenous persons with disabilities, with a particular focus on challenges faced with respect to the full enjoyment of human rights and inclusion in development’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1468018113491330">36</xref></sup> In a recent report, the Bretton Woods Project has also highlighted the World Bank’s commitment to incorporate human rights (including those of indigenous people) in all of its activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1468018113491330">37</xref></sup></p>

<title>Global social governance</title>
<p>The meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors concluded with a communiqué that, amongst other things, reaffirms the important role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in fighting the crisis in countries and urges its governance reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1468018113491330">38</xref></sup> It welcomes the OECD report on tax base erosion and profit shifting. The role of the IMF continues to be contested, however. Thus Jesse Griffith from the European Network on Debt and Development (eurodad) asks if the IFIs will give the right advice as the G20 starts to work on long-term investment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1468018113491330">39</xref></sup> The Center for Economic and Social Rights discusses ‘King, Keynes and Obama’s legacy at the IMF’, while Bloomberg expresses doubts about the IMF’s austerity prescriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1468018113491330">40</xref></sup> The OECD’s latest ‘Going for Growth’, however, still talks about necessity of structural reform commitments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1468018113491330">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Isabel Ortiz provides an alternative view on the austerity crisis (and one which reflects the impact on many non-OECD countries) in a report entitled ‘The Age of Austerity – A Review of Public Expenditures and Adjustment Measures in 181 Countries’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1468018113491330">42</xref></sup> ‘Southern Voices in the Post-2015 Development Debate’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1468018113491330">43</xref></sup> is also worth reading.</p>
<p>In the long term, the outcome of a new UN working group convened to provide inputs on a renewed global partnership for development in the post-2015 development agenda represents a potentially promising development. Their report argues the need for strengthened global governance:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>…</italic> global public goods are under-provisioned. Overcoming the collective action problems in the supply of public goods will require internationally coordinated actions in order to ensure adequate provisioning. Striking the right balance between global rules that are both effective but also fair will be a key factor in a successful global partnership for development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1468018113491330">44</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The several think pieces penned by UN agencies that inform the report are also of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1468018113491330">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The G20 Development Working Group Meeting was held in February in preparation for the 2013 St Petersburg Summit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1468018113491330">46</xref></sup> The Russian Sherpa admitted that the G20 objective to achieve steady and balanced growth globally cannot be reached without assisting developing and least-developed countries in strengthening their own capacities for growth and establishing solid foundation to make such growth sustainable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1468018113491330">47</xref></sup></p>

<title>Health</title>
<p>Despite quite important international developments detailed above, global health debates appear relatively muted in the beginning of the year. As usual, the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) executive board convened in January.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1468018113491330">50</xref></sup> At the meeting, the Director-General’s report to the executive board referred to numerous health policies, including the post-2015 development agenda, austerity measures, climate change and child health. Yet, if there is a primary focus, then it is on medical issues, particularly polio. It is more difficult to find where health systems, health system financing and universal health care are being considered – a report on ‘Universal Health Coverage’ amongst others explains that
<disp-quote>
<p>Moving towards universal coverage is a process that needs progress on several fronts: the range of services that are available to people (consisting of medicines, medical products, health workers, infrastructure and information required to ensure good quality); the proportion of the costs of those services that are covered; and the proportion of the population that is covered. These gains need to be protected during financial or economic downturns. Universal health coverage is not about achieving a fixed minimum package.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1468018113491330">51</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The WHO co-organized a Ministerial Meeting on universal health coverage with the World Bank.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1468018113491330">52</xref></sup> In her opening speech, WHO Secretary-General Margaret Chan noted that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The recent enthusiasm for universal coverage occurs in a world in which social inequalities, in income levels, in opportunities, and in access to health care, are at the greatest levels seen in at least half a century. At a time when policies in so many sectors are actually increasing social inequalities, I would be delighted to see health lead the world towards greater fairness in ways that matter to each and every person on this planet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1468018113491330">53</xref></sup></p>

<title>Social protection</title>
<p>The New York Office of the International Labour Organization (ILO) convened the third meeting of the new Social Protection Inter-Agency Cooperation Board (SPIAC-B) in conjunction with the Annual UN Social Development Commission meeting. Its agenda included inserting social protection in the UN post-2015 agenda and collaboration between the World Bank and UN and bilateral agencies on social protection statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1468018113491330">54</xref></sup> Among the papers tabled was one by Magdalena Sepulveda (Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights) and Olivier de Schutter (Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food) on ‘the need to include a rights-based approach to Social Protection in the Post-2015 Development Agenda’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1468018113491330">55</xref></sup> In addition to calling for social protection to be included in the ‘new MDGs’, it referred to their earlier argument in favour of a global fund for social protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1468018113491330">56</xref></sup> No discussion took place around getting the SPIAC-B to line up behind this proposal, and no steps were taken to bring it into existence. It seems that the concept of a global fund that could grant funds to poor countries might now be played down, in part because the concept clashes with the interests of the World Bank, which jointly chairs the SPIAC-B board, in lending money for building social protection systems.</p>
<p>The invitation for the meetings of the SPIAC-B are extended to a large number of (mainly Northern) OECD member ‘donor’ countries, several international organizations and some INGOs including HelpAge International, Save the Children, the International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) and Solidar. Interestingly, Michael Cichon, now president of the ICSW, who resigned from the ILO in December 2012, did not present the ICSW position at the February SPIAC-B meeting. Instead, he posted it via the ICSW Cooperation Newsletter where he argued that it is now the turn of trade unions and civil society to advance the social protection floor concept:
<disp-quote>
<p>Political will on the national level can also not be created by international organisations, which are ultimately owned by national governments. These organizations have carried the ball as far as they could. … The global consensus on the Social Protection Floor provides moral guidance and legitimacy, as well as a political shield for national demands. The global community of nations has decided that everyone should enjoy a minimum of social protection and that societies should gradually build higher levels of social security on the basis of strong principles. And it has decided so unanimously. There is nothing that should stop national pressure groups from reminding national governments of that consensus whenever necessary and demanding the establishment or safeguarding of social protection floors at the national level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1468018113491330">57</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, immediately after Michael Cichon had given up the reigns of social protection at the ILO and Isabel Ortiz had done the same with Economic and Social Policy at UNICEF, the World Bank’s social protection division and UNICEF’s policy division convened a joint web meeting to agree on a common strategy on building social protection systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1468018113491330">58</xref></sup> Although mention is made of the social protection floor (SPF), it is somewhat disturbing (from the point of view of those wanting to focus on and role out SPFs) that the two organizations will work together with a new methodology. The new methodology, called SPARC (Social Protection Assessment of Results and Country Systems), seems to ignore the already-existing ILO rapid assessment protocol for helping countries work out the cost of the gaps in their SPFs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1468018113491330">59</xref></sup> Despite the creation of SPIAC-B, (earlier) tensions, jockeying and positioning still seem to be the name of the global social protection game.</p>

<title>Education</title>
<p>Education is key to any plans for the post-2015 development agenda, as discussed, for example, at the ‘Thematic Consultation on Education in the Post-2015 Development Agenda’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1468018113491330">60</xref></sup> The final document proposes an umbrella education goal for the post-2015 development agenda entitled ‘equitable, quality, lifelong education and learning for all’.

<p>There were also voices making the case for food to be at the core of the development agenda.

<p>On International Women’s Day (8 March, see Rights section), the FAO and other international organizations highlighted the links between women, violence and food security.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1468018113491330">68</xref></sup> Similarly, UN Special Rapporteur Olivier De Schutters said that ‘[s]haring power with women is a shortcut in reducing hunger and malnutrition, and is the single most effective step to realizing the right to food’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1468018113491330">69</xref></sup></p>

<p>Access to water has increasingly become highlighted and the celebrations on World Water Day (22 March) focused on the theme of water cooperation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1468018113491330">70</xref></sup> which highlighted the adverse impact of the allocation of water through market mechanisms on the most marginalized and vulnerable. The UN called on countries to ensure that access to water and sanitation is included in the post-2015 development agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1468018113491330">71</xref></sup> Further, UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson called for urgent action to end the crisis of 2.5 billion people who live without basic sanitation, and to change the fact that more people have mobile phones than toilets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1468018113491330">72</xref></sup> In the interactive dialogue convened by the Human Rights Council, with experts on the Human Rights and the Environment and Foreign Debt, a clean and healthy environment was identified as important to furthering the human rights of individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1468018113491330">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the World Bank is undergoing a two-year consultative process to review and update its environmental and social safeguard policies, an independent UN expert has called on the Bank to increase protection and promotion on the right to adequate housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1468018113491330">74</xref></sup> Though environmentally safe housing with appropriate sanitation is necessary, security of tenure to housing is also needed, as the Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing pointed out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1468018113491330">75</xref></sup></p>
