<abstract>
<p>Modelling and analysis of an electromagnetic generator designed for harvesting power produced during walking is presented. The generator is designed to be unobtrusive to the user by embedding it within the thickness of a normal shoe sole, and by applying a passive generation principle which requires minimal additional force over that normally exerted by the user during walking. In this way, a portion of the power used in walking is harvested for potential use in powering portable electronic devices. Analysis of different geometrical and material properties is applied to identify conditions for optimized designs; average power levels of up to 14 mW (200 mW of instantaneous power) are demonstrated within a volume of 15 × 15 × 100 mm<sup>3</sup> at a walking speed of 2 steps per second. At least two of these volumes can be easily accommodated within a shoe heel to provide up to a 56 mW average power per user, and higher power levels can be achieved for faster walking or running speeds.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>With the increasing use of portable electronic devices for communication, entertainment, sports, and healthcare applications, issues relating to powering of low-power devices have become more significant. Ultimately, these translate to a limited battery life-time and the associated inconvenience of needing to remove and wait for batteries to recharge. Energy-harvesting solutions have been developed to address these issues, where a range of different operating principles have been applied to convert kinetic energy into useful levels of electrical energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959651811411406">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959651811411406">2</xref>]. The design of wearable power generators for generating electrical energy during walking is investigated in this work, where the energy may be supplied directly to portable devices or it may supplement the energy provided by a battery, thereby extending its life. As a first step, optimization of generator structures in terms of the maximum level of AC power output is investigated in this paper.</p>
<p>A range of generator structures has been investigated previously for integration into various personal accessories; e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959651811411406">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651811411406">5</xref>]. However, previous analyses showed that the maximum potential for harvesting of energy around the body occurs in the feet during walking or running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959651811411406">6</xref>], and therefore this work focuses on the design of generators integrated into shoes. Other shoe-integrated generator structures proposed in the literature include those based on pneumatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959651811411406">7</xref>], and piezoelectric and electromagnetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959651811411406">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959651811411406">10</xref>] principles of operation. While relatively high power levels have been reported for electromagnetic generators, their operation involves significant interference with the user’s normal gait. There are also issues with the reliability of the mechanical components used in these systems. In a bid to address these limitations, the possibility of redefining an electromagnetic generator structure specifically for integration into shoes has been proposed, so that power can be harvested passively from users without impacting on their gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959651811411406">11</xref>]. Using the proposed structure, the user does not need to apply any significant additional force over that normally applied during walking. Furthermore, the generator does not involve complicated mechanical components and therefore reliability issues are addressed. Power levels are lower than those produced with more complicated electromechanical structures but they remain comparable with those produced by shoe-integrated piezoelectric generators. The principle of operation of such a structure is reviewed in section 2, along with the mechanical and electromagnetic models used to predict its performance.</p>
<p>Research in electromagnetic energy harvesting is very active with many authors developing new methods for producing miniaturized structures with improved electro-mechanical coupling; e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959651811411406">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959651811411406">12</xref>] and others investigating methods for increasing the operating frequency range of resonant-type structures; e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959651811411406">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959651811411406">14</xref>]. A comprehensive review paper on micro-scale magnetic generators that discusses the issue of scale reduction and the need for developments in magnetic materials and power conversion solutions, in addition to comparing the performance of an extensive range of generator structures has been presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959651811411406">15</xref>]. However, while some efforts have been made at optimizing the electromagnetic interactions, these are limited in detail. Owing to the passive nature of energy conversion in the proposed structure, generated power levels are relatively low and therefore the generator needs to be optimized in terms of the maximum possible power that can be harvested. For this purpose, analysis of a wide range of generator parameters is provided in section 3, where the effects of several geometrical and material properties are illustrated for normalized generator dimensions. A similar analysis can be applied to generator structures based on the same principle for use in other power-harvesting environments, where larger structures and therefore higher power levels may be generated. Optimization of the generator for integration within a shoe is investigated in section 4 and supporting measurement results are presented in section 5. It is shown that average AC power levels of up to 28 mW per shoe may be achieved during walking, with corresponding instantaneous power levels of up to 400 mW. These levels are competitive with those achieved with shoe-integrated piezoelectric generators, and would be sufficient for some sensor applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959651811411406">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959651811411406">10</xref>]; higher levels can be achieved at faster walking speeds. When compared with typical levels of power generated during walking; e.g. 2–4.5 W/kg at the ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959651811411406">16</xref>], over 400 W in foot transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959651811411406">17</xref>], it is clear that the energy level produced is a smaller percentage of the user input energy and therefore the corresponding impact on the user’s gait is expected to be minimal. In terms of applications, work is continuing to determine the most efficient AC/DC power conversion scheme for the generators in powering portable devices.</p>

<title>2 Shoe-Integrated Generator Modelling and Design</title>
<p>Various shoe-integrated electromagnetic generator structures have been investigated previously by the current authors, and it was found that a higher power is predicted for a magnet sliding through a coil located horizontally in the shoe than with a series of opposing magnets being pushed through vertical coils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959651811411406">11</xref>]. While the latter approach is more active in that the user needs to apply a force against opposing magnets, it is found that the scope for magnet movement in the shoe is limited if the normal gait of the user is to be maintained. The basic structure of the alternative inertial sliding-magnet generator is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959651811411406">Fig. 1(a)</xref>; it consists of a disk magnet that is free to slide up and down through a cylindrical coil, similar to those described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651811411406">5</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959651811411406">18</xref>]; i.e. there are no springs or other fixtures used to connect between the magnet and the coil or former. In this case, when the coil is fixed horizontally in the shoe sole as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959651811411406">Fig. 1(b)</xref>, the pendulum motion of the foot during walking maintains bidirectional movement of the magnet through the coil. It should be noted that so long as the magnet mass <italic>m</italic> is much lower than the mass of the foot <italic>M</italic> continuous movement of the magnet is sustained by forces exerted normally by the foot during walking, and there is no significant or deliberate effort needed from the user as in the case of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959651811411406">18</xref>]. The application of springs to form a resonant structure as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651811411406">5</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959651811411406">12</xref>] was not considered, because the structure is intended to harvest power for a range of walking speeds, which will vary from time to time and from person to person.</p>

<title>2.1 Mechanical analysis</title>
<p>Prediction of the exact force acting on the magnet versus time during walking is difficult because the force exerted by the user varies hugely with walking speed and style. Therefore, the results of measurement performed using an accelerometer attached to the outer heel of a shoe were used to predict the magnet motion. Similar measurements have previously been applied to compare the relative performance of various inertial generators located at different locations around the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959651811411406">19</xref>]. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref> are typical <italic>g</italic>-forces exerted for a walking rate of 1.5 steps per second. Positive components of horizontal and vertical acceleration are defined relative to the shoe as indicated. Note that since an accelerometer measures the force acting on a reference mass that is free to move within a package that is in turn fixed to the body under test, the forces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref> may be taken as the actuating forces applied to the magnet. In this case, measured forces include the combination of user-applied forces during walking and gravity; this is seen in results of the offset by 1<italic>g</italic> of the vertical force component during the stance phase.</p>

<p>Consider the forces applied at the start of a step before toe-off (TO) as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref> where it is assumed that the magnet is positioned towards the front of the heel. This is verified in photographs 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(b)</xref>, where the magnet can be seen at the position indicated (by the red arrow) inside a transparent plastic tube attached to the outer side of the shoe. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref>, it is seen that after an initial forward force associated with lifting the heel from the ground, there is a net backward horizontal force (with respect to the shoe) of between 1<italic>g</italic> and 2<italic>g</italic> measured as the foot is lifted against gravity after TO. For a coil with an unconnected magnet inside, the corresponding horizontal forces acting on the magnet are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(c)</xref>. These include the actuating force as measured by the accelerometer, –<italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub>, (the minus sign is due to the reference directions defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref>) and friction, <italic>F</italic><sub>fr1</sub>, which depends on the reaction force between the magnet and the coil former acting in the vertical direction (with respect to the shoe), and may be taken as minus the measured component of the vertical force, <italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub>, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref>. Initially, the magnet remains in contact with the shoe but as the foot is lifted after heel-off, –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> decreases thereby also causing reduced friction, <italic>F</italic><sub>fr1</sub>. Taking –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> at an average of 0.5 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> during this phase for a magnet mass of <italic>m<sub>m</sub></italic> and a coefficient of static friction, μ<sub>s</sub>, of 0.4 for metal–plastic, the frictional force, <italic>F</italic><sub>fr</sub>, is estimated by</p>

<p>using a value of 0.2 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> for the magnet mass, <italic>m</italic>. When compared with a backward actuating force of greater than 1 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic>, it is clear that the magnet will be propelled backwards relative to the coil. This is seen in photographs 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(b)</xref>. Magnet motion continues until it reaches the stop end of the coil former, with which it impacts. Estimated results of velocity are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref> where the net negative acceleration, –<italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> + 0.4<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub>, was integrated over time from the instant when –<italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> &gt; 0.4<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub>. The velocity was reset to zero once the magnet travelled 100 mm, indicating that the magnet was stopped due to impact with the stop end of the coil former.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, forward motion of the magnet can be explained by forces exerted during the swing phase of the foot forward, when the horizontal force, <italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub>, acting at the heel measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref> increases between 2<italic>g</italic> and 3<italic>g</italic> in the forward direction. In this case, the magnet is starting from the heel end of the shoe (see photographs 5 and 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(b)</xref>). The corresponding horizontal forces acting on the magnet are the same as previously described; i.e. <italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> as measured by the accelerometer and friction, <italic>F</italic><sub>fr2</sub>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(d)</xref>, with a reaction force –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> acting in the vertical direction. During this phase, it is seen that as <italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> first increases from zero, so too does –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> and estimation of the corresponding frictional force, <italic>F</italic><sub>fr2</sub>, indicates that it is large enough to prevent magnet motion. Using μ<sub>s</sub> = 0.4 as before, with –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> taken as 2 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic>, the maximum frictional force is estimated as 0.8 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> versus <italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> ∼ 1<italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic>. However, it is found that just before heel strike (HS), when <italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> is increasing towards a maximum, –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> and therefore <italic>F</italic><sub>fr2</sub> both decrease as the heel lifts forward before striking. Taking –<italic>F</italic><sub>vm</sub> = 0.5 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> and μ<sub>s</sub> = 0.4, <italic>F</italic><sub>fr2</sub> is again estimated as 0.2 <italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> acting against a <italic>F</italic><sub>hm</sub> of over 2<italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> and therefore the magnet slips forward through the coil towards the toe end of the shoe, where it is remains until after the TO phase of the next step. The estimated magnet velocity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651811411406">Fig. 2(a)</xref> is slightly higher during this phase due to higher actuating force, and this is confirmed by measurements in section 5.</p>
<p>In a generator structure with an attached load, once the magnet starts moving a current is induced in the coil, and an electromagnetic force, <italic>F</italic><sub>em</sub>, will act against the motion of the magnet. However, it is shown in section 2.2 that the magnitude of this force is of the order of 0.19 mN or 0.0032<italic>m<sub>m</sub>g</italic> which is much lower than the forces acting to produce magnet motion in either direction, and therefore it does not significantly impact on the magnet motion. Furthermore, it may be deduced that the associated electromagnetic reaction force imposed by the moving magnet on the user (through the coil) is negligible when compared with the user-applied forces of several <italic>g</italic> acting on the mass of the foot and shoe. Future work will investigate the effects on user gait by comparing accelerometer measurements with and without the generator attached.</p>

The results for the magnetic flux shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959651811411406">Fig. 4</xref> were predicted using finite element analysis (FEA) simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959651811411406">20</xref>] at a radius of 6.5 mm parallel to the axis of a Φ10 × 10 mm NdFeB disk magnet, with the magnetic flux gradient then being calculated numerically. If the coil is longer than the extent of the flux gradient, it is found that there is an increasing time period for which positive and negative components of dφ/d<italic>x</italic> act so as to produce voltage cancellation within the coil. For maximum power and voltage, it is required that this period should be minimized, as any additional coil length only contributes to increasing the coil resistance. Taking 10 per cent of the maximum flux gradient to define a cut-off value, it is found that the optimum coil length for the Φ10 × 10 mm magnet of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959651811411406">Fig. 4</xref> is 15 mm.</p>

In this way, the performance of different generator structures is compared independently of magnet speed, although it will be shown later that 1 m/s is quite accurate for the test structures considered. In all cases, the coil consists of 12 turns of 0.25 mm diameter copper wire per millimetre of coil length. It should be noted that the given structure was applied to confirm the voltage waveforms and power levels predicted, and it is optimized only in terms of coil length.</p>

<p>It is found that up to a certain value, the amplitude of the induced voltage increases with coil length as the magnetic flux linkage increases. For longer coils, the voltage amplitude remains constant, but the separation between positive and negative voltage pulses increases thereby indicating an increasing portion of time for when the net voltage induced is zero. Instantaneous power levels given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959651811411406">Fig. 5(b)</xref> are calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0959651811411406">equation (5)</xref> with <italic>R</italic><sub>L</sub> = <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>. It is shown that the largest power is predicted for the shortest coil, which is explained by the lowest coil resistance in this case. Similarly, coil resistance limits power produced by the longest coil, which has the lowest power levels. When averaged over the time taken for one step during walking (0.5 s for a rate of 2 steps per second), it is found that the 10 mm coil produces the highest average power of 1.46 mW, while in terms of combined peak-peak voltage and average power, the optimum coil length is found to be 15 mm.</p>
<p>In order to verify the assumption of a low electromagnetic damping force, results of the force exerted on a 15 mm coil length by a Φ10 × 10 mm NdFeB disk magnet as it moves through the coil are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959651811411406">Fig. 6</xref>. These results were calculated using FEA for a normalized ampere – turns product of 1 A in the coil. Taking a peak voltage of 0.65 V predicted for a 15 mm coil in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959651811411406">Fig. 4(a)</xref> with a coil resistance of 2.55 Ω for 180 turns of 0.25 mm diameter wire, a corresponding peak ampere – turns value of 49.5 Ampere-turns is found. This translates to a peak electromagnetic damping force of 0.19 mN or 0.032<italic>g</italic> for a 0.0059 kg magnet mass. Clearly, this is much lower than the actuating force acting on the magnet described in section 2.1. Furthermore, given the condition <italic>m</italic>&lt;&lt;<italic>M</italic>, it is clear that the electromagnetic force is much lower than the applied user forces and therefore the impact of electromagnetic generation would be expected to be minimal on the user’s gait.</p>

<p>If the length of space available to accommodate the generator is much longer than the optimum coil length, several coils of optimum length can be applied. In a bid to address the low voltage levels generated, previous work has investigated connecting successive coils in series opposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959651811411406">11</xref>]. However, the output power is limited by the series resistance of multiply connected coils in this case. It is found that, assuming the coils have separate and ideal rectifier circuits, a parallel coil connection provides the highest output power, as current only flows in a given coil when it has a voltage induced on it. Where relevant, this assumption will be made in the remainder of this paper.</p>

<p>The relative effects of all parameters of a sliding magnet generator designed to fit within the thickness of a shoe heel (∼20 mm) are investigated in this section. Normalized results of peak-peak voltage and average power per unit generator length are presented for the simplest case of one magnet and one coil. Results are then applied to define optimum magnet and coil combinations for a given generator length (100 mm in this case) in section 4.

<p>Obviously, a small portion of the generator area is taken up by a coil former, but this does not impact significantly on the result.

When compared with designs optimized for maximum power, this indicates that the reduction in voltage produced with a larger <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> is more than compensated for by the corresponding reduction in coil resistance. A higher voltage may be achieved by using a smaller wire diameter so that more turns can be fitted within the same space. For illustration, results of average power and peak-peak voltage are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959651811411406">Fig. 8</xref> for a Φ10 × 10 mm magnet sliding through a coil with diameter and length both equal to 15 mm.</p>

<p>Clearly, voltage levels increase dramatically with decreasing wire diameter as the number of turns that can be accommodated increases. At the same time, the variation in average power is much lower. This is explained by the fact that coil resistance is approximately proportional to the square of the coil turns, thereby offsetting the increase in voltage squared with turns. The slight decrease in power with decreasing wire diameter is explained by the reduction in percentage conductor area due to wire insulation.</p>

In order to illustrate this effect, results of power and voltage per unit length are presented as a function of magnet length in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0959651811411406">Fig. 9</xref> for the optimum magnet diameter in generator diameters of 15 and 20 mm. As shown, power per unit length increases with magnet length, however, due to a decreasing flux gradient the rate of increase levels off for longer magnets. This poses the question of whether it is better to use one long magnet instead of several shorter magnets in a given generator space, which is investigated in detail in section 4. For peak-peak voltage levels, it is interesting to see that the graph levels off when the magnet length equals half the generator diameter in both cases.</p>

<p>FEA results on the magnetic flux distribution were applied to predict voltage and power levels produced by the different generator designs as before. In all cases, coils were assumed to be connected in parallel to a matched load through ideal full-wave rectifier circuits, so that maximum power is provided.

<p>It is seen that a maximum average power of almost 8 mW is predicted for three coils connected in parallel, which is over twice that predicted for one large coil fitting the same space. Analysis of these results shows that maximum power designs are found simply for magnets whose product of power per coil length and total coil length that can be accommodated within the given space is at a maximum; i.e. the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959651811411406">Fig. 8</xref> can be applied directly along with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0959651811411406">equations (7)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-0959651811411406">(8)</xref> to predict maximum power designs. As expected, maximum power is achieved with a magnet diameter of 10 mm in this case.</p>
<p>Plots of peak-peak voltage show a decrease in voltage with increasing number of coils, which is expected as the length of individual coils reduces. Higher peak-peak voltage for smaller diameter magnets is explained by the combination of higher flux gradient and larger number of coil turns. As noted in section 3, voltage levels can be tuned for different applications by changing the coil wire size used.</p>

<title>4.2 Multiple magnets</title>
<p>Up to this point, all results are based on a single magnet travelling through the coil. The effect of adding several magnets within the generator length is investigated here, where the case of opposing magnet poles is considered. In order to prevent cancellation of voltages within a given coil, it is found that the minimum magnet separation should be 2<italic>l</italic><sub>c</sub> as illustrated for the case of a five-coil, two-magnet generator in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0959651811411406">Fig. 14</xref>.

<p>Voltage and power levels produced by the generator are predicted by applying <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0959651811411406">equations (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0959651811411406">(5)</xref> for each magnet and coil combination, and adding total contributions. Clearly, the overall number of voltage pulses produced increases with increasing number of magnets. For example, in the case of a five-coil two-magnet generator, there are two voltage pulses instead of the single pulse produced on the central coil, with 1½ pulses each on the second and fourth coils (for each excursion of the magnets in one direction). Open-circuit voltage waveforms for the first, second, and third coils are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0959651811411406">Fig. 15</xref> for illustration, where it is assumed that the magnet speed is the same as that applied for single magnets.</p>

<p>Clearly, additional voltage pulses contribute to increasing root-mean squared (RMS) voltage and power levels. For direct comparison with the case of a single magnet in section 4.1, the total average power levels predicted within a 100 mm length are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0959651811411406">Fig. 16</xref> for a differing number of magnets. As before, the generator coils are assumed to be connected to one load through individual full-wave rectifier circuits. As might be expected, a higher power is predicted for two magnets over one in all cases, where increasing the number of voltage pulses produce larger RMS voltages. Similarly, three magnets provide higher power than one magnet in all designs, but not necessarily higher than two magnets. This is explained by the reduced scope for magnet travel as the number of magnets increases. For the same reason, it is found during measurements in section 5 that the average magnet speed reduces and therefore overall, the best results are achieved with one magnet.</p>

<p>A photograph of the three and four-coil generators is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959651811411406">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. As shown, the generators were located under the insole of a shoe at the heel; the internal plastic was hollowed out to accommodate the generators and a layer of foam was applied before replacing the insole so as to minimize discomfort to the wearer. Two generator structures were tested at a time for an approximate walking speed of 2 steps/second. A portable oscilloscope was used to capture the voltage waveforms at the generator coil terminals for different loads. For each design, the generator was tested with coils connected in parallel to individual loads, and connected in series opposition to a single load. For illustration, load voltages measured on the central coils of the three and five-coil generators are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0959651811411406">Fig. 17</xref> for the case of one sliding magnet and matched load.</p>

<p>Two sets of pulses are shown within a 2 s time interval in both cases, confirming a walking speed of 2 steps/second. It is seen that the amplitude of the second half of each pulse is larger than the first, illustrating how the magnet speed increases as it travels through the coil. As might be expected, the voltage amplitudes and pulse duration are smallest for the shortest coil (smallest magnet), while the opposite is generally true for the longest coil. Given that measurements were performed for the same walking conditions as assumed in the calculations, the match with predicted voltages presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0959651811411406">Fig. 13(b)</xref> confirms the assumption of an average magnet speed of 1 m/s.

The total power for each generator was found by summing the power levels for each of its coils. Results are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0959651811411406">Fig. 18</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is seen that the highest power is measured for the three-coil generator, which corresponds to predictions. In this case, the power level is higher than predicted, and this is most likely explained by instantaneous magnet speeds of greater than 1 m/s. Maximum power is found around a load resistance of 10 Ω in all three cases, as this is the closest test value to the coil resistances (9.0, 8.0, and 7.0 Ω for the three-, four-, and five-coil generators, respectively). Voltage waveforms were applied to predict corresponding levels of instantaneous power; up to 200 mW was measured for each coil of the three-coil generator, whereas levels of 130 and 60 mW were more typical of coils in the four- and five-coil generators, respectively. It should be noted that for parts of the waveforms, instantaneous power levels are doubled in each generator due to simultaneous contributions from two successive coils.</p>
<p>Measured voltages for both cases of parallel and series opposition coil connections are compared for the three-coil generator in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0959651811411406">Fig. 19</xref>. Clearly, voltages on successive coils overlap somewhat for the parallel coils in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0959651811411406">Fig. 19(a)</xref>, and increasing magnet speed can be seen in terms of increasing voltage pulse amplitudes as the magnet progresses in each direction. As expected, voltage amplitudes are larger when the coils are connected in series opposition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0959651811411406">Fig. 19(b)</xref>, while the total number of pulses is smaller than for parallel coils. Corresponding average power levels were calculated for the different coil connections as before, and it was found that the maximum power achieved with the parallel coils is approximately twice that measured for the series opposition connection. As explained in section 2, this is caused by current flowing through coils when there is no voltage induced on them for part of the magnet travel time.</p>

<p>In the case of the four-coil generator, it is seen that average power levels measured with two magnets are lower than that achieved with one magnet when the coils are connected in parallel. This contradicts predictions which were based on an assumption of a constant magnet speed (of 1 m/s). However, due to the combined effects of reduced scope for magnet travel and increased moving mass, the speed the magnets in the two-magnet case is lower than that of a single magnet. This may be seen by comparing voltage waveforms for the five-coil generator in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0959651811411406">Figs 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0959651811411406">20</xref>, which have the same time period between pulses, but the distance travelled in the case of the two-magnet case is lower. The effect is less significant in the case of the five-coil generator, where the magnet size and separation are both smaller, so that power levels for one and two-magnet cases coincide.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that power levels for the series opposition connections are improved by the addition of a magnet in both cases. The improvement is attributed to the increased level of coincidence between voltage pulses on successive coils than produced with a single magnet, as may be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0959651811411406">Fig. 15</xref>. Notwithstanding this, overall it may be concluded that the highest power level is achieved with one magnet travelling through parallel coils, each of which is connected to a matched load. In this case, the optimum generator design according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0959651811411406">Fig. 18</xref> is the same as that predicted; i.e. a three-coil generator with a Φ10 × 10 mm magnet.</p>

<title>6 Conclusions and Future Work</title>
<p>The design of an electromagnetic generator for integration within the heel of a person’s shoe is described, along with a method for optimizing its structure to provide maximum output power. The generator harvests power passively from the user without the need for significant additional force over that normally applied during walking. Therefore, while power levels are low, there is potential to produce sufficient energy for many portable applications by generating power over relatively long time scales compared to power consumption periods, as required by wireless sensors for example.</p>
<p>Analysis of generator performance in terms of different geometric and material parameters is presented to illustrate the relative effects of different generator designs. Results are normalized so that they can be applied to design similar generators for a range of application environments and generator sizes. The main findings show that in order to achieve maximum output power, there is an optimum coil length for a given magnet size and an optimum magnet diameter for a given total generator diameter. Effects of wire size, magnet length, and magnet grade are also determined.</p>
<p>Results of parameter analysis are applied to design an optimized generator structure to fit within a given space defined by the heel of the shoe. Multiple coils, multiple magnets, and various coil connections are considered. It is shown through models and measurements that the highest power is achieved by using one magnet and several coils connected in parallel to a load that matches the coil resistance. The highest power level demonstrated in a 15 × 15 × 100 mm<sup>3</sup> space is an average of 14 mW and an instantaneous value of 200 mW for walking speeds. These levels compare favourably with the power produced by piezoelectric generators in the shoe heel, while the proposed structure is more amenable to integration in the shoe than other electromagnetic generators proposed.</p>
<p>Significantly higher output power will be achieved for faster walking speeds or running, where the combination of higher magnet speed and increased voltage pulses per second will contribute to increasing instantaneous and average power levels, respectively. Also, it should be noted that there is space to accommodate at least two generator units of size 15 × 15 × 100 mm<sup>3</sup> within the heel of a shoe, so that the total average power per person could be as high as 56 mW for walking speeds. Work is ongoing to investigate AC/DC conversion schemes for the generator voltages, so that the power can be applied to supply portable electronic devices or to charge reusable batteries. The scope for application of the generators is also being investigated, including such areas as sports monitoring and biomedical applications. Larger generator structures are also being considered for environments with larger potential forces and space.</p>
