<abstract>
<p>Recent interviews with congregational leaders in Thailand suggest a need for reframing some of the concerns commonly expressed in missiological writing on short-term missions (STM). North American writers have expressed concern about the ministerial inefficiency of short-term missions, the attendant de-professionalization of foreign missions, and the potential for STM to encourage dependency among recipients. Interviews with Thai pastors in 2007 revealed a different set of concerns. Many expressed an interest in resourcing for stronger congregational life, a concern that is usually missing from North American writing on short-term missions. Short-term missions were also valued most greatly by leaders whose congregations did not have alternative access to the material and relational resources made available by the visitors. Finally, in contrast to concerns that short-term missions promote dependency, the interviews suggest that many Thai leaders were using the relational networks to access moral and material resources that enhanced ministerial vitality and independence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growth of short-term international missions (STM) has become one of the most significant social developments of the new millennium. Starting with a trickle of participants in the 1960s, by 2005 the phenomenon had grown to include an estimated 1.6 million participants a year from North America alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091829612475169">Wuthnow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091829612475169">Wuthnow and Offutt, 2008</xref>). Significant additional flows were coming from places like Latin America (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091829612475169">Cerrón, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>), Southern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>), and East and Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091829612475169">Zehner, 2010</xref>: 80, 82; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091829612475169">Wuthnow and Offutt, 2008</xref>). There is now a rapidly growing sociological and missiological literature on the movement. At least 56 books, articles, doctoral dissertations, and journal issues have been published in English between 2000 and 2012, not including literature written for short-term participants or the popular press. Since at least four of these sources were multi-authored collections of articles, the actual number of contributions totaled nearly a hundred in just a dozen years.</p>
<p>Much of that literature is written from the perspective of the sending countries, usually North America. The works tend to display North American cultural values, and they often assess STM in terms of its contributions or impediments to the purposes of the sending churches and organizations. Consequently, even the most scholarly of this literature has tended to focus on questions of financial efficacy, spiritual and attitudinal formation among mission participants, de-professionalization of the global mission force, “dependency” among the recipients of short-term mission, relative effectiveness of the short-term missions in achieving their stated purposes, and the potential for damaging local ministries due to lack of cultural training and sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091829612475169">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Largely missing from the work to date has been attention to the attitudes and opinions of the recipients of short-term missions. While there exists a small amount of sub-literature critiquing STM’s effects on local populations (among the best of these are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091829612475169">Adeney, 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475169">Montgomery, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091829612475169">2007</xref>), and an equally small amount of literature on their uses by hosts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091829612475169">Priest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>), very little of the literature on STM has drawn directly on fieldwork or interviews intended to assess and report the actual attitudes of those who have hosted short-term missions (exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091829612475169">Baar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091829612475169">Livermore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091829612475169">Ngaruiya, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091829612475169">Priest, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091829612475169">Ver Beek, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091829612475169">2008</xref>; and portions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, almost nothing has been written about short-term missions in Asia, a region that has been sending and receiving increasing numbers of short-termers in recent years (partial exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091829612475169">Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091829612475169">Wan and Hartt, 2008</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091829612475169">Zehner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These are important omissions. As studies of tourism and other forms of international travel have shown, the hosts of international travel may work from a position of relative weakness vis-à-vis internationally networked tourism brokers and investors, yet they often have a greater influence on the types of activities and the types of travelers received into their communities than had initially been realized (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091829612475169">Stronza, 2001</xref>: 275–76). Given the especially intimate interactions between visitors and local communities that can happen in religiously motivated short-term volunteer travel, hosts’ preferences may have especially important effects on the character and distribution of short-term mission. For the moment, the type of international networking involved in short-term missions has been intensifying the spread of North American styles of Christianity both directly and through North American-supported proxies from the Global South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475169">Brouwer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091829612475169">Coleman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Priest et al., 2010</xref>: 100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091829612475169">Wuthnow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091829612475169">Wuthnow and Offutt, 2008</xref>). However, it is important to realize that these networks are continually renegotiated from all sides of the short-term missions transaction. For example, even as short-term missionaries and sending congregations seek places to “serve” (often for reasons that have as much to do with participant benefit as with altruism), the receiving congregations may be seeking access to resources that can help address their own needs as ministers and congregations.</p>
<p>The mixing of altruistic with non-altruistic motives is well attested both for secular service learning and volunteer tourism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091829612475169">Lyons and Wearing, 2008</xref>: 148), and for faith-based short-term missions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091829612475169">Howell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Priest et al., 2010</xref>: 100). In both cases the desire to serve can be interwoven with hopes for benefits to participants, missionaries, home congregation, or the educational goals of study abroad programs, including the ability to travel, acquisition of marketable skills, increased spiritual depth, or acquisition of cross-cultural competence. Priest et al. are particularly trenchant on this point:<disp-quote>
<p>While older models of mission involved more purely altruistic mission expenditures not designed to serve the sending church, STM as a paradigm of mission channels mission funding in ways that serve the interests of the North American sending church as well as (sometimes more than) the interests of those being served. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">2010</xref>: 100)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091829612475169">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other end of the transaction, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091829612475169">Englund (2001)</xref> has shown for parts of Malawi, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt (2011)</xref> appears to have found in both South Africa and parts of Latin America, and as has been observed in Thailand since at least as early as the late 1960s, pastors and evangelists in the Global South can often use their contacts with persons and groups in the Global North as ways to increase access to funds and personnel that could enhance their own ministries. As should be apparent, sender and recipient motivations for short-term missions are not necessarily at odds. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt (2011)</xref> points out that congregations from North and South have increasingly been collaborating in ways that enable congregations from less affluent societies to develop short-term missions of their own. In addition, as will be shown in the present article’s data from Thailand, there are times when the congruence of interests between senders and receivers may function to give recipient leaders greater ministerial independence and effectiveness, contrary to what has been suggested in some earlier literature.</p>
<p>Some of the negotiations and connections involved in short-term missions are done with the help of intermediary individuals and organizations who are rooted in both sending and receiving communities and who may have their own agendas even while assisting those of senders and hosts. These intermediaries are not normally as well funded or institutionalized as the tour guides and large-scale industries found in holiday tourism. Rather, the arrangements in what might be called the “short-term missions industry” (to the extent that the STM industry is “organized” at all) are usually more <italic>ad hoc</italic>, lower to the ground, more directly relational, and rarely profit-driven. Often the arrangements are so intentionally <italic>ad hoc</italic> and relationally driven that short-term travel becomes functionally similar to visits with friends or very distant relatives. Yet it is important not to overlook the presence of “brokers” in the form of conventional missionaries or mission agencies, short-term mission agencies, former missionaries who have retained ties to the field, and even well-connected local churches who help place visiting teams in other churches. In such cases the conventional distinction between “senders” and “receivers” of mission breaks down, as the same individuals or groups may play multiple roles simultaneously.</p>

<title>Researching Short-term Missions in Thailand—Basic Data</title>
<p>The above reflections are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in June–August 2007 in Thailand, a country where I had previously done anthropological field work on conversions to the Protestant Christian community (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0091829612475169">Zehner, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0091829612475169">2005</xref>). Aware that the voices of on-field hosts were missing from the emerging literature on short-term missions, I had planned that summer to converse with Thai church leaders about their experiences with short-term teams from abroad. I also interviewed some foreign missionaries and NGO leaders, partly at the suggestion of my local contacts, and partly because they were important recruiters, mentors, and local coordinators of short-term missions. I also conversed with some local church members. However, my primary focus was on the local leaders of churches and church groups. During my nine-and-a-half weeks in Thailand, there were contacts and interviews with more than 100 individuals associated with approximately 75 separate churches, denominations, missions, and NGOs. Most of the interviews happened in urban settings such as Bangkok or Chiangmai, though several interviewees had had rural pastoral experience or had taken short-term teams to rural areas. Interviewees were mostly leaders of Thai and Sino-Thai (i.e. Chinese-Thai) urban-based churches. This was so partly due to ease of access, and partly because they were the people I was being referred to by others. Interviews were in Thai or English, depending on the interviewees’ preference.</p>
<p>My field notes suggest that the roughly six dozen churches and organizations I encountered were collectively receiving some 3000 short-termers a year, with the numbers for each particular church or organization ranging from zero individuals to a reported high of several hundred. Though this figure includes some double-counting, it is also incomplete even for the urban areas I visited. Bangkok alone had nearly 400 Protestant churches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091829612475169">Visser, 2008</xref>: 191–93), of which I could visit only a handful. The field data also omit the many short-termers who pass directly to a rural site. Furthermore, the count likely omits short-term missions going to ethnic highland populations, who now comprise nearly half of Thailand’s Protestants. And although short-term missionaries from Asian countries like Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, and Singapore were often mentioned in the interviews, I suspect most of these short-termers went uncounted. Consequently, the figure of 3000–4000 derived from my notes could easily be doubled to at least 6000–8000 per year.</p>
<p>Although small compared to the numbers of short-termers going to Latin American countries, a figure of 6000–8000 short-termers may still seem oversized in the context of a national Protestant community that numbered just 325,000 members in slightly over 4000 congregations in the year 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091829612475169">Visser, 2008</xref>: 75–80). However, the volume of short-term missionaries was just a drop in the bucket compared to the 14.46 <italic>million</italic> international visitors that Thailand received in 2007 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091829612475169">Tourism Authority of Thailand, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the actual STM “footprint” within local churches was normally less than the raw numbers might suggest. Short-term missionaries normally travel in groups ranging from a low of perhaps 6 to as large as 20 or more per group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091829612475169">3</xref></sup> Consequently, there would have been no more than 600–800 visiting groups per year. And although some churches were apparently frequently visited, only in rare cases did a church report receiving more than two or three teams a year, and several reported receiving just one or none.</p>

<sec id="section3-0091829612475169">
<title>Activities of Short-term Missions in Thailand</title>
<p>The specific things done by short-term missionaries in Thailand overlap with the lists of activities reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt (2011</xref>: 801–803), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091829612475169">K. Priest (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091829612475169">R. Priest (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Priest et al. (2010</xref>: 99), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091829612475169">Villón (2007</xref>: 122, 125–31), though with some important local differences. Short-term missionaries in Thailand have taught English, built or cleaned latrines, rebuilt damaged houses, constructed playgrounds, led worship teams, distributed tracts, evangelized one-on-one (in English, Chinese, or via translators), painted church and orphanage walls, performed wordless dramas, “fished” prostitutes from go-go bars (only women need apply for this activity!), provided medical and dental services to the rural poor, and more. On the most basic level, these activities were meant to support evangelism, strengthen church life, enhance the local churches’ contacts with surrounding communities, and provide services and transnational connections that the local churches and organizations might not be able to provide for themselves.</p>
<p>Medical missions seemed less frequently performed in Thailand than elsewhere. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Robert Priest et al. (2010</xref>: 99) show that “medical/health care” ranks fourth (out of at least 13) among the tasks most frequently performed by short-term teams from U.S. megachurches. Material by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091829612475169">Robert Priest (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Stephen Offutt (2011</xref>: 802), and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475169">Montgomery, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091829612475169">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>: 802; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091829612475169">Priest, 2008</xref>) suggests short-term medical services have been in high demand in Latin America, South Africa, and elsewhere. By contrast, reports of short-term “medical missions” were relatively rare in Thailand, at least at the time I visited. This may be partly due to the Thai government’s move to implement a relatively inexpensive national health care system less than a decade earlier (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091829612475169">Pasuk and Baker, 2009</xref>: 92–94). It was also reportedly difficult for visiting doctors and dentists to bring in their own medical supplies. Nevertheless, some Thai pastors told me there were still health care shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091829612475169">Pasuk and Baker, 2009</xref>: 94 likewise report availability problems), and a couple of them asserted that import permits for medical supplies could sometimes be arranged with sufficient advance notice. Still, the most badly needed services were sometimes ones that short-termers cannot perform. For example, helping HIV-positive individuals maintain their medication regimes required long-term personal relationships and good Thai language skills, neither of which fit short-termers’ profiles.</p>
<p>By contrast, English teaching was in high demand. The U.S. megachurches surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Priest et al. (2010)</xref> listed English instruction as only the ninth most common activity (out of 13), but in Thailand (as is likely true throughout northeast and central Asia) English teaching was probably among the top three to five desired activities. Particularly in urban areas, English instruction (especially by Americans, but sometimes also by Southeast Asians) was used both as a direct doorway to evangelism and as a relational bridge to surrounding communities. For similar reasons, Korean short-termers were reportedly teaching tae kwon do, short-termers from Taiwan were reportedly teaching Mandarin, and the rising local popularity of Korean pop culture may have been creating interest in the Korean language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0091829612475169">
<title>Local Priorities: Evangelism, Social Action, and Support of Church Life</title>
<p>Another point emerging from the interviews is that the priorities of the sending and receiving churches only partly correspond. In a recent study by Priest et al., the ministerial priorities of U.S. megachurches were shown to cluster into just two primary groups: evangelism and social engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">2010</xref>: 100–101). I suggest that for many recipient churches in Thailand, there is a third cluster—strengthening the ongoing ministerial life of the recipient church. For many Thai recipients of STM this third cluster may be the most important of all. All three categories have important implications when applied to short-term missions in Thailand.</p>
<sec id="section5-0091829612475169">
<title>Evangelism</title>
<p>Given U.S. megachurches’ demonstrated ability to evangelize, develop leaders, and establish satellite congregations, it should not surprise that all three of their highest-rated priorities had to do with evangelization and church planting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Priest et al., 2010</xref>: 100). These concerns are shared by many Thai evangelical churches. However, neither evangelism nor church planting are things that a U.S. congregation can hope to effectuate overseas solely through its own short-term missions effort, due to language and cultural barriers and the difficulty of cultivating lasting personal relationships on the field (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091829612475169">Thornton, 2012</xref>). However, many of my Thai interviewees were thinking like Peruvian pastor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091829612475169">Joaquín Alegre Villón (2007)</xref>, who has written that short-termers can be useful evangelistic supports within a locally coordinated effort. Thus, although there were ample reports of short-termers distributing tracts or doing one-on-one evangelism with the help of translators, there were many more reports of local churches, missionaries, and Christian NGOs using the short-termers’ exotic “otherness” to attract audiences through language teaching, martial arts, drama and music, children’s programs, and even the building of houses and latrines. The visitors reportedly attracted audiences that might not otherwise have interacted with the local church. And although most of the interest disappeared after the visitors had left, repeated contacts over time could sometimes bring results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0091829612475169">
<title>Supporting Ministerial Vitality</title>
<p>A second emphasis that seemed important to Thai churches was strengthening of the local church’s life and ministry. This could include anything from the training and support of worship leadership teams, to the provision of Sunday school and cell group teaching materials (even if the local church would have to translate them into Thai), to cell group lesson sheets and leadership mentoring, to Christian-themed crafts or coloring books and training in children’s and youth ministries. Mentoring for successful children’s and youth ministries seemed in particularly high demand, albeit only if the assisting church had strong children’s ministries of its own. Training in worship leadership was also desired, though preferably under the covering of teams accompanied by pastors from the musicians’ own church (musicians traveling on their own reportedly responded less well to local churches’ leadership).</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that this concern for strengthening internal congregational dynamics is not unique to my data. For example, when Daniel Daesoon Kim, the OMF missionary who directs the Chiang Mai Theological Seminary, asked influential Thai Christian leaders what they saw as the greatest need of the Thai churches, their answer was not the expected concern for evangelizing more people (though this is certainly a priority for many). Instead, “the majority of the leaders vocalized apprehension concerning the Thai Church’s effectiveness in making active and mature disciples after evangelizing people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091829612475169">Kim, 2011</xref>). “Discipling” is an evangelical Protestant term referring to processes that others might call “spiritual formation” or “spiritual growth.” It is important to realize, however, that in the Thai context the discipling process is not just the cognitive one that is often assumed in American discourse. Rather, the process of building disciples (<italic>saang saawok</italic>) is also a process of bonding with the church community, transforming behaviors and attitudes, and deepening Christian commitments such as to make reversion less likely while making movement into leadership roles more likely. Consequently, whereas Americans often conceive of disciple-making as a one-on-one or group instructional activity, in many Thai Protestant churches it is also conceived as an interior personal development that is enhanced by healthy group processes. Consequently, I would argue that the desire for assistance with the interior life of the churches that I encountered in 2007 is an expression of the same concern for greater effectiveness in making disciples that Kim encountered in his own conversations with Thai leaders, because it is in the context of strong youth group, cell group, and worship service ministries that these bonding and character-building processes are so often perceived to be happening.</p>
<p>It is in the matter of help with congregational life that I heard pastors most frequently and fervently express disappointment with overseas counterparts who were perceived as failing to follow through on promises to provide long-term help and relationships, often because the overseas counterpart had moved its attentions elsewhere. It is perhaps revealing that this category of support for congregational life is also largely missing from the English-language literature on short-term missions, which has tended to focus instead on things like evangelistic outcomes, economic value of labor or material transfers to recipient communities, or social-spiritual-educational value to the mission participants themselves. The idea that the recipient church may desire tools for strengthening its internal ministry (and thereby its ability to evangelize and teach) is almost entirely missing from this literature.</p>
<p>I suspect such desires may indeed have been expressed in other locales, but they may have been “heard” in other terms. For example, Stephen Offutt writes that instead of evangelistic assistance, evangelical leaders in El Salvador and South Africa preferred “material and technical assistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">2011</xref>: 802) from STMs, a phrasing paralleling my own initial understanding of the Thailand data. Priest et al. write that most STM trips from U.S. mega-churches “involve collaboration with local Christians (and missionaries) in partnership projects designed to strengthen local churches and their witness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">2010</xref>: 99), a phrase paralleling my thesis here. However, when congregations were asked the annual number of short-term trips devoted to particular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">2010</xref>: 99), the categories most closely related to congregational life ranked relatively low. Of these, the category “VBS, children’s ministries” (averaging 1.38 trips per year per church) was third on the list of 13. But “music, worship” (.72 trips) was eighth and “education: other” (.55 trips) was tenth. Short-term missions doing “art, drama” (ranked twelfth) might also count as a form of skills transfer, although they are more often used as evangelistic support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0091829612475169">4</xref></sup> Generally missing from the list—whether due to the survey design or because it was not being done—was evidence of intentional planning for church-to-church mentoring, modeling, and encouragement of a type that would enable the local hosts to observe their overseas counterparts’ ministry models, adapt them to their own situations, and discuss the results with those counterparts. I do not mean to suggest that Thai churches lacked a desire for material and technical assistance, but even in these cases the underlying purpose was often to strengthen the local congregation’s ministry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0091829612475169">
<title>Social Action</title>
<p>The third impulse, social action, was also strong, both in STM and in some of my interviews with Thai church leaders. But such activities tended to be separate from the mainstream life of most of the Thai Protestant congregations. Partly this is due to the influence of North American evangelical styles of mission that until recently have prioritized evangelism over the “social Gospel,” and which even now tend to treat social action as but an aspect of Gospel outreach. Another reason may be general norms of social distance between givers and recipients of charity (a hierarchical divide that is reversed in the case of gifts to religious institutions). Yet another reason may be the limited personnel and financial resources of the churches. Thai-initiated Christian social action was hardly lacking, especially where external financial support could be found. For example, one pastor’s wife had started a sizable orphanage, and another pastor was helping up-country church members reduce expenses through sustainable horticulture. Yet another church had taken charge of a ministry to slum children. But most Thai churches tended to be focused primarily on congregational life and the needs of the congregation’s members.</p>
<p>To be fair, it should be noted that the kinds of social projects that Westerners have started or supported in Thailand (orphanages, crafts training, micro-credit associations, ministries to sex workers, efforts to end trafficking) are of a type that are rarely attempted by congregations even in the missionaries’ home countries, where such work tends to be professionalized and is therefore institutionally separate from congregational life. Though I often heard Western evangelicals in Thailand criticize the backwardness of the Thai churches on social action issues, I suspect that the volume and complexity of Thai Protestants’ contributions of time and finance, as a function of the number of members, at least equals that of American Protestants, especially when relative incomes and education levels are taken into account. What is remarkable, therefore, is not that participation rates are so low, nor that they are often reflective of prevailing social attitudes. Rather, it is that so many congregations have retained close ties to particular social action projects or initiated new efforts of their own, although they are often small projects that may not be well known externally.</p>
<p>By contrast, social action—the urge to “make a difference”—seemed to be a major theme in short-term missions, especially those from countries like the United States and Europe, and it seemed especially popular among college and university students and recent graduates. Several foreign NGOs based in Thailand were advertising short-term opportunities explicitly to this audience. The quarterly bulletin of one of these groups advertised a new ministry to male sex workers, a ministry to “poor and vulnerable […] women and children,” a slum children’s ministry, a project to help women in slums supplement their income by facilitating the making and marketing of hand-made greeting cards, a home for sexually exploited girls, a project for rural women’s economic development, and a child sponsorship program. Another group worked to help HIV-positive individuals obtain and stay on their medications. Several were trying to attract prostitutes into alternative occupations. Still others were working in poor neighborhoods and villages on projects ranging from micro-credit schemes to child sponsorship to provision of breeding stock for cattle.</p>
<p>In some of these projects, it could be difficult to define a useful role for short-term missionaries. Nevertheless, roles existed. For example, a Christian-oriented child sponsorship agency was actively encouraging sponsors to visit the children, not only as a way to encourage continued donations, but also to give the sponsor a “face” in the eyes of the child. Some of the work with women in the sex industry was reportedly most readily done by Western women. And in one case, a missionary family arranged for a short-term team to construct playground equipment at a local government school as a thank you for its willingness to educate the HIV-positive orphans for whom the family had begun to care. In other cases, it seemed that the primary purposes of the short-term visits was to help enhance the visited project’s local relationships while also solidifying its network of external supporters.</p>

<sec id="section8-0091829612475169">
<title>Perceived Benefits of the Missions</title>
<p>Reactions of Thai churches to the short-term missionaries were highly varied, but were generally positive, especially when speaking of teams directly working with local churches. Some churches claimed to receive no short-term missionaries at all, with one pastor terming them “more a burden than a blessing,” and some others implying that they could find no significant function for the visitors in their own church. Many others, however, seemed inclined to receive as many as they could get, though it was rare that a pastor reported receiving more than one to three teams a year.</p>
<p>This variation can be explained in part by reference to a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091829612475169">McGehee and Andereck (2009)</xref>, which is one of the few quantitative analyses of attitudes of the hosts of secular volunteer tourism. They found that in Tijuana, Mexico, a city where volunteer tourism is especially common, volunteer tourism was generally well received, contrary to the researchers’ expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091829612475169">5</xref></sup> The ratings of potential positive aspects of volunteer tourism were high on all aspects and for all of the population’s subgroups, and they were especially high for those who perceived direct benefit to themselves from the volunteer tourists’ work (a similar pattern can be seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091829612475169">Ver Beek, 2006</xref>, where the quotes from those who received help are often brimming with emotion). Statements of potential negative attitudes to volunteer tourism (such as the idea of local people being exploited or local cultures being under threat) were rated relatively low, regardless of personal benefit. However, the negative items were rated somewhat higher by those with relatively high levels of education.</p>
<p>These results translate very well into the Thai church setting, with the important proviso that the pastors and NGO leaders I interviewed normally emphasized benefits to their <italic>ministries</italic>, not their personal pocketbooks. Some of these benefits were material ones, such as assistance with construction or remodeling, and several leaders clearly hoped that the visits would provide access to additional resources from abroad. But in the urban areas I visited pastors more frequently voiced a desire for relatively intangible benefits such as more skilled worship teams, more effective children’s ministries, better understanding of how to implement cell group ministries or lay education programs, or better tools for evangelizing or improving relations with the church’s surrounding community. Some churches also seemed to welcome the short-termers’ visits as a break from routine. Additional intangibles included such things as encouraging the local Christians by showing that outsiders are taking interest in them, inspiring local church members to work harder at evangelism, providing an evangelistic bridge to local communities, adding a festive atmosphere to youth ministry, and enhancing the local church’s public image by “doing good works” in the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the strongest critics of short-term missions were relatively highly educated pastors and professionals whose churches or outreach organizations had already developed strong locally led ministries, or that had demonstrated the ability to attract and manage the services of foreign and local expatriates, and who therefore may have felt less of a need for short-term missionaries or the overseas partnerships they might represent. However, failure to deploy short-term missionaries in the home congregation did not necessarily mean opposition to short-term missions in general. One pastor who rarely used short-term teams in his own urban congregation was clearly interested in referring and supporting the work of short-term teams in less affluent provincial congregations. Another who said he never used short-termers in his home congregation was simultaneously running an organization that deployed hundreds of short-termers in campus ministries. And yet another who said he rarely received short-term teams was reported by others to have valued his church’s “sister” relationship with another Southeast Asian congregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0091829612475169">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0091829612475169">
<title>Dependency and Independence</title>
<p>Although only a few interviewees were explicit about it, there seemed among many an unspoken hope that the short-term visits might also provide bridges to financial support. I had the impression that many Thai leaders considered such hopes to be justified. The leader of a provincial church pointed out that her congregation was comprised primarily of students and poor families who would not have been able to pay for their recently constructed building without the foreign help that seemed to flow from webs of contacts that had been initiated during short-term visits and extended even more broadly after returns home. At least one mission coordinator was trying to discourage such donations, partly on the grounds that the short-term teams were not really going to the neediest churches (the latter were in less accessible locations). And it was hard to tell how much the recipient Thai churches may have been dependent on such donations. Equally ambiguous was the degree to which individual churches actually campaigned for funds, as the few times such donations were mentioned they were often presented as unexpected blessings from God or as the unlikely result of a string of serendipitous contacts.</p>
<p>It is on this topic that the local churches’ perspectives may differ most significantly from the mainstream of evangelical missiological literature on short-term missions, and I believe this difference is rooted in divergent perspectives on the overall purpose of STM. Many North Americans have expressed concern that short-term missions could lull the hosts of mission into a dependency that makes them unwilling to support their own work due to the assumption that additional assistance will be coming from abroad. However, there may be additional factors at work here. For example, several interviewees pointed out that construction projects may sometimes need to be scaled to the community’s resources, lest the materials and construction techniques be too expensive for the locals to maintain themselves. More importantly, by allowing greater access to external resources, the thickened international networking that accompanies short-term missions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475169">Offutt, 2011</xref>) may be enabling some Thai leaders to develop more vibrantly creative ministries even as they exhibit behaviors that some outside observers read as dependency. In these cases, the relationships through which short-term missions flow may function as ministerial enhancement, strengthening the local churches rather than weakening them, and providing greater resources to some of the congregations that might otherwise be marginal.</p>
<p>Given the degree to which Anglo-American evangelical leaders continue to express concerns about “dependency” and lack of “accountability” on the part of recipients of aid (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091829612475169">Elisha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475169">Priest et al., 2010</xref>: 101), I should briefly note a few important points: (1) although many churches in Bangkok have also received financial assistance from abroad (especially for their church buildings), the most outstanding stories of financial enabling through short-term connections came from provincial towns where average incomes are relatively low; (2) Thai urban churches already have a long tradition of establishing and helping to support daughter churches in less affluent areas (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091829612475169">Zehner, 2010</xref>), and if anything this pattern of independent organizational vitality has been accelerating in the age of short-term missions;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0091829612475169">7</xref></sup> (3) Thai pastors are aware that receipt of donations can make them beholden to the donors, and most leaders seem eager to avoid conditions that would compromise the independence of their ministries; (4) it is for this reason that informal donations from “friends” are often preferred over the traditional system of grants and loans from overseas denominations and missions; and finally, (5) it should be noted that nobody considers it inappropriate for foreign missions and missionaries in Thailand to advertise for funds from abroad, even though receipt of those funds gives the missions a continuingly outsized influence in the Thai churches. Consequently, while most Thai churches seem to be aiming for self-support, and while many have essentially achieved it, financial self-sufficiency is not necessarily the primary indicator of ministerial independence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Analysis of these interviews suggests that those Thai pastors who most valued STM contacts did so particularly for their potential to strengthen church ministry and internal church life. Thus it could be argued that in some situations the pastors were using STM visits, along with the accompanying relationships, as leverage to increase functional independence and strengthen congregational life.</p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest that there were no downsides to STM. Some pastors noted that the visits were too short to be concretely useful. There were sometimes issues of insubordination toward local church leadership. Poor advance communication often led to misunderstandings. Some teams did not seem to understand the rhythms and needs of normal church life. Many of the activities favored by the teams were a drain on the local church’s resources due to the need for translation and for help with local arrangements. More generally, there were issues of inefficient use of funds and personnel, as air fare is not cheap, and few short-termers speak Thai. In some cases there were also persisting cross-cultural status imbalances whereby those with the financial means to perform short-term missions assumed themselves (or perhaps their churches or sending organizations) to be culturally, organizationally, and perhaps spiritually superior to those receiving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0091829612475169">8</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is precisely through the exchanges of STM that a leveling of relations may be starting to happen. It remains true that power is primarily in the hands of those whose funds enable travel, yet in some of the stories I collected from Thai leaders I heard a metaphor of “friendship” between churches, and with individual pastors and team members, that seemed especially empowering to those who told the stories. The most welcomed of these friendships appeared to be multi-directional sets of relationships that were not limited to particular mission or congregational pairings. The very postmodern, multi-directional, and de-centered serendipity of these arrangements made them seem especially divine (due to the often unexpected ways they came into being), while also buffering local church leaders against the impacts of shifting ministerial priorities among their partners abroad.</p>

<p>The benefits for short-term participants are especially highlighted in Scott Meier’s “Missionary, minister to thyself: the real reason behind mission work” (2001). In a similar vein, an American pastor once told me that perhaps the primary benefit of his church’s short-term missions was to promote bonding among the church members who participate. And it is common for short-term missions promoters to advertise missions trips as “life-changing.” Parallel patterns can be found in secular volunteer tourism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475169">Guttentag, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091829612475169">Lyons and Wearing, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091829612475169">McGehee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091829612475169">Palacios, 2010</xref>, and sources cited therein).</p>

<p>The top two responses—“building, construction, repair” and “evangelism, church planting”—may have included some activities that recipients read as congregational support. But, at least in Thailand, these activities were often separate from congregational life, and could involve minimal contact with congregational members.</p>

<p>As these three examples indicate, the boundaries of the “short-term missions” concept are very hard to define, as I suspect that all three congregations would have had numerous visits by people who considered themselves “short-term missionaries,” or who functionally fit the role, even if they did not have any direct ministerial functions when visiting.</p>

<p>In recent years one of the fastest-growing segments of the Thai church has been the category of “independent” and “non-denominational” churches, which grew from negligible numbers in 1978 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091829612475169">Smith, 1982</xref>) to more than 66,000 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091829612475169">Visser, 2008</xref>: 80), by which time they comprised 20% of Thailand’s Protestants. In addition, several urban congregations within established denominations had developed independently managed <italic>phanthakit</italic> (evangelism, church-planting, missions) ministries to rural areas, including a significant number of cross-cultural ministries and at least several dozen new church plants across national borders.</p>
