</p>
<p>It’s always been difficult to take seriously the claims of His Excellency Keith Rupert Murdoch—Knight of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great, Companion of the Order of Australia, the son of Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch, Knight Bachelor, and Dame Elisabeth Joy Murdoch, Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Companion of the Order of Australia—to be an anti-establishment figure, an outsider. An alumnus of the exclusive Geelong Grammar School, whose annual fees today are reported to be around AU$30,000 (US$32,000) per year, and of Oxford University, where he has endowed a chair in language and communication, he inherited an already substantial media empire from his rich and influential father, using this handy capital base to accumulate yet more wealth and influence, plus such less tangible—although hardly maverick—honors as the privilege, apparently not yet exercised, to ride a horse inside St. Peter’s basilica in Rome. Despite his constant attempts over many decades to project the opposite, Rupert Murdoch has always had his nose pressed against the <italic>inside</italic> of the window, as he looked longingly at the world beyond, with its treats and blandishments to be conquered and taken.</p>
<p>Nobody believes more in the power of the news media than the press barons. This may in part be because they credit what fearful politicians say about them. Edmund Burke, in an era of theatrical parliamentary melodrama, is said to have pointed to the House of Commons Reporters’ Gallery “yonder” and declaimed that “the Fourth Estate” was “more important far” than the three customary parliamentary estates of commons, lords temporal, and lords spiritual. (In France, possibly more realistically, “<italic>le Quatrième État</italic>” was the title bestowed on the mob.) The British Conservative Party leader Stanley Baldwin once feverishly denounced the unregulated power of the British media moguls as akin to “the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages,” although the idea, inspired by Baldwin’s cousin Rudyard Kipling, seems rather hard on the legions of <italic>grandes horizontales</italic>, who generally don’t get to run anything at all. But overheated as these philippics may be, they are lapped up by the Hearsts, the Harmsworths, and the Hersants, the barons who love to think that across the world, the powerful bend their knees towards them.</p>
<p>And they’re not wrong. Indeed, so constant is the genuflection that one imagines Rupert Murdoch almost took it for granted. “When you work for Rupert Murdoch, you do not work for a company chairman or chief executive: you work for a Sun King” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411425511">Neil 2011</xref>). Andrew Neil, the former editor of Murdoch’s nontabloid <italic>The Sunday Times</italic> in London claimed that Murdoch was “brutal with his tabloid editors,” quoting one <italic>Sun</italic> executive who witnessed the boss’s blasts: “When you run the most successful tabloid in the world, it is not nice being regularly told you’re a f[uck]ing idiot by the owner.” And it is the tabloids that Murdoch most cares about. “If you want to know what Rupert Murdoch really thinks,” Neil recounted, “then read <italic>The Sun</italic> and the <italic>New York Post. . . . The Sun</italic> reflects what Rupert thinks on every major issue.” As refined by Murdoch over four decades, <italic>The Sun</italic>—together with its now-defunct dominical stable-mate <italic>The News of the World</italic>—became the epitome of what he wants from his newspapers:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It is so spot-on that it effectively revolutionizes the form itself—in modern Britain, the tabloids become the most powerful media, breaking stories, standing on the sidelines . . . it also gives him his extraordinary power base in the United Kingdom. <italic>The Sun</italic> becomes one of the key levers to push the transformation of Britain itself. It changes Murdoch too, giving him a sense of just how large his ambitions could be. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411425511">Wolff 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And in the service of that transformation, Murdoch’s editors knew to pay close attention to the Sun King. Listening to him introduce Tony Blair, the new leader of Britain’s Labour Party, in 1995, the assembled editors knew what they were there for: “Fascinating, but a bit chilling, to watch all these grown men, and some women, hanging on every word, and knowing that an inflection here or there would influence them one way or another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411425511">Campbell 2007</xref>). Famously, the mutual wooing of Murdoch and Blair, the latter desperate to break a run of four successive election wins by the rival Conservative Party, led <italic>The Sun</italic> to ditch the Tories in 1997 and back Labour. Blair, the son of a university lecturer who attended an exclusive private boarding school in Scotland, went on to Oxford University and then became a barrister in London, also regards himself as an outsider and appears to have responded to this apparent trait in Murdoch. Once leader of Labour, he “and his people . . . will regularly make pilgrimages to [Irwin] Seltzer [Murdoch’s London representative] to find out what Murdoch might be thinking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411425511">Wolff 2010</xref>). Blair reportedly spoke to Murdoch regularly, including in the run-up to the second Iraq war. The quid pro quo for Murdoch’s support, it was widely believed, was the Labour government’s soft-pedaling on anything that would negatively impact the great man’s media interests. But it went further, moving from an “opportunistic alliance to fast friendship—against which each, with evident humility, leavens his views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411425511">Wolff 2010</xref>).” In September 2011, it was reported that Blair—secretly—had stood as godfather to Murdoch’s daughter Grace, during a ceremony in Jordan at the very spot where Christ was said to have undergone baptism. Blair, the report said, had become “one of Murdoch’s closest friends” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476411425511">Sabbagh 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These various currents came together in July 2011 when Murdoch was called before a House of Commons committee to explain the persistent and widespread criminality of his journalists, most notably on <italic>The News of the World</italic>, in pursuing stories about murders, royals, and celebrities. Murdoch—the tyrannical editor-bollocker, whose stamp was imprinted on every syllable his tabloids published, the kingmaker who raised up and tore down political leaders, the media baron whose minions “yonder” in the press gallery constituted a veritable unelected branch of government—suddenly became the confused old man who’d left his glasses in the back of the car:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Allow me to say something? This is not an excuse. Maybe it is an explanation of my laxity. <italic>The News of the World</italic> is less than 1% of our company. I employ 53,000 people around the world who are proud and great and ethical and distinguished people—professionals in their line. Perhaps I am spread watching and appointing people whom I trust to run those divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411425511">Oral Evidence—Phone Hacking, July 19, 2011</xref>).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was about as convincing as Frank Pentangeli’s Senate testimony in <italic>The Godfather, Part Two</italic>: “I was in the olive oil business with his father a long time ago. That’s all.” And that’s the point—just as Mikey Corleone walked free from the investigation, it was hard amid the deep pleasure of <italic>schadenfreude</italic> to believe that the media–political nexus in Britain—or the USA, Australia, China, and anywhere else the Murdoch rule obtains—had really been fractured by the phone hacking embarrassment. <italic>The News of the World</italic> may be gone for now (although reports of revival under another name persist), but <italic>The Sun</italic>, Fox News, and the editorial pages of <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic> appear undimmed, as evidenced by the frank, fearless, and free response of the <italic>Journal</italic> to the Sun King’s temporary discomfiture:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>When News Corp. and CEO Rupert Murdoch secured enough shares to buy Dow Jones &amp; Co. four years ago, these columns welcomed our new owner and promised to stand by the same standards and principles we always had. That promise is worth repeating now that politicians and our competitors are using the phone hacking years ago at a British corner of News Corp. to assail the <italic>Journal</italic>, and perhaps injure press freedom in general. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411425511">News and Its Critics 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Yes, Frankie Five-Angels toils in the olive oil business. Criticism of the criminal activities of enterprises controlled by Murdoch is an attack on press freedom. Rupert and Tony are anti-establishment outsiders. And the putatively opposed worlds of media and politics, of police and the policed are uncannily merged, in an alien spectacle that in a disembodied sense we can enjoy with pleasure, because we do not feel that we are part of this looking glass world, even as it overtakes our own, “real” one. But of course it has. As Thomas Hardy observed of the imminent collision of the Titanic and the iceberg:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Alien they seemed to be:</p>
<p>No mortal eye could see</p>
<p>The intimate welding of their later history.</p></disp-quote>
