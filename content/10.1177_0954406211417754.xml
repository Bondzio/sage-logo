<abstract>
<p>Antikythera mechanism, dateable around to the first century BC, is the oldest known geared mechanism treated as an astronomical computer through the decoding of modern technology. In accordance with the decoded exterior dials and their functions, the interior mechanism was confirmed to consist of five corresponding subsystems. However, some unexplained problems still exist among these subsystems, such as the lunar subsystem, in which the visible pentagonal mark is positioned on the centre of a gear, demonstrating the lunar anomaly motion. From the viewpoint of mechanical design, this strange evidence implies the existence of a shaft with a complex structure, i.e. the coaxial gears with different rates. Also, it affects strongly the identifications of links and even the positions of gears. In order to provide other possible concepts to clarify this problem, this study synthesizes all feasible reconstruction designs through a systematic procedure. Through the study of historical literature, astronomical theories and existing designs, design constraints which are indispensible for the assignments of links and joints are concluded. Then, according to the concepts of generalization and specialization of mechanism, 13 feasible designs which are consistent with the theories and techniques of the subject’s time period, including the one by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> are synthesized. Once new discoveries about the unexplained problem appear in the future, these feasible designs can be the corresponding answer.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211417754"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In 1900, a storm accident resulted in an important archaeological finding. A party of Greek sponge divers was driven off course by gales and worked off the island of Antikythera, midway between the Peloponnese and Crete. They discovered unexpectedly an antique shipwreck at a depth of 42 m. This shipwreck contained, in addition to a great quantity of bronze and marble statues, a group of damaged wrecks that could be formed as one complicated and ingenious mechanism with some marvelous functions. This is the so-called Antikythera mechanism nowadays.</p>
<p>As the copious inscriptions on the exterior of corroded fragments are gradually decoded, the functions of Antikythera mechanism become more and more clear. This ancient mechanism can display the circular motion of the celestial bodies on the zodiac, including the sun, the moon, and the five planets. It can predict the appearances of solar and lunar eclipses. It can also display the variation of the phases of moon. With the understanding, it is said that the Antikythera mechanism is obviously an astronomical instrument with the functions like an astrolabe, a planetarium [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417754">1</xref></bold>], or a calendar calculator. Furthermore, the decoding of inscriptions also confirmed that the Antikythera mechanism, dateable to the first century BC, is by far the oldest existed geared mechanism in the world.</p>
<p>The first contact with the fragments of Antikythera mechanism was made by the archaeologist Valerios Stais in 1902. Since then researchers, including Albert Rehm and Theophanidis, successively studied this mechanism. Antikythera mechanism was defined an astronomical calculator around 1905. However, they were unable to present a coherent explanation due to the limitation of technology at that time. Until the application of image inspection in this century and the past one, a number of studies were presented successively [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417754">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211417754">21</xref></bold>]. Also, there are three major restorations of the Antikythera mechanism. The first reconstruction design, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417754">Fig. 1</xref>, was delivered by Price [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417754">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417754">3</xref></bold>] in the late 1950s to the early 1970s. The second one, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417754">Fig. 2</xref>, was delivered by Wright [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417754">4</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417754">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211417754">14</xref></bold>] and Wright and Bromley [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417754">5</xref></bold>] between 2002 and 2007. Based on the detection records from the cooperation with Bromley, he published a series of studies to correct the interior structure of Price’s design and presented new decipherments including the design of spiral back dials. The third design, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417754">Fig. 3</xref>, was delivered by Freeth [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417754">15</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211417754">16</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211417754">19</xref></bold>] and Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211417754">18</xref></bold>] between 2006 and 2008. Their research includes numerous decoding of inscriptions that describe the functions of dials on the exterior and a reasonable explanation for the connection of interior gears. In 2008, Koetsier [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211417754">20</xref></bold>] presented the historical development of reconstructing the Antikythera mechanism through the analysis of each previous design and Greek astronomy. In addition to the current academic investigations, the decoding of this sophisticated device also received media attention. In 2008, Marchant [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211417754">21</xref></bold>], a freelance journalist, introduced the full story of the quest for Antikythera mechanism through the interview with those who studied or investigated this device before. In short, the foregoing works show a continuous revolution for the reconstruction of Antikythera mechanism and provide an important basis for further investigation.

<p>Nevertheless, there are still some disagreements regarding unexplained and lost features of the interior mechanism, the lunar mechanism, for example. A visible regular pentagon in the centre of gear is still unexplained [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>]. From the viewpoint of mechanism, this unexplained feature would affect the identifications of links in the lunar mechanism. Also, the arrangement of axes in the design would relate to the manufacturing possibility in ancient time.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the unexplained feature, this study presents an approach for the reconstruction synthesis of the lunar subsystem in Antikythera mechanism. Through this approach, all feasible designs of the unexplained feature in the lunar subsystem that agree with the science and technology standards of the subject’s time period can be generated systematically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211417754"><title>2 HISTORICAL ARCHIVES AND DEVELOPMENT</title>
<p>For the appropriate restoration of the interior mechanism of the Antikythera mechanism, the first design step is to define the problems. This requires an investigation into the origin and applications of the device. In what follows, the surviving evidences and historical records are addressed.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211417754"><title>2.1 Investigation of object evidences</title>
<p>The most important data in the reconstruction of Antikythera mechanism are found in the surviving wreckages. Even if the excavated objects are incomplete and damaged, they still provide a powerful assistance in defining the fundamental design specifications and constraints for the reconstruction. From 1902 to date, a large number of photos have been gathered with the help of various kinds of image technology. They support the recombination of the fragments and the development of the model. It is obvious that Antikythera mechanism is composed of gears and links. Also, the applied mechanical components that meet the science and technology subject to the given time period is undoubted. However, there are still some unexplained questions pertaining to various parts, including the mechanism of the lunar subsystem. Although the planetary gear train with a pin-in-slot joint is evident, the problem for a visible regular pentagon in the centre of gear is still unexplained [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211417754"><title>2.2 Study of historical records</title>
<p>The purpose of studying historical records is to identify the origin of this ancient mechanism. By decoding of inscriptions, Antikythera mechanism is dated around 150–100 BC. The cultural pieces from the shipwreck and the position of shipwreck suggests that Antikythera mechanism is from the Island of Rhode, the centre with the most advanced astronomical development of that time and was designed by Hipparchus. These viewpoints were overturned until 2008. By decoding the month names of the calendar in this mechanism, Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> confirmed strongly that the mechanism’s calendar is identical to the Corinthian calendar coming from the calendar of Tauromenium in Sicily. It also explained that Antikythera mechanism should be from Corinthian colonies and a certain workshop adopted from <italic>Archimedes</italic> seemed to be likely the origin [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211417754">18</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>There are almost no direct historical records of the Antikythera mechanism in the extant literature dating to that period. The only related historical literature appears in Cicero’s writings, which contain descriptions of the astronomical apparatuses used by the Greek astronomer Posidonius, in Rhodes. Among which, similarities can be found between one device and Antikythera mechanism. However, it was merely the evidence that such technology could have arrived in that period, not the evidence for the existence of Antikythera mechanism in the period.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954406211417754"><title>3 ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DESIGNS</title>
<p>A reconstruction of Antikythera mechanism shows a bronze geared mechanism encased in a wooden box approximately 315 × 190 × 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, driven by hands, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417754">Fig. 4</xref>. The exterior has one large dial on the front plate and two dials on the back plate, and the design is covered with numerous inscriptions recording the ancient astronomical information and the calendar used in Greek. The interior consists of gear trains that drive the pointers of dials. The following is the analysis that describes both the exterior functions and the interior mechanism of this ancient astronomical device.
<fig id="fig4-0954406211417754" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>A reconstruction model of Antikythera mechanism [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211417754">19</xref></bold>]: (a) front plate; (b) back plate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417754-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<sec id="sec6-0954406211417754"><title>3.1 Functions of exterior dials</title>
<p>The front plate has one metal dial which includes two concentric annuluses, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417754">Fig. 4(a)</xref>. The inner scale is fixed and divided into 360 divisions in 30 groups. These groups are marked with names of the signs of the zodiac in Greek. There also exist some inscriptions referred as the Parapegma that shows the correspondence between the rising and setting of particular stars and the civil date. The outer scale is movable and divided into 365 parts corresponding to the Egyptian calendar which has 12 months of 30 days each and a group of five extra days at the end of the year. A comparison with the true length of the year requires correcting the effect of the extra quarter day by turning the scale forward one day every 4 years [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The front plate has pointers that display the positions of the sun and the moon in the zodiac with the corresponding calendar. There is a black and white ball that displays the change of the phases of moon during 1 month. This function is similar to the Byzantine sundial. It is further suggested that the front dial has some pointers that show the motion of various planets, such as Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, etc [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417754">4</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417754">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>On the back plate, there are two large spiral dials with one subsidiary dial on each, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417754">Fig. 4(b)</xref>. The large upper dial has five turns, and each one has 47 divisions, showing the 235 months of the 19-year Metonic cycle. This cycle indicates the approximate common multiple of tropical year and synodic month. The upper subsidiary dial is a calendar that follows the 4-year cycle of the Olympiad and other associated games in Greek [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211417754">18</xref></bold>]. It is further suggested that one more subsidiary dial follows the 76-year Callippic cycle. As far as the lower dials are concerned, the large spiral dial has four turns that are divided into 223 parts, showing the 223 months that constitute 18 years. The subsidiary dial shows the 54-year Exeligmos cycle. These two cycles are the predictions of solar and lunar eclipses. In summary, the exterior functions of the Antikythera mechanism can display the motion of the heavenly bodies. They also can record the important astronomical events and cultural activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211417754"><title>3.2 Characteristics of interior mechanism</title>
<p>From the viewpoint of kinematics, the interior mechanism of existing design by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> consists of five subsystems; each one has one function, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417754">Fig. 3</xref>. These subsystems are referred to as the date subsystem, calendrical subsystem, eclipse prediction subsystem, lunar subsystem, and lost subsystems to display the sun and planets. Except for the lost mechanism, previous research has confirmed the date subsystem and eclipse prediction subsystem as a planar three-bar mechanism with one degree of freedom and a planar five-bar mechanism with one degree of freedom, respectively [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417754">15</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211417754">19</xref></bold>]. However, for the lunar mechanism, one unexplained shape still exists. Also, this study focuses on the lunar subsystem to clarify the unexplained feature [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>It is confirmed that the lunar subsystem, a planetary gear train with a pin-in-slot joint, serves to simulate the cyclic motion of the moon in zodiac on the front dial, among which, a design such that a pin running through a slot allows the two joined mechanical components to revolute around each other and to translate with respect to each other in one direction is ingenious. Such a design is a special case of a cam joint. Through the analysis of the mechanism of the existing design, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417754">Fig. 5(a)</xref>, it is concluded that the lunar mechanism with variable transmission has the following topological characteristics:
<list id="list1-0954406211417754" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It has seven members consisting of a ground link (member 1, K<sub>F</sub>), a sidereal gear, (member 2, K<sub>I</sub>), a deferent gear (member 3, K<sub>E</sub>), an anomalistic gear (member 4, K<sub>A</sub>), an output gear (member 7, K<sub>O</sub>), and a pin-in-slot device (K<sub>PS</sub>) with a pin gear (member 5, K<sub>P</sub>) and a slot gear (member 6, K<sub>S</sub>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It has nine joints, including six revolute joints (joints a, b, c, e, g, and h; J<sub>R</sub>), three gear joints (joints d, f, and j; J<sub>G</sub>), and one cam joint, i.e. a pin-in-slot joint (joint i; J<sub>A</sub>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is a reverted gear train, i.e. the input and output members are coaxial.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The sidereal gear and the anomalistic gear are the two inputs and the output gear the output.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All gears are external gears.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It has two degrees of freedom.</p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig5-0954406211417754" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Mechanism of the lunar subsystem by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic>: (a) kinematic drawing; (b) generalized kinematic chain</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417754-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Hipparchus developed two equivalent lunar theories. The first theory indicated that the moon rotates at the rate of the sidereal month about an eccentric, which in turn rotates about the earth at the rate of the anomalistic month. The second theory indicated that the moon rotates on an epicycle at the rate of the anomalistic month relative to a deferent circle that rotates at the rate of the sidereal month [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211417754">22</xref></bold>]. Through kinematic analysis, this geometric model is able to introduce the motion of the moon with the rate of the sidereal month plus the harmonic variation of the anomalistic month. The variable angular speed curve for the lunar motion can then be modelled approximately by the planetary gear train with a pin-in-slot device [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>]. In order to change the period of variation from the sidereal month, which would occur when two gears incident to the pin-in-slot joint are on the fixed axes, for the anomalistic month, it is necessary to mount two gears incident to the pin-in-slot joint on the deferent gear.</p>
<p>The foregoing analyses can be summarized as follows. The lunar subsystem must have two inputs with different rates. One input should have the rotation rate of the sidereal month. The other input should carry the deferent gear to generate the rate difference between the anomalistic month and the sidereal month, i.e. the rate of the moon’s apogee. Through the pin-in-slot mechanism that provides the variation, the output demonstrates the lunar anomaly motion.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954406211417754"><title>4 DESIGN CONSTRAINTS</title>
<p>The design constraints are the fabrication statements of the purposed machines. They are helpful to derive the feasible designs from numerous mechanisms with different topological structures. In the process of reconstruction synthesis, the determinations of the design constraints for the identification of each link in the mechanism are based on the study of historical records and existing designs.</p>
<p>According to the time inference of the Antikythera mechanism, the lunar subsystem had the function of variable transmission to demonstrate the lunar motion by Hipparchus’s first lunar theory. The detections of surviving evidence indicated that the input with the rotation rate of the sidereal month and the output must be coaxial in the space arrangement, and the lunar subsystem was also confirmed as a planetary gear train. Indeed, either the applied lunar theory or the surviving evidence is the important basis that cannot be violated in the reconstruction design.</p>
<p>The numbers of the applied members and joints are the points of reconstruction design. As mentioned above, it is logically concluded by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> that the planetary gear train must at least include one ground link, sidereal gear, deferent gear, pin-in-slot device, anomalistic gear, and output gear. In order to appropriately fabricate these required members, the corresponding design constraints are stated further.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0954406211417754"><title>4.1 Ground link (member 1)</title>
<p>From the viewpoint of mechanism design, any machine must have a fixed link as the ground link to support the motions of members. Also, from the viewpoint of mechanism, the ground link must not be adjacent to any planet gear of a planetary gear train.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954406211417754"><title>4.2 Sidereal gear (member 2)</title>
<p>The sidereal gear is defined as one input link of the lunar subsystem. In accordance with the existing design, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417754">Fig. 3</xref>, one of the powers driving the lunar subsystem must be transmitted along axis E. Moreover, the sidereal gear must rotate with the rate of the sidereal month, in order to demonstrate Hipparchus’ lunar theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0954406211417754"><title>4.3 Deferent gear (member 3)</title>
<p>The deferent gear plays the role of the carrier of a planetary gear train. It must carry on all planet gears simultaneously, i.e. the deferent gear must be adjacent to the planet gears with revolute joints. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the rotation period of the deferent gear determines the period of the planet gears through the viewpoint of kinematics of mechanism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954406211417754"><title>4.4 Anomalistic gear (member 4)</title>
<p>As far as the lunar subsystem is concerned, another rotation rate is necessary to achieve the simulation of lunar anomaly motion, not including the confirmed rate of the sidereal month. The purpose of the anomalistic gear is to transmit the required power to the deferent gear to generate the variation period of the anomalistic month. Based on the existing design by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic>, it is logically supposed that the anomalistic gear rotates counterclockwise along axis M.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954406211417754"><title>4.5 Pin-in-slot device (members 5 and 6)</title>
<p>The pin-in-slot device, consisting of a pin gear (member 5), a slot gear (member 6), and a cam joint, is an important factor to generate the variable transmission. Hipparchus’ lunar theory clearly indicated that the period of the rate variation is the anomalistic month. Therefore, in order to satisfy the specified period, the pin-in-slot device must be carried on the deferent gear, i.e. the pin gear and the slot gear are the planet gears.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0954406211417754"><title>4.6 Output gear (member 7)</title>
<p>The output gear is responsible for the transmission of the resulting lunar motion. It must rotate along axis E based on the surviving evidence mentioned above.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0954406211417754"><title>4.7 Revolute joint (joints a, b, c, e, g, and h; J<sub>R</sub>)</title>
<p>Since each link is a gear except for the fixed ground link, it must have one revolute joint to generate rotation. For the gear train with seven members, there must be six revolute joints. Furthermore, it is considered that there can be no loop formed exclusively by revolute joints to result a motionless structure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0954406211417754"><title>4.8 Gear joint (joints d, f, and j; J<sub>G</sub>)</title>
<p>For a planetary gear train, each gear must have at least one gear joint to generate the transmission of power. Except for six revolute joints and one pin-in-slot joint, the remaining joints applied in the lunar subsystem are the gear joints. Moreover, there must be three gear joints.</p>
<p>In summary, the above design constraints are concluded based on Hipparchus’ lunar theory, the related historical records, and the existing designs. Also, they correspond to the reconstruction designs that agree with the decoding done nowadays. However, it should be understood that the determinations of design constraints are not absolutely rigid. They can be modified appropriately in accordance with the study background. Once new discoveries are decoded from the historical records and the surviving evidence in the future, the corresponding design constraints will be further concluded.</p>

<p>In order to synthesize all feasible topological structures of the lunar subsystem in the Antikythera mechanism, this study follows the design procedure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417754">Fig. 6</xref> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211417754">23</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211417754">26</xref></bold>].

<sec id="sec18-0954406211417754"><title>5.1 Design specifications</title>
<p>Design specifications include the number of members, the types of joints, and the categories of mechanical elements. Based on historical archives of the lunar subsystem, the corresponding design specifications can be developed. Furthermore, the mechanical elements and mechanisms with the available science and technology of the subject’s time period are concluded. The defined design specifications and the topological characteristics of the existing mechanisms further conclude the design constraints.</p>
<p>The topological structure of the existing designs and the geometry structure of the surviving object define the following design specifications:
<list id="list2-0954406211417754" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It is a planar seven-bar mechanism with ten joints and two degrees of freedom.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The types of mechanical components are simple gears and links.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The joints consist of revolute joints, cam joint (pin-in-slot joint), and external gear joints.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0954406211417754"><title>5.2 Generalized kinematic chains</title>
<p>The atlas of generalized kinematic chains is obtained based on the concepts of generalization and number synthesis. The purpose of generalization is to transform a mechanism involving various types of members and joints into a generalized kinematic chain with only generalized links and generalized joints. A generalized joint is a joint in general; it can be a revolute pair, a prismatic pair, a spherical pair, a helical pair, or others. A generalized link is a link with generalized joints; it can be a binary link, a ternary link, a quaternary link, etc. Graphically, a generalized joint is symbolized by a node. Also, a generalized link with <italic>N</italic><sub>J</sub> incident joints is symbolized by an <italic>N</italic><sub>J</sub>-sided, shaded polygon.</p>
<p>Any existing design of the lunar subsystem can be generalized into its corresponding generalized kinematic chain consisting of generalized links connected by generalized joints. Based on the algorithm of number synthesis, the atlas of generalized kinematic chains with the required numbers of members and joints can be synthesized. Therefore, by the concept of generalization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417754">Fig. 5(b)</xref> shows the corresponding generalized kinematic chain with seven links and ten joints of the existing design by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> Also, the number of the generalized kinematic chains with seven links and ten joints is 50 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211417754">24</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>It is indispensable to identify the feasible generalized kinematic chains. According to the analysis of the pin-in-slot device and the design constraints mentioned above, it is undoubted that feasible generalized kinematic chains must have one three-bar loop formed exclusively by multiple links. Also, there must be one binary link adjacent to the multiple link of the three-bar loop in accordance with the design constraints of the anomalistic gear. Furthermore, in order to satisfy the constraints of joint distributions, two ternary links of the three-bar loop must not be composed of other three-bar loops. Therefore, only 13 generalized kinematic chains with seven links and ten joints are feasible, subject to the conditions mentioned above, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417754">Fig. 7</xref>.

</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0954406211417754"><title>5.3 Specialized chains</title>
<p>Specialization is the process of assigning specific types of members and joints in the available atlas of generalized kinematic chains based on the concluded design constraints. Through the process of specialization, the atlas of feasible specialized chains is generated. For the 13 feasible generalized kinematic chains with seven links and ten joints, the corresponding feasible specialized chains, subject to the concluded design constrains, are identified through the following steps:
<list id="list3-0954406211417754" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For each generalized chain, the pin-in-slot device is assigned.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each result from Step 1, the anomalistic gear is assigned.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each result from Step 2, the ground link is assigned.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each result from Step 3, the remaining links, including the sidereal gear and the output gear, are assigned.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each result from Step 4, the remaining joints, including the revolute joints and the gear joints, are assigned.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In summary, through each step of assignments subject to the design constraints, 13 specialized chains with identified ground link, sidereal gear, anomalistic gear, output gear, and pin-in-slot device are available, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211417754">Fig. 8(a)</xref> to (m).

<sec id="sec21-0954406211417754"><title>5.4 Reconstruction designs</title>
<p>According to the geometry constraints from the CT images of the wrecked Antikythera mechanism, each design in the atlas of feasible specialized chains can be particularized into the corresponding schematic diagram, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417754">Fig. 9</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417754">Figure 9(b)</xref> is the existing design by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> and the remaining 12 specialized results are possible alternative design concepts for the lunar subsystem. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211417754">Figure 10</xref> shows the reconstruction designs in three-dimensional (3D) solid models that enable variations in the designs to be compared.
<fig id="fig9-0954406211417754" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Atlas of reconstruction designs in kinematic drawings</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417754-fig9.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig10-0954406211417754" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Atlas of reconstruction designs in 3D models</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417754-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For these feasible designs, different structures of axis E that affect strongly the link identifications for the coaxial gears, such as gears e5, e6, e1, and e2, are presented. They can provide alternative viewpoints to discuss the goal of the unexplained feature further. Simultaneously, the manufacture problems in each design are the impact factors that affect the identification of the original one. For these generated reconstruction designs, their feasibilities should consider the complexity of the structure and the degree of difficulty on manufacture. Logically, it is believed that, for the same goal, a simpler design is a better design.</p>
<p>Here, the purposes of the visible pentagonal mark are suggested in two ways: one is the hub of rotational shaft, i.e. the structure with the inner and the outer shafts existed; another is just a decorative design, i.e. the shaft with the complex structure is unnecessary. As far as the purpose of the hub design is concerned, the 13 designs, including the existing design by Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417754">Fig. 9</xref> are feasible. Each design can respectively correspond to an appropriate result of the identifications of the links for the coaxial gear. Moreover, it can result in the derivations of different gear trains further. The geometrical positions of gears in the space will be involved. Furthermore, for the purpose of a decorative design, since there is no existence of the design with the inner and the outer shafts, the coaxial gears are not adjacent to each other. Therefore, only the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417754">Fig. 9(i)</xref> can achieve this purpose.</p>
<p>In summary, the feasible conceptual designs corresponding to the different structures of axis E and the link identifications of the coaxial gears are presented. They can assist to clarify the unexplained feature in the lunar subsystem. Furthermore, although these feasible designs have the same output function and satisfy the technology standard of the subject’s time period, the complexity degree of the shaft structure will affect the manufacture possibility.</p>

<sec id="sec22-0954406211417754"><title>6 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The most difficult task in the reconstruction research of ancient machines is to create the reconstruction designs. Since the surviving fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are corroded and damaged, it is difficult to obtain the complete information by observing the fragments, even with the help of modern instruments. This study presents a systematic approach to the reconstruction synthesis of all feasible designs for the unexplained feature of the lunar subsystem of the Antikythera mechanism. Design constraints are concluded for each subsystem based on the study of historical archives, the analysis of existing designs and fragments images, and the investigation of ancient astronomy and other ancient astronomical apparatus. Then, by applying the concepts of generalization and specialization of mechanism, feasible designs that are consistent with the geometry of the excavated object and the science theories and techniques at that time are systematically generated. With respect to Antikythera mechanism, 13 feasible designs of the lunar subsystem are synthesized, among which, the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417754">Fig. 9(i)</xref> is the earliest adopted design, since the structure of shaft is the simplest. Also, the unexplained feature in this design is suggested as decoration. The existing design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417754">Fig. 9(b)</xref> is still the most feasible design based on the current decoding knowledge. However, these results contribute to solve the problem of the unexplained feature as mentioned in Freeth <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417754">17</xref></bold>]. Logically, one of the reconstruction designs should be the original model of the Antikythera mechanism.</p>
