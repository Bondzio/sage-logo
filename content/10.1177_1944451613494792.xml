<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult Still’s disease (ASD) is a severe form of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis that can occur in adults. It is characterized by recurrent fevers, evanescent pink salmon-colored rash, polyarthralgias, and frequently accompanied by a leukocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451613494792">1</xref></sup> Eighty percent of patients with ASD can be adequately controlled with corticosteroids, but in the others, disease-modifying drugs and biological agents have been used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451613494792">2</xref></sup> These include methotrexate, cyclosporine, interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) inhibitors. The pathophysiology of ASD is believed to be similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis, which includes the generation of auto-antibodies through the interaction of CD<sub>4</sub> T cells and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451613494792">3</xref></sup> resulting in elevations in IL cytokines 1, 6, 18, TNF, and interferon-γ levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451613494792">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613494792">5</xref></sup> Rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech Inc, Vacaville, CA), which binds to the CD<sub>20</sub> receptor on the surface of B cells preventing activation, has been used in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate or other conventional disease-modifying agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451613494792">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451613494792">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451613494792">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451613494792"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451613494792">10</xref></sup> is a life-threatening complication of ASD and presents with high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and lymphadenopathy and severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613494792">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613494792"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451613494792"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613494792">15</xref></sup> MAS usually develops in patients with ASD after initiation of a new therapy or without insult. We present a case of MAS in a patient with ASD who was given rituximab when conventional therapy failed to control the disease. The patient developed severe SIRS with hypotension or “pseudo-septic” shock. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of MAS associated with rituximab.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 21-year-old Caucasian female, who was diagnosed at age 19 with ASD after having recurrent fevers, salmon-colored rash, and polyarthralgias, was admitted to a local hospital with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, lethargy, and diarrhea. One month prior to this, she had been started on rituximab for ASD refractory to methotrexate, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine. When the rituximab was initiated, she was being treating with prednisone 10 mg daily. She received 4 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly, the last dose being 2 weeks prior to admission. On admission, her nose and limbs were cyanotic, she had a fever of 102.5°F, blood pressure of 70/30 mm Hg, white blood cell count was 65 000/µL with 60% bands, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, platelet count 81 000/µL, creatinine 3.7 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 402 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 78 IU/L, and procalcitonin was &gt;200. She was pancultured and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The following day, the cyanosis in her limbs worsened and she was then started on methylprednisolone 1 g/d. Her condition, however, continued to deteriorate, and she was transferred to a tertiary referral center for further management.</p>
<p>On admission to our hospital, she continued to have fevers greater than 102°F, but her mean blood pressure was 55 mm Hg off vasopressors. She appeared flushed, had cyanotic fingers to the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally with necrotic distal interphalangeal joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451613494792">Figure 1</xref>), necrotic toes, and cyanotic nose. No murmurs were heard on exam and her lungs were clear.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1944451613494792-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Her white blood cell count had dropped from 65 000/µL to 5100/µL. Hemoglobin was stable at 8.4 mg/dL. Platelet count was 60 000/µL. Creatinine was 1.5 mg/dL. Aspartate aminotransferase and Alanine aminotransferase were 570 IU/L and 209 IU/L, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase was 2218 IU/L. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm/h. Haptoglobin was 119 mg/L. D dimer &gt;36.4 µg/mL. Fibrinogen was 486 ng/dL but dropped to low 200s over the next 24 hours. Fibrin split products were positive. Cryoglobulins were negative. Ferritin level was 31 000 ng/mL. Triglycerides were 224 mg/dL. Cardiolipin and glycoprotein II antibodies were negative but lupus anticoagulant was positive with positive venous response rate test. Complement levels were within normal limits. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Hepatitis panel was negative. Influenza virus was negative. Epstein–Barr virus polymerase chain reaction was also negative. Urine drug screen was negative. No organisms were detected.</p>
<p>The patient had developed difficulty in breathing, bilateral basal crackles, and a raised jugular venous pressure after initial aggressive fluid resuscitation. A transthoracic echocardiogram then documented an ejection fraction of 40% to 45% as well as global hypokinesis, a right to left shunt, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 72 mm Hg. No vegetations or valve abnormalities were seen. The patient had severe hypoxia with bilateral infiltrates even after adequate diuresis. A diagnosis of pseudo-septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with MAS was diagnosed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613494792">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613494792"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451613494792"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613494792">15</xref></sup> and she was started on anakinra (Kineret, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) at 100 mg/d, sildenafil (Viagra, Pfizer, Collegeville, PA) 25 mg 3 times a day, and a 5-day course of plasmapheresis. The steroids were continued.</p>
<sec id="section3-1944451613494792">
<title>Subsequent Course</title>
<p>After starting the anakinra, her ferritin levels decreased to 2000 ng/dL after 3 days and to 194 ng/dL after 2 weeks of the medication. Her liver enzymes and coagulopathy normalized. Her transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated 11 days later and the ejection fraction was 50% to 55% with mildly elevated right ventricular pressure. The echocardiogram completely resolved when repeated 1 month later. Two months after her transfer to our facility, she underwent multiple finger, toe, and phalangeal amputations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our patient with ASD presented with pseudo-septic shock after being treated with rituximab. No organisms were found and she was subsequently diagnosed with MAS. After specific treatment for MAS, her severe SIRS resolved but the necrosis to her finger toes persisted and they were amputated. MAS is a rare, but devastating, complication of ASD that occurs in 7-13% of patients and carries a 20% mortality rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451613494792">14</xref></sup> The clinical presentation appears similarly to severe SIRS or sepsis due to the same cytokine cascade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613494792">13</xref></sup> These include elevations in IL, cytokine 1, 6, 18 and TNF and interferon-γ levels. Methotrexate and anti-TNFα agents have been associated with MAS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451613494792">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451613494792"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451613494792">10</xref></sup> but, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of rituximab associated with MAS. The actual pathogenesis of MAS has not been adequately worked out. This questions if there is more than NK cell and perforin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613494792">15</xref></sup> expression levels to the pathophysiology of MAS and the possibility of including a role of B cells and/or cytokine storm.</p>
<p>From the current proposed mechanism of action, which consists of elevated cytokines, anakinra, an IL-1 inhibitor, was chosen to treat the MAS and severe SIRS. Anakinra has also been used in other clinical setting with similar results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613494792">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451613494792">16</xref></sup> In this patient, the inflammatory markers and ferritin continued to decline while on the medication even after the patient’s corticosteroids had been discontinued; her rash and fevers have also resolved after anakinra was instituted. Perhaps, these changes are due to anakinra’s affect on IL-1, which acts primarily to expand the bone marrow granulocyte compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451613494792">17</xref></sup> Normally, IL-1 inhibits B lymphopoiesis and promotes myelopoiesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451613494792">17</xref></sup> which could be part of the underlying cause of MAS.</p>
<p>In addition to the resolution of her MAS, the patient’s multi-organ dysfunction, including her cardiomyopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome also resolved after treatment. The cytokine storm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613494792">13</xref></sup> linked to MAS especially TNF, also known as “myocardial depressant factor” and IL-1 are associated with the cardiomyopathy of septic shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451613494792">18</xref></sup> TNFα can lead to negative inotropic effects and apoptosis within the cardiac muscle leading to the classical features of congestive heart failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451613494792">19</xref></sup> and IL-1 is thought to depress myocyte contractility by stimulating nitric oxide synthase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451613494792">20</xref></sup> Anakinra could have a future role in treating SIRS, even severe sepsis or septic shock without underlying rheumatologic disease. Small trials have been performed looking at the efficacy of anakinra in the setting of myocardial infarction with favorable results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451613494792">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, many of the drugs that are used to treat ASD/juvenile idiopathic arthritis can also precipitate MAS in these patients. The timeline of the onset of MAS in this patient strongly suggests that rituximab was associated with MAS. The MAS presented as “pseudo-sepsis” and responded to anakinra. There were, however, residual effects of the massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451613494792">Figure 1</xref>). This case illustrates this rare, but potentially life-threatening, side effect of rituximab and further adds to the growing literature that anakinra may be used to treat this cytokine storm. Further studies are necessary to see the effect of anakinra in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.</p>
