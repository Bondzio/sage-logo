<abstract>
<p>This study, the first on the impact of a WalMart in a large city, draws on three annual surveys of enterprises within a four-mile radius of a new Chicago WalMart. It shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store. This probability fell off at a rate of 6% per mile in all directions. Using this relationship, we estimate that WalMart’s opening resulted in the loss of approximately 300 full-time equivalent jobs in nearby neighborhoods. This loss about equals WalMart’s own employment in the area. Our analysis of separate data on sales tax receipts shows that after its opening there was no net increase in retail sales in WalMart’s own and surrounding zip codes. Overall, these results support the contention that large-city WalMarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market.</p>

<body>
<p>Since opening its first store in Bentonville, Arkansas, in 1962, WalMart Stores Inc. has achieved nearly complete coverage of the small-town and suburban markets. Consequently, large, central-city areas represent WalMart’s last frontier for virgin expansion in the United States. The company has embarked on an aggressive effort in this direction. Supporters of WalMart urban expansion have argued that WalMarts will bring jobs and sorely needed economic development to central-city neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412457985">Mitts, 2008</xref>). Opponents question these claims and point to the displacement effects that have characterized WalMart expansions in small places. This study is the first to focus on the economic development impacts of an urban WalMart store on local businesses and employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412457985">1</xref></sup> We conducted three annual surveys of retail businesses in West Side Chicago neighborhoods starting in the months before WalMart opened. Drawing on an analysis of those surveys, as well as on state of Illinois data on sales tax receipts by zip code, we find evidence that the Chicago WalMart displaced many neighborhood businesses and in doing so displaced a number of jobs about equal to those it directly generated. Nor is there evidence of a stimulus effect on new businesses. Overall, these conclusions support the contention that large-city WalMarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly contributing to local economic development.</p>
<p>WalMart’s big-city urban expansion plans have roused strong local political opposition. As of October 2007, there were only two big-city WalMarts among the nation’s three largest cities—one in Los Angeles and one in Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412457985">WalMart Stores, 2012</xref>). New York City has not yet allowed any WalMart stores within its city limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412457985">Jones, 2007</xref>), although the retailer is still eager to enter that market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412457985">Massey, 2009</xref>). Recently, WalMart has indicated that it is hoping to expand across the city of Chicago, starting with a store on the South Side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412457985">Bustillo, 2009</xref>). The economic policy debates, in Chicago and elsewhere, have centered on WalMart’s impact on local jobs and community retail development needs.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2004, WalMart submitted zoning applications to locate stores in two different Chicago neighborhoods. After a number of highly contentious zoning board and city council meetings, WalMart was given approval for a store on Chicago’s West Side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412457985">2</xref></sup> The decision was motivated by claims that WalMart would bring economic development to the West Side. At the time, the relatively impoverished area immediately around the new WalMart site (zip codes 60639 and 60651) was not exactly enjoying an urban renaissance, but it was experiencing steady increases in sales tax revenues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891242412457985">3</xref></sup> In the 5 years before the new WalMart opened (2001-2006), sales taxes increased at about 7% per year. Sales taxes in nearby areas (in other words, in neighboring zip codes) were growing at a slower rate, about 1%. Retail employment in both the core area and contiguous zip codes was basically steady over the preopening period.</p>
<p>The controversial decision to allow WalMart to establish a store there was followed by an effort to enact a “big-box living wage ordinance” in Chicago. This proposal would have required WalMart and other large retailers to pay a “living wage” and provide health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412457985">Baiman, 2006</xref>). The big-box living wage ordinance was passed by the city council but provoked a heated debate and led to the first mayoral veto in 17 years. The new WalMart opened at the end of September 2006. In the recent recession, WalMart obtained approval for a second city store on the southwest side. Job creation and economic development arguments were central to the discussion over where to put that store.</p>
<p>The next section, “Conceptual Framework,” discusses the basic hypotheses of the article. The third section, “Survey Methodology,” presents the set of surveys conducted for this study. The section “Findings from Survey Data” analyzes the store closures in West Side neighborhoods. Then, the section “Sales Tax Data and WalMart’s Impact” goes on to consider the impact of the Chicago WalMart on state sales tax data by zip codes. The last section, “Summary and Conclusions,” presents our conclusions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0891242412457985">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Has the Chicago urban WalMart encouraged job growth and economic development? Too often in their eagerness to claim employment gains, economic development studies fail to adequately consider the displacement effects of a new activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412457985">Persky, Felsenstein, &amp;Wiewel, 1997</xref>). Nowhere is this problem more severe than in the retail sector. In retailing, displacement is not the exception but the rule. It borders on the irresponsible to claim job gains for new developments without measuring the displacement of existing businesses.</p>
<p>This observation underlies our approach to assessing the impact of an urban WalMart on total employment. The goal of the first part of our study is to measure WalMart’s impact on existing retailers serving the same market. There is a considerable literature on the displacement impacts of new WalMarts outside major urban areas (for a full review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412457985">Goetz &amp; Bonanno, 2012</xref>). If price elasticities are low, the introduction of an urban WalMart will leave total purchases approximately unchanged. Given WalMart’s high ratio of sales to employees, this would imply an actual decline in employment, presumably through forcing some existing firms to contract or close.</p>
<p>Here we use a survey to gather data on existing nearby retailers before and after the opening of the Chicago WalMart. The key hypothesis tested here is that displacement in a dense urban area will fall with distance. The empirical analysis of the survey data identifies a displacement gradient by distance from the new WalMart. This research design controls for the generally high rate of small-business closures in retailing. Moreover, the hypothesis is consistent with a range of market-area theories of retailing. For example, in variations of central place theory, larger centers generally provide fewer goods to more distant locations, as lower-order goods are supplied locally.</p>
<p>Even if WalMart displaces existing competitors, there are at least two ways that it might encourage an expansion of retailing as a whole. First, if consumer price elasticities are large, total retail sales might increase if WalMart’s prices were significantly lower than the competitors it displaced. Second, WalMart’s opening could spur agglomeration economies in retail sectors with which it does not directly compete. A number of recent researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412457985">Basker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412457985">Paruchuri, Baum, &amp; Potere, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412457985">Sobel &amp; Dean, 2008</xref>) have suggested that WalMarts, while displacing retail competitors, may encourage the development of a range of other retailers. Their argument rests on WalMart creating significant consumer agglomeration economies on which those other retailers can build.</p>
<p>The second empirical exercise in this article explores the possibility of retail expansion, either because of high price elasticities or agglomeration effects. We analyze sales tax receipts in the Chicago zip codes around WalMart. If WalMart encouraged retail development more broadly, these receipts should trend upward after WalMart’s opening. This trend should be strongest closest to the WalMart store itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0891242412457985" sec-type="methods">
<title>Survey Methodology</title>
<p>To study the effect of WalMart on economic activity in the West Side, where it is located, we gathered baseline (“pre-WalMart”) information and measured post-WalMart changes in activity over two years. We attribute changes in. We attribute changes in economic activity to WalMart’s presence by comparing three sets of alternatives: (a) pre-WalMart activity and trends to post-WalMart activity and trends, (b) changes in activity near WalMart to changes further away, and (c) changes in product lines that directly compete with WalMart to those that do not. We use a variety of data to make these comparisons.</p>
<p>We obtained our main source of data about business activity in the neighborhood of the new WalMart store by conducting a series of phone surveys of local businesses. The survey consisted of approximately 25 (often multipart) questions and asked about ownership of the businesses, racial and educational characteristics of owners and employees, wages and hours, and prices for various items. A copy of the complete survey can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/pa/faculty/Fall2007Survey.pdf">http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/pa/faculty/Fall2007Survey.pdf</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412457985">Loyola University Chicago, Center for Urban Research and Learning, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We considered a target area that covered businesses within four miles east, west, north, and south of WalMart<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0891242412457985">4</xref></sup> (i.e., the 64 square miles surrounding the WalMart store; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891242412457985">Figure 1</xref>). The logic of sampling this sizable urban area is that it is significantly larger than what might be expected to be the new WalMart’s market area. Hence, it is likely to contain both nearby retail areas that would draw many shoppers to WalMart and more distant, but comparable, areas that are less likely to feel WalMart’s competitive pressure. The radius of four miles used in equation estimation based on survey data is roughly consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412457985">Holmes (2009)</xref>, who estimates a demand model with one WalMart in a “dense” community. That model suggests that under such conditions consumer demand for WalMart falls off by 80% between zero and five miles. He notes, “A higher distance responsiveness in urban areas is just what we would expect” (p. 12). Chicago densities are considerably higher than those Holmes considers. In any event, if the radius is drawn too conservatively here, then the resulting displacement impacts will be underestimated.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using geographically coded MSN Yellow Pages listings for retail stores, we assembled a list of 503 businesses in the major retail categories that compete with WalMart. From March through late August 2006, we implemented our telephone survey of these businesses. We were able to confirm that 306 of the 503 businesses (61%) were in business, were located in the study area, and offered products that competed with WalMart. Other businesses were not called, were called but never answered, or answered but were not in the study area or did not offer products that competed with WalMart.</p>
<p>Of the 306 potential WalMart competitors that we identified, 177 completed surveys that provided at least some useful baseline (pre-WalMart opening) data on the number of hours worked by owners and employees, number of employees, starting and average wages, whether benefits were offered, and some prices.</p>
<p>Beginning in March 2007, we resurveyed businesses that completed surveys in 2006. Again these were mostly telephone surveys, involving multiple calls to the same store until someone answered or explicitly asked not to be contacted again, followed by a few site visits. This second wave of surveying continued through early November 2007, when surveying was discontinued to avoid the potentially distortionary effects of holiday seasonal employment.</p>
<p>Our third wave of data collection began in March 2008 and ran through early November 2008.</p>
<p>We also tracked the ongoing status (i.e., in business/out of business) of the 129 businesses that we know were in business, in the study area, and offered products that competed with WalMart in 2006 but that declined to respond to our survey in 2006. Thus, we have a sample of 306 (177 + 129) businesses in the study area that we know were in business before WalMart’s opening and for which we can track in-business status. For a subsample of these businesses (177 in 2006), we have some additional data about number of employees, wages, and so on, from 2006 and some later years. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891242412457985">Figure 2</xref> outlines the three waves of sampling and provides some additional information.</p>

<p>On average, the firms we surveyed in 2006 had about 10 employees and paid a wage of $8.08 per hour. Fifty-one of the firms reported offering health care coverage to their employees. About half were owned by Chicagoans, while the rest were of dispersed ownership. Many of the businesses had owners that worked directly in the store for many hours (an average of almost 49) each week. Many of the businesses had women or minority owners.</p>
<p>As part of our survey, we asked each business within which product lines it operated. All businesses in our survey had product lines that overlapped with WalMart’s. Many businesses carried multiple product lines—among the most popular were apparel (48%) and drugs (31%). We also geocoded the location of all the stores in our sample and measured the distance from each business to WalMart. Businesses ranged from as little as one tenth of a mile from WalMart to as far as four miles from WalMart, with the average business about two-and-a-third miles from WalMart.</p>

These included nine businesses that had disconnected phone numbers, six businesses that had become different stores since 2006, and seven businesses that completed surveys in 2006 but that we were unable to contact despite many repeated attempts in 2007.</p>

<title>2008 Survey Response Rate</title>
<p>For Part A of our 2008 survey, we attempted to contact the 155 (177 − 22) businesses in the 2007 sample that had not yet gone out of business plus seven businesses that had not responded to our 2007 survey. None of the seven businesses that had not responded to our multiple attempts to contact them in 2007 responded to our attempts to contact them in 2008. Thus, we confirmed that these 7 businesses, which we know had been in business in 2006, were out of business in both 2007 and 2008. Eighty of the 155 businesses that completed surveys in 2006 and were still in business in 2007 provided at least some usable survey information when we contacted them in 2008, for a 2008 repeat-survey response rate of about 52%. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412457985">Table 2</xref>, 51 of the businesses we resurveyed refused to participate in the 2008 survey. In addition, we conclude that 24 businesses went out of business sometime between our 2007 survey and our 2008 survey attempt. These included 17 businesses that had disconnected phone numbers, two businesses that had become different stores since 2006, and seven businesses that completed surveys in 2006 but that we were unable to contact despite many repeated attempts in 2008.</p>
<p>Note that some of our surveys were completed after the start of the national recession, which began in December of 2007. Although the advent of the recession may have hastened the closure of some businesses in our study area, it will have no effect on our analysis of WalMart’s impact on competitors’ probability of closure as long as the recession had a uniform impact on economic activity throughout the whole study area—an assumption that seems innocuous.</p>
<p>In addition to the businesses that provided some useful survey information in 2006, we also tracked the survival of the 129 businesses that were in the original 2006 sampling universe of 503 retail businesses and that we verified were in business in 2006, but that did not complete the 2006 survey. For these businesses we were able to ascertain whether they were in business as of 2007 and 2008 and in what line of goods they specialized.</p>
<p>The top panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0891242412457985">Table 3</xref> contains some summary statistics about 55 businesses that responded to both the 2006 and 2007 surveys. Because our samples of businesses that responded to multiple surveys is quite small, and because many businesses did not provide complete information even when they responded to the surveys, we confine our analysis of changes to the most important variables—employment and wages. On average, in 2007 these businesses had about 11 employees and had 14% more employees than they had had in 2006. In 2007, the firms reported paying an average wage of $8.47 an hour, which was about 4% higher than the average wage they had reported in the 2006 survey. (Note that the standard deviation on both wages and employees is quite large.)</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0891242412457985">Table 5</xref> reports on several regression specifications that test the hypothesis that proximity to WalMart influences the probability a competing business will fail. Column 1 reports the results of a simple ordinary least squares regression of distance to WalMart (in miles) on a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respondent business closed between our 2006 survey and our 2007 survey. The constant suggests that in the immediate vicinity of the WalMart location about 25% of competing businesses closed in this first year. The negative and significant coefficient indicates that each one-mile increase in distance to WalMart reduced a competitor’s probability of closing by about 4%. Thus, at three miles, a competing business had only a 13% chance of closing in that year. The ordinary least squares regression in Column 3 suggests that these effects continued at much the same pace in the second year of the 2006-2008 survey period. A business in the immediate proximity of WalMart had about a 40% chance of closing some time over the two-year period following the baseline pre-WalMart survey. This chance fell at a significant rate of almost 6% per mile. Thus, at three miles, a competing business had only a 22% chance of closing in the two-year period. Columns 2 and 4 replicate Columns 1 and 2, using the probit functional form to constrain the predicted probability to be between 0 and 1. The results of these tests essentially replicate the simpler forms in Columns 1 and 2. Column 5 shows results when the sample is limited to three miles. For this smaller sample, the coefficient on the distance parameter is consistent with the other estimates.</p>

<p>The general decline of competing businesses’ closures as one gains distance from WalMart seems independent of direction. None of the simple models of business closure is significantly altered by the introduction of quadrant variables. Similarly, base-year employment fails to enter the regression as significant.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0891242412457985">Table 6</xref> breaks down the going-out-of-business regression (2006-2008) by retail line of business. All these lines (except shoe stores) show negative distance effects, and for a majority these effects are statistically significant. The largest distance effect is found for toy stores, at 25% per mile. A hypothetical toy store adjacent to WalMart had a 75% chance of going out of business. A toy store three miles away had almost no chance of closing. A similarly large impact was found for electronics stores, starting at 62% and falling off 22% per mile. Office supply stores had much the same pattern.</p>

<title>Estimated Job Loss From WalMart</title>
<p>Business closures generated by a WalMart “distance effect” result not only in losses to business owners but also in declines in employment that would not otherwise have occurred. An estimate of these employment declines builds from the basic linear equation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0891242412457985">Table 5</xref>, restricted to establishments within four miles of WalMart (Column 1). The expected employment loss for each establishment is estimated as regression coefficient × (4 − distance from WalMart) × (average employment in 2006 of establishments that closed by 2008).</p>
<p>This methodology assumes that, in the absence of WalMart, the rate at which existing businesses closed would not be correlated with distance to the parcel of land on which WalMart sits. That is, in the absence of WalMart, businesses in close proximity to where the WalMart store now stands would close at the same rate as those that were three to four miles away from the WalMart location were observed to close. Note that our methodology attributes to WalMart only the “excessive” closures near the store.</p>
<p>This methodology is likely conservative, because we do not calculate reductions in the opening of new businesses as a result of the WalMart store. Because there is no centralized database that tracks business openings, we were unable to assemble a set of data that would allow us to discern the pattern of new business openings after WalMart’s arrival. It seems likely that the prospect of competing with a low-priced WalMart store would deter some potential competitors. If this was the case, our measure of job loss due to WalMart would be conservative. We acknowledge that, as some critics have charged, it is logically possible that WalMart could have a synergistic effect that could actually increase the number of new business openings. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412457985">Paruchuri, Baum, and Potere (2009)</xref> use a comprehensive database on store openings and closures in Florida and find that WalMart suppressed entry rates. We come back to this question in the next section, where we analyze data on total retail sales.</p>
<p>Average employment of the sampled establishments (for which we have employment data) that closed by 2008 was 6.05 full-time-equivalent workers. This gives an estimate of 189 full-time-equivalent jobs lost through the WalMart effect on the 306 sampled stores. If we adjust this estimate for stores that were never contacted (482/306), the estimated loss increases to 298.</p>
<p>With some adjustments, the job-loss figures estimated here can be compared with the assertion that WalMart employed some 426 workers at its Chicago store, 310 of whom were “sales associates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412457985">Mitts, 2008</xref>). Many of the latter were undoubtedly part-time workers. An estimate of about 320 full-time-equivalent workers (assuming half of the 426 workers were part-time) would very likely be generous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0891242412457985">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0891242412457985">Table 7</xref> reports on additional regressions with dependent variables that measure the change in employment and wages in surviving stores that responded to both the 2006 and 2007 surveys, and surviving stores that responded to both the 2006 and 2008 surveys. Distance to WalMart was not significantly correlated with either of these variables in either sample.</p>

<title>Sales Tax Data and WalMart’s Impact</title>
<p>The survey data discussed in the last section throws light on the impact of WalMart on nearby retailers in operation as of 2006. These data cannot fully address claims that the Chicago WalMart has stimulated retail openings by firms new to the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412457985">Mitts, 2008</xref>). To explore such claims we obtained zip code–level data on taxable sales from the Illinois Department of Revenue by quarter, from the first calendar quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2008. This data set includes the zip code in which WalMart is located, 60639, and nine surrounding zip codes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0891242412457985">Figure 4</xref> shows the included zip codes. We only use data through Quarter 1 of 2008 to avoid confounding the trends in our study with those of the recession that began at the end of 2007 and of the financial crisis that began in September 2008.</p>

</fig>
<p>The WalMart store (marked with a star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0891242412457985">Figure 4</xref>) lies in zip code 60639, just across the border from zip code 60651. In 2005, zip code 60639 had taxable sales of about $743 million. These sales were growing at a healthy 7.5% per year before the opening of WalMart. We do not have data on the annual sales of the Chicago WalMart, but according to the “Two-Year Economic Report Card” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412457985">Mitts, 2008</xref>) on the impact of the WalMart store, a report card issued by Chicago Alderwoman Emma Mitts, WalMart paid $10.4 million in sales taxes (all levels) in its first two years of operations. This figure implies sales of at least $55 million per year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0891242412457985">8</xref></sup> Alternatively, we know that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242412457985">Wikinvest (2012)</xref>, in 2005 U.S. sales by WalMart averaged $438 per square foot. Since Chicago’s WalMart is 142,000 square feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412457985">Jones, 2008</xref>), we might expect its sales to be about $61 million a year. Using a figure of $60 million, these sales amount to about 8% of the sales in the zip code.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0891242412457985">Table 8</xref> reports regression results for a basic-event study, keyed to WalMart’s opening. Attention is focused here on WalMart’s zip code of 60639 and its neighboring zip code, 60651. All zip codes contiguous to either of these are aggregated into what effectively becomes the control group. The dependent variable is the natural log of taxable sales measured in millions (i.e., 100 × sales taxes ÷ 1,000,000). The strategy is to identify the trends in the control region, 60639 and 60651, before WalMart’s opening and then see if there are breaks in these trends after WalMart’s opening. The first coefficient in the table (Time) can be interpreted as the average annual growth rate for the region as a whole throughout the period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0891242412457985">9</xref></sup> This rate is about 1% a year. It is somewhat slower than the corresponding rate for the entire city of Chicago, 3%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0891242412457985">10</xref></sup> The next two coefficients (Time × 60639 dummy and Time × 60651 dummy) measure the extent to which the two zip codes of interest were growing faster than the area average in the pre-WalMart period. Interestingly, zip code 60639 was averaging an additional 6.7% in this period, while 60651 averaged about 4.3% more in this period. Put somewhat differently, the WalMart Corporation picked an area of relatively rapid retail growth for its new store.</p>

<p>The fourth entry in the table (After Opening dummy × 60639 dummy) allows for the absolute shift produced in zip code 60639 by the WalMart opening itself. This is estimated as just about 11%, a figure very much in line with the estimates presented above. This estimate has a standard error that implies a <italic>t</italic> statistic of 1.63, a borderline value that has a 10.7% probability of being drawn from a population with a true value of zero. The next coefficient (After Opening dummy × [Time − Opening Time]) can be interpreted as any break in trend that holds for the entire region. This is essentially 0—that is, there was no break in trend for the region as a whole. But the next coefficient (After Opening dummy × [Time − Opening Time] × 60639 dummy) suggests that there was a very significant break in trend in zip code 60639 after WalMart’s opening. Having a value of almost -18%, this estimate implies that the zip code’s trend of about 7% growth per year falls to a -11% per year. In one year’s time, this new trend erases the entire absolute effect of the WalMart opening. Similarly, the trend in zip code 60651 falls from about 5% to about -3% (i.e., 5.3% − 8.4%)—not as low as zip code 60639 but significantly below the rest of the area’s 1% growth.</p>
<p>Our analyses of data on taxable sales in WalMart’s home zip code in its close neighbor, zip code 60651, and in adjoining zip codes, are consistent with the hypothesis that WalMart’s sales displace a significant amount of sales from its home zip code and its immediate neighbor. Sales in zip code 60639 began to trend down after WalMart’s opening. Far from demonstrating that WalMart served as an engine of local retail development, these data suggest that WalMart acted as something of a barrier to such development.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study of Chicago’s West Side WalMart has provided evidence that, in an urban setting, proximity to WalMart is associated with a higher probability of going out of business for local retail establishments. In addition, sales tax collections suggest that the West Side WalMart has replaced sales from its own zip code and its immediate neighboring zip code.</p>
<p>The relation between closure and distance from WalMart has strengthened over time. Our third round of surveys began in March 2008. Those data provide strong evidence about WalMart’s long-run effects. The impact on store closures by distance from WalMart is larger and more significant in this last sample. Our estimates suggest that WalMart has resulted in the loss of about 300 full-time-equivalent jobs in its own and in nearby zip codes. Although there is considerable uncertainty attached to these calculations, they suggest a loss about equal to WalMart’s own employment in the area. These estimates support the contention that large-city WalMarts absorb retail sales from other city stores without significantly expanding the market.</p>
<p>The above estimate focuses only on store closings. Of course, some new stores have entered the area since WalMart opened. We do not have estimates on these store openings. Whatever openings have occurred, these new outlets have not been able to offset the negative trends in older establishments. Indeed, sales tax data show that WalMart’s opening has set off overall declines in revenues within its zip code and its closest neighboring zip code.</p>

<p>The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0891242412457985">Table 3</xref> may at first appear inconsistent with a within-firm fall in employment between 2007 and 2008, since the top panel shows a lower average level of employment than the bottom panel. To understand this anomaly, remember that businesses that provided survey information in 2006 and 2007 are distinct from the businesses that provided survey information in 2007 and 2008. The decline in employment between 2007 and 2008 discussed in the text is based on data provided by businesses that responded to both our 2007 and our 2008 survey attempts. About 29 businesses provided survey data in all 3 years (2006, 2007, and 2008). This small sample for which employment figures are available for all 3 years shows modest declines, from 9.5 full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees in 2006 to 8.8 FTE employees in 2008.</p>
