<abstract>
<p>A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR test) based on genome segment 10 of <italic>Bluetongue virus</italic> (BTV) was developed. The PCR test consists of robotized viral RNA isolation from blood samples and an all-in-one method including initial denaturation of genomic double-stranded RNA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time detection and analysis. Reference strains of the 24 recognized BTV serotypes, isolates from different years, and geographic origins were detected. Other orbiviruses such as <italic>African horse sickness virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus</italic>, and <italic>Equine encephalosis virus</italic> were not detected. Experimentally infected animals were PCR positive from 2 days postinoculation, which was earlier than fever, other clinical signs, or seroconversion. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were very close to or even 100%. The PCR test played a key role in the detection of BTV serotype 8 in August 2006 in The Netherlands. The outbreak in a completely naive ruminant population allowed for further evaluation of the PCR test with field samples. In 2006, the correlation between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR results was estimated to be 95%. In the following years, the PCR test was used for diagnosis of diseased animals, for testing of healthy animals for trade purposes, and for detection of BTV RNA in different species of the insect vector, <italic>Culicoides</italic>. In the autumn of 2008, BTV serotype 6 unexpectedly emerged in northwest Europe and was also detected with the PCR test developed in the current study. The performance in routine use over 5 years has been recorded and evaluated.</p>

<title>Animal experiments</title>
<p>Animal experiments were performed in cattle, sheep, and goats. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs and sampled frequently for EDTA-blood and clotted blood (serum). Samples were divided into suitable aliquots and stored at 4°C for ≤2 days or at −70°C (EDTA-blood) and at −20°C (serum) for longer periods. All experiments with live animals were performed under the guidelines of the European Community (86/609) and were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Central Veterinary Institute.</p>
<sec id="section6-1040638712440986">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>Two groups of 6 sheep were used. All sheep were negative for BTV RNA and BTV antibodies as determined by the PCR test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Five sheep per group were intravenously inoculated with 1 ml of 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml of BHK-21–adapted BTV serotype 2 or 4 of the panel of reference BTV strains of the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, United Kingdom (IAH-Pirbright, U.K.) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/">http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/</ext-link>).

<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>In 2006, 3 naturally infected pregnant heifers were used as donors of BTV serotype 8. These heifers had no clinical signs but were positive for serotype 8 and serotype 8 antibodies, and they were estimated to be infected at least 50 days before the first sampling. One hundred milliliters of EDTA-blood was collected from each heifer. Total pooled cell fractions were washed several times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), resuspended, and pooled in a total volume of 300 ml (washed EDTA-blood). Three recipient cows negative for BTV and BTV antibodies were inoculated with 70 ml intravenously and 30 ml subcutaneously. After 7 and 21 dpi, EDTA-blood was harvested from 2 of 3 inoculated cows identified as BTV positive by PCR and was stored at −70°C (EDTA-blood). Recipient cows and heifers were monitored and sampled weekly until the end of the experiment (approximately 150 and 200 dpi, respectively).</p>

Three negative controls (which consisted of 200 µl PBS) and 3 positive controls were part of each isolation run. Positive controls contained different dilutions of BTV grown on BHK-21 cells. The weak positive control (cutoff value) contained the highest dilution of virus with a reproducible positive signal. The strong positive control was the highest dilution of virus resulting in a maximal ratio of optical density (OD)<sub>530</sub>/OD<sub>640</sub>. The third positive control (intermediate control) was a dilution of virus with a result between the weak and strong positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712440986">Fig. 1</xref>). Samples of 1 isolation run, including positive and negative controls, were immediately tested or stored at −70°C. Field samples were always tested in the real time RT-PCR assay together with the controls of the same isolation run.</p>

Primers and probes were designed by selection of conserved regions in genome segments S5, S8, and S10. Initial denaturation of dsRNA, first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis (RT), PCR, and real-time monitoring were performed in a closed capillary. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a thermal cycler.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638712440986">b</xref></sup> In a later stage, real-time RT-PCR was also performed in a different thermal cycler with a 96-sample format.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638712440986">b</xref></sup> Forward primer 5′-AGTGTCGCTGCCATGCTATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCGTACGATGCGAATGCA-3′ were used.

<title>Development of the PCR test</title>
<p>Prototypes of RT-PCR assays were developed that theoretically detected all BTV strains of which the sequences of the PCR targets were available (in silico sensitivity). Sequences of other relevant serogroups of orbiviruses (EHDV, AHSV, and EEV) were used to confirm the selectivity of primers and probes (in silico specificity). Ten prototype assays were studied with a representative panel of 24 serotypes of BTV as provided by IAH-Pirbright, U.K. Four of the prototypes were further studied with EDTA-blood samples from experiment 1. The most promising prototype was based on genome segment S10, and this assay was selected for extensive optimizing and validation. The optimal conditions were defined as the earliest Cp values combined with the maximal OD<sub>530</sub>/OD<sub>640</sub> ratio. The robustness of the PCR test was studied by deliberate deviations of volumes, temperatures, and time intervals. The volumes of premix (15 µl) and template RNA (5 µl) may vary up to 2 µl without reduction of sensitivity. Annealing temperature at 61 ± 2°C and variation in time intervals (±1 sec) did not affect the sensitivity. Because the template for RT is mainly viral dsRNA, special attention was taken on the denaturation of dsRNA before synthesis of the first strand of cDNA in the presence of all reagents. Maximal sensitivity was achieved by initial denaturation at 98°C for 20 ± 5 sec. Furthermore, for practical reasons, it was confirmed that isolated RNA could be retested without loss of sensitivity after storage up to 7 days at 4°C, or after up to 10 freeze–thaw cycles. New batches of isolation and amplification kits, primers, probe, and different isolation robots and different thermal cycler machines were implemented in a 5-year period of study. The relative standard deviation of the repeatability of the strong and weak positive control was 0.50% and 2.03%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712440986">Fig. 2</xref>). The relative standard deviation of the reproducibility of the strong and weak positive control was 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively.</p>

<title>Sensitivity</title>
<p>Desktop selection of conserved regions for primers and probe by alignment of known sequences of BTVs was the first step to develop a PCR test with a high theoretical or in silico sensitivity. Selected conserved regions for primers and probe in S10 of BTV have a maximum of 1 mismatch (data not shown).</p>
<p>Twenty-four BTV serotypes from cell cultures, including isolates from Australia, the United States, southern Europe, northwest Europe, and South Africa, were detected (in vitro sensitivity). The correlation between virus titer and PCR signal was found between 3.3 and 3.5 Cp/log dilution (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of &gt;0.995) for the panel of reference BTV strains over a wide range of dilutions, indicating a comparable detection limit for all BTVs. Virus detection by PCR was more sensitive than VI on ECE (results not shown).</p>
<p>The detection of BTV by PCR in animals (diagnostic sensitivity or in vivo sensitivity) was investigated with samples from 4 animal trials in which different BTV strains were used. Two of these animal trials, experiments 2 and 4, have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712440986">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440986">4</xref></sup> No severe clinical signs were observed in experiments 1 and 3, except fever (&gt;40°C) at 1 or more days in the first 2 weeks postinfection in experiment 1. In both groups, 1 of 5 inoculated animals became PCR inconclusive late after infection, at 21 or 32 dpi, respectively, followed by successive PCR-negative results. All other animals remained PCR positive up to 70 dpi, the end of the experiment. In experiment 3, 3 naturally infected heifers remained PCR positive to &gt;140 dpi and became PCR negative after 2 consecutive weekly samples with PCR-inconclusive results. Two experimentally infected heifers became PCR positive at 5 and 7 dpi and became PCR negative at approximately 170 dpi after 2 consecutive weekly samples with PCR-inconclusive results. The third recipient remained PCR and ELISA negative, indicating an unsuccessful experimental infection.</p>
<p>In summary, 29 animals infected with different BTV serotypes were all detected by the PCR test at an average of 4 dpi. Infection was subsequently confirmed by ELISA for BTV antibodies and by repeated testing by PCR. In 1 case, experimental infection was unsuccessful as determined by successive negative PCR tests. This animal also remained ELISA negative, confirming the unsuccessful infection. In conclusion, the range of detection for all BTVs was comparable, and the diagnostic sensitivity in this study was approaching 100%.</p>

Selectivity was further achieved by real-time detection/analysis with the developed selective probe for BTV amplicons.</p>
<p>The diagnostic or in vivo specificity was determined by testing EDTA-blood samples from BTV-free animals. Eighteen cattle, 17 sheep, and 4 goats served as negative control animals in trials and/or were sampled prior to infection. In total, more than 200 samples from 39 animals were ELISA and PCR negative (not shown). In experiment 1, 1 negative control sheep became PCR positive at day 21 and following samplings in the experiment. Indeed, this sheep seroconverted in ELISA 9 days later for the first time, confirming BTV infection much later via an unknown route. In conclusion, the diagnostic specificity of the PCR test was very close to or even 100%.</p>

<title>Practical use</title>
<p>The PCR test was used for field samples after the incursion of BTV serotype 8 in northwest Europe in August 2006. Bluetongue had never previously been reported in The Netherlands, and a nonvaccination policy against bluetongue was in place. Consequently, BTV infection could be detected by either PCR or ELISA, although antibodies could be detected later in the infection. Coupled samples of EDTA-blood and serum, taken on the same day from the same animal, collected during August–December 2006, were studied by ELISA and PCR tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638712440986">Table 1</xref>). For cattle, 369 of 403 coupled samples were both ELISA and PCR positive. All coupled samples (<italic>n</italic> = 230) of seropositive sheep were also PCR positive. None of the tested goats were PCR or ELISA positive in this period.</p>

<p>Samples of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid–treated whole blood and serum were taken from the animals (coupled samples) between August 17, 2006, and December 15, 2006.

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Similarly, coupled samples were selected in the vector-free period between mid-December 2006 and the end of March 2007. Seronegative animals were expected to remain PCR negative in this period by the absence of BTV circulation. Indeed, all seronegative sheep (<italic>n</italic> = 543) and goats (<italic>n</italic> = 187) were also PCR negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638712440986">Table 2</xref>). For cattle, 1 of 247 seronegative animals was PCR positive. It appeared that this cow was sampled very soon after the official start of the vector-free period (December 27, 2006) and was likely an exceptional example of acute infection. In general, a very high correlation between ELISA and PCR results was found in 2006, the first year of BTV circulation (for positive results) and in the vector-free period (for negative results).</p>

<p>Samples of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid–treated whole blood and serum were taken from the animals (coupled samples) between December 16, 2006, and March 31, 2007. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)–negative results were used to define animals as “BTV-free” (in bold). PCR = polymerase chain reaction.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In 2007, seropositive animals could have been infected in the previous year. Therefore, comparative positive ELISA and PCR results were only possible in the first year of BTV circulation, starting with a completely naive ruminant population. ELISA positivity after natural infection lasts longer than PCR positivity and certainly overlaps periods of BTV circulation. Furthermore, starting in 2008, vaccination with an inactivated BTV serotype 8 vaccine was begun, and thus detection of infected animals by ELISA was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Regarding sustainability of the PCR test, primers and probe were annually checked by alignment to sequences in GenBank and other available sequence data sets (in silico sensitivity and specificity). Occasionally, new <italic>Orbivirus</italic> isolates were requested to check the in vitro sensitivity and specificity. Since 2006, test results of the annual ring trials organized by the Community Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue (IAH-Pirbright, U.K.) have been in full agreement with those of the organizing laboratory.</p>
<p>Over a 5-year period, the performance of the PCR test was continuously recorded during testing of samples to control the BTV serotype 8 epidemic. All negative controls were negative following the criteria for diagnosis (not shown). Sporadically, false-positive test results of negative controls were found, and subsequently the entire PCR test, RNA isolation, and RT-PCR assay were repeated as contamination was suspected. In general, positive controls showed limited variation. Occasionally, the PCR results of positive controls varied by &gt;2 SD (“invalid”), and these runs were subsequently repeated. In the 5-year period of operation, change of reagents, equipment, and personnel was also recorded. No repeatable difference of &gt;2 SD was observed in test performance; however, small variations (&lt;2 SD) could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712440986">Fig. 2</xref>). On 2 occasions, an obvious change in performance was associated with the implementation of a new batch of reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712440986">Fig. 2</xref>). A next step in high-throughput diagnostics was achieved by implementation of a 96-sample format system using the same details and conditions of the method described herein. In different periods, 96-sample format systems for isolation and for RT-PCR were implemented in the diagnostic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712440986">Fig. 2</xref>). No difference and variability in test performance were noticed by this scaling up.</p>
<p>A summary of PCR results over 5 years of practical use in an epizootic situation followed by a monitoring period is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712440986">Figure 3</xref>. Inconclusive PCR results were observed to be in the majority after the peak of infections in 2006 and 2007. Positive PCR results for field samples were no longer found after 2008.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As part of a preparedness program on bluetongue, a high-throughput PCR-based diagnostic system was developed to detect BTV. The PCR test provided early detection of all recognized BTV serotypes, as well as reliable and rapid testing of large numbers of samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712440986">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638712440986">18</xref></sup> An average of over 3,000 samples per month (in total &gt;200,000 samples) were tested in a 5-year period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712440986">Fig. 3</xref>). It has to be noted that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712440986">Figure 3</xref> does not reflect the number of BTV-infected animals but represents the number of tested EDTA-blood samples and is a strong underestimation of the actual number of BTV-infected animals. Furthermore, most samples from January 2009 onwards were tested for export purposes and originated from healthy cattle.</p>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction assays for BTV with manual RNA isolation have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440986">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712440986">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638712440986">28</xref></sup> Comparison between manual and automated RNA isolation has shown a top 3 position for automated RNA isolation for several previously developed PCR tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638712440986">29</xref></sup> Manual RNA isolation is not considered practical to deal with epizootics in which large numbers of samples need to be tested. Previously published real-time PCR tests for BTV need initial denaturation of dsRNA before the addition of enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712440986">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712440986">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712440986">19</xref></sup> The PCR test described in the current study includes initial denaturation of dsRNA, first-strand cDNA synthesis (RT), PCR, and detection/analysis by real-time technology in the presence of all reagents of the PCR test. This all-in-one method further reduces labor, as reopening of test tubes is no longer necessary. Other key benefits include avoiding reopening to minimize risk of accidents and cross-contamination, shortening the total operation time, and reducing costs. Implementation of a 96-sample format system for both dsRNA isolation and PCR for this all-in-one method has been accomplished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712440986">Fig. 3</xref>). The all-in-one method and the scaling to a 96-sample format system created a truly high-throughput system that will be very helpful in further automation of high-throughput diagnostics to control epizootics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638712440986">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sequences of virus isolates become available rapidly, even without virus cultivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712440986">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712440986">16</xref></sup> At present, the primers and probe contain at most 1 mismatch per oligo for all BTV strains. Furthermore, none of the mismatches are located near the 3′-end of PCR primers. In contrast, more than 4 mismatches are present in other orbiviruses, such as EHDV, AHSV, and EEV.</p>
<p>In terms of the onset of clinical signs, the ELISA and PCR test results in the current study are in agreement with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712440986">13</xref></sup> and varied between animal trials. This variation is likely due to differences in species, status, and age of the animals, as well as by differences in dose, route of administration, origin, history, and the BTV strains used in the work.</p>
<p>The PCR results were interpreted as positive, inconclusive, or negative. An inconclusive area between the cutoff value of the PCR test and the negative control was defined to reduce the percentage of false positives and false negatives. On one hand, false-positive PCR results could incorrectly change the status of a BTV-free animal, farm, compartment, region, or country. As this could have serious consequences, the cutoff value of the PCR test was therefore chosen relatively high to lower the risk of an incorrect (positive) interpretation of PCR results. On the other hand, false-negative PCR results have undesirable consequences for bluetongue control, which include the national or international movement of infected animals to BTV-free areas. Depending on the impact, inconclusive PCR results were tested again and/or the respective animals were resampled. Animals must be tested PCR negative for national or international movement.</p>
<p>In 2006, due to the specific circumstances of this first year of BTV circulation, the status “recently infected by BTV” could be determined by ELISA and/or PCR tests. However, on some occasions, a fast BTV clearance after experimental infection was observed. Extrapolated to the field situation, a minority of ELISA-positive animals could have become PCR negative in August–December 2006 by fast BTV clearance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638712440986">Table 1</xref>). For sheep, most of the animals tested were showing clinical symptoms and thus were acutely infected; therefore, all ELISA-positive sheep were PCR positive.</p>
<p>New infections (PCR+/ELISA–) were highly unlikely from December 2006 to March 2007 as this was the vector-free period in northwest Europe. Consequently, ELISA-negative animals in this period could be defined as “BTV-free.” Indeed, except for 1 animal, all ELISA-negative animals were also PCR negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638712440986">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>After the first period of BTV circulation, the percentage of PCR–/ELISA+ cattle became higher, and no inconclusive results were found in this period for sheep (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638712440986">Table 2</xref>). This is in agreement with the longer prolongation and slower decline of the PCR signal in cattle compared with sheep as observed after experimental infections. It is noteworthy to mention that, in the vector-free period, much fewer sheep were sampled, whereas more healthy cattle were sampled to be moved or traded.</p>
<p>The PCR test described in the current study has also been used for research purposes to test many different types of samples, including organ suspensions, homogenates of ECE, and midges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712440986">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638712440986">25</xref></sup> and ticks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440986">7</xref></sup> demonstrating the broad application of the PCR test in BTV research. The PCR test was further successfully used for detection of BTV serotype 6 in 2008. Discrimination between infection with BTV serotypes 8 and 6 would be possible by genetic differences in the regions between the conserved sequences of the primers and probe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440986">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638712440986">23</xref></sup> At present, in the post-epizootic period, the PCR test is used to screen animals for international movement and monitoring as well as for research purposes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a robust, thoroughly validated, high-throughput sample processing system using real-time RT-PCR detection for all BTV serotypes was described in the current study. The automated isolation of viral dsRNA combined with the all-in-one method and the 96-sample format systems can be used for development of BTV serotyping by PCR and for development of PCR tests for other serogroups of orbiviruses.</p>
