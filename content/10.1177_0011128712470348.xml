<p>This study provides a partial test of Klinger’s ecological theory of police behavior using hierarchical linear modeling on 1,677 suspects who had encounters with police within 24 beats. The current study used data from four sources originally collected by the Project on Policing Neighborhoods (POPN), including systematic social observation, in-person interviews with officers, census data, and police crime records. It investigates the effects of neighborhood violent crime rates and concentrated disadvantage on officer vigor, controlling for individual-level officer characteristics and situational factors. The analyses reveal that police vigor was significantly shaped by beat-level crime rates, with high–crime rate neighborhoods experiencing higher levels of police vigor in handling suspects. The findings are not consistent with the ecological propositions set forth by Klinger. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research and theoretical development are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of explanations of police behavior have been advanced, and the empirical scholarship examining police work is abundant. A large body of research has focused on situational factors (e.g., citizens’ background characteristics, demeanor, seriousness of offense, and strength of evidence), decision-maker characteristics (e.g., officers’ demographics, training, assignment, and occupational attitudes), and organizational considerations (e.g., departmental philosophies, strategies, and leadership and supervisory styles). A fourth line of inquiry involves examining the effect of neighborhood context on police behavior, which has received comparatively little theoretical advancement and empirical investigation. Indeed, the question about how and why patterns of policing vary across communities remains underresearched. More research examining neighborhood effects is necessary so as to understand the confluence between the law and the ecological characteristics of place.</p>
<p>The central focus of the current study is to assess the connection between neighborhood context and police behavior. We partially test ecological propositions raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128712470348">Klinger (1997)</xref> in his theory of police work. The thrust of Klinger’s theory is that officers working in high crime districts will act less vigorously because they would be more cynical of residents, view crime as normal within that area, perceive victims as less deserving, and have less time to devote to all calls, compared with officers assigned to lower crime districts. His theoretical framework illuminates the connection between police organizations and their ecological environment and explains why officers may police with less vigor in high crime areas. Vigor here refers to the degree to which officers used their formal legal authority by responding to the conduct of citizens within the framework of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>This article builds off prior research examining the ecological correlates of police behavior in three distinct ways. First, although Klinger’s theoretical piece was published more than a decade ago, empirical testing of his propositions remains sparse. Two likely reasons for the paucity of research are the complexity of his model involving multiple stages of causal relationships and the multilevel nature of the theory that requires individual- and neighborhood-level data. Indeed, less than a handful of studies have partially tested theoretical arguments proposed by Klinger, and the results have been mixed and, in some cases, contradictory to the theory tested. For example, one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128712470348">Johnson &amp; Olschansky, 2010</xref>) found that district crime rates were inversely related to the number of vehicle stops, positively associated with the number of arrests, and weakly connected to the number of vehicle searches, traffic tickets, and misdemeanor arrests. A second study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>) found a positive relationship between district crime and vigor, but the significant connection disappeared when seriousness of the offense and other controls were entered into the analysis. Still, a third study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128712470348">Lawton, 2007</xref>) showed that district violent crime rates were not significantly related to the use of nonlethal force. Indeed, research examining ecological propositions derived from Klinger’s theory is unsettled and more empirical assessment is warranted.</p>
<p>Second, a methodological improvement promotes the present study. Specifically, previous tests of Klinger’s theory (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128712470348">Lawton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>) used neighborhood contextual variables (e.g., district crime rates) in individual-level (i.e., officer-level) analyses. This micro-level approach is problematic for two reasons. One is that these studies could have violated the assumption of independence for regression analysis because officers who are assigned to the same district are often correlated to each other in certain ways. For example, if the district commander emphasizes aggressive enforcement strategies in handling local crime problems, then patrol officers assigned to the same area may collectively be more likely to engage in aggressive field practices such as traffic stops, field interrogation, and arrests. The other is that these studies could not assess cross-level effects because the estimates are not adjusted for the covariates, regardless of whether they are measured at the individual or the contextual (e.g., district or beat) level. Multilevel modeling techniques are employed in this study to address these two potential concerns.</p>
<p>Finally, conceptual elaboration of Klinger’s theory is proposed and assessed in this study using an argument set forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol (2010a)</xref>. According to Klinger’s theory, the district is the fulcrum for the development of work rules, and the aggregate most appropriate to explaining police vigor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128712470348">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol (2010a)</xref> posited that crime and deviance levels might vary considerably within the district (intradistrict variation), thereby making it prudent to study the effect of crime levels on police behavior at the smaller jurisdictional level such as a patrol beat (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128712470348">Phillips &amp; Sobol, 2011</xref>). We echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol’s (2010a)</xref> suggestion that patrol beats may be a more appropriate unit of analysis due in large part to the fact that racially and economically diverse districts are also likely to experience significant variation in crime and deviance levels. Although officers in the same district may be ascribed to a common work group culture, their responses to crime or levels of “vigor” may be shaped heavily by distinctive neighborhood (or beat) characteristics that they are familiar with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2008</xref>). This conceptual reconsideration is tested in this research.</p>
<p>Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) on 1,677 suspects who had encounters with police within 24 beats, this study investigates the effects of neighborhood violent crime rates and concentrated disadvantage on the vigor with which the police respond, controlling for individual-level officer characteristics and situational factors. The following section reviews the extant literature on police behavior, as well as prior research on the role of neighborhood characteristics, situational factors, and officer variables on police decision making. Specific attention is paid to research focused on how neighborhood factors relate to police behavior, consistent with Klinger’s theory of social ecology. Next, the data and methodology used in the study are discussed. Finally, the results of the analyses are presented, and the findings of the study are placed within the larger body of theoretical and empirical literature in this area.</p>

<title>Theoretical Frameworks of Police Behavior</title>
<sec id="section3-0011128712470348">
<title>Individual Explanations</title>
<p>Individual explanations consist of two major groups of predictors—officer characteristics and situational factors. Individual officer explanations of police behavior suggest that police officers’ background characteristics, work assignment, as well as attitudes, perceptions, and personality influence their behavior during police–citizen encounters. Based on Klinger’s theory, this study focuses on three officer characteristics, including level of cynicism, workload, and length of service in current district.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128712470348">Klinger (1997)</xref>, officers’ levels of cynicism and workload mediate the relationship between district violent crime rate and vigor. That is, officers who are assigned to high–crime rate districts are likely to have heavier workload and be more cynical of neighborhood residents, which, in turn, leads to lower levels of vigor in officers’ response to crime. Only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol (2010a)</xref> has incorporated these two variables into an analysis. He reported a negative, but insignificant, bivariate relationship between both officer cynicism and vigor and workload and vigor. His analyses also showed that the relationship between district violent crime rate and vigor was not mediated by officer cynicism and district workload, as theoretically expected. The present study thus focuses on the direct effects of cynicism and workload on vigor. The effect of the last officer variable, length of service in current district, is less articulated in Klinger’s work. The variable is included in the analysis because it may influence officers’ perceptions of citizens and district problems and subsequently levels of vigor.</p>
<p>Situational factors are perhaps one of the more prominent explanations for police decision making. Characteristics of the situation include citizen demographics, citizen demeanor, relationship between the victim and the offender, victim preferences, evidence strength, and the visibility of the encounter. Studies examining citizen characteristics are, however, mixed. For example, some research has shown that males are more likely to be arrested (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128712470348">Sealock &amp; Simpson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128712470348">Visher, 1983</xref>), while others reported no significant gender differences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712470348">Klinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128712470348">Krohn, Curry, &amp; Nelson-Kilger, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128712470348">Smith &amp; Visher, 1981</xref>). Studies also indicate that non-White suspects are more likely to be arrested, cited, and treated with more force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128712470348">Schafer, Carter, Katz-Bannister, &amp; Wells, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128712470348">Smith, Visher, &amp; Davidson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128712470348">Smith &amp; Visher, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128712470348">Sun, Payne, &amp; Wu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128712470348">Terrill &amp; Mastrofski, 2002</xref>), but others report no significant race effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712470348">Klinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128712470348">Smith &amp; Klein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128712470348">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). Studies on the effects of citizen age and social class also showed similarly mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128712470348">R. Brown, Novak, &amp; Frank, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with citizens’ demographic characteristics, citizen demeanor has been found to be one of the more consistent predictors of police behavior. Studies indicate that disrespectful citizens are more likely to be arrested, cited, and be the recipient of officer coercive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128712470348">Engel, Sobol, &amp; Worden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128712470348">Smith, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128712470348">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128712470348">Worden, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128712470348">Worden &amp; Shepard, 1996</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128712470348">Klinger, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712470348">1996</xref>). The two tests of Klinger’s ecological theory also found that citizens who were disrespectful, were drug impaired, and had unstable mental condition were more likely to be subject to higher levels of nonlethal force and vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128712470348">Lawton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has been consistent concerning the seriousness of the crime. Most studies agree that police are more likely to make an arrest if the offense is serious and the evidence is strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128712470348">Black, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128712470348">Mastrofski, Worden, &amp; Snipes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128712470348">Smith &amp; Visher, 1981</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol’s (2010a)</xref> attempt to test Klinger’s theory found a significant relationship between higher levels of police vigor and citizens who had a weapon within jump and reach and who resisted officer authority by fleeing the scene.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011128712470348">
<title>Neighborhood Explanations</title>
<p>Neighborhood explanations argue that police behavior can be accounted for by variation in demographic and institutional characteristics of communities. Following Chicago school’s social disorganization tradition, a number of studies have reported significant variation in police behavior along several neighborhood structural characteristics, such as racial composition, socioeconomic status, and residential mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128712470348">Bayley &amp; Mendelsohn, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128712470348">Brooks, Piquero, &amp; Cronin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128712470348">Hagan, Gillis, &amp; Chan, 1978</xref>). Earlier studies treated these contextual characteristics as separate measures in testing their effects on police behavior. For example, police officers were found to be more likely to issue citations, make arrests, and engage in coercive and abusive behavior in minority and racially mixed neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128712470348">Smith, 1986</xref>). Research has also revealed that poor neighborhoods were more likely to be subjected to control or coercive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128712470348">Smith &amp; Klein, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128712470348">Wilson (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128712470348">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls (1997)</xref>, recent studies have extended the measurement of poverty or class from a single item to a composite factor of concentrated disadvantage, commonly operationalized by a combination of percentage of poverty, unemployed, and female-headed/single-parent family. Concentrated disadvantage was found to be positively related to police coercive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128712470348">Sun et al., 2008</xref>) and negatively associated with police supportive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128712470348">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). The concept, however, was found to have no significant impact on police vigor in a recent test of Klinger’s model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>A second neighborhood characteristic, which constitutes the centerpiece of Klinger’s theory, is crime rate. Studies have hypothesized that patrol officers’ attitudes and behavior may be affected by the levels of crime and deviance in the areas they patrol. For instance, high crime areas have been found to affect how the police will differentially scrutinize citizens and situations within particular areas and explain selective enforcement practices based on officers’ perceptions of the spatial distribution of crime and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128712470348">Brooks, Piquero, &amp; Cronin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128712470348">Mastrofski, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128712470348">Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128712470348">Stark, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128712470348">Sung, 2002</xref>). Using measures of community dangerousness to assess the effects of neighborhood crime rates on police behavior, research has shown that the police may develop different operational styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128712470348">M. Brown, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128712470348">Skolnick, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128712470348">Stark, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128712470348">Westley, 1970</xref>) and such styles likely reflect the level of crime in the area.</p>
<p>Additional scholarship contends that neighborhoods with more crime and deviance may see enforcement that is more lenient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128712470348">Stark, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128712470348">Warner, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128712470348">Stark (1987)</xref> argued that patrol officers are more inclined to let things pass in particular neighborhoods because they are more cynical toward citizens and victims in high crime environments. Using systematic observation of the police, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128712470348">Smith (1986)</xref> reported that the effects of neighborhood crime rates influenced police nonrecording behaviors in higher crime neighborhoods, and there was a threshold effect whereby an offense had to reach a higher level of seriousness in higher crime neighborhoods before the police would take a report. This finding suggests that officers may be more selective for different classes of offenses and encounters.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at Klinger’s theory, district-level crime rates are a vital precursor of how police officers perceive citizens and how much vigor or leniency they apply to encounters with citizens. Put more simply, officers assigned to districts with high crime rates are presumed to hold more cynical views of neighborhood residents, view crime as normal within that area, perceive victims as less deserving, and have less time to devote to all calls, controlling for seriousness of the immediate offense. A possible result of such attitudinal propensities and time constraints, according to Klinger, is responding with less vigor compared with officers assigned to areas with less crime. The few examinations of propositions derived from Klinger’s theory have, however, produced results not congruent with Klinger’s assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128712470348">Johnson &amp; Olschansky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128712470348">Lawton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>). Apparently, findings from such a small number of studies are less than conclusive, calling for more empirical tests.</p>

<sec id="section6-0011128712470348">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The current study used data from four sources originally collected by the Project on Policing Neighborhoods (POPN), including systematic social observation, in-person interviews with officers, census data, and police crime records. The POPN study was conducted in two cities (Indianapolis, Indiana, and St. Petersburg, Florida) in the summers of 1996 and 1997, respectively (for a detailed description of POPN and the research sites, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128712470348">Mastrofski et al., 1998</xref>.) Field observers accompanied officers assigned to selected beats throughout a matched sample of work shifts. Patrol observation was conducted in 12 beats in each city.</p>
<p>Approximately 240 hours of observation was carried out for officers assigned to each beat within each of the seven districts. Across both sites, observers recorded contact with approximately 12,000 citizens (6,500 in Indianapolis and 5,500 in St. Petersburg). The citizens who were encountered were classified as crime victims, witnesses, a variety of service recipients, and criminal suspects.</p>
<p>Data on officers’ characteristics and attitudes were taken from both in-person interviews and observations. These interviews consisted of a mix of questions posed by interviewers and checklists completed by respondents in the interviewers’ presence. Of the 426 officers assigned to patrol in Indianapolis, a total of 398 were surveyed, producing a completion rate of 93%. In St. Petersburg, 240 of 246 patrol officers were interviewed, a completion rate of 98%. Survey questions were designed to obtain information on officers’ personal characteristics, occupational outlooks, work experience, perceptions of their beats, and attitudes toward the police role. Additional data on officer experience, assignment, and personal demographic characteristics were also collected. The measure of the amount of time officers had available during their observed shifts was obtained from observational data.</p>
<p>Census data and police crime records for each beat were collected and used to compute a beat crime rate for each of the 12 beats where the officer may have been assigned. Data from the interviews were merged with those observational data to allow one to examine the extent to which the vigor of the police response varies across neighborhoods and to which degree neighborhood contextual factors affect officer vigor. To maximize the likelihood that police–suspect interactions involved neighborhood residents and their visitors, traffic and administrative-related incidents were excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128712470348">2</xref></sup> Data for the analyses reported here include all nontraffic suspects. There were originally 1,702 suspects encountered by the police in the current data. Cases with any missing data were dropped from the analysis. The resulting sample included a total of 1,677 suspects with whom the police had contact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0011128712470348">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The dependent variable used in this study is police vigor, measured by a five-category ordinal variable that covered the following exhaustive and mutually exclusive police responses: (a) no action/release; (b) suggest, persuade, request, and negotiate; (c) command and threaten the suspect to do something; (d) interrogation and search; and (e) arrest. The higher the score, the greater the vigor of officer action the greater likelihood the encounters will lead to serious legal consequences.</p>
<p>Independent variables of interest included both individual- and beat-level predictors. Individual-level predictors incorporated a variety of officer, citizen, and incident characteristics. Specifically, three officer variables were examined: level of cynicism, workload, and length of service in current district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128712470348">3</xref></sup> Officer cynicism was measured by an additive scale of three items.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128712470348">4</xref></sup> Officers were asked “How many of the citizens in your beat would call the police if they saw something suspicious?”, “How many of the citizens in your beat would provide information about a crime if they knew something and were asked about it by the police?”, and “How many of the citizens in your beat are willing to work with the police to try to solve neighborhood problems?” The response options for each item ranged from most (1) to none (4). A higher score reflected a more cynical outlook of the police. Principal component factor analysis confirmed that these items loaded on one factor that explained approximately 66% of the variance across the items (Eigenvalue = 1.97). The Cronbach’s alpha score indicated acceptable reliability (α = .74).</p>
<p>The predictor, officer workload, took into account the amount of time officers had available during their observed shifts by assessing the percentage of their time that was directed activity (i.e., assigned time) versus nondirected activity (i.e., unassigned time). Specifically, the measure was obtained by summing the total activity and encounter time, the total assigned activity and assigned encounter time, and computing the quotient. A higher percentage of unassigned time during observed officer shift indicated lower workload. Finally, officer length of service in the district was measured in years. We used years in district as our measure because assignments are district-based in the two cities, and officers generally cross beat boundaries within the same district but rarely cross district boundaries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011128712470348">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Situational predictors included a multitude of demographic and behavioral dimensions. Citizen gender, race, age, and class were dichotomized variables with value 1 representing female, minority, young (18-29 years old), and poor (chronic poverty or low income), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011128712470348">6</xref></sup> Four other dummy variables indicated whether or not the citizen was unable to control emotions and actions, showed disrespect to the authority of the officer, had any sort of weapon within immediate reach, and fled the scene of the encounter. Value 1 indicated the presence of these individual and situational characteristics. Finally, seriousness of crime was measured by an ordinal variable of five categories: 0 = <italic>no crime</italic>; 1 = <italic>public disorder/victimless crime</italic>; 2 = <italic>misdemeanor/minor property crime</italic>; 3 = <italic>major property crime</italic>; and 4 = <italic>major violent crime</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011128712470348">7</xref></sup> A higher score represents greater seriousness of crime.</p>
<p>There were two neighborhood contextual factors used in the analyses. Concentrated disadvantage was a three-item weighted factor, including percentage of poor, percentage of unemployed, and percentage of female-headed families. Violent crime rates were obtained from the Uniform Crime Report for Indianapolis in 1996 and St. Petersburg in 1997. The counts of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were added up and divided by census data population estimates, standardized by 1,000 residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011128712470348">8</xref></sup></p>

Possible multicollinearity problems were checked among independent variables by examining their bivariate correlation matrix (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128712470348">Table 2</xref>) and the variance inflation factor (results not shown). No indication of multicollinearity was found.</p>

<title>Analytical Methods</title>
<p>Data in this study presented a nested structure where police officers worked in patrol beats; thus, multilevel modeling that included additional error terms was appropriate to correctly account for the nested nature of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128712470348">Bryk, Raudenbush, &amp; Congdon, 1994</xref>). Due to the ordinal nature of the outcome variable, two-level ordinal logistic HLM was used. Ordinal response models often utilize cumulative comparisons of the ordinal outcome. Thus, different from binary logistic HLM where one logit function is sufficient, ordinal logistic HLM uses multiple logit functions, yielding a cumulative logit function. In this study, the ordinal models characterize the ordinal responses in five categories in terms of four cumulative category comparisons, specifically, four cumulative logits (i.e., log odds) of the ordinal responses. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0011128712470348">appendix</xref> reports detailed specification of our models to assist a better understanding of the ordinal logistic HLM. Analyses were conducted using the HLM2 module of the statistical package HLM 6.06.</p>
<p>The analytic approach proceeded along three steps. To start, an unconditional model (Model 1) was run without adding any independent variables at either level. The purpose of the unconditional model was to gauge the proportion of variance in officer vigor accounted for by the differences within and between beats. In other words, the model indicated whether or not there was sufficient variation between beats in officer vigor that warranted an investigation of the beat-level variables. Next, Level 1 independent variables were added to the model with randomly varying intercepts (Model 2). Officer characteristics, including level of cynicism, workload, and length of work, were grand mean centered as the primary substantive focus of the current study was on the Level 2 predictors. By using grand mean centering, the intercept can be interpreted as the predicted vigor score for an officer whose level of cynicism, workload, and length of work scores were at the grand mean. The slope coefficients with grand mean centering were a mixture of the within- and between-cluster association between cynicism, workload, length of work, and vigor.</p>
<p>Situational characteristics, including citizen gender, race, age, class, emotional state, and disrespectful behavior, seriousness of crime, weapon present, and suspect fleeing the scene, were entered into equations in their original forms. Using the original metrics of these variables was proper because they were dummy variables with meaningful values of 0. After that, Level 2 predictors were added to the model with randomly varying intercepts and fixed slopes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011128712470348">9</xref></sup> (Model 3). Concentrated disadvantage and violent crime rate were centered on their grand means. By using grand mean centering, the intercepts represented the group-mean values for persons who had a grand average on every predictor. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0011128712470348">appendix</xref> reports detailed specification of our models.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-0011128712470348" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics showed that the overall mean score on officer vigor was 3.39 on the 1- to 5-point scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128712470348">Table 1</xref>). Frequency distributions of the variable indicate that, among the 1,677 observed incidents, interrogation and search constituted the most common officer response (46.2%), followed by arrest (20.2%) and no action (20.1%). A small number of encounters involved either officer suggesting/persuading (6.7%) or commanding/threatening (6.9%) the citizens.</p>
<p>Results of the ordinal logistic HLM analyses were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128712470348">Table 3</xref>. The first panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128712470348">Table 3</xref> reported the results of the unconditional model (Model 1). A moderate degree of variability of officer vigor between beats was found (variance component = .161, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.40). The results from the second and third panels of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128712470348">Table 3</xref> showed that after adding in both Level 1 and Level 2 predictors (Model 3), the variation of intercepts between beats has reduced modestly compared with when only Level 1 predictors were included in the analyses (Model 2). This finding suggested that besides concentrated disadvantage and violent crime rates, there were additional important Level 2 variables missed from the analysis.

<p>The second and third panels of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128712470348">Table 3</xref> presented the results of Model 2 and Model 3. Coefficient estimates in ordinal logistic HLM were in the form of log odds, which indicated the change in the log odds of being in the lowest category of the dependent variable as a result of one unit change in the predictor after controlling for all other predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712470348">Gracia &amp; Herrero, 2008</xref>). Given that the lowest category of the outcome variable was no action by the officer, a negative coefficient meant that a higher value of an independent variable was associated with a reduction in the log odds of no action by the police. Conversely, a positive coefficient meant that a higher value of the independent variable was related to an increase in the log odds of no officer action. In other words, negative coefficients represented more vigor of police response, and positive coefficients indicated less vigor of police response.</p>
<p>It was observed that the effects of Level 1 predictors were quite consistent, with or without Level 2 predictors. As expected, female and older citizens received less vigorous police response than males and younger citizens. Citizens who were emotional, disrespectful, and trying to flee the scene were more likely to receive higher levels of vigorous police response.</p>
<p>The effects of fleeing the scene on police vigor were the strongest one among all independent variables. For individuals fleeing the scene, the odds of getting arrest versus the combined other action options are almost 8 times higher than people who did not flee the scene, given all other variables are held constant in the model. The next strongest effects appeared to be disrespect for the police. The odds of getting arrested versus all the other police actions are approaching twice as high for individuals who showed disrespect to the authority of the officer than their counterparts who showed respect. In terms of Level 2 predictors, concentrated disadvantage was not a significant predictor, but violent crime rates had a significantly negative effect on the log odds of receiving lower end officer vigor. In other words, holding all other variables constant, beats with higher violent crime rates witnessed higher probabilities of vigorous police action. For a one unit increase in the violent crime rate, the odds of getting vigorous police response rather than less vigorous are 1.02 times greater, given the other variables are held constant in the model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study extends a small pool of past studies that have partially tested Klinger’s ecological theory of police behavior. The results of this study provide much-needed evidence to advance the development of neighborhood explanations of police behavior in general and to assess the validity of an ecological theory of police vigor in particular. Three major findings are derived from our analyses of multilevel data of police–citizen encounters. First, police vigor was significantly shaped by beat-level crime rates, with high–crime rate neighborhoods experiencing higher levels of police vigor in handling suspects. Although this finding is in line with the results from recent tests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128712470348">Johnson &amp; Olschansky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">2010a</xref>), it contradicts Klinger’s proposition that crime rates are inversely related to police vigor. Indeed, patrol officers in high–crime rate beats do not take a hands-off or underenforcement approach by ignoring some, especially minor, offenses. Instead, as found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712470348">Fyfe, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128712470348">Smith, 1986</xref>), they actually acted more vigorously toward suspects encountered in neighborhoods with more serious crime problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011128712470348">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>To further assess Klinger’s argument about the impact of district crime rates, we performed additional three-level HLM analyses including district crime rates as a Level 3 indicator and beat crime rates as a Level 2 indicator. The results showed that both district and beat crime rates were not significant predictors of police vigor. This finding indicates that the interarea variation is not a very large one. When it is partitioned between the two levels (i.e., district and beat), each level’s variation is small, failing to account for variation in police behavior. Future research should take this finding into account when formulating theoretical models and deciding analytic techniques.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to neighborhood crime rates, our findings revealed that two of the “mediating factors” in Klinger’s theory (levels of cynicism and workload) are not significantly connected to police vigor. Although we only partially tested propositions derived from Klinger’s work, the direct influences of both concepts on police behavior are not found. Our findings are not at odds with the results from previous studies that showed a weak link between officers’ occupational attitudes and field practice (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128712470348">Worden, 1989</xref>) and a recent test showing no association between workload and police vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, situational factors were found to influence levels of police vigor. Although officers’ individual-level predictors were not significantly related to police vigor, situational dynamics embedded in police–suspect encounters do matter. Suspects who were male, young, emotional, disrespectful, committing more serious offenses, and trying to flee the scene were more likely to be the subjects of a more vigorous police response, controlling for seriousness of the offense. Apparently, the application of vigor is not randomly distributed across the population. Male and young citizens have been and probably will continue to be the targets of law enforcement because of their physical threat and heavy involvement in criminal activity. Certain members of the community and specific features of police–citizen encounters increase the likelihood of a more vigorous police response. Indeed, our findings confirm the necessity to include citizens’ background characteristics, demeanor, and legal considerations in models predicting police behavior.</p>
<p>Two more directions for future assessment of Klinger’s theory are worthy of discussion. First, to be fair, none of the previous studies, including this research, have conducted a full test of Klinger’s theory of police behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011128712470348">11</xref></sup> A careful read of Klinger’s work suggests that a combination of different statistical methods (e.g., HLM and structural equation modeling [SEM]) and levels of data is required to adequately address the multilevel nature of his theory (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010a</xref>). This means that using appropriate methods to examine the influences of both individual- and neighborhood-level predictors and test the causal relationships among key concepts should be vigorously pursued in future research.</p>
<p>Second, future studies should continue to advance the operationalization of the concept of police vigor and pay much closer attention to how district crime is measured, independent of a measure which overlaps with police behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0011128712470348">12</xref></sup> One reasonable approach would be to incorporate a broader range of police behavior, especially noncoercive or supportive actions, into the analysis. We propose that police vigor can be better measured by capturing not only the exercise of coercive control over citizens but also the provision of support to citizens (e.g., also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712470348">Klinger, 1996</xref>). The latter has been largely ignored in past studies. Nevertheless, two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128712470348">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128712470348">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>) can shed light on how police supportive or noncoercive behaviors can be conceptualized and measured.</p>
<p>Two implications for policy can be derived from the findings of this research. First, our findings show the differential manner in which police treated citizens in neighborhoods with varying crime conditions. This finding is consistent with previous research that reported neighborhood structural disadvantage has a positive effect on police misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128712470348">Kane, 2002</xref>). Although higher levels of police vigor do not necessarily mean unequal treatment “or abusive behavior,” police administrators and supervisors need to monitor overly aggressive actions against residents in high–crime rate neighborhoods.</p>
<p>A second and related point is that police vigor is not evenly distributed across segments of society. Police indeed police both people and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128712470348">Smith, 1986</xref>). Although legal considerations (e.g., seriousness of the offense) and suspect demeanor are generally viewed as acceptable factors in justifying higher levels of vigor against suspects, citizens’ gender and age are extralegal factors that should not have a place in the police decision-making equation. Male and young citizens have been and probably will continue to be the targets of law enforcement because of their heavy involvement in criminal activity. Police administrators want to ensure that there is no systematic bias against them and that they will be treated with respect and fairness even when more coercive actions have to be applied to control the situation.</p>

<p>Although the ecological aggregate for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128712470348">Klinger’s (1997)</xref> theory is the patrol district, he acknowledges that police work is carried out across different types of patrol areas. For example, he writes that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The shared responsibility within and exclusivity across jurisdictional and district boundaries creates distinct systems of policing at the district and small jurisdictional level . . . [but for] simplicity’s sake . . . such groupings of beats will be called districts, regardless of whether the district is a distinct jurisdiction unto itself or a subsection of some larger jurisdiction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128712470348">Klinger, 1997</xref>, p. 282)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712470348">Sobol (2010a)</xref>, we assert that grouping such jurisdictions together may be problematic for the theory, especially when the district is diverse and has considerable variation of crime and deviance levels within it.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0011128712470348">
<label>2.</label>
<p>Although traffic stops are an important setting for studying police–citizen contact, the focus of the research remains on nontraffic encounters because such encounters are more likely to yield interactions with residents from the community. A separate analysis involving traffic suspects would dilute the focus of this article.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0011128712470348">
<label>3.</label>
<p>It should be noted that statistically, it is possible to test Klinger’s theory by using only district-level measures. Such an analysis would be more consistent with what Klinger’s theory called for. Unfortunately, such an analysis would require a much larger data set and likely need multiple departments because a single agency would not have enough districts to permit a meaningful analysis. Such data are not available for the present study.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0011128712470348">
<label>4.</label>
<p>We acknowledge that the cynicism measure used in this analysis does not tap into officers’ perception about the failings of the criminal justice system—an area which Klinger noted increased their level of cynicism. Klinger’s theory did, however, also assert that another determinant of cynicism might be dealing with the citizens in the areas they are assigned. It is from this basis that the current measure of cynicism is based. Such a measure is consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128712470348">Niederhoffer (1967)</xref>. Specifically, Niederhoffer’s classic study asserted that cynicism is directed at the world (the people with whom they interact) and the police system more generally and entails both a skepticism of social institutions and a loss of faith in people and an unwillingness to assist people who are deemed unworthy. Our current measure takes into consideration officer perceptions of citizen cooperation, citizen willingness to assist/provide information about crime, and whether citizens would assist police to try and solve neighborhood problems and tap into several dimensions of cynicism proposed by Niederhoffer (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128712470348">Sobol, 2010b</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0011128712470348">
<label>5.</label>
<p>As suggested by one of the anonymous reviewers, it is possible that the effect of length of service on vigor is conditional based on beat/neighborhood characteristics. Future research should consider examining the interaction effect between length of service and beat characteristics and constructing the length of service variable based on both district- and beat-level data if possible.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0011128712470348">
<label>6.</label>
<p>Information on citizen class came from direct observational data collected and coded by POPN field observers. A citizen’s wealth was determined based on the citizen’s appearance, dress, the citizen’s property and possessions, and information provided by the citizen about his or her income (job, home, and other resources). The original item had four categories: chronic poverty, low, middle, and above middle. The first two were used to construct the measure “poor.” Chronic poverty refers to someone who appears not to have a domicile that can shelter him or her from the elements, and low wealth refers to someone who has regular food, shelter, and clothing but can provide these things at minimum levels for subsistence.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0011128712470348">
<label>7.</label>
<p>The variable seriousness concerns the severity of the alleged citizen behavior that prompted the encounter. It is possible that a citizen was coded as a suspect but “no crime” was involved because the suspect was cleared after police investigation or the responding officer decided not to file charges against the citizen. It is unlikely, however, that no action was taken if the suspect was involved in a major violent crime.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0011128712470348">
<label>8.</label>
<p>The average district rate of violent crime was higher than the national rate because POPN oversampled neighborhoods/beats with high levels of social distress and crime rates. This sample strategy is consistent with most systematic observational studies of the police. As a result, although our findings might be considered generalizable to most urban, metropolitan, police departments, they may be poor comparisons to rural and suburban agencies.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0011128712470348">
<label>9.</label>
<p>Due to the complex nature of ordinal logistic hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and the large number of Level 1 predictors, we did not allow individual-level slopes to vary randomly to reduce the complexity of the models. Assessing fixed effects also reflected our interest in modeling vigor averages as a function of individual-level and neighborhood-level predictors.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0011128712470348">
<label>10.</label>
<p>Both departments were in the early stage of implementing community policing. Our finding that officers displaying higher levels of vigor toward suspects encountered in neighborhoods with more serious crime problems may indicate the departments’ willingness to actively address neighborhood problems using various aggressive enforcement and problem-solving practices.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0011128712470348">
<label>11.</label>
<p>One of the reasons that Klinger’s theory has yet to be fully tested is because his theory is unclear on several fronts. For example, although Klinger’s piece (1997) did imply an interaction effect between district crime rates and seriousness, the theory can be interpreted and subsequently modeled by controlling for the level of seriousness in the police–citizen interaction because Klinger also posits that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>as the level of deviance in patrol district increases, the seriousness of the matters in which officers intervene increases . . . it is only after the seriousness of deviance in police-citizen encounters is held constant that police vigor in encounters with citizens decreases with increasing district deviance. (p. 296)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Still, in Klinger’s causal model of police behavior, the relationship between district crime and vigor is mediated by seriousness. Future study should further test these possible interaction and mediating effects proposed by Klinger.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0011128712470348">
<label>12.</label>
<p>As one reviewer pointed out, we used one form of police behavior (reporting behavior or district violent crime rate) to predict another form of police behavior (vigor). As one reviewer correctly pointed out, there is a limitation in using official crime data (the UCR data) to measure crime as the official data are related to and reflect police behaviors to a certain degree. Ideally, victimization surveys such as those used in the Police Services Study (PSS) in the late 1970s would yield a better measure of an area’s level of crime that is not confounded by police recording behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128712470348">Smith, 1986</xref>). Unfortunately, such data were not available for the present study. Nonetheless, we believe that the approach used in this study is appropriate as long as one form of police behavior can be conceptually and methodologically distinguished from the other. We believe that our dependent and independent variables are conceptually distinguishable. There was a slight overlap between the two, but it is acceptable because arrests are a rare event in our data.</p></fn>
