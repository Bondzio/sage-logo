<abstract>
<p><italic>Aim</italic>: In 2002, the Danish tax law was changed, giving employees a tax exemption on supplemental, employer-paid health insurance. This might have conflicted with one of the key foundations of the healthcare system, namely equal access for equal needs. The aim of this study was to investigate determinants for employer-paid health insurance coverage. Because the policy change affected only people who were part of the labour force and because the public sector at that time had no tradition of providing fringe benefits, the analysis was restricted to the private labour force. <italic>Method</italic>: The analysis was based on data from a range of Danish person-level and company-level registers (explanatory variables). These data were combined with information on insurance status obtained from the trade organisation for insurance (dependent variable). A logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds of having employer-paid health insurance coverage. <italic>Results</italic>: The individuals who were most likely to be insured were those employed in foreign companies as mid-level managers within the field of building and construction. Other important variables were the number of persons employed in a company, gender, ethnicity, region of residence, years of education, and annual income. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Both company and individual characteristics were found to be important and significant predictors for employer-paid health insurance coverage. The Danish tax exemption on private health insurance in the years 2002–12 thus seems to have led to inequality in employer-paid health insurance coverage.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Private health insurance is a growing market in Europe despite the fact that most countries have universal healthcare coverage paid through taxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813486966">1</xref>]. In the Scandinavian countries, tax-financed health care is mandatory, making private insurance a voluntary supplement. In this context, there are two main rationales for private health insurance. The first rationale is to cover the user-payment charged for some services provided in the primary healthcare sectors, such as massage, physiotherapy, and psychological therapy. The second is duplicate coverage for services provided free of charge in the public sector but which are associated with waiting time and/or expectations of lower service quality compared with privately provided services.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Danish Tax Assessment Act was changed, giving employees a tax exemption on health insurance provided by their employers, under it condition that insurance was offered to all employees in a company, according to weekly working hours and seniority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813486966">2</xref>]. Although the market for health insurance was almost non-existent before 2002, it quickly became significant, and by 2011, more than 1 million Danes had a supplementary health insurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813486966">3</xref>], of these some are part of collective trade union agreements. The fact that the tax exemption only addresses employed individuals seems to conflict with the objective of free and equal access to health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813486966">4</xref>] because individuals who are not active in the labour market cannot benefit from the policy. Furthermore, because the public sector in Denmark had no tradition of offering fringe benefits to employees, only individuals employed in the private labour market could actually benefit from the policy. Although the public debate has not considered these nuances of the target group, much has been written about the negative consequences of the Tax Assessment Act on equality induced by employer-paid health insurance, and the new government recently deactivated the policy. It has later been established that this policy effectively alleviates the pressure on public funds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813486966">5</xref>], but it is still uncertain whether the policy has contributed to inequality in employer-paid health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>The literature on the effect of incentivising private health insurance on inequality in access to care is emerging. A Norwegian study that examined the company characteristics of companies that obtained health insurance on behalf of their employees found that the probability of obtaining health insurance increased with the company’s economic level, the share of younger employees, and the employees’ educational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref>]. Another Norwegian study examined the characteristics of individuals with employer-paid health insurance and found that the probability of being covered by employer-paid insurance increased with high income, management positions, and private sector employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813486966">7</xref>]. A recent Danish study concluded that the existence of employer-paid health insurance was positively associated with company size, income, being a white-collar worker, private sector employment, and younger age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813486966">8</xref>]. From the UK two studies have been reported. Besley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813486966">9</xref>] conducted a study on private health insurance and waiting lists in the UK, and found a positive association between having an employer-paid health insurance, number of employees in the company, household income and level of education, being middle-aged, and male. King and Mossialos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813486966">10</xref>] later confirmed these results.</p>
<p>Although the literature thus contains five studies on employer-paid health insurance, it is important to point out that the policy contexts of the studies were different in relation to the tax incentives given. In Norway, the tax exemption was given to employees but employers could freely choose to offer the insurance to selected employees only. In Denmark, the tax exemption was also given to employees but only on the condition that all employees in a company were offered insurance. In the UK, the tax exemption was given to the company providing it. Furthermore, there are methodological differences between the studies relating to whether or not they included both person-level and company-level data, and whether or not they restricted the investigations to the population for which the exposure-outcome relationship could be assumed to have an effect. The main weakness of the literature, however, is that the populations were selected and that the studies suffered substantial non-response, which could have led to bias.</p>
<p>The present study is based on register data for the entire privately employed labour force in Denmark. Its contribution to the literature is thus to provide an assessment of possible negative consequences of incentivising private health insurance on equality in insurance coverage, which is free from selection and non-response bias. Furthermore, and this is also in contrast to the previous Danish study, the analysis is restricted to the private and full-time working part of the labour force. The aim of this study was to investigate determinants for employer-paid health insurance coverage in the private labour market in Denmark.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494813486966">
<title>Study design and population</title>
<p>The study was conducted as a controlled, cross-sectional study of all members of the private labour force in 2007. Various national registries were combined with ad hoc data on insurance status from a private registry, as described in the following sections.</p>
<p>The population was identified through the Database for Research in the Labour Market provided by Statistics Denmark. To be included in the study, an individual had to be between 18 and 65 years old and employed in the private labour market and had to have full-time unemployment insurance (<italic>N</italic>=1,573,334). The insurance status of an individual, which was provided by the Danish Insurance Association, defined whether an individual had private health insurance at some point during the year 2007. A large number of relevant covariates at the individual person level and at the company level were extracted from different national registries. These covariates refer to 2006, except historical use of hospital services which refer to an average of the years 2004<bold>–</bold>06.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813486966">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>For descriptive statistics the percentages and frequencies were analysed according to insurance status. The main analysis was based on logistic regression to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for being insured versus not being insured for person-level and company-level covariates. Relevant functional forms of the covariates were assessed prior to the analysis. Variables with a nonlinear relation to insurance status (e.g. age) were included in squared form to capture the effect of the nonlinearity. Variables that appeared to be highly skewed (e.g. income and use of hospital services) were log transformed and the data were assessed for missing data. The missing data was handled as follows; if a categorical variable had more than 1% missing values (education and company type), the missing values were categorised as “missing” and were included in the statistical analysis. If the categorical variable had less than 1% missing values (field of employment) or if a variable was included in its natural continuous form (annual income, percentage of blue-collar workers and number of employees) it was judged insignificant for this total population study, meaning that these cases were not part of the analysis.</p>
<p>Data analyses were conducted using Stata 12.0 on servers run by Statistics Denmark. The identities of individual study subjects were not revealed to the authors at any point. The project was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal number 2010-41-5556).</p>

<title>Population characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813486966">Table I</xref> shows the descriptive characteristics of the study population. In both the insured and uninsured groups, almost two-thirds of the population were males with a mean age of 41 years. A majority of the study population was employed as workers, had an occupational education and was an ethnic Dane. The mean annual income was DKK 311,111 before taxes, with the insured group earning approximately DKK 60,000 more than the uninsured group, on average. One-fifth of the workforce had an inpatient visit during the 3-year period between 2004 and 2006, and half of the workforce had an outpatient visit during the same period (equally distributed between the insured and uninsured).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813486966">Table II</xref> shows that, compared to the other variables in the study, field of employment and company type had the greatest impact on whether an individual was offered employer-paid health insurance. As displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813486966">Table I</xref>, building and construction contractors consisted of less than 1% of the total population, but this group was 7.16-times more likely to be offered insurance compared to the baseline group of teaching and health, with almost 5-times as many in the insured group compared to the uninsured group (in terms of percentages).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813486966">Table III</xref> shows that the individuals who were most likely to have had private employer-paid health insurance at some point in 2007 were being female with an official residence in Zealand, ethnic Danes, and employed as mid-level managers with an occupational education. The probability of being insured increased with annual income and increased up to a certain age, at which point it decreased. Regarding hospital services, there was a small tendency for individuals with at least one inpatient visit between 2004 and 2006 to be less likely to have insurance compared to those who had no inpatient visits during the same period. The opposite effect was found for outpatient services; individuals with at least one outpatient visit between 2004 and 2006 were more likely to be insured compared to individuals with no outpatient visits. However, this difference was very small.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that employer characteristics are the most important and significant determinants for employer-paid health insurance coverage in the context of a tax law, which incentivises employees to demand and/or employers to offer private health insurance as part of the salary scheme. The study was conducted after the tax policy change had been in effect for 5 years and thus could be assumed to be largely stable. The conditions of the tax policy to ensure that equal coverage was maintained within companies might have moderated the inequality between individuals employed within the same company but these results underline that inequality in access to employer-paid health insurance between individuals employed in different companies was present; this inequality was company-related as well as person-related.</p>
<p>Comparing the results with previous studies, a few notes on methodological differences are warranted. First, the previous studies were based on study populations of mixed public/private employment. Second, in the Norwegian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813486966">7</xref>] and the UK studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813486966">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813486966">10</xref>], the policies evaluated were not identical to the Danish case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813486966">8</xref>]. At the time of the studies, Denmark, Norway, and UK all had a tax exemption, but whereas the Danish tax exemption was conditioned by insurance to all employees in a company, the Norwegian companies were allowed to offer insurance to selected employees. In the UK, the tax exemption was given to the employer and not the employee as was the case in Denmark.</p>
<p>The present findings support those of three previous studies in relation to the overall importance of company characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813486966"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813486966">8</xref>]. It is not surprising that company type seems to have such a significant influence on whether a company offers insurance. If information on the country in which a company had its headquarters had been available, it would in all probability have shown that companies that offer insurance are more likely to have their headquarters in countries where employer-paid health insurance is the primary form of payment for healthcare services, such as the USA. The finding that independent institutions were the least likely to offer insurance may be due to the fact that public services are outsourced and are financed through public taxes, which makes it almost impossible to offer fringe benefits to employees. Also the positive relation between number of employees in a company and access to private health insurance confirms findings of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813486966">8</xref>]. Large companies’ tendency to offer health insurance as a fringe benefit may be due to the fact that large companies, in general, pay less per covered employee because the risk is shared by many individuals.</p>
<p>This study differs from previous studies in that the individuals most likely to be offered insurance were females; Kiil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813486966">8</xref>] found gender to be insignificant while Seim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref>], Besley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813486966">9</xref>], and King and Mossialos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813486966">10</xref>] found males to have a higher likelihood of having private insurance. Also with respect to the role of education the evidence is mixed. Seim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref>], Besley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813486966">9</xref>], and King and Mossialos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813486966">10</xref>] found that higher educational was associated with having private insurance whereas Grepperud and Iversen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813486966">7</xref>] and Kiil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813486966">8</xref>] found no significant relationship between the two variables. Furthermore, this study showed a bimodal role of education with higher education and a minimum of education being negatively associated with private insurance whereas high school degree, occupational education, and higher education of less than 3 years of duration were positively associated with private insurance. The mixed evidence may be due to the study design but is most likely also due to structural and cultural differences between the three countries, such as the typical educational profile of employees in specific industries or types of companies.</p>
<p>A note on potential endogeneity in the model is warranted. First, the explanatory variables for in- and outpatient use (measured in 2004<bold>–</bold>06) refer to use of public hospitals only. If individuals had a high service use due to private insurance coverage it would most likely be for use of private hospitals. Second, insurance coverage was measured at a later point in time than explanatory variables of hospital use: i.e. the individual would have to have had private insurance before the years 2004<bold>–</bold>06 in order for this to affect hospital use. Unfortunately, there are no Danish data available for private health insurance coverage before year 2007 but from the national statistics we can see that the number of insured was very limited. As a simple test we have excluded the historical years 2005<bold>–</bold>06 from the model and it had no significant influence on the results. For these reasons, we do not consider endogeneity a major problem for the estimation of the results.</p>
<p>The effects of the Tax Assessment Act on equity in access to health care has been much debated in the public media and it has been claimed that private insurance is a fringe benefit for selected groups. This is obviously the case for individuals who are not members of the (private) labour force, given that the tax exemption was given to employer-paid insurance only. Regarding individuals who are members of the private labour force we identified a long list of significant determinants for having private insurance. If these individuals are not in greater need than those without private insurance, the objective about equal access for equal needs (horizontal equality) that our healthcare system is founded upon is violated. It should, however, be noted that inference from the present results of “determinants for insurance coverage” to “horizontal inequality” requires that adjustment has been made for individual need/health status. We included proxies for health status (historical use of hospital services) in our model in an attempt to control for need but the extent to which this is sufficient could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The present findings may be the result of political decisions to reduce public spending on health care by encouraging employers to take more responsibility. When the left-wing government took over from the right-wing government, the Tax Assessment Act was changed so that employees again had to pay taxes on their employer-paid health insurance. This change also deactivated the condition of the tax exemption (all employees in a company had to be offered insurance for the exemption to take effect), meaning that companies could again offer insurance selectively to their most valuable employees. This situation was seen in Seim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813486966">6</xref>], in which only 39% of the companies offered insurance to all employees and 61% of companies offered insurance to key employees only.</p>
<sec id="section9-1403494813486966">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are three main limitations to this study. The first limitation concerns the design of the study. Because this study used a cross-sectional design, it was not possible to identify a causal relationship between exposure and outcome. That is, the population characteristics cannot be held directly responsible for inequality because this inequality may have existed before the Tax Assessment Act or may have causes other than the Act. Second, the study is limited to people employed in the private labour market in Denmark. The third limitation involves the explanatory degree of the model: the model only explains approximately 10% of the variation in the data, leaving 90% to be explained by factors outside the study. The unexplained variation may be due to “soft” factors, such as company culture. The inclusion of these factors may have strengthened the results on both the company level and the individual employee level.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that company and individual characteristics are important and significant predictors of employer-paid health insurance coverage. However, whether this means that the use of tax incentives for increasing the number of individuals with supplemental, private health insurance leads to horizontal inequality remains inconclusive. To infer from inequality in insurance coverage to horizontal inequality requires full adjustment for health status and this is associated with methodological challenges that are difficult to overcome. First, it can be difficult to obtain data on the true need of individuals and second, it requires repeated measurements of insurance status, which are not available in any national register.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Danish tax exemption on employer-paid health insurance in the years 2002<bold>–</bold>12 seems to have led to inequality in employer-paid health insurance coverage whereas it remains uncertain whether this translates into unequal access to health care for equal needs.</p>
