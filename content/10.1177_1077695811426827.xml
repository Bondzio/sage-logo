<abstract>
<p>A former whites-only South African university’s journalism department employs a dual-medium language policy in which Afrikaans and English alternate in classrooms, and students may use either. Admissions processes include a test of linguistic ability (general/cultural knowledge and writing skills). Citing Bourdieu, this article disputes the validity of the test’s score as an indication of a student’s linguistic ability (part of his/her “cultural capital”); in fact, students’ biographical profile form part of their “habitus.” First, levels and composition of cultural capital of different “racial” groups of students show how the way the test determines linguistic ability structures student performances. Second, statistical findings are discussed with reference to the profile and assessments practices of department staff members. Such practical changes could improve selection of black students, but this article also suggests reconsidering the dual-medium language policy.</p>

<body>
<p>Post-apartheid journalism education and training in South Africa is arguably strongly influenced by developments in the education system in general. Since the 1990s, when democratization started, various challenges to education reform have been posed by amongst others a legacy of endemic poverty and historically inferior education facilities for black people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695811426827">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mainly black, are reportedly still struggling to gain entrance into some recognized first-class (formerly white) institutions. Furthermore, once they are accepted, many black students find progress through the system difficult due to structural, financial, social, and cultural constraints. Regular outbreaks of violence at some university campuses in protest against “lack of transformation” are symptomatic of the crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695811426827">2</xref></sup> At the same time, critics increasingly agree that mismanagement of the education system by the African National Congress (ANC)–led government since 1994 must be added to the list of explanations for the continued underperformance of black pupils and students. The government, in turn, has criticized some former whites-only universities for their inability to attract and successfully graduate increasing numbers of black students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695811426827">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>After 1994, a deliberate project of “nation-building” was launched by the ANC-led government coalition to address the legacy of apartheid with regards to the inequality of black people and their relatively low numbers on especially higher levels in the public and private sector. This led, amongst others, to government policies of “positive discrimination” such as Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and preferential status for black people in the job market, in areas such as education and training, and in sport (in the form of “race” quotas for teams).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695811426827">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tertiary education sector was restructured<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695811426827">5</xref></sup>—mainly by combining universities and technicons—in order to break down the class, language, and cultural barriers created by centuries of discrimination during British colonialism and apartheid. All tertiary institutions came under pressure to “transform” in order to reflect the demographics of the “nation” as a whole—for example, the predominance of black people—but especially Afrikaans universities, such as Stellenbosch University (SU), University of Pretoria, University of the Free State, Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Hoër Onderwys, and the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit in Johannesburg, bore the ideological brunt because of their close historic ties with Afrikaner nationalism and the ruling National Party (NP) during apartheid.</p>
<p>All these institutions, some of which also experienced a name change, had to increase their efforts to enroll black (and so-called “coloured” and Indian) students. Because of the emergence of English as <italic>lingua franca</italic> amongst the South African elite and mass media, and the negative association between Afrikaans and the oppressive mechanisms of apartheid, these traditional Afrikaans institutions also had to scale down the dominance of Afrikaans as main medium of instruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695811426827">6</xref></sup> Different models, from parallel medium (different courses in Afrikaans and English) to dual medium (both languages alternating in the same course), were proposed and tried out in practice at one stage or another at the traditional Afrikaans universities (although not at the traditionally English institutions, which carried on as before in terms of their main language of instruction).</p>
<p>At SU, a bastion for Afrikaner nationalism before and during apartheid, the issue of language of instruction caused bitter debates internally and in the news media, which eventually led to the resignation of the rector at the time, Chris Brink.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695811426827">7</xref></sup> But even then conflict continued at SU and in the news media because some proponents of Afrikaans—pointing to trends in other education sectors—argued that “transformation” policies will inevitably lead to the demise of Afrikaans. In turn, those in favor of “inclusivity” and a change in the “institutional culture” of SU through the introduction of more black people as members of staff, administrative personnel, and students, argue that Afrikaans is being used as a tool of racist exclusion by “reactionary Afrikaner right-wingers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695811426827">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>But some efforts to transform the education system mentioned above are reportedly also now paying off. According to Dell, data released by the South African Institute for Race Relations (SAIRR) reflected a “four-fold increase in the number of black African graduates from South African universities since 1991,” and this finding “has been hailed as an indication of a successfully transforming higher education sector.” A January 18, 2011 SAIRR press release stated, “this was evidence that transformation of the higher education sector was well under way.” Dell (2011) continued,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>According to data from the SAIRR’s latest <italic>South African Survey</italic> published this month, 8,514 black Africans—excluding coloureds (people of mixed race) and Indians—were awarded degrees in 1991. In 2008 that figure had rocketed to 36,970, representing an increase of 334%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695811426827">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The SAIRR (2011) press release states that “in 1991 some 2,347 coloured people had been awarded degrees. This went up to 5,286 in 2008, an increase of 125%. In 1991, some 2,333 Indians had been awarded degrees. This went up to 6,857 in 2008, an increase of 194%. In 1991 some 27,619 whites had been awarded degrees. This went up to 31,527 by 2008, an increase of only 14%.”</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that the proportions of black versus white graduates is still not reflective of the black majority profile of the overall population, the SAIRR facts also point to continued structural inequality in the system. Wrote Dell,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Significantly, the SAIRR data, which was sourced from the Department of Higher Education and Training, also shows that the universities accounting for the majority of degree awards in South Africa in 2008 are all former whites-only institutions. Eight universities out of a total of 23 institutions accounted for nearly two-thirds of all degrees awarded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695811426827">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Are critics of former whites-only universities thus wrong in accusing them of lack of transformation? In some cases, arguably so, but as the South African Survey (2010) indicated, SU is seemingly still struggling seriously to change its apartheid image. SU is still graduating fewer black, “coloured,” and Indian students together than white students. For example, in 2008, SU graduated 5,136 students (bachelor’s, honors, master’s, and higher degrees). Of those, only 478 were African, 601 “coloured,” and 76 Indian, while 3,981 were white.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695811426827">11</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1077695811426827">
<title>Journalism Education and Training at Stellenbosch University</title>
<p>In the development of apartheid, SU played a central role in the communication of the ideology of (white) Afrikaner supremacy to a national constituency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695811426827">12</xref></sup> Since 1994, SU has accepted the call for “transformation” from government as a key challenge and is regarded as one of South Africa’s more affluent and respected universities in terms of its facilities, programs, and the quality and quantity of graduate and research output.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695811426827">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although SU in general is still struggling to attract large numbers of black students (see discussion above), the journalism department has been relatively more successful. Data collected for this article<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695811426827">14</xref></sup> indicate that, from 1999 to 2009, about a third of journalism graduates were black (including so-called “coloureds” and Indians). Although this may not be regarded as a major example of transformation, it still represents a marginally better proportion of white to black graduated students than for SU as a whole.</p>
<p>SU holds the dubious honor that its postgraduate journalism department was founded in the heyday of apartheid in 1978 by Piet Cillié, a staunch supporter of the ruling NP and former editor of the newspaper <italic>Die Burger</italic> (the official “mouthpiece” of the NP in the Cape Province during apartheid). In line with apartheid policy, SU journalism classes were overwhelmingly composed of white students until late in the 1980s. According to Dell, apartheid legislation of 1959, which restricted the admission of black students to white institutions, was formally repealed in 1988.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695811426827">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the department under Cillié did not concentrate exclusively on Afrikaans language journalism, arguably a reflection of the delicate power balance between white Afrikaner and English communities when the Union (1990) and subsequently Republic (1991) of South Africa was established. Both Afrikaans and English were recognized as the only official state languages until 1994, when nine indigenous African languages were added to the list.</p>
<p>Thus, since its inception the SU journalism department cultivated links with English media practitioners and owners and selected a fair percentage of English first- language speakers to hone their skills in the year-long honors degree course. Over the years this practice developed into an official dual-medium language policy, and BPhil students thus have the option to choose between Afrikaans and English to communicate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695811426827">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Black (ethnic African) students often acquire English as a second or even third language, while Afrikaans is arguably in decline among black Africans in primary and secondary schools since the end of so-called Bantu education that characterized apartheid inequality in education. The important point is that a dual-medium language policy at university level requires a measure of competence in both languages, even if one is then allowed to choose one of them as medium of communication.</p>
<p>Although the dual medium policy of SU calls for the equal treatment of Afrikaans and English in departments such as journalism, critics often point to examples in which English dominates in practice—for the simple reason that many black students cannot understand even basic Afrikaans. In addition, pressure to appoint black staff members to SU can also lead to a practical disregard for the language policy.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2007, the first full-time black African lecturer, Simphiwe Sesanti, was appointed by SU’s journalism department. He is fluent in English and Xhosa, but not in Afrikaans, and thus is able to teach only in English.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695811426827">17</xref></sup> One can therefore argue that transformation targets (i.e., increasing the component of blacks as staff members and students) may sometimes in practice override the dual-medium language policy of departments such as journalism—with implications for the teaching and assessment of Afrikaans language students.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the continued dominance of Afrikaans and (white) Afrikaners as lecturers at SU arguably also has implications for students communicating in English. The basic premise is that all Afrikaans lecturers are competently bilingual, but it is reasonable to assume that their linguistic abilities in English will be weaker. As was indicated above, black students are part of the English component at SU journalism and may, thus, be disadvantaged in this regard.</p>
<p>But at the same time, one must guard against the misleading view that all Afrikaans students at SU are white and that Afrikaans is indeed a “white man’s language,” as C.J. Langenhoven, a prominent Afrikaans intellectual, proclaimed decades ago. Afrikaner nationalism appropriated Afrikaans from its millions of “coloured” speakers and stigmatized nonstandard variants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695811426827">18</xref></sup> As part of post-apartheid restructuring, marginalized, so-called “coloured” users of Afrikaans are part of the growing black component of journalism classes at SU since the late 1980s. Yet, so-called “coloured” students at SU still must cope with the standard variant of Afrikaans employed at SU.</p>
<p>Most important, however, is the fact that the language profile of the journalism department at SU has not changed since 1994. Besides a failed attempt to introduce indigenous African language journalism as a submodule after 2000,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695811426827">19</xref></sup> the statuses of Afrikaans and English are unaffected.</p>
<p>Both could be considered media of empowerment and exclusion under certain conditions, while their historic combination in SU’s journalism department provides a particular dynamic in post-apartheid South African journalism education and training. The aim of this article is investigating the implicit and often unexamined relations of power around the dual-medium language policy of the SU journalism department under various and often divergent pressures.</p>

<title>Pressures on Journalism Educators and Trainers in South Africa</title>
<p>Besides the explicit aim of former whites-only South African universities to transform demographically, both government and the journalism industry frequently call for more, better-trained black journalists. Although drastic mass media restructuring has occurred since 1994, especially the large commercial print media industry is still largely owned and controlled by white shareholders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695811426827">20</xref></sup> It is argued that the content of the mainstream print media is still largely reflective of middle-class and mainly white interests and therefore often exclude the views of the majority of poor black citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695811426827">21</xref></sup> The dramatic popular rise of tabloid newspapers aimed at poor black communities since 2000 has arguably altered the picture somewhat,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695811426827">22</xref></sup> but opinion leaders in government, the ruling party alliance, and the news media industry are still demanding better access and more opportunities for black journalists on all levels.</p>
<p>It can be argued that if more black students are able to access journalism education and training, more might find their ways into newsrooms and, eventually, boardrooms. Although one could state, in return, that demographically representative newsrooms alone will not automatically ensure access to marginalized voices, the counter-argument is that fair representation in the news media will probably be even harder in an environment characterized by a lack of staff and ownership diversity.</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, the industry has expressed dissatisfaction with tertiary journalism education and training institutions, including SU,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695811426827">23</xref></sup> for not producing students with skills levels that meet their requirements. Industry reports and academic research<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695811426827">24</xref></sup> have indicated for a number of years that newsrooms are struggling to cope due to trends such as the “juniorization” of editorial staff and lack of basic skills (in writing and editing) and knowledge (of history, culture, science, mathematics, and society in general).</p>
<p>In terms of key cultural studies concepts coined by Bourdieu,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695811426827">25</xref></sup> one could argue that many South African journalists suffer from a lack of “cultural capital” (knowledge and skills). Journalists are therefore unable to compete successfully for a dominant, recognized position (symbolic and social capital) and financial gain (economic capital) in the “field” of cultural production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695811426827">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whatever the theoretical explanation, the practical consensus is that journalism is facing profound challenges on different levels. As a result, three of the biggest media houses, Naspers (Media24), Avusa, and Independent Newspapers, announced the formation of their own training academies in the past few years. In a move seen by some academic observers as a direct insult, the focus of recruitment of these industry academies included graduates from leading postgraduate institutions who were told that they were not “ready” for the job market yet and that they needed at least another year of industry training.</p>
<p>The dilemma for journalism educators and trainers at SU is thus that they must provide more and better black journalists to the industry while black students are still not entering the institution in large numbers after more than fifteen years of democracy. The influence of the dual-medium language policy of the journalism department on the performance of black students in selection processes are at issue in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077695811426827">
<title>Cultural Capital, Language, and Power</title>
<p>Bourdieu<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695811426827">27</xref></sup> argued that cultural capital is one tool of “distinction” used by the powerful elite to maintain the hierarchical structure of society. Bourdieu viewed cultural capital as the result of socialization and education and training at home and at school/university. The historical trajectory that describes a particular agent’s path of cultural socialization is called the “habitus” by Bourdieu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695811426827">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this hierarchical description of society implies a structural rigidity to Bourdieu’s social analysis, which he has denied,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695811426827">29</xref></sup> Botma<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695811426827">30</xref></sup> argued that the concept of cultural capital can be useful to describe phases of transitions in “postliberation” societies such as South Africa. In this context, cultural capital then refers to the dominant culture maintaining apartheid hegemony, its lingering legacy in the new democratic dispensation, and oppositional/alternative culture during apartheid, which then became part of the dominant culture after liberation.</p>
<p>The argument, then, is that black South Africans were disadvantaged in terms of cultural capital during apartheid. Therefore, the fight against apartheid was also waged on a cultural level,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695811426827">31</xref></sup> and the defeat of apartheid was also a process by which the nature of the perceived Eurocentric, Afrikaner-dominated official and public cultural capital was challenged and subjected to strategies of change.</p>
<p>At universities such as SU, however, one could argue that some remainders of apartheid cultural capital are still operational because of the dominance of institutional Afrikaans/Afrikaner habitus. In theory, thus, black and English South Africans might still lack the required cultural capital to gain access to the institution. This article aims to analyze and describe the cultural capital and habitus of a group of applicants to examine the relationship between language and culture in selection processes at the SU journalism department.</p>
<p>Bourdieu<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695811426827">32</xref></sup> describes the relationship between culture, especially language, and power. In short: according to Bourdieu, different speakers compete on a particular language market (“field”) for the best positions and the rewards on offer (“capital” in various forms) in terms of the specific logic of that field. The central point here is that the ability to compete in a specific field is acquired over time through a process of socialization and education and is incorporated by individual agents as their “habitus”—a constructed mode of being at a particular time in a particular space.</p>
<p>In terms of language, this would mean that an agent competing in his second or even third language—like some black applicants at South African universities—would be at a structural disadvantage against competitors who are able to use their first language. Furthermore, the process through which one language is elevated above others as the “currency” of a particular language market, is described by Bourdieu<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695811426827">33</xref></sup> as symbolic power, and the negative effects of that type of power he names symbolic violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695811426827">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the field of South African education, one could argue that various indigenous languages have been the victims of symbolic violence during colonization and apartheid, while English and Afrikaans were privileged. Since Afrikaans lost its direct political protection when the NP was defeated in 1994, this language has now also felt the impact of symbolic violence as it was relegated to a lower position on the educational language market. But as was argued above, although English has gained ground, Afrikaans is still very much entrenched at SU and is arguably a strong currency for the conversion of cultural capital into power (the ability to gain entrance and pass the course). By the same token, because of the dual-medium language policy of SU’s journalism department, English first-language speakers can harness the same power on the language market to gain entrance. It then also follows that second-language students in both Afrikaans and English—mainly black and so-called “coloured” students—could be at a disadvantage. Again, the aim of this article is examining relations of power implicit in the dual-medium language policy in the SU’s journalism department.</p>
<p>Of course, linguistic ability in journalism entails much more than writing skills. On audiovisual platforms, for instance, different skills are needed to communicate than in print. But because a written test for all applicants forms the backbone of the SU selection process, writing skills are regarded as a central part of linguistic ability in this article. It is not the only part, though, because the selection test also includes a section on so-called general knowledge (“Frame of Reference”). But in terms of Bourdieu’s view on language, culture, and power, one would have to conclude that knowledge is not general or neutral; it is the result of specific struggles in different linguistic fields/markets as part of education processes since childhood. The cultural capital (linguistic ability) required to enter the SU journalism department is therefore composed of writing skills and cultural (“general”) knowledge. Thus, it would be a mistake to view linguistic ability in this study as technical writing skills alone. In others words, to measure the linguistic ability of a particular student, the cultural context (field) in which knowledge is acquired must also be considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077695811426827">
<title>Selection at the Journalism Department of SU</title>
<p>Vocational BPhil (honors level) journalism education and training classes at SU average twenty-five students per year. As the sole postgraduate-only and (in part) Afrikaans journalism school in South Africa, SU enjoys a high standing in the industry and the field of journalism education and training (it was rated in 2006 as one of twelve “potential centers of excellence” in Africa by UNESCO<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695811426827">35</xref></sup>). The BPhil course draws about 150 applications from across South Africa each year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695811426827">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>As was indicated above, aspirant students have to complete a written test assessing their “general” knowledge and writing skills. In terms of the theoretical framework of this study the selection test therefore measures the linguistic ability (cultural/“general” knowledge and writing skills) of an applicant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695811426827">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>An individual test score can be accepted as an indication of the level of cultural capital that a particular student has already achieved and incorporated (as part of the formation of the habitus) in the course of his or her training at home, schools, and university (bearing in mind that SU only takes in postgraduates who have successfully completed at least three years’ university education). By analyzing the test score results in terms of “race”/ethnicity, the relations between linguistic ability and the specific habitus of students will become clearer.</p>
<p>The standard BPhil selection test comprises two sections, Frame of Reference (“general”/cultural knowledge) and Journalism Aptitude (writing skills), each of which is marked out of one hundred. Students get three hours to complete the test. Section A on Frame of Reference involves a variety of “general” knowledge and history questions. The argument here is not that every single question of the selection test is culturally biased against most black students. It is clear from the inclusion of a number of overt Afrocentric questions that some care is probably deliberately taken to minimize the “Western” or “Eurocentric” bias in the “general” knowledge section.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695811426827">38</xref></sup> But arguably because these tests have been devised in the main by white and Afrikaans-speaking members of staff over at least a decade, some bias against ethnic Africans remains in terms of the cultural knowledge required.</p>
<p>In general, for instance, questions often refer to Western (rather than African) history and high art and to specifically American examples to test current affairs and popular art knowledge. Problematic localized questions are those posed on minority sporting codes among blacks, such as cricket and rugby, for instance about Kevin Pietersen (who left South Africa to play cricket for England) in the 2008 test. In 2004, students were also asked to identify a picture of the South African rugby team coach, Jake White. Rugby and cricket are hugely popular among whites, especially Afrikaners, but a small minority interest among blacks.</p>
<p>In 2008, students had to identify the writers of a list of at least ten works of literature. Only two were South African (one English and one Afrikaans), while the rest were international (Western and South American) books such as <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic>, <italic>Animal Farm</italic>, <italic>White Fang</italic>, <italic>One Hundred Years of Solitude</italic>, and <italic>The Da Vinci Code</italic>. This section arguably provides the clearest indication of a cultural bias—directly related to literacy—in the SU journalism selection test. In other words, because reading can be regarded as the cornerstone of linguistic ability (cultural capital) in education, this particular selection of a canon of literature in the test shows its Western cultural orientation clearly. Furthermore, even two South African works in the 2008 test were by white authors.</p>
<p>Section B on Journalism Aptitude includes the following: a brief description—in full sentences—of five important news events of a particular calendar year; an assignment to pose five coherent and insightful interview questions to a certain person in the news selected from a list; a motivated ethical response to a practical newsroom dilemma, such as a choice between two visually disturbing news photographs; questions on the candidate’s view of the responsibilities of young journalists; a spelling test; and an assignment to compile a complete news report from fragments of information provided.</p>
<p>The nature of some questions on ethics and the interpretation of news events above indicate that cultural background will also influence responses in a section designed in the main to gauge the writing skills of applicants. In other words, views on ethics and the importance of certain events for a particular community will be influenced by a student’s own cultural positioning. But still, section B provides an opportunity to showcase technical writing skills, something section A on “general” knowledge does not do.</p>
<p>Finally, aiding in the research process is the biographical section of the selection test, in which students were asked to provide information such as “race,” gender, school symbol, highest academic qualification and at which institution it was obtained, language of study, whether they applied for financial assistance, and why.</p>
<p>Because of ethical considerations regarding the potential misuse of personal information of students, the researcher applied for and obtained clearance from the Ethical Committee of the Research Committee at SU. Clearance was given on the provision that no students could be identified in or be identifiable from the research and that participants should grant informed consent. Documentation obtained for research purposes must also be stored under lock and key. Applicants were thus informed that the information could be used as part of a research project and were asked to complete an informed consent form before completing the biographical section in the selection test.</p>

<title>Quantitative Research Findings</title>
<p>In this article, the concepts of cultural capital and habitus of Bourdieu provide a basis to investigate the influence of SU’s dual-medium language instruction policy on the selection of students at the journalism department. The performance of students in the selection test is here regarded as a measure of their cultural capital in the context of journalism, in other words, their linguistic ability, composed of cultural knowledge and writing skills. The different racial/ethnic profiles of students in terms of both apartheid discriminatory and post-apartheid empowerment policies are regarded here as their habitus.</p>
<p>Two main phases of quantitative research, using statistical analysis, were employed<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695811426827">39</xref></sup> with two aims. First, the relationship between the levels of cultural capital and habitus of different students was measured; and second, the linguistic abilities of different “race” groups of students were analyzed in terms of the relationship between “general”/cultural knowledge and writing skills.</p>
<p>All students who completed the selection test from the years 2008 to 2010 were included in the statistical analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 323). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed between application test score (outcome) and the following predictors: school symbol, race, gender, university’s previous language orientation, field of study, test completion language, and previous university.</p>
<p>The following predictable finding—in terms of the legacy of apartheid—thus emerges: among a host of possible variables, race remains the dominant determining factor in predicting the performance of students in the SU selection test for journalism. In short: a black student will score 15 percent less than a white student in the selection test. “Coloured” applicants will tend to do 6 percent worse than white applicants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077695811426827">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in terms of the focus on language, a key finding was that compared to students who completed the selection test in Afrikaans, English students will tend to score 8 percent higher if all other predictors in the model are held constant. In an Afrikaans-dominated environment, one could have expected English students to be at a disadvantage. Along with the “race” factor, the situation, in short, is that students who are white and English will perform better than other groups in the selection test. These issues will be addressed in more detail in the qualitative discussion below.</p>
<p>Second, the purpose was to determine in which section of the selection test students struggle the most in terms of their racial profile. As was indicated above, Frame of Reference measures levels of cultural/“general” knowledge, while Journalism Aptitude is a strong indicator of writing skills. The argument is that both these elements are present in the linguistic ability of students. In other words, the ability to compete on a linguistic market, as Bourdieu argues, is influenced by both your cultural knowledge and the ability to communicate that knowledge (verbally and also in writing, as is the case here).</p>
<p>To compare the constitution of the linguistic ability of different “races,” the analysis first focused on different mean scores in terms of both the Frame of Reference score and the Journalism Aptitude score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077695811426827">Figure 1</xref>) and, second, on the differences between the mean Journalism Aptitude score and the mean Frame of Reference score for each “race” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695811426827">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>As can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077695811426827">Figure 1</xref>), students overall tend to do worse in the Frame of Reference section of the selection test than in Journalism Aptitude. Put otherwise, a lack of “general”/cultural knowledge is the biggest hindrance to selection at SU. While this finding may, on one level, support the universal view that a younger generation of students lacks basic knowledge about history and current affairs, the article complicates the issue in terms of “race” and language. In other words, while black and “coloured” students are able to compete well with white students in Journalism Aptitude (writing skills), they fall far behind in Frame of Reference (cultural knowledge). On average, the magnitude of the difference between Journalism Aptitude score and Frame of Reference score for “coloured” and black students is much larger (see column labeled “effect size” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695811426827">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The results thus show that race plays a larger role in students’ performance in the Frame of Reference section if compared to their performance in the Journalism Aptitude section, pointing superficially to a need for improvement in black and “coloured” students’ “general” knowledge. Or, as the discussion below will indicate, it could also illustrate the cultural bias of the selection test and a failure to recognize the role of language in the formation of cultural knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077695811426827">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bourdieu’s theory of cultural capital and habitus can be applied to explain the very real crisis in post-apartheid journalism and training at a prominent South African university.</p>
<p>As can be predicated, black and “coloured” students clearly still find it more difficult than white students to access postgraduate journalism at SU because of their disadvantaged habitus—even fifteen years after democratization. However, what this study makes clear is that in terms of linguistic ability, black (including “coloured”) students are most lacking in cultural knowledge (Frame of Reference) when compared to white applicants to the BPhil course at SU.</p>
<p>It would seem, however, that in terms of writing skills (Journalism Aptitude), the differences between the “races” are smaller. Thus, seemingly contrary to what Bourdieu’s field theory on the relationship between language and power would seem to suggest, the language policy of SU—or more precisely at the journalism department—does not seem to disadvantage black applicants or play a major role in the performance of selected students in the course. In fact, it would seem that students writing in English generally do better in the selection test. This finding would thus seemingly support a controversial call for the extension of English, even to the detriment of Afrikaans, at SU.</p>
<p>One should, however, take care and consider this finding in more detail. First, the argument was already presented above that Journalism Aptitude, the writing section of the selection test, forms only part of linguistic ability. In other words, although black students are seemingly not that far behind white students in terms of writing skills, their disadvantage in linguistic ability is more accurately reflected in poor marks in the Frame of Reference section.</p>
<p>One problem in the SU selection test may be this artificial separation between cultural knowledge and technical writing skills. The official 2011 course outline of the department seems to show that this trend is maintained in program design in, for instance, a clear separation between subjects such as Journalism Practice (news and article writing) and Cultural Literacy (including a submodule on African Culture). The question thus arises whether an integration of cultural knowledge (Frame of Reference) and writing skills (Journalism Aptitude), both in selection and teaching, might not be more productive and a more accurate indicator of linguistic ability in a post-apartheid South African context.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that students writing in English generally do better in the selection test can point to other flaws in selection processes at the department. The majority of permanent staff members involved in marking selection tests remain Afrikaans first language speakers. All Afrikaans first-language lecturers were also long-serving practicing journalists before they joined SU. It is thus likely that their Afrikaans editing abilities are well developed and (much?) better developed than their linguistic skills in English. Because much assessment of the Journalistic Aptitude section is based on interpretation, and Afrikaans assessors would probably then also pick up language errors in that language more easily, it is thus possible that students writing in English are advantaged to a degree. It could, in other words, be a case of “reverse discrimination,” in that those marking the test might arguably be more knowledgeable about Afrikaans, and might therefore be stricter when evaluating the language ability of Afrikaans applicants. Furthermore, because selection test papers are distributed among three to four faculty members for marking, inconsistency between the interpretations of individuals also becomes a factor.</p>
<p>It would thus seem that in terms of the assessment of selection test papers, the SU journalism department should reconsider its practices to increase the reliability of results. This is not to say that results are necessarily currently totally unreliable. As was indicated by the statistical analysis, black students perform worse than white students on the whole (in line with the legacy of apartheid inequality in education). Black English students are thus clearly not advantaged significantly by a perceived lack of English language skills of their lecturers. Furthermore, any advantage would probably be cancelled out a few times over by the fact that black students are clearly heavily penalized for not sharing the cultural knowledge valued by the department.</p>
<p>In fact, considering the statistical findings, it is clear that many black students probably fail to achieve selection because of a very poor score in the Frame of Reference (“general”/cultural knowledge) section. To be fair, because the majority of applicants are white and most of them also do not get selected, one can assume that many white students also fail because of poor “general” knowledge and/or writing ability. But the point is that the large discrepancy between the results for writing ability and cultural knowledge of black applicants in general deserves attention—especially when an explicit goal exists to select and graduate black students with journalistic talents.</p>
<p>Still, although English at SU journalism is used by both first- and second/third-language users from different “race”/ethnic backgrounds, members of this “handicapped” group (in terms of habitus in an Afrikaans dominant environment) still managed to outperform their Afrikaans counterparts, who use only their first/home language in the selection test. As mentioned above, some possible reasons for this finding can been located in the staff profile and assessment practices at the department, but that is most likely not the complete picture.</p>
<p>For example, black applicants to SU may already be a part of a small group of top-performing students with more than average cultural and financial capital. It is possible that they went to good English-language schools before completing three years of university studies in that language. Another factor may be that the general performance of white English applicants is of such a high standard that it cancels out some negative effects of the performance of black students writing in English. As a group, black students still perform badly, while SU seems to be an environment in which white English speakers prosper.</p>
<p>This result could be another worrying sign regarding the standard and future availability of Afrikaans on a tertiary level. Many white and so-called “coloured” Afrikaans first-language speakers increasingly prefer English as their study language and therefore complete the selection test in English. Code switching between Afrikaans and English has also become common for these students, even between different sections in the same selection test.</p>
<p>But because of a need at Afrikaans-owned news media companies for transformation, financial grants at SU are often awarded to “coloured” students to study journalism in Afrikaans—even if they would have preferred to use English. High-level transformation pressures (encoded in the financial aid agreements) are therefore influential in basically instructing “coloured” students to write in Afrikaans at SU if they want financial assistance. Because many “coloured” students are economically disadvantaged, their options in this regard are very limited.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the indication that Afrikaans “coloured” students perform the worst at SU in terms of linguistic ability is particularly worrying. One must ask whether so-called “coloured” students are being set up for failure, both at SU and in Afrikaans journalism. It arguably also places a burden on SU to both select and graduate students with limited abilities in their field of study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077695811426827">
<title>Conclusion and Suggestions</title>
<p>The general statistical finding above thus supports the application of Bourdieu’s theory to these phenomena—in other words, that black students would be disadvantaged by the dual-medium language policy of SU. Although black students, writing in English, compete well with white students in technical writing skills, they are disadvantaged in terms of general/cultural knowledge. Furthermore, selection test results must be interpreted in the greater sociopolitical context of language at SU, such as, for instance, the fact that black applicants to and participants in the course are always by far in the minority (at most about a third of the population). There is also the often-expressed perception that the institutional culture of SU is still not welcoming of non-Afrikaans (and black) students.</p>
<p>White students are advantaged by a structure in which linguistic ability is superficially divided between cultural knowledge and writing skills, even if both are always implicated in particular journalistic practice. In other words, cultural knowledge is viewed as neutral by the SU journalism department. Thus, according to SU journalism, bearers of a particular low level of cultural knowledge are deemed less able to become journalists, even when they display a reasonable skills level in writing (often in their second language, in the case of black Africans).</p>
<p>Afrikaans first-language “coloured” speakers are probably also disadvantaged by the fact that their particular variant(s) and dialects of Afrikaans remain discredited in the education mainstream. Current practices around the allocation and administration of bursaries arguably also adds to their exclusion. So-called “coloured” students studying in English seemingly do better, but their access is restricted by a lack of financial assistance (no Afrikaans, no monetary grants).</p>
<p>However, in the context of discourses of Africanization in South Africa, rightly or wrongly, the main focus is not on so-called “coloured” students but on increasing the number of ethnic black African students at SU. It is clear that efforts to further “Africanize” the department will first have to look at the department’s language policy.</p>
<p>Many arguments are put forward by Rabe<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077695811426827">41</xref></sup> and others to explain why the combination of Afrikaans and English, and the purposeful inclusion of members of other “races” in the SU journalism program, provide the best model to prepare aspirant journalist for the multicultural and multilinguistic realities of the post-apartheid South African newsroom. Part of that reality is that SU must necessarily contribute to the preparation of aspirant journalists for a (new) media industry that is thoroughly incorporated in the globalized political economy. Africanization that loses touch with the homogenizing influences of Anglo-American directed globalization, so goes the argument, will be doomed.</p>
<p>But still, this article suggests that it is counterproductive to accept as a given the current language policy—in operation since 1978—of the department. In the process, not only historic but also current relations of power around both languages are ignored, seemingly to the detriment of black and “coloured” students.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of national and institutional processes, it is unlikely that either Afrikaans or English will be dropped easily at SU, but if a choice becomes inevitable, it is clear that an English language policy will benefit more black, and arguably also some “coloured,” students in the long run. White English students would probably be affected because of a shift in cultural focus, but their strong performance base would arguably act as a buffer. The growing trend of bilingualism among economically affluent white Afrikaans students will, in turn, compensate them to some extend for the loss of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. The fact that many Afrikaans first-language speakers who are weak in English (including some “coloured” students) will then be effectively excluded from tertiary education is, of course, very worrying indeed.</p>
<p>The disappearance of Afrikaans at SU journalism could also mean that other indigenous languages (so-called black languages) will also be even further excluded from mainstream journalistic forums. But it is also unlikely that SU journalism will replace or even just supplement Afrikaans and/or English with other indigenous languages on a significant scale in the medium or even longer term. These languages are even less “developed” than Afrikaans in terms of both academic and journalistic application and are also under pressure from English in their respective language communities, especially among young urbanites.</p>
<p>Thus, this article would suggest that, if maintained, the current Afrikaans/English language dispensation should be strengthened by restructuring selection processes, course content, and assessment practices. The basis of restructuring should be a view of particular cultural knowledge as part of linguistic ability. Furthermore, the staff component should reflect both the Afrikaans-English and white-black-“coloured” split, and teaching and assessment should be done by experts not only in the field of specialization, but also in the particular language of instruction.</p>
<p>In practice, such steps could have far-reaching implications, and one could ask with some justification whether a formal split between Afrikaans and English at the department would then become inevitable. At face value, such a move could specifically improve the selection chances and performances of black students, but in especially a numerically small postgraduate journalism department such as SU, a formal split could be counterproductive. It could, for instance, lead to whites’ frequenting Afrikaans classes (and English classes remaining multicultural), which would strengthen the accusation that Afrikaans at SU acts as a means of maintaining/establishing white segregation.</p>
<p>Or it could (still) lead to the disappearance of Afrikaans journalism instruction at SU under pressure from government and industry demands. Such a move would thus be broadly in line with national post-apartheid education policies and media trends, but one most certainly with far-reaching consequences for the future of postgraduate Afrikaans language journalism education and training in South Africa. Furthermore, as this article indicated, even the complete disappearance of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at SU will not magically remove all barriers to tertiary journalism education to black South Africans. Especially among the new power elite, English may be on the rise as <italic>lingua franca</italic>, but it is not (yet?) the language of inclusive success either.</p>

<p>In this article, frequent references are made to “racial” categories into which South Africans were divided during apartheid, and subsequently in Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies of the African National Congress (ANC)–led government after 1994. This does not mean that the author agrees with or argues for categorizations based on so-called race—such as white, black, and “coloured.” To complicate matters further, “coloured” was and still is a controversial term rejected by many people of a so-called mixed “race” in South Africa to whom it refers. This is why the term “coloured” is consistently qualified in this article. My view is racial and ethnic identities are socially, politically, and culturally constructed—often with the will to power. Therefore, the real effects of policies and strategies based on “race” are duly recognized as powerful, as this article clearly indicates.</p>

<p>As a general norm, candidates achieving at least 50 percent (100/200) are invited for face-to-face interviews, but the head of department and program director reserve the right to adjust the selection criteria for strategic and/or practical reasons—such as the achievement of “transformation targets,” that is, inclusion of a number of non-white students (L. Rabe, personal communication, October 31, 2008). Still, even with this option, black students remain in the minority in the Stellenbosch University journalism department.</p>

<p>To complete the quantitative analysis, an expert in statistical analysis (Johnnie E. Tolken) was employed at this stage of the study. Tolken made use of computer software to provide the statistical results presented in this article. This was done because the author is schooled in qualitative research methods only. Tolken was tasked by the author to design and execute the quantitative phases after being provided all data for analysis. He played no part in designing the project as a whole or drawing overall conclusions.</p>

<p>This result, that race was the dominant factor in performance at Stellenbosch University journalism, was confirmed by a statistical analysis of information on all the students selected to the program from the academic years of 1999 to 2009 (<italic>n</italic> = 245). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed between the dependent variable (outcome) average year mark and the following independent variables (predictors): application test percentage, final grade twelve school symbol, race, gender, university previous language orientation, field of study, selection test completion language (study language), and previous university applicants attended. Race predictably emerged again as the strongest predictor of performance.</p>
