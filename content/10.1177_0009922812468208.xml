Data from the July to December 2010 National Immunization Survey–Teen Parental Concerns Module were analyzed to determine factors that influence parental decisions to vaccinate their adolescents. <italic>Results</italic>. Parents reported that their adolescent’s health care provider recommended tetanus toxoid/tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap; 74.4%), meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY; 60.3%), and human papillomavirus (HPV; 71.3%). Vaccination coverage estimates were significantly higher among parents who reported receiving a provider recommendation: 85.2% versus 76.7% (Td/Tdap), 77.3% versus 49.7% (MenACWY), and 62.2% versus 21.5% (HPV). Compared with Td/Tdap and MenACWY, fewer HPV vaccination conversations included recommendations for vaccination.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vaccination with the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines is routinely recommended for adolescents 11 to 12 years of age with catch-up vaccination throughout adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812468208">1</xref></sup> Routine recommendations for adolescent vaccinations were published between 2005 and 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812468208">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812468208"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812468208">4</xref></sup> Tdap prevents tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Pertussis is a highly communicable acute respiratory infection that involves violent bursts of coughing and respiratory distress and has significant morbidity and mortality among infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812468208">5</xref></sup> Although symptoms experienced by adolescents and adults may be milder compared with infants, it may lead to several days of lost work and school. Adolescents and adults are often a source of infection for infants and account for an increasing proportion of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812468208">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812468208">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>MenACWY prevents meningococcal diseases, including meningitis, an inflammation of the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. It is fatal in 10% to 14% of cases and can have long-term sequelae, including hearing deficits, limb loss, and neurological disability in 11% to 19% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812468208">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812468208">9</xref></sup> Meningitis rates are highest among infants &lt;1 year of age with a second peak in adolescents and young adults 13 to 24 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812468208">3</xref></sup> Behaviors that may be common during adolescence place adolescents at increased risk for meningitis, including living in close living quarters; attending bars, clubs, and school dances; tobacco exposure; and having multiple intimate kissing contacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812468208">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812468208">10</xref></sup> HPV is one of the most commonly sexually transmitted infections and is a causal factor for cervical cancer and genital warts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812468208">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812468208">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812468208">12</xref></sup> Nearly one half of adolescents in grades 9 to 12 report ever having sexual intercourse and are at risk for HPV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812468208">13</xref></sup> The prevalence of HPV among adolescents 14 to 19 years of age ranges from 24.5% to 32.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812468208">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812468208">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because adolescents are at risk for acquiring and transmitting vaccine preventable diseases, and vaccination coverage remains below national objectives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812468208">16</xref></sup> effective strategies that promote adolescent vaccination are needed to increase these rates. In addition to improving access to and parental awareness of adolescent vaccines, increasing parental acceptance of vaccines should lead to higher vaccination rates. Some factors that have influenced parental acceptance of vaccines include provider recommendations, school requirements, parental beliefs about a vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, perception of disease risk, media coverage, and information sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812468208">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812468208"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812468208"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812468208">20</xref></sup> Yet varying levels of concern about vaccine safety affect many parents, leading to delay and refusal among those with the highest levels of vaccine doubts and safety concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812468208">21</xref></sup> Better understanding of factors that influence parental vaccination decisions is needed to promote adolescent vaccination and achievement of Healthy People 2020 vaccination objectives. In this study, we describe the role of health care providers, adolescents, other persons, and media sources on parental decisions to vaccinate their adolescents with Td/Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV.</p>

<sec id="section2-0009922812468208" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) is composed of 2 phases: (1) a random-digit-dialed telephone survey of parents/guardians of adolescents 13 to 17 years of age and (2) a mailed survey to all vaccination providers identified by the parent and for which consent was granted. NIS-Teen represents a stratified national probability sample of households in the United States, including 50 states, the District of Columbia, and selected local areas. It is built on the sampling frame of telephone numbers used by the NIS, which seeks to identify vaccination rates in children 19 to 35 months old. Telephone interviews for the 2010 NIS-Teen surveys were conducted from January 2010 to February 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812468208">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the third and fourth quarters of 2010, the NIS-Teen included a parental attitudes module, which included questions regarding parental perceptions about vaccination, influences on parental decisions to vaccinate their adolescents, history of delaying or refusing vaccinations, and reasons for delaying and refusing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812468208">23</xref></sup> Parents were asked what type of health care providers they spoke with during vaccination visits for their adolescent. For each of the 3 vaccines (Td/Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV), parents were asked, “At visits made for [TEEN]’s vaccinations, did his/her healthcare provider talk to you about [VACCINE], recommend [VACCINE], give you enough time to discuss [VACCINE], play a role in your decision to get [TEEN] vaccinated or not to get [TEEN] vaccinated with [VACCINE].” For each of the vaccines, parents were asked, “How did [TEEN]’s healthcare provider play a role in your decision about getting him/her vaccinated with [VACCINE].” Parents responses were coded as follows: “Made you more likely to get [TEEN] vaccinated,” “made you less likely to get [TEEN] vaccinated,” “did not affect your decision,” “don’t know,” or “refused.” Parents were also asked “Did [TEEN] play a role in your decision to get him/her vaccinated or not to get him/her vaccinated with [VACCINE]?” Similar responses were given for the health care providers’ and adolescents’ roles. Parents were asked, “Did [TEEN] receive [VACCINE] on the day that you discussed it with his/her healthcare provider?” “Did any of the following play a role in your decision about vaccinating [TEEN],” “Check all that apply: drug company advertisements, news coverage, TV shows/talk shows, internet, books, magazines, or information from a library, friends, family, and school requirements.”</p>
<p>All vaccination coverage estimates in this study were determined from provider records. Only adolescents with adequate provider data were included in the analysis—that is, those with sufficient vaccination information obtained from the provider(s) to determine vaccination status. Details of the NIS-Teen methodology, including how vaccination data are combined to produce a synthesized immunization history and weighting procedures, have previously been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812468208">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812468208">24</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-0009922812468208">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Bivariate analyses were used to describe communication with health care personnel at vaccination visits and influences on parental vaccination decisions by health care providers, their adolescents, and other sources. Health care provider and adolescent influences on parental HPV vaccination decisions are reported among girls only. “Don’t know” and refused responses were excluded from the analysis. The proportion of “don’t know” and refused responses was &lt;5.0%, with the exception of the following variables, which had missing responses ranging from 6.4% to 11.0%: “Did his/her healthcare provider talk to you about [Td/Tdap and MenACWY],” “recommend [Td/Tdap and MenACWY],” “give you enough time to discuss [Td/Tdap and MenACWY],” and “play a role in your decision to get [TEEN] vaccinated or not to get [TEEN] vaccinated with [Td/Tdap and MenACWY],” and “How did [TEEN]’s healthcare provider play a role in your decision about getting him/her vaccinated with [MenACWY].”</p>
<p><italic>Z</italic> statistics and <italic>t</italic> tests were used to test statistically significant differences in sample proportions of parent-reported health care provider influences between vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescents. We considered differences with <italic>P</italic> values of ≤.05 statistically significant. Data were analyzed using SAS-callable SUDAAN version 9.3 to account for the complex sampling design of the NIS-Teen (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). NIS-Teen was approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s institutional review board. The parental attitudes module included 10 808 completed household interviews, for a Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate of 40.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812468208">22</xref></sup> Among those who completed the household survey and the parental attitudes module, 8652 (80.0%) had adequate provider-reported vaccination histories (CDC, unpublished data).</p>

<p>Characteristics of provider vaccination discussions and the roles of providers and adolescents in parental vaccination decisions are stratified by vaccination status in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812468208">Table 2</xref>. Compared with parents of unvaccinated adolescents, a significantly higher proportion of parents of vaccinated adolescents reported that their health care providers talked to them about the vaccine, recommended the vaccine, gave enough time to discuss the vaccine, and played a role in their vaccination decisions for Td/Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV. Among all parents, 56.5% (Td/Tdap), 46.8% (MenACWY), and 48.4% (HPV) reported that their providers made them more likely to receive the vaccinations. Compared with parents of unvaccinated adolescents, a significantly higher proportion of parents of vaccinated adolescents reported that their providers made them more likely to receive the 3 vaccinations. Compared with parents of adolescents who received Td/Tdap (57.3%) and MenACWY (54.2%), 72.4% of parents of adolescents who received HPV reported that their providers made them more likely to receive the vaccination. Among parents who reported that their provider discussed the vaccine with them, 81.5% (Td/Tdap), 83.5% (MenACWY), and 73.3% (HPV) reported receiving the vaccine on the day that they discussed it with their provider.</p>

<p>Among all parents, less than 5% reported that their providers made them less likely to receive the vaccinations. However, compared with parents of vaccinated adolescents, a significantly higher proportion of parents of unvaccinated adolescents reported that providers did not affect their vaccination decisions or made them less likely to vaccinate for MenACWY and HPV. Unlike Td/Tdap and MenACWY, the proportion of parents who reported talking about the HPV vaccine with their providers was higher than the proportion that reported receiving a recommendation for the vaccine. This occurred more commonly among parents of unvaccinated girls. Most parents reported that their adolescents did not play a role in their decisions to receive Td/Tdap (84.1%), MenACWY (85.5%), and HPV (72.6%). However, a significantly higher proportion of parents of vaccinated adolescents reported that their adolescents made it more likely that they would receive MenACWY and HPV compared with parents of unvaccinated adolescents. Both adolescent influence on parental decisions regarding HPV vaccination and parental report of their adolescent making it more likely for them to receive HPV vaccination increased with age (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Similar to other studies, we found that health care providers play an important role in parental vaccination decisions; vaccination rates were significantly higher among adolescents whose parents reported receiving a provider recommendation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812468208">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812468208">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812468208">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812468208">26</xref></sup> However, provider vaccination discussions and influence on parental decisions differed by vaccination type. Additionally, fewer parents reported conversations or recommendations for MenACWY compared with Td/Tdap and HPV. Compared with Td/Tdap and MenACWY, fewer HPV vaccination conversations included recommendations for vaccination. Although less than 5% overall, a significantly higher proportion of parents of unvaccinated adolescents reported that providers did not affect their vaccination decisions or made them less likely to vaccinate for MenACWY and HPV. Most adolescents did not play a role in parental vaccination decisions; yet other common factors that influenced parental vaccination decisions included school requirements, news coverage, and family.</p>
<p>Health care providers are instrumental in parental vaccination decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812468208">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812468208">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812468208">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812468208">28</xref></sup> Yet missed opportunities for vaccinations occur when providers do not recommend needed vaccinations to adolescents. Depending on the vaccine, 26% to 29% of parents did not receive vaccination provider recommendations, representing some missed opportunities. Barriers to adolescent vaccination recommendations have included the following: vaccination cost and reimbursement concerns, lack of adolescent preventive visits, provider discomfort discussing sexuality and sexually transmitted infections with parents, preference for delaying the vaccination until an older age, and perception that parents would refuse the vaccine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812468208">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812468208"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812468208">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Better business practices that ensure proper reimbursement, participation in vaccine-purchasing pools, and improving reimbursement through the Vaccines for Children Program should help increase the availability of vaccines in doctors’ offices and decrease cost barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812468208">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922812468208">33</xref></sup> Compared with the other vaccines, fewer parents reported provider discussions about MenACWY. This may be because some providers support waiting until high school completion to vaccinate against meningococcal meningitis, believing that risk is more likely after college entry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812468208">30</xref></sup> Recently published recommendations for a MenACWY booster dose for adolescents vaccinated before 16 years may prompt some health care providers to delay vaccination until 16 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812468208">34</xref></sup> Likewise, physician surveys have found that fewer providers recommend HPV vaccination to 11- to 12-year-old girls, compared with older adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812468208">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812468208">31</xref></sup> Provider education on adolescent disease risk, the benefits of vaccination before increased exposure to these diseases, and the effectiveness of MenACWY and HPV is needed to promote vaccination recommendations by providers at the recommended ages.</p>
<p>Additionally, we found that the proportion of parents who reported talking about the HPV vaccine with their provider was higher than the proportion that reported receiving a recommendation for the vaccine. This occurred more commonly among parents of unvaccinated girls. Compared with other vaccinations, some providers offer HPV vaccination as an optional vaccine or may not strongly recommend it to their patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812468208">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922812468208">35</xref></sup> Provider HPV recommendations may differ by provider type, sociodemographic characteristics, and perceived barriers to HPV vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812468208">31</xref></sup> Yet we found that provider recommendations may be particularly important in parental decisions for HPV vaccination. Nearly three quarters of parents of adolescents who received HPV reported that providers made them more likely to receive the vaccine compared with nearly half of parents whose adolescents received Td/Tdap or MenACWY. In addition to provider education, barriers to provider recommendations for HPV vaccination need to be addressed to improve this vital part of parental vaccination decisions. Provider educational materials, such as those recently developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have been developed to promote effective communication of vaccination information by providers to parents regarding early childhood vaccinations and will be expanded to include adolescent vaccinations (CDC, personal communication, October 1, 2012).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922812468208">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of parents reported that their adolescents did not affect their vaccination decisions, although there were differences by vaccine type. Compared with Td/Tdap and MenACWY, more parents reported that their adolescents affected their decisions regarding HPV vaccination. Also, both adolescent influence on parental decisions regarding HPV vaccination and parental report of their adolescents making it more likely that they received HPV vaccination increased with age. Few studies have assessed the role of adolescents in vaccination decisions. Rand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0009922812468208">37</xref></sup> found that 78% of adolescents 15 to 17 years of age preferred that the health care provider discuss HPV vaccine with parents and adolescents together, and parents and adolescents agreed with one another on the decisions to vaccinate 91% of the time. In contrast, Hughes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0009922812468208">38</xref></sup> found that some adolescents 11 to 18 years of age considered themselves as passive participants in HPV vaccination decisions. Further study on the role adolescents play in vaccination decisions is needed. However, because older adolescents may be more participatory in vaccination decisions, providers should also include adolescents in their discussions and recommendations for vaccinations.</p>
<p>Other than provider influence, school requirements, news coverage, and family members were the most common influences on parental vaccination decisions. With few differences in parent-reported influential factors by vaccination status, we are unable to conclude whether these factors influenced parents for or against vaccination. For instance, the presence of a school vaccination requirement may have prompted a parent to vaccinate their adolescent, whereas the absence of a requirement may have led to their decision not to vaccinate. It is known, however, that school requirements increase vaccination coverage among adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0009922812468208">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0009922812468208">40</xref></sup> As of the 2010-2011 school year, 31 (Tdap), 19 (MenACWY), and 2 (HPV) states required middle school entry vaccinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0009922812468208">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0009922812468208">42</xref></sup> The lack of middle school vaccination requirements may have contributed to parental decisions not to vaccinate in states without requirements.</p>
<p>For each given influential factor, except school requirements, parents of girls were more likely than parents of boys to state that the factor played a role in their vaccination decisions. Because HPV vaccine has been heavily marketed toward and is a vaccination against a sexually transmitted infection, parents of girls may be more aware of the HPV vaccine as well as other adolescent vaccinations compared with parents of boys. They may also be more influenced by media, ads, and friends/family because of publicity regarding HPV vaccination. Because news coverage may endorse or discourage vaccination, providers should be prepared to discuss issues in the news if parents ask about it. Likewise, including influential family members in parent-provider vaccination discussions could address concerns and increase vaccination acceptance. In 2011, ACIP approved routine recommendations to vaccinate 11- to 12-year-old boys against HPV, which may increase HPV-related marketing and media toward boys, thereby decreasing the differences in parental influences by gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0009922812468208">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>This analysis has some limitations. NIS-Teen is a random-digit-dialing survey and is limited to landline households. It may not be representative of nonlandline and wireless-only households, contributing to noncoverage bias. According to data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, the number of wireless-only households is increasing, with 31.8% of children currently living in wireless-only households.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0009922812468208">44</xref></sup> Only 2.0% of children live in households without telephone service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0009922812468208">44</xref></sup> The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a face-to-face household survey that includes landline, nonlandline, and wireless only households, has been assessed for sociodemographic and health-related variables among adolescents. Benchmark comparisons of these variables among adolescents in the NIS-Teen and NHIS have shown no significant evidence of coverage bias after adjusting sampling weights for noncoverage of nonlandline and wireless-only households in the NIS-Teen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0009922812468208">45</xref></sup> Nonresponse bias may remain after weighting adjustments. Provider data or vaccination histories may be incomplete. Parent report of provider recommendations and vaccination discussions are subject to recall bias. Missing response rates greater than 5.0% for some variables may contribute to falsely elevated estimates.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many factors influence parental decisions to vaccinate their adolescents; one of the most important factors is provider recommendation. Missed opportunities for vaccination persist when strong vaccination recommendations are not given or are delayed. Increasing parental awareness of adolescent vaccines through provider recommendations, marketing, and participating in immunization information systems and reminder-recall systems will help increase vaccination rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812468208">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812468208">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0009922812468208">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0009922812468208">47</xref></sup> Although training materials are available to address barriers to childhood vaccinations, provider training specific to adolescent vaccination is needed to promote such discussions with parents. Strategies will be needed to address barriers specific to HPV vaccination.</p>
