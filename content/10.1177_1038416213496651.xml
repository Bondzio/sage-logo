<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide some Australian data on the use of the <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic>. Results from 196 adult clients who participated in a vocational evaluation are analysed. The assessment provided a hierarchy of career interest results that reflected demographic features such as gender and education. The vocational interest results were consistent with the pre-accident occupational background of clients. The findings provided support for a direct approach to vocational interest assessment that may find some application in practice.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1038416213496651" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>To date, the vocational assessment of work-related interests for rehabilitation purposes has relied typically upon inventoried career interests compared to expressed, tested or manifest interests. It has been argued that there are substantial drawbacks with most interest inventories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1038416213496651">Athanasou, 2011</xref>). They are not necessarily appropriate for the bulk of adult clients. Moreover, there are substantive concerns about the relevance of the norm reference groups, let alone the reading requirements, the item content or even the time required to complete an inventory. This is magnified when an interest inventory does not add materially to the information already available from a work history.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no evidence that asking many indirect questions is a necessary and sufficient substitute for a direct enquiry about one’s interests. Moreover, it is well documented that expressed interest (i.e. a simple occupational prediction) has been found to be as effective a predictor as interest inventory results in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213496651">Super &amp; Crites, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, as far back as 1968, Mischel had proposed that in the process of assessment our questionnaires and inventories should be evaluated against self-estimates. Later, he contended that “what the person tells us directly turns out to be as valuable an index as any other more indirect sign” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1038416213496651">Mischel, 1977</xref>, p. 248). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1038416213496651">Burisch (1984)</xref> also examined major approaches to questionnaire development and concluded: “… if self-ratings are (a) directly communicable, (b) the ultimate in economy, and (c) also more valid than their questionnaire counterparts, then we will have to face the somewhat embarrassing question of just why we continue to construct personality inventories at all” (1984, p. 225).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these comments there is often a need for some form of structured interest assessment when vocational options are being explored. It is as important to know one’s key interests as well as a person’s transferable skills. This is because interests represent a relevant domain of vocational behaviour that is closely linked with educational success; they relate to what is valued in life; and they form a component of vocational aptitudes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213496651">Renninger, Hidi, &amp; Krapp, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>An approach to interest assessment based on the direct sorting of interest category titles was suggested initially by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213496651">Athanasou (1980)</xref>. This involved the direct self-estimate of interest and found application in adult vocational guidance services in Australia. This approach was adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213496651">Hosking (1996)</xref> and used initially in a study of unskilled workers for whom completing an interest inventory in the workplace was neither practical nor valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213496651">Hosking &amp; Athanasou, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>This <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1038416213496651">Athanasou &amp; Hosking, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1038416213496651">2003</xref>) is based on seven work interest areas (Outdoor, Practical, Scientific, Creative, Business, Office, People Contact). The card sort contains the title of an interest category with a brief description on the reverse. The client is asked to sort the cards into those liked most, second most, third most and so on. Normally the top two categories are considered as indicative of a person’s likes but the last category is also evaluated as an indicator of extreme dislike. Diagnostically the pattern of preferences is also investigated. It is expected that interests will conform broadly to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213496651">Holland (1997)</xref> hexagonal arrangement. Finally, the congruence with one’s occupational history is also examined.</p>
    <p>The rationale for this procedure was that adults were largely (but not exclusively) in a position to be relatively good judges of their work interests (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213496651">Athanasou &amp; Cooksey, 1993</xref>). The card sort was trialled largely with unskilled workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213496651">Hosking, 1996</xref>, p. 54 et seq. for details of reliability and validity). For example, on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1038416213496651">Iachan (1984)</xref> index of interest congruence the mean over a five-week period for an adult sample was 23.6 on a scale from zero to 28 with 28 being perfect congruence. Recently the <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> was applied in an idiographic study of community college course choices based on Holland codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213496651">Athanasou, 2013</xref>); results confirmed the idiosyncracy of preferences and a minor but overall positive role of vocational interests with the correlation between <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> rankings and Holland code beta weights ranging from 0.43 to 0.76.</p>
<p>The <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> is in the public domain and has been made freely available for career practitioners for use in vocational assessment. It has been reported in a number of publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1038416213496651">Chen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1038416213496651">Hughes &amp; Thomas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1038416213496651">Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1038416213496651">Silva, 2006</xref>, p. 166) but to date there is no information available on its use with a rehabilitation sample. The purpose of the present paper is to provide some background and validity data for users with a view to increasing confidence in the application of this assessment.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the assessment of interests using the card-sort should relate meaningfully to a range of social and demographic variables in a manner consistent with age, education, employment. The purpose of this paper is simply to provide some additional data on this approach to interest assessment both as a summative and formative component of a vocational evaluation but also to provide a basis for future research using this instrument.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1038416213496651" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants (<italic>N</italic> = 196) comprising 130 males and 66 females ranged in age from 14 to 62 years (<italic>M</italic> = 34 years, SD = 11.4 years). They were attending for a vocational assessment following an accident or injury.</p>
<p>The majority (75%; all percentages rounded) were from city locations. The median level of schooling was 11th grade. Post-school education and training comprised certificate (30%), degree (7%), diploma (5%) and no formal qualification (57%). Occupational groups were dominated by labourers (35%) followed by trades (17%) then sales (12%), technicians (10%), production and transport (9%), clerical occupations (7%), service occupations (6%) and professionals (5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1038416213496651"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>The <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> comprises seven 3″ by 5″ cards with the title of seven interest categories on one side. These are: Outdoor, Practical, Scientific, Creative, Business, Office and People Contact. On the reverse side there is a brief description of the category if examples are desired. The participant is required to sort these into rank order based on their likes and dislikes. The whole procedure takes around three minutes and is suited to clients who have some work experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1038416213496651" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> was completed towards the end of a 1½ h interview comprising an educational, vocational and social history. It was completed along with a range of physical assessments, literacy (reading) and cognitive status assessment where required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1038416213496651"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>The results from the <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> were recorded as ranking of the seven preference categories. Descriptive statistics are reported and comparisons between demographic groups are also provided.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1038416213496651" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>In this sample the most popular interest category by far was Outdoor work, which is particularly relevant in the Australian work context. This was ranked first by 66 participants compared with only seven who chose Office or Scientific work as their first choice. The lower section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1038416213496651">Table 1</xref> indicates the average rankings for the categories and highlights three broad preference groupings: I. Outdoor; II. Practical, Creative and People Contact; and III. Office and Scientific. Note that the lower mean ranking indicates a higher preference.

<p>The average inter-correlation between the categories was −0.163 which is entirely consistent with the theoretical value of −1/(<italic>n</italic> − 1) where n is the number of categories. This is because the assessment is ipsative and tends to reflect the way interests are structured within a person (i.e. hierarchically). An interest in one category tends to mean a lesser interest for another. The only two exceptions were for Outdoor and Practical interests (<italic>r</italic> = 0.196) and for Office and Business interests (<italic>r</italic> = 0.292). As expected the remaining intercorrelations were all negative.</p>
<p>Results were broadly in line with the hexagonal ordering of interests proposed by Holland. Outdoor interests were diametrically opposed to Office interests (<italic>r</italic> = −0.379); Practical interests were negatively correlated with Office interests (<italic>r</italic> = −0.314); Scientific interests were least related to Office interests (<italic>r</italic> = −0.320); Creative interests were least related to Office interests (<italic>r</italic> = −0.226); Business interests were least related to Practical interests (<italic>r</italic> = −0.298). The matrix of inter-correlations is summarised in the top section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1038416213496651">Table 1</xref>. The following sections provide validity data for the results based on differences between demographic groupings.</p>

<p>Similarly, rural clients were significantly higher on Outdoor interests (effect size = 0.37) but city clients were higher on Business (effect size = 0.21) and Office interests (effect size = 0.24). The calculated effect sizes for gender and location are small (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1038416213496651">Cohen, 1988</xref>) but nonetheless important indicators of socialisation effects.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1038416213496651">Table 3</xref> reports the correlations of age or the highest level of secondary schooling with the ranking of the different interests. Only age showed a statistically significant relationship with the ranking for Scientific interests (negative) and Office interest (positive) but the amount of variance accounted for was only around 2.5%. A similar picture emerged with schooling. The amount of years in high school was negatively and statistical significantly correlated with Business interest but again the amount of variance accounted for was minimal (3.7%). It appears that career interests were relatively independent of age and schooling in this sample.

<p>This study provided some basic information on a direct assessment of vocational interests. The results of this analysis were essentially uncomplicated and continued to indicate the value of self-estimated interests. The results confirmed what might be a layperson’s view of the patterns of interests across groups such as the low standing of scientific interests and the high popularity attributed to outdoor interests. These results are not limited to a rehabilitation sample but also broadly consistent with other large-scale studies of career interests that used the same categories (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1038416213496651">Athanasou, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The relatively low inter-correlation between interest categories meant that there is no measurement artefact such as a rating scale bias or “yea-saying” tendency. That is, it is not possible for someone to rate highly on all interests or low across all interests. The <italic>Career Interest Card Sort</italic> used an ipsative or ranking approach. It provides an overall picture of one’s interests that is likely to be accurate at the extremes.</p>
<p>Demographic differences were also in line with everyday expectations and stereotypes. For instance, males rated higher on interest for Outdoor and Practical work activities than females. Females rated Creative and People Contact work interests higher than males. This means that at least over a period of 40 years the gender stereotypes of career interests have remained fairly constant (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213496651">Connell, Stroodbant, Sinclair, Connell, &amp; Rogers, 1975</xref>). The socio-cultural archetypes of male and female vocational preferences are alive and kicking! City and rural differences also betrayed a view of the world of work where Outdoor interests were favoured by rural clients but city clients were characterised by a variety of preferences. On the other hand neither age nor schooling had any meaningfully large effect on interest. Educational and vocational differences provided results that would be consistent with a layperson’s expectation of their influence. For example, Outdoor and Practical were important to those without a qualification or a trade ticket. Beyond this it is not really possible to extrapolate given the small numbers involved in the sub-groups.</p>
<p>The main contribution of this study is to reinforce the value of self-estimates as a means of assessing something as simple and uncomplicated as one’s career preferences. Where there is no reason for deception then a basic ranking of interest categories is probably more useful than realised. This does not mean that practitioners should throw away their interest inventories but there is every reason to suspect that the results – at least for a reasonably large group of rehabilitation clients – are likely to be very similar. The additional advantage of the low inter-correlation between preferences should not be underestimated as it provides the key result for a counsellor. Moreover, there are substantial savings in cost and time, let alone in the demands made upon clients in a rehabilitation context. It is not clear just how much more evidence is really needed to convince practitioners that there may well be a case for using direct assessments of psychological characteristics but hopefully the results of this small study will provide some additional support for an approach that has theoretical and practical value in vocational rehabilitation assessment.</p>
