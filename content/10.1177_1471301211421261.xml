<p><bold>Background and aim:</bold> While the number of people suffering from dementia in the Netherlands will double in the next 25 years, there are no plans to expand the capacity of residential care facilities for these patients. This will almost inevitably lead to an increase in the burden placed on informal carers. We investigated how caregivers living with a loved one who has dementia experience their caregiving situation.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> For this study, 53 caregivers ranked a structured set of opinion statements covering a representative range of aspects of caregiving. By-person factor analysis was used to uncover patterns in the rankings of statements.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Five distinct profiles of caregiving were identified that provide information on the various care situations that can occur, the needs and dilemmas that these caregivers face, and the subjective burden and perseverance time of the carers.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The findings contribute to the development of interventions for the support of informal caregivers.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421261" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In line with projections in many other countries, the number of people suffering from dementia in the Netherlands is expected to double during the next 25–40 years. It is estimated that the prevalence of people with dementia of age 65 years and older will increase from 1 in 93 to 1 in 44 inhabitants. In terms of the proportion of active against inactive people in society, this implies an increase of one person with dementia per 63 working population to one per 27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421261">De Lange &amp; Poos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421261">Ferri, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421261">Wancata, Musalek, Alexandrowicz, &amp; Krautgartner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421261">Wimo, Winblad, Aguero-Torres, &amp; Von Strauss, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>At present in the Netherlands, two out of three people with dementia live at home. These dementia patients are largely cared for by informal carers (here referred to as caregivers). The caregivers all experience the burden of care differently −22% see this as a light task, 58% as moderate and 20% as very demanding. Furthermore, 77% of caregivers find it difficult to cope with the behavioural changes of the dementing person they are caring for, and approximately 50% feel themselves under a great deal of emotional stress due to this fact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421261">Peeters, Francke, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421261">Peeters, van Beek, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2002, the Health Council of the Netherlands concluded that the supply and demand of facilities and services for people with dementia in the Netherlands was not balanced. In order to answer the ever-increasing needs regarding this issue, the Health Council advised the government to increase residential capacity by approximately 2% each year between 2001 and 2010. Without this expansion, it is estimated that the percentage of people with dementia who will be able to get a place in a residential setting will decrease from 35% to 29% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421261">Gezondheidsraad, 2002</xref>). However, at the time, the government did not choose to expand capacity but to stimulate collaboration between care providers at a regional level. This move was aimed at achieving improvements in care and services for people with dementia and their caregivers in a non-residential setting.</p>
<p>Therefore, policy for the next few years in the Netherlands will encompass the stimulation of care in non-residential settings without extra resources for dementia care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421261">Bussemaker, 2008</xref>). Without any additional policy in this area, the tension between care supply and demand will certainly shift towards caregivers, and their subjective burden of care will almost certainly increase considerably.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how caregivers experience their personal caregiving situation, and which needs and dilemmas they face. For this purpose we use Q-methodology. Because this is a fairly novel method in the field, the next section starts with an introduction of the method, followed by a more detailed description of how the current study was carried out.</p>
<p>The explorative study presented in this paper is part of a larger longitudinal study (2007–2010) into the perseverance time of caregivers living with someone with dementia and its most important determinants. Perseverance time is defined as the period of time for which caregivers themselves indicate that they can continue to care for their dementing loved one under current conditions The results from this larger study will help in the development of specific, demand-driven interventions aimed at supporting caregivers in their task.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1471301211421261"><title>Research method</title>
<p>Q-methodology combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research methods and provides a scientific base to study the perceptions, preferences and opinions of people regarding a certain subject. This type of research is relatively new to the field of health care but has been widely used in other areas of policy research during the last 70 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421261">Stephenson, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421261">Brown, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421261">1993</xref>). The following studies in health care have been published recently: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421261">Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421261">Bryant, Green, &amp; Hewison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421261">Kreuger, van Exel, &amp; Nieboer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421261">Risdon, Eccleston, &amp; McCracken, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421261">Stenner, Dancy, &amp; Watts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421261">Tielen, Van Staa, Jedeloo, van Exel, &amp; Weimar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421261">van Exel, de Graaf, &amp; Brouwer, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421261">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421261">Buljac et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421261">Cramm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421261">Jedeloo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421261">Vermaire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421261">Wallenburg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421261">Tielen et al., 2011</xref>.</p>
<p>In a Q-methodological study, respondents are asked to rank a set of opinion statements. This method of ranking enables the respondents to give their opinion and attitude towards the subject being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421261">Cross, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421261">Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421261">Watts &amp; Stenner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421261">Van Exel &amp; de Graaf, 2005</xref>). William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421261">Stephenson (1935)</xref>, who was the founder of Q-methodology, introduced the method as an inversion of conventional (by-item) factor analysis, in the sense that Q correlates persons instead of tests; correlation between individual rankings of statements then indicates similar viewpoints. Significant clusters of correlations can be identified through by-person factor analysis, described as common viewpoints, and individual respondents can be mapped to these viewpoints. Therefore, Q-methodology is used to describe a population of viewpoints and not – as is the case in conventional factor analysis – a population of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421261">Risdon et al., 2003</xref>). Only a small research population is needed because the aim is to reveal the commonly shared viewpoints and not the size of the population that subscribes to these viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421261">Bryant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421261">Risdon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421261">Smith, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study was conducted in three steps described below.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421261"><title>Step 1: Collecting and selecting statements</title>
<p>The first step consisted of collecting a set of opinion statements that typically represented the situation of caregivers living with someone with dementia – this is known as the Q-set. In order to design the Q-set, in a series of five panel interviews caregivers were asked about how they experience their own care situation, including which problem areas and dilemmas they have to face. These interviews were conducted by using 14 problem areas which caregivers of people with dementia may encounter over time and as defined by the Dutch National Dementia Programme (Landelijk Dementieprogramma (LDP); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421261">Peeters, van Beek &amp; Francke, 2007</xref>). The 14 problem areas are: the feeling that something isn't right; what exactly is going on and what may help; afraid, angry and confused; totally alone in the situation; avoiding contact; physical care; danger; caregiver also has health problems; loss; it's all too much; giving up and losing control; through good and bad times; bad communication with health professionals; and resistance to admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421261">Peeters, van Beek &amp; Francke, 2007</xref>). The stories that the participants told the panel were an important component for the design of the Q-set. As well as this reference material, an earlier Q-methodological study on the attitudes of caregivers regarding respite care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421261">Van Exel et al., 2007</xref>) was examined as well as the questionnaire ‘Problems and wishes of caregivers of people with dementia’ [freely translated from the Dutch] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421261">Van der Poel &amp; van Beek, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>From these sources, two of the authors (Kraijo &amp; Van Exel) collected and structured opinion statements that related to the most important themes surrounding informal care for people with dementia (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421261">Table 1</xref>); this was done by using an iterative process. Subsequently, a representative set of statements was selected. The final Q-set consisted of 36 statements from caregivers living with someone with dementia. These 36 statements were then numbered randomly and printed onto cards that fitted into the slots on the response sheet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211421261">Figure 1</xref>). The Q-set was tested by five caregivers and then approved as the definitive version without any further changes being made.

<sec id="sec5-1471301211421261"><title>Step 2: The implementation of the study</title>
<p>The caregivers who participated in this study were recruited from the database of 223 caregivers living at home with a loved one with dementia and who were taking part in the previously mentioned longitudinal study into perseverance time. Out of the 223 carers, 124 (56%) were living in the same house as the person with dementia. From these 124 carers, 53 (43%) agreed to take part in our study. Participants and non-participants did not differ in terms of age, health status and the principal variables of concern for this study: subjective burden of caring and perseverance time. Female carers more often agreed to participate than male carers, as did higher educated carers as compared with lower educated carers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted in the homes of the caregivers by the first author of this paper. After first sorting the statements into three categories (agree, neutral, disagree), the caregivers then ranked the statements according to a scale of agree the least to agree the most, using the response sheet provided (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211421261">Figure 1</xref>). Any comments given by the caregivers during and following the sorting of the statements were carefully noted down. Regarding the two statements at either end of the scale – those representing the very least or the very most in agreement – the participants were asked to describe their motivation clearly. This material was then used later to help in the interpretation of the results and also used as quotes in the description of the profiles (<italic>in italics</italic> in the results section).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421261"><title>Step 3: The Q analysis</title>
<p>The individual rankings of statement were subsequently analysed using by-person factor analysis, with the aim of identifying a number of corresponding ways in which the caregivers ranked the statements (the dedicated software can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lrz.de/~schmolck/qmethod/">http://www.lrz.de/~schmolck/qmethod/</ext-link>).. For the resulting factors (i.e. profiles of informal carers), a weighted average ranking of the statements was compiled based on the rankings of the caregivers associated with the factor and the corresponding correlation coefficients as weights. These compiled rankings of statements, representing how a caregiver with a correlation coefficient of 1 with a factor would have ranked the statements, were used to describe the profiles concerned according to characteristic and distinguishing statements. A statement is considered characteristic for a profile in this study whenever it scores a −4, −3, +3, +4 in the compiled ranking. A statement is considered distinguishing whenever the score of the statement statistically significantly differs from those in the other profiles (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The compiled rankings for each profile are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1471301211421261">Table 3</xref>. Together with the explanations from caregivers to their ranking of the statements, these form the base for the description of the profiles.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421261"><title>Additional data</title>
<p>The interviews for this study were conducted at the time of inclusion of the respondent in the longitudinal study into perseverance time of caregivers for a loved one with dementia. As part of the longitudinal study, respondents completed an extensive questionnaire concerning their care situation. Here we use selected data from this questionnaire concerning characteristics of the caregivers, their dementing loved one and the care situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the care situation, the questionnaire included questions about subjective caregiver burden and perseverance time. Burden was assessed using two measures, the Self-Rated Burden (SRB) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421261">Van Exel et al., 2004</xref>) and the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421261">Robinson, 1983</xref>). The SRB is a visual analogue scale ranging between 0 (‘not at all straining’) and 100 (‘much too straining’) on which caregivers were asked to indicate the overall subjective burden of caregiving. The CSI comprises 13 items referring to the stressors in caring, each completed yes/no, with the yes answers summed to give an overall strain score. Perseverance time was measured using the following question: If the care situation remains as it is now, how long will you be able to carry on giving the care? (answer options: less than 6 months; more than 6 months but less than 1 year; more than 1 year but less than 2 years; more than 2 years).</p>

<p>The analysis of the individual rankings resulted in a five-factor solution. In other words, five profiles of carers living with a loved one who has dementia could be differentiated regarding their perception towards their individual care situation. Together, the five profiles account for 50% of the variance in the 53 individual rankings of statements. The profiles are presented in sequential order of increasing subjective burden as indicated by the caregivers associated with each profile. In the description of the profiles, the numbers of the statements are given between parenthesis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1471301211421261">Table 3</xref>) and the quotes from the caregivers concerned are given in italics.

<sec id="sec9-1471301211421261"><title>Profile 1</title>
<p>These caregivers are able to cope well, both physically and emotionally with their task (7, 17, and 33). <italic>‘The care required is still fairly limited and can be carried out without too much difficulty’.</italic> They are able to cope with the behavioural changes of the dementing person (31), are not afraid of unsafe situations occurring (5) and do not avoid contact with others as a direct result of their loved one's dementia (10). These caregivers have the least need for a regular respite break in which they can get away from the care situation (36). In addition, these caregivers do not want to hand the care over to someone else (25). <italic>‘If she will suffer from that, then so will I.’</italic> Whilst in one way they see it as their duty to care for their dementing loved one (19) and are apprehensive about them being admitted to residential care (29), they also admit to thinking that their loved one wants and prefers to be cared for by them (2). Moreover, these caregivers (more than those in the other profiles) do get satisfaction, i.e. feel good about caring for their dementing loved one (24). They appear to know their way around the world of care well (35) and need to be reassured that a place in residential care would be available for their loved one should it be needed in the future if care at home is no longer possible (23). <italic>‘If I think about the future, then I get a kind of panicky feeling, so knowing that residential care is a possibility reassures me again’.</italic> As far as the future is concerned, these caregivers want to remain in control of the care given (11).</p>
<p>Caregivers with this profile are able to cope well with the care they are giving.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421261"><title>Profile 2</title>
<p>This group of caregivers can cope reasonably well with the care (7). However, they also indicate clearly that they need support (3, 22) and reassurance that things will be OK in the future. For example, they would like to have a focal liaison point for advice and a health professional who can organize all kinds of practical things that are involved with the care process (3). The need for support stems from the caregiver's wish to remain in control of the care for their loved one (11, 25). ‘<italic>Being so close to my partner means that I know a lot about him, especially his emotional side and that's why I want to decide when, where and what is going to happen’.</italic> Whilst caregivers in this group do not feel that healthcare professionals pay them enough attention, they do want to be able to ask advice on how to deal better with the behavioural changes that result from the dementia (22, 31, and 5). They also indicate that they would like to have regular (monthly) respite breaks in order to rebuild their energy levels (36). <italic>‘Just a day and night once or twice a month would be nice – to be able to visit the grandchildren’.</italic> They want to carry on caring for their loved one as long as possible and see this as their duty (19). They are apprehensive about an admission to residential care (29). <italic>‘It would be difficult for me to live my own life again. I think I would walk around feeling sorry for myself’.</italic> However, they do want to have reassurance regarding an available place in residential care should the time come that the person can no longer be cared for at home (23). With this group, fortunately that time has not yet arrived. Caring for the loved one is not physically demanding (33) and there is no fear of unsafe situations occurring (5).</p>
<p>A caregiver with this profile wants support in order to carry on giving the care but at the same time wants to keep control over the situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421261"><title>Profile 3</title>
<p>These caregivers find their task physically demanding (33). <italic>‘Sometimes I'm on the go 24 hours a day’.</italic> In spite of this, it is the emotional demand that weighs the most (17). <italic>Seeing my husband's sadness and the helplessness that seems to pour out of him – and the fact that I can't help him at all’.</italic> They sometimes find it difficult to set boundaries and make room for their own activities (28). Family and friends understand perfectly well what it is to be a caregiver for someone who is suffering from dementia (6). In this profile, more than other caregivers, these people do perceive the support they get from their social environment (6, 16). <italic>'Everyone asks how he is and they also understand my situation’.</italic> Out of all the caregivers, these people have the least feeling of being on their own (14). Caregivers in this situation do not find it difficult to ask family and friends for help (13). <italic>‘If it's really necessary I can always ask my neighbours or one of the children for help’.</italic> Therefore they do not feel isolated (4). They have good and supportive contacts in their own social environment (10, 30). <italic>‘I am not ashamed of the situation and take him everywhere with me’.</italic> However, in spite of the support from their environment, these caregivers do not want to hand over the care to anyone else (25). <italic>‘If Idid that I would feel as though I was leaving him in the lurch’.</italic> They experience fulfilling their task for as long as possible as a duty (19). They are apprehensive about an admission to residential care (29) because of the negative image that this carries. They want to save their loved one from admission if at all possible. <italic>‘I wouldn't want that to happen to him. Ithink that he would deteriorate even further if he was admitted to a care home’.</italic> Moreover, they are apprehensive about an admission because their loved one prefers to be taken care of by them (2) and because they would be missed so much if they were not the one giving the care.</p>
<p>A caregiver with this profile experiences the task of providing care as quite demanding but has a lot of support from his/her environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211421261"><title>Profile 4</title>
<p>In this profile, the people in the direct social environment of the caregivers do not understand very much about the situation (6). <italic>‘Nobody understands properly because they only see him for a few hours at a time’.</italic> This is why caregivers in this profile can only expect a little help and support from their family and friends (16). Whilst they do not avoid making contact with others themselves (10), there is less contact with others (30) as a direct result of the dementia. <italic>‘We have a lot less contact with other people due to the advanced incontinence’.</italic> All of the above leaves these caregivers with the feeling that they cannot depend on people in their social environment when they need support themselves (13, 16). These caregivers find the task of caring for someone with dementia very demanding (17) indeed. <italic>‘Together with my wife, I cry a lot about the situation that has arisen and all the grief and sadness that goes with it’.</italic> They find it very difficult to cope with the behavioural changes that have resulted from the dementia (31). These caregivers feel as if the burden of care has been left to them alone by people in their environment much more than the caregivers in other profiles (14). <italic>‘Because he can't join in with social activities any more and is not much fun to be with, nobody wants to do anything with him’.</italic> Therefore, with these caregivers, loneliness comes to the foreground the most (4). Moreover, due to the time pressure of providing the care itself, these caregivers have less time to focus on other activities (28). They do not readily ask for help from professional organizations because they have experienced a lack of being consulted on care decisions for their loved one in the past (13). They would welcome a regular respite break in their care task each week (36). In spite of the seriousness of the situation and the sense of duty to take care of their dementing loved one, these caregivers still do not want to hand over the care to someone else (25). <italic>‘When you have shared everything together for 58 years, I just see it as my duty to take care of her’.</italic> They are even apprehensive about a future admission to residential care (29) ‘<italic>I know he would be very unhappy there. He is dreading that himself’.</italic></p>

<p>Caregivers in this profile are actually hardly able to keep up their task of providing their loved one with care (7). <italic>‘I am extremely tired and hardly ever have any time for myself’.</italic> They find it very difficult to cope with the behavioural changes that have resulted from the dementia (31). <italic>‘The person you loved so much is not there anymore and the person who is there – well you just feel sorry for them and take care of them’.</italic> Of all the caregivers, these are the ones who worry the most about unsafe situations occurring (5). <italic>‘I have to keep an eye on him all the time’.</italic> They experience caring for the person with dementia as emotionally demanding (17). <italic>‘Slowly and surely you start to suffer yourself’.</italic> Caring for your loved one no longer gives you any satisfaction (24) <italic>‘I see caring for him as my duty but it produces feelings of frustration rather than any good feelings’.</italic> They find it regrettable that family and friends do not seem to appreciate just what being a caregiver entails (6).

These caregivers have an express need for a guarantee that, should they need it, there would be a place available for their loved one in residential care (23). <italic>‘I need a lot of reassurance that he will be temporarily admitted to residential care if there comes a time that I can't cope any more – but nobody gives me that reassurance’.</italic> However, this certainly does not mean that they are looking forward to their loved one being placed in a care home. <italic>‘That would mean the end of our marriage.

<sec id="sec14-1471301211421261"><title>Similarities between the profiles</title>
<p>A number of striking similarities between the five profiles have been observed.</p>
<p>Whilst caregivers consider caring for their dementing loved one as their duty (19) most of them also say it makes them feel good (24). The majority of informal carers want to keep control of the care their loved one receives as much as possible (11) and are apprehensive about admission of the person to residential care (29). In spite of this, in general the need for respite care scores relatively highly (36). Contrary to what is often thought about caregivers of people with dementia, they do not avoid contact with their social environment (10). Financial aspects hardly play a role in the whole scenario (34).</p>
<p>In general, the need for reassurance felt by caregivers is that there must be a safety net in place if a time comes when it will be needed (23).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1471301211421261"><title>Profiles and background characteristics</title>
<p>The number of caregivers who took part in this study is insufficient for giving any indication of the prevalence of the profiles among carers living with a loved one who has dementia, or for generalizing the associations between profiles and background characteristics of the care situation. A number of striking relationships between the profiles and data of the informal carers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211421261">Table 2</xref>) are given here as hypotheses for further study.</p>
<p>It is clear that there is a strong positive association between the profiles and the caregiver burden as measured with the SRB (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.601; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) or the CSI (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.527; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) scale and the perseverance time (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −410; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as indicated by the caregivers. The caregivers in profile 1, for example, indicated a lower burden (3.2 on SRB; 5.4 on CSI) and a longer perseverance time (27.6 months) than those in profile 5, who clearly reported a higher burden (7.3 on SRB and 10.2 on CSI) and a shorter perseverance time (14.6 months).</p>
<p>A short summary has been made for each profile outlining the principal characteric and distinguishing characteristics: please see the appendix. These summaries will be used in further research to study how often the profiles occur in a larger sample of caregivers and the relationship between the profiles and the characteristics of caregivers, people with dementia and the care situation itself.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1471301211421261" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This study produced five distinctive profiles relating to caregivers living with a person with dementia. A short summary ordered by registered subjective burden would be as follows: caregivers who cope well with providing care; caregivers who would like to receive help in providing the care but who want to remain in control of the care process; caregivers who find it quite demanding to keep up the level of care needed but who do receive a lot of help and support from their family and friends; caregivers who experience their task of caregiving as very demanding and who do not receive much support from family and friends; caregivers who can hardly cope with providing the care for their dementing loved one that is required.</p>
<p>The profiles show that caregivers experience a number of dilemmas in their task of caring for a loved one with dementia. Therefore, some attention will be paid to these dilemmas and their implications in this discussion section.</p>
<p>From the interviews, it became clear that caregivers want to retain control of the care process for their loved one for as long as possible, and that they really do not want to hand over the care to others. However, they also indicated an express need for reassurance that there would be a place available in residential care should the need arise – read here that the person can no longer be cared for at home. This dilemma is kept alive by the fact that whilst people realize only too well that handing over the care will be unavoidable at some point, they also know that they want to put this moment off for as long as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421261">Van Exel, de Ruiter &amp; Brouwer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, caregivers indicate that their dementing loved one only wants to be cared for by them and sometimes by them alone. For this reason, the caregivers want to carry on with their task; after all, they have promised, in sickness and in health to look after each other until death. However, there comes a moment when they want to share the care with someone else. This is not always a truly sincere thought, but has to do with self-protection and the ability to carry on caregiving for longer. Reaching a decision to hand over care is often accompanied by feelings of guilt and shame. However, this is not always the case, as sometimes people just resign themselves to the fact that they can have no control over how the disease progresses and that they will not always be able to care for their loved one themselves.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole disease process, caregivers seem to wrestle with a varying complexity of feelings – resistance, anger, sadness, powerlessness, acceptance, acquiescence etc. – that have to do with the unavoidable but gradual phases of realization that they have to say goodbye to their loved one. Changes in personality, admission to residential care and death are recognizable breaking points in these personal relationships. Uncertainty, unavoidability and losing control over the situation are all things which take over the caregiver's life.</p>
<p>The balance between caregiver strain and caregiver strength is characterized by the degree to which people experience satisfaction when providing informal care. Caring for your lifepartner can be a very satisfying experience and can be the incentive needed to continue with providing informal care. But, that incentive can be severely damaged when changes in personality/character occur. Feelings of estrangement then take over. The very demanding emotional situation which, on the one side is the commitment to the loved one, and on the other side, the separation that is taking place due to the dementia, starts a phase in which special attention and support for the caregiver is needed.</p>
<p>Caregivers do not avoid contact with their environment as a result of their loved one's dementia. However, when behavioural changes and incontinence become a reality, then it becomes more and more difficult for people to maintain contact with their social environment. This is also a sign that priority should be given to an offer of respite care to the caregiver.</p>
<p>At this point, attention, understanding and empathy for the caregivers by people in their social environment are important and function as support for the carers. If there is no understanding from the person's social environment, including direct family members, then it may be necessary to focus more on helping family and friends to understand the situation better.</p>
<p>One of the images that comes to the foreground from earlier typing of dilemmas is that of the caregiver who needs but does not ask for support, or at least not without difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421261">Van Exel et al., 2007</xref>). However, this dilemma is not recognized when healthcare professionals work on a demand-driven basis. What happens then is the omission of early signalling and offers of support. For these caregivers, a mild form of assertive outreach in the care offers them a chance of temporary support – which is just what they need in order to carry on with their task longer. A trusted representative who can offer professional advice to caregivers regarding dementia and who can support them in organizing all kinds of practical things involved in the care is a possible answer to this problem.</p>
<p>Although the number of respondents included in this study is sufficient for the purposes of Q-methodology and no substantial selection bias was found between participants and non-participants from the larger longitudinal study, some concerns regarding the population of study need mentioning. A common feature of research among informal caregivers is that carers who experience a very low or very high burden are under-represented. Those with a very low burden often do not identify or report themselves as carers and therefore are difficult to trace, while those who are very strained by their care situation are not able or less willing to participate in any type of research. It is difficult to say whether the omission of these respondents has influenced our results; the profiles seem to represent care situations varying from no strain at the one end to substantial strain on the other, perhaps with the exception of more extreme, crisis situations that may occur in the last phase before admission of the person with dementia to a residential setting. Considering that the wider purpose of our project is to inform the development of interventions to support carers in their task, this issue appears to be of limited concern. In any case, the data that will be gathered during the follow-up study will inform about the prevalence of the profiles in a wider population of carers for a loved one with dementia, and thus also reveal whether specific groups are ill-represented by these profiles. Because the follow-up study is longitudinal, we will also be able to investigate whether carers move between profiles over time and how this relates to the progression of their loved one's dementia.</p>
<p>In addition, this study has been conducted among caregivers living in the same house as the person with dementia. The Q-set was developed on the basis of opinion statements from caregivers regardless of the physical distance that separates them from the dementing person. Further research should show whether the profiles described in this paper also apply to caregivers who are not living in the same house as the person with dementia.</p>
<p>The profiles were presented in sequential order of subjective caregiver burden. We found that the profiles were also associated with the perseverance time as indicated by the carers. This provides a first indication of the relevance of the concept of perseverance time as an indicator of how carers cope with their caregiving situation and the type of support they need to be able to carry on. The profiles are therefore considered an important starting point for a longitudinal follow-up study investigating the perseverance time of caregivers and its determinants, in which the prevalence of the profiles will also be identified (see appendix).</p>
<p>The results of this study and the larger follow-up study will contribute to the development of more specific, demand-driven interventions for the support of informal caregivers living with a loved one who has dementia.</p>

<p><bold>Henk Kraijo</bold> has been CEO in Public Health organizations for 25 years, in intramural psychiatry and the homecare sector. He participated in the National Dementia Program (LDP) from 2004 to 2008. This programme was initiated by the Dutch government based on the 2002 report “Dementia” from the National Health Council. After his retirement in 2007 he started as a PhD student at the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands. His research focus is on the perseverance time of informal caregivers of persons with dementia. The start of his study, which has a longitudinal follow-up design (2007–2010), was to investigate how informal caregivers define their own situation as caregiver and how to cope with caring. To stay involved with contemporary issues regarding the care for vulnerable people, he became chairman of a committee of citizens that advises the local council of the city of Deventer, the Netherlands.</p>
<p><bold>Werner Brouwer</bold>, is a Professor of Health Economics at the institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA) and the institute of Health Policy and Management (iBMG) of the Erasmus University Rotterdam. He has been affiliated to the iMTA and the iBMG since 1996. His research is primarily concerned with the methodology of economic evaluations in the field of health care and the link between such evaluations and health policy. Describing, measuring and valuing informal care has always been a special interest in his work.</p>

He has published many books and articles about innovation of care. His scientific attention nowadays is oriented to integrated care, transmural care, regiovisions, managed care and disease management. As a lecturer he has much experience in post-academic education and advising organizations in the field of cooperation between institutions, strategic policy, financial management and quality policy.</p>
<p><bold>Job van Exel</bold> is a health economist, affiliated to the institute of Health Policy &amp; Management (iBMG) of Erasmus University Rotterdam since 2000. His research is focused on the assessment of the impact of informal care on caregivers and the development of methods for incorporating such effects in (economic) evaluations of health care interventions, as well as on various other measurement and valuation issues in health. In addition, he has developed expertise with Q-methodology and has applied it to a variety of subjects in the health care sector.</p>

While the healthcare professionals do not have a lot of time for me, I do really need someone who can advise me and who can organise practical things for me. I want to keep up the caregiving for as long as possible and that's why I need reassurance on some things. For example, that there is a possibility of getting away from the situation now and again.</td></tr>

<td colspan="5">I find the caregiving emotionally demanding. I have much less contact with my family and friends due to my loved one's dementia. I often have the feeling that it's all my responsibility. My social environment does not really understand what it means to be a caregiver in this situation and they are happy to leave everything up to me. That's why I find it difficult to ask for help when I do really need it. The healthcare professionals don't take me seriously either.</td></tr>

I would welcome the chance of a break to recharge my batteries.</td></tr>
