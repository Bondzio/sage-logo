<p>While media studies has traditionally asked questions about how textual meaning is created or explored audience consumption practices, in the last decade, the field has paid increasing attention to the industrial practices of film and television production, including the day-to-day decisions made by individual workers. At the same time, “production culture” studies tend to focus on so-called “above the line” personnel, mid- and upper-level professionals whose creative roles are highlighted within the end credits of a media text and inhabit culturally sanctioned roles as artists or professionals. Many other workers have been invisible, both in credits and in research on media production.</p>
<p>This should not surprise us. Media industries have long had a vexed relationship to practices of labor. Film, radio, and television involve creative practices, but that creativity lies within industrial contexts and bureaucratic routines. As in many kinds of work, neoliberal economic policies have destabilized the employment practices of media production, making work invisible. However, in recent years, scholars such as John Caldwell, Miranda Banks, Vicki Mayer, and others have sought to illuminate these complicated practices.</p>
<p>In <italic>Below the Line</italic>, Vicki Mayer applies a labor theory of value and ethnographic research to explore the significance of work practices that have traditionally been erased from our understanding of media production. She places broadly defined laboring practices into two contexts: first, how definitions of creativity and professionalism function as markers of occupational status that increase surplus value for employers, and second, how work performed by talent cultivators and citizen regulators of public access highlight the tensions involved in making claims to identify audiences and publics.</p>

<p>Mayer’s book charts how identities based on race, class, gender, and sexual orientation intersect with different types of production and different degrees of worker autonomy in media industries. These issues are framed via four case studies: Brazilian television assemblers, videographers who create soft-core pornography, reality television casting agents, and citizen cable regulators who advocate for public-access television production. In each case, the labor discussed expresses contradictions of contemporary capitalism. The television assemblers in Brazil engage in creative practices that increase the rate and quality of the TVs produced. These workers recognize that their work in assembly plants is both more prestigious and more lucrative than many competing jobs, even as those workplaces take physical and psychic tolls. Mayer views the creativity of the workers as generating inadvertent increases in productivity keyed around avoiding Taylorist surveillance and discipline. Their cooperation with each other is conducted with goals of carving out spaces of limited autonomy, rather than as a means of collaboration with management. The female workers reject the company-sponsored venues for suggesting changes in work practices, viewing them as overdetermined by race and gender. Their male, Korean managers are at best unresponsive to female suggestions and at worse view them as challenges to their authority.</p>
<p>Chapter 2’s videographers rely on definitions of professionalism even as their working conditions at the margins of the media industries render them a temporary and flexible workforce excluded from mainstream production practices and membership in production guilds. Mayer describes the wide range of practices within a rubric of professionalism as providing a kind of psychological wage that, partially, makes up for their marginal economic status. An identity as a professional distinguished these cameramen from tourists or office workers and, within limits, was a prerequisite for potentially moving into mainstream video production. Mayer rightly remains ambivalent about the actual opportunity for economic mobility created by these positions, as she does about defining one part of the professional skillset: the ability to convince young women to willingly disrobe on camera for little or no remuneration. Yet, her analysis makes clear that as soft-core pornography gained a place within the late night television programming schedule, a focus on titillation served to erase the conditions of production and the work of the cameramen.</p>
<p>Chapter 3’s casting agents are similarly situated as both exploiters and the exploited. Reality show participants receive little compensation, certainly far less than professional, trained actors. They are a cheap source of labor that the television industry relies on for its own profitability. The role of reality show casters is to seek out individuals who are both willing to provide low-cost labor and fit with the desired demographics of a given program. Casting agents perform a kind of emotional labor by cultivating relationships that allow them to produce the kinds of casts demanded by reality television production companies. They screen large numbers of potential applicants and create indexes of individuals that fit certain demographic profiles. They develop unique skills in evaluating how well an individual might fit into the cross-section of types desired by a given reality show producer. Moreover, like the cameramen, casting agents are kept at the margin of mainstream production professions. Their work is essential for creating casts that serve as demographic proxies for the viewing audiences of reality television programs, but the casting agent’s role ends when shooting starts, rendering it, Mayer argues, invisible in the final text. At the same time, they are ambivalent about their roles in producing what Mayer argues is a “cast as commodity.” In this way, the identities of reality show participants serve as a source of potential profit for the television industry. Reality show casting plays a crucial role in a new television economy that seeks new sources of inexpensive content, but as with Chapter 2’s cameramen, it involves inducing everyday people to volunteer to convert themselves into a commodity, whether soft-core pornography to be sold via late night infomercials or reality show participant.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayer looks at the labor performed by citizens who volunteer as representatives of the public before local cable governing boards. A by-product of agreements between cable providers and local governments, these boards assess the schedules (or potential schedules) of public-access channels. They are tasked with making the public access programming representative of their community. Here, Mayer draws on her own experience in San Antonio, Texas, and Irvine, California, to explore how board members speak as authorities for diverse groups of the public who seek representation on local cable access channels. Mayer notes that, although citizen cable regulators work for what they hope is the greater good, they share with the workers of earlier chapters a role of aiding the television industry in finding free labor and developing new markets. Likewise, class and professional identities can clash with the guiding principles of public rather than private interests, as boards evaluate both their own members and individuals who wish to go on the air.</p>
<p>There is much to recommend in this book. Although Mayer’s accounts of the challenges faced by Brazilian electronics workers will probably read as all too familiar to readers of this journal, situating these individuals within a context of media production represents a fresh and welcome perspective on the artifacts of popular culture. Her other case studies break new ground in making visible the atomized work worlds of decentralized media industries. As media production increasingly is available to everyday people, we need to recast our understanding of work and leisure as paid and unpaid labor. The remarkable insights gained from examining how these individuals understand their professional identities and work practices radically recalibrate our understanding of how media texts are created. In all of her case studies, Mayer shows how industrial organizations benefit from volunteer and self-guided labor. In the process, the workers’ recognition of their skills allows them to articulate the value of their creative labor, even as they were alienated from that labor by the exploitative conditions in which they work.</p>

<p>Finally, as Mayer notes in her conclusion, Hollywood serves an analogy for a species of creative labor touted by urbanist/consultants like Richard Florida as a means of rejuvenating postindustrial economies decimated by globalization. The insights into <italic>Below the Line</italic> speak to some of the working conditions that emerge when individuals take advantage of what they see as the possibility of a professional identity as media creator while cultural industries stand ready to exploit these personal and geographic identities to produce a wide variety of willing and docile workforces. As Mayer writes, “The aura of the creative professional in television operates to efface the ways in which capital captures all workers in a universal logic of accumulation while dividing them into categories based on conflict and contradiction” (pp. 176-177). No longer just producing an audience commodity for sale to advertisers or program content for sale to distributors, the new television economy gains value from the direct actions of everyday people. At the same time, however, Mayer’s respondents were often acutely uneasy about their own roles in categorizing others. Those moments stood in sharp contrast to the pride in their own skill and judgment, and ultimately, Mayer views them as fault lines for future engagement on the political economy of media production and as potential points of shared identification. Central to and yet marginalized from mainstream production practice, labor practices have heretofore been unaccounted for within media studies, even as media production workers have gone largely unnoticed in studies of labor. With more work like Mayer’s, they will not be in the future.</p>
