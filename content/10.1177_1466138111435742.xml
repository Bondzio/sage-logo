<abstract>
<p>From fascist prisons to Communist-era gulags, Romania does not simply have a history of torture, but also an existing infrastructure conducive to its practice. Romania, human rights organizations have made clear, hosted a number of ‘secret detention centers’ used by the US government in its program of ‘extraordinary rendition’, whereby intelligence agents illegally rendered, detained and tortured suspected terrorists. Both Romania’s gulags and its secret detention centers call to mind Giorgio Agamben’s notion of ‘the camp’ – an extra-juridical space where human life is reduced to its bare form – which is why this article pivots on a historical comparison between the two. While both gulags and extraordinary rendition share material infrastructure, and both were organized around the production and management of ‘bare life’, this article shows that rendition operates through a very different spatial logic than a gulag. As a result, survivors of these different spatial iterations of ‘the camp’ offer qualitatively different accounts of bare life. This observation allows ethnographers to extend Agamben’s analytical reach by spatially contextualizing the form, relations and kinds of violence taking shape inside ‘camps’, allowing theorists to think about bare life as a historically specific phenomenon.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1466138111435742" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>On 7 June 2006, the European Council’s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights published a report condemning the European Union’s involvement in the United States’ extraordinary rendition program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>). Made public during the George W. Bush administration – and still ongoing under President Barack Obama – ‘extraordinary rendition’ refers to an extra-juridical program through which a variety of intelligence agencies collaborate to arrest, transport and imprison suspected terrorists in secret detention centers worldwide. The report documents the inhumane treatment of rendered detainees that could easily be characterized as torture. Romania, the site of my own extended fieldwork, is, according to the report, a location both conducive to and deeply involved in the practice of rendition. From fascist prisons to Communist-era gulags, Romania does not simply have a history of torture, but also an existing infrastructure that could be mobilized for the purpose of rendition. The report’s findings, in fact, evidence all too perfectly Gorgio Agamben’s observation that we continue to find ourselves in the presence of ‘the camp’ – exceptional spaces where the institutions of citizenship, human rights and the law do not reach, and where its inhabitants, stripped of every political status and its protections, are reduced to their bare life (1998). Agamben defines bare life as a state of ‘the living dead’ against which crimes are not crimes; ‘the camp’ for Agamben presents itself as ‘an apparently innocuous space … that delimits a space in which the normal order is de facto suspended’ (1998: 174). Put together, ‘the camp’ is the space where bare life emerges.</p>
<p>At first glance, the extraordinary rendition program fits neatly within the analytical form of Agamben’s camp. Most obviously, secret detention centers organize the practice of rendition; these are prisons beyond any legal-juridical order in which the limits of abuse are checked only by the judgment of its administrators. Those inhabiting the detention center stand (literally) naked before the power of the intelligence agents who dominate them. Agamben’s theorization of ‘the camp’ invites us to conclude that extraordinary rendition produces the same kind of space as any other camp, say, for example, a Communist-era gulag: one in which bare life is made and dominated. ‘The camp’, for Agamben, is an enduring and timeless form – a ‘political black hole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138111435742">Minca, 2005</xref>: 406), or an ‘inscribed geography … that continually produces and dismembers spaces within which everything is, literally, possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111435742">Minca, 2006</xref>: 401). Yet upon further examination, extraordinary rendition, infrastructurally speaking, is not a camp at all, but rather a transnational network made up of detention centers, to be sure, but also roadways, flight patterns, hotels and airports. This network, furthermore, is not so much an innocuous backdrop, as Agamben suggests, but rather complicit in the violence of producing bare life itself. This is to say that bare life emerges not simply in an absolute space, but rather through a network of routes, rooms and roadways.</p>
<p>The space of bare life posed by extraordinary rendition, to put it simply, does not reflect that of a Communist-era gulag. Yet the heavily abstracted and ahistorical quality of Agamben’s work does not allow for these qualitative differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1466138111435742">Mesnard, 2004</xref>), prompting the criticism that Agamben reduces ‘the camp’ to a ‘one-dimensional abstraction of juridical logic’ that ‘closes off discourse about the specifics of [camps] at precisely the point that a study of political space really ought to contribute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138111435742">Comaroff, 2007</xref>: 387). Agamben’s insistence on framing ‘the camp’ as an ahistorical political form elides important ethnographic distinctions about the social and material differences that set one camp off from another. It also misses an opportunity to see camps as contextually specific sites whose particularities give insight into the wider political projects in which they are situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111435742">Benson, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1466138111435742">1</xref></sup> There is, then, something ethnographically unsatisfying about Agamben’s camp when posited as a conclusion. This article, in response, rethinks Agamben’s camp as a point of ethnographic departure – one that connects the abstract space of bare life to the specific spatial configurations of camps in their physical manifestation. Theoretically, this means placing Agamben in dialogue with other spatially minded, and more historically grounded, theorists of political power.</p>
<p>Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111435742">Foucault (1977)</xref> and Gilles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111435742">Deleuze and Félix Guattari (1987)</xref> come to mind as productive interlocutors for thinking through the different spatial iterations of ‘the camp’ in Romania – first as Communist-era gulags and then as detention centers for extraordinary rendition. The enclosed and segmented space of Romania’s Communist-era gulags, as described below, resonates with the space of a prison as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111435742">Foucault (1977)</xref>. By contrast, extraordinary rendition is not an enclosed space at all. Instead, ‘the camp’ of rendition is a transnational network of spaces. As the key case study of the European Council’s report makes clear, bare life does not emerge simply in the detention center but rather in preparation for the detention center, causing ‘the camp’ of rendition to work less like a prison and more like what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111435742">Deleuze and Guattari call a ‘rhizome’ (1987)</xref>, or a fleeting network of assemblages. The changing space of ‘the camp’ from a prison to a rhizome makes sense given that the rhizomatic camp of rendition is not a biopolitical feature of state socialism, like a gulag, but a new style of infrastructure designed to facilitate biopolitics on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138111435742">Amoore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435742">Medovoi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The ethnographic specificity of the rhizomatic camp becomes palpable when read, in the words of Ann Stoler, ‘along the archival grain’ of the European Council’s report, among other survivor testimonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138111435742">Stoler, 2010</xref>). Take Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese decent who was detained in 2003 during a trip to Skopje, Macedonia. Follow his passage through rendition’s infrastructure:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1466138111435742">2</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>After passing through several international border crossings without incident, Mr. El-Masri was detained at the Serbian-Macedonian border because of alleged irregularities with his passport. He was interrogated by Macedonian border officials, and then transported to a hotel in Skopje … Over the course of three weeks, Mr. El-Masri was repeatedly interrogated about alleged contacts with Islamic extremists, and was denied any contact with the German Embassy, an attorney or his family. He was told that if he confessed to Al-Qaeda membership, he would be returned to Germany. After 23 days of detention, Mr. El-Masri was videotaped, blindfolded and transported by vehicle to an airport. There, he was beaten, stripped naked and thrown to the ground. A hard object was forced into his anus. When his blindfold was removed, he saw seven or eight men, dressed in black and hooded. He was placed in a diaper and sweatsuit, blindfolded, shackled and hurried to a plane, where he was chained spread-eagled to the floor. He was injected with drugs and flown to Baghdad, then on to Kabul, Afghanistan … Upon arrival in Kabul, Mr. El-Masri was kicked and beaten and left in a filthy cell. There he would be detained for more than four months … [Upon determining his innocence] Mr. El-Masri was flown from Kabul to a country in Europe other than Germany. He was placed, blindfolded, into a truck and driven for several hours through mountainous terrain. He was given his belongings and told to walk down a path without turning back. Soon thereafter, he was confronted by armed men who told him he was in Albania and transported him to Mother Theresa Airport in Tirana. There, he was accompanied through customs and immigration controls and placed on a flight to Frankfurt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>: 24–26).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Rendition reduced El-Masri, and thousands of others, to bare life. Yet ‘the camp’ formed by rendition is not a singular place in the world as Agamben describes it to be; rather, it takes a specific spatial form. This article thus pivots on a historical comparison between two spatially different kinds of camps: the gulag and rendition. Through a heightened attention to the infrastructural space of these two kinds of camps, it intends to show how ethnographers can extend Agamben’s analytical reach by spatially contextualizing the form, relations and kinds of violence taking shape inside ‘camps’. This observation is important because it allows theorists to think about bare life – life reduced to its biological fact – as a historically specific phenomenon situated within specific political projects rather than as a universal phenomenon.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1466138111435742"><title>Agamben and the gulag</title>
<p>In August 1948, the Romanian People’s Republic established the Direcţia Generală Securităţii Poporului,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1466138111435742">3</xref></sup> or the <italic>Securitate</italic> for short. Modeled directly from the Soviet Union’s KGB, the <italic>Securitate</italic> functioned as Romania’s secret police for decades. Its dissolution came in 1989, following the violent overthrow of the then Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu. Yet, for 40 years the Romanian Communist Party (RCP) used the <italic>Securitate</italic> as its ‘edge of the sword’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1466138111435742">Boldur-Lăţescu, 2005</xref>), charging the organization with ‘ensuring the security of the Romanian People’s Republic against the plotting of internal and external enemies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1466138111435742">Deletant, 1995</xref>: 17–18). The <italic>Securitate</italic> defined these enemies, more or less, as those critical of the RCP and its initiatives. While nearly all Communist countries maintained a secret police, the <italic>Securitate</italic> was distinct for its size and scope. For one, the <italic>Securitate</italic> is considered to have been the largest in Eastern Europe with an estimated 2,000,000 people on its payroll, or roughly 10 percent of the Romanian population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1466138111435742">4</xref></sup> This estimate includes full-fledged agents as well as part-time informants. Each reported on the activities of family, friends and neighbors either out of fear, coercion or in the hopes of coming into the RCP’s good graces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111435742">Bacon, 1984</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>With its wide reach and seemingly ubiquitous presence, the <italic>Securitate</italic> carried out a Stalinist program of political terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111435742">Tismăneanu, 2006</xref>). This terror achieved two periods of particular intensity. The first was under the dictatorship of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (1948–1965), while the second occurred under Nicolae Ceauşescu (1978–1989). In both instances, the <italic>Securitate</italic> targeted intellectuals, students, political opponents of the party and other dissidents broadly conceived. Estimates made by Western experts indicate that, at its height, the <italic>Securitate</italic> oversaw 180,000 forced laborers and a total of 1.1 million distinct political detainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111435742">Bacon, 1984</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1466138111435742">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>Securitate</italic> detained these forced laborers and political prisoners within a constellation of gulags located throughout Romania (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1466138111435742">Figure 1</xref>). With at least 120 sites, these gulags had (and still have) three points of condensation. The first is around the capital city, Bucharest, which is near Romania’s southern border. The second is near the Danube Delta, along Romania’s southeastern border. The third is along the Carpathian Mountains in northern Romania. The <italic>Securitate</italic> connected these gulags administratively, each under the auspice of the Romanian Communist Party. Comparable forms of deprivation, conscripted labor, torture and executions, among other indignities, occurred at each site, and the <italic>Securitate</italic> moved prisoners between detention centers when deemed necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111435742">Tismăneanu, 2006</xref>). These interconnections, from a certain perspective, suggest that bureaucracy connected each point in the gulag archipelago. They shared staff, regulations, procedures and information. It is important to note, however, that each gulag functioned as a discrete point within the system. The <italic>Securitate</italic>, for example, did not transfer each detainee weekly, monthly or even yearly. The workings of the gulag did not require detainees to move between detention centers. Movement was more the exception than the rule. Furthermore, while certain prisons were more notorious for their crimes than others, the workings of one prison did not complement or complete the workings of another. Individual prisons did not exist in symbiotic or holistic relationships. Every site contained within its own walls the necessary elements to produce and to support what Agamben calls ‘bare life’.

</p>
<p>At its most basic, ‘bare life’ refers to life stripped of every social protection, rendering life subject to exercises of all kinds of violence without having committed a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435742">Agamben, 1998</xref>). Agamben develops the notion of bare life out of an obscure figure of Roman law – the <italic>homo sacer –</italic> whose inclusion within the political order is limited to his or her exclusion from the political order. Quoting Pompeius Festus, Agamben wrote, ‘The [<italic>homo sacer</italic>] is the one whom the people have judged on account of a crime. It is not permitted to sacrifice this man, yet he who kills him will not be condemned for homicide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435742">Agamben, 1998</xref>: 71). By sovereign decree, the <italic>homo sacer</italic> became life situated outside the law, and in turn, rendered ‘bare’ of its protections. Once reduced to a biological fact (zoë), bare life can be tortured or killed without legal recourse. Bare life exists as the ‘living dead’ caught within a ‘zone of indistinction’ – a liminal space that is both lawless and yet created by law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435742">Agamben, 1998</xref>: 174). It is within this legal zone of indistinction that the space of ‘the camp’ emerges – the physical place where life in its bare form comes to be dominated.</p>
<p>The production of bare life relies not only upon legal and social practices, but also on infrastructure. This becomes evident when examining the lived space of Romania’s Communist-era gulags. While much of the inner workings of gulags remain restricted within government archives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435742">Tănăsoiu, 2007</xref>), survivors’ testimonies from Romania’s most notorious prisons narrate clearly the infrastructure of the Romanian gulag. Two book-length memoirs are particularly useful in this regard. The first is Dumitru Bacu’s account of the so-called Piteşti prison experiment. The second is by the Romanian historian Constantin Giurescu, who spent five years in the notorious Sighet prison. The opening pages of Giurescu’s account explain that he landed in the gulag because he had written a history of Romania that ultimately fell out of favor with the Communist Party. The <italic>Securitate</italic> then arrested him in the middle of the night, dragged him out of his Bucharest home and transported him by van to Sighet Penitentiary, where he spent more than five years as a political detainee. He recounts his initial impressions of Sighet, echoing in powerful ways Agamben’s own sense of ‘the camp’ as a neutral backdrop with distinct borders:<disp-quote>
<p>I realize immediately that we are in a large prison, with a ground floor and two upper floors. (1994: 22)</p>
<p>[From the outside] the building is massive; the rows of barred windows give it a grim aspect. We are led one by one [indoors and] into a long and high room, it is the height of the entire building, which looks like the nave of a gothic church. On the right and on the left there are doors covered with iron and having heavy bolts; exactly above them, on the second and third floors, there are identical doors. A wooden catwalk gives access to the doors on each floor; at about twelve feet – the height of the first floor – a net made of thick wire covers the entire room: this is in order to prevent prisoners from committing suicide by leaping from the second or third floor. When you see all this a chill runs up your spine. (1994: 25–26)</p>
<p>The building was imposing in its proportions: the ground floor and two upper floors – around forty-eight feet high – occupied a rectangle bordered on all sides by streets … The building reserved for the political prisoners – that in which I stayed from 1950–1955 – is T-shaped; it is made up of a main body which is the base of the ‘T’, running from east to west, and the second section, representing the toe of the ‘T’, running from north to south … the big number of individual cells in Sighet offered – and continues to offer today – the possibility of strict isolation for large numbers of prisoners. (1994: 47)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In very clear ways, the infrastructural elements of the gulag reflect key aspects of Agamben’s camp: a geographically rooted and defined point ‘in which the normal [legal] order is de facto suspended and in which whether or not atrocities are committed depends not on law but on the civility and ethical sense of the police who temporarily act as sovereign’ (1998: 174). The infrastructure of the Sighet prison provides the <italic>Securitate</italic> with a secured space for the production and control of bare life. Yet Dumitru Bacu’s descriptions of the Piteşti prison offers insight into some of the ways that the Romanian gulag, as a physically manifested space of bare life, pushed back against Agamben’s timeless and heavily abstracted formation. What emerges from Bacu’s account is a description of a camp as a container in which guards could carry out horrific practices or ‘experiments’, but as is also evident, the Romanian gulag served additional functions. As an apparatus of Romanian Socialism, ‘the camp’ also produced and regulated population segments beyond bare life, marking the gulag as a more dynamic kind of camp than Agamben allows. Bacu describes Piteşti as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Situated to the northwest, outside the town limits, close to a small river and far from any dwelling, [the Piteşti prison] was a location almost ideal for torture, since no scream from within its walls could be heard by outsiders. (1971: 31)</p>
<p>In this [Center for Student Re-education at Piteşti] were brought together all students arrested up to the fall of 1948. They were divided into four categories according to the classification given [to them] when sentenced … In theory, this was the classification according to the gravity of the offense that is practiced in prisons all over the world. But in practice, this classification and segregation served to isolate the categories from one another, isolating the less ‘contaminated’ from the ‘fanatics.’ Those caught [interacting with persons from other categories] were sent to ‘<italic>cazinca</italic>,’ a special room in the prison’s cellar full of dirt, with walls permanently dripping with moisture. (1971: 32)</p>
<p>On the northern edge of the prison building, on the ground floor, there is a room bearing the number 4. Initially it was meant for the sick; that is why it retained the name and was known to the prisoners as ‘Hospital Room Four.’ This room, fairly large, was selected for beginning the experiment for it was secluded from the cells in which the students were confined. (1971: 33)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The gulag was a secured space that was consciously set apart from the world beyond its walls. As Agamben’s general framework for ‘the camp’ would suggest, the gulag was an enclosed and isolated space of exception. Yet this iteration of ‘the camp’, while producing bare life, was also about more than bare life; the Romanian gulag needed to isolate political dissidents from the general population and to reform them into loyal Communists. This wider project of subject (re)formation required this iteration of ‘the camp’ to not just render lives bare for the purposes of breaking resistance but to support and regulate bodies before and afterwards. Contained within the Romanian gulag’s biopolitical project of sovereign distinction ran a parallel and integrated biopolitical program of governmental regulation. The gulag’s internal division of space lent itself to this dual project, ensuring, for example, that new or extreme detainees did not contaminate the less extreme, or that the general population did not interfere with the rendering of bare life. To that end, the gulag, as an architectural form, was divided into wings, floors and cells. These spatial divisions facilitated the segmentation of detainees into sub-populations, which, in turn, could be compartmentalized in different parts of the prison. This compartmentalization made possible a variety of practices: observation of the detained, their differentiation into different categories or sub-populations, the management of different sub-populations through different sets of techniques and the ability to locate certain activities, such as eating, washing or torturing, in particular places within the prison.</p>
<p>In this sense, infrastructurally speaking, the Romanian gulag functioned like any other prison, ‘fixing [the detained] in space, classifying them, extracting from them the maximum in time and forces, training their bodies, coding their continuous behavior, maintaining them in perfect visibility, forming around them an apparatus of observation, registration and recording, etc.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111435742">Foucault, 1977</xref>: 231). Unlike a regular prison, however, the gulag existed outside of the normal legal-juridical order. The gulag did not enforce the order of law so much as create its own, turning the gulag into a zone of sovereign distinction as described by Agamben. It was an exercise of sovereign authority made possible by infrastructure: walls fixed the space of sovereignty’s reach, expanding the discretion of administers and guards to act against segments of the detained, but only within prescribed areas of the prison. Following the remarkable intertwining of the Gulag’s dual biopolitical project – one that mixes Foucault’s logic of governmental regulation with Agamben’s logic of sovereign distinction – the exceptional space of the gulag was, in actuality, not all that exceptional. Over 100 gulags existed in Communist Romania, representing the literalization of Michel Foucault’s notion of the ‘carceral archipelago’, whereby clusters of prisons comprised the social landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111435742">Foucault, 1977</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1466138111435742">6</xref></sup> This gulag archipelago illustrates the claim that even free citizens constantly find themselves, consciously or not, in the presence of ‘the camp’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435742">Agamben, 1998</xref>: 174).</p>

<p>On 2 November 2005, <italic>The Washington Post</italic> reported that the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was ‘hiding and interrogating some of its most important al Qaeda captives at a Soviet-era compound in Eastern Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111435742">Priest, 2005</xref>). As the story unfolded over the coming months, major media outlets such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the <italic>Financial Times</italic> and the <italic>New York Times</italic> reported that the secret detention program, dubbed here as ‘extraordinary rendition’, extended well beyond a single compound. Dozens of sites existed in Romania, Poland, North Africa and in the Middle East. American intelligence agents, the news coverage continued, colluded with no fewer than 14 European Union countries to abduct, transfer and detain (at times, indefinitely) suspected terrorists in and between these detention centers. Amid this network of so-called black sites, CIA operatives subjected detainees to what the Bush administration admitted as being ‘harsh interrogation practices’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1466138111435742">7</xref></sup> International human rights organizations condemned these interrogation practices as torture, calling them inhumane and even deadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138111435742">Amnesty International, 2008</xref>). Much like the Communist gulags described above, conditions inside these detention centers existed (and continue to exist) outside the regular rule of law. As <italic>The Washington Post</italic> reported:<disp-quote>
<p>The CIA and the White House, citing national security concerns and the value of the [extraordinary rendition] program, have dissuaded Congress from demanding that the agency answer questions in open testimony about the conditions under which captives are held. Virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the facilities, what interrogation methods are employed within them, or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111435742">Priest, 2005</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As the story evolved, new details emerged about these secret detention centers. The <italic>New York Times</italic> reported that:<disp-quote>
<p>One jail was a renovated building on a busy street in Bucharest, Romania … Another was a steel-beam structure at a remote site in Morocco … [and another] was outside a former Eastern bloc city. They were designed to appear identical, so prisoners would be disorientated and not know where they were if they were shuttled back and forth. [The detained] were kept in isolated cells … Nothing exotic was required for the infamous water-boards – they were built on the spot from locally available materials, [CIA] officials said. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111435742">Mazzetti, 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Fifteen years after the dissolution of the Romanian People’s Republic and the Communist gulag, ‘the camp’ has once again re-emerged in Romania. Drawing upon a similar (if not at times the very same) set of prisons and military bases, intelligence officials established spaces of sovereign authority situated outside of the normal juridical order to produce and to dominate bare life. While exhibiting a variety of continuities with Communist-era gulags, however, extraordinary rendition in and beyond post-Communist Romania results in a very different kind of camp that works through a very different set of spatial and infrastructural circumstances. Specifically, ‘the camp’ embodied by the Romanian gulag worked, at the level of material infrastructure, as a vast, enclosed and geographically rooted environment. Once inside the gulag, sovereign power reigned supreme. Officials determined who lived within that space and under what conditions.</p>
<p>The camp created by rendition, in contrast, works less like a prison and more like a rhizomorphic structure, or a system of interconnections caught in a persistent state of <italic>de-territorialization</italic>, or the uprooting of spatial relations to facilitate changing patterns, and <italic>re-territorialization</italic>, or the re-implanting of relations in space to facilitate new and more pliant patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111435742">Deleuze and Guattari, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138111435742">Massumi, 1992</xref>). Rendition de-territorializes the largely fixed infrastructure of ‘the camp’ as embodied by the gulag in the sense that ‘the camp’ of rendition becomes spatially fluid, rather than geographically anchored, covering an ever-shifting terrain that stretches across national borders. Yet at the same time, rendition constantly re-territorializes ‘the camp’ as intelligence officers appropriate new spaces (such as hotel rooms, airport lounges and minivans) while relinquishing other spaces. This camp’s presence and its parameters are fleeting, fluid and trans-national; it expands and contracts, appears and disappears, moves from one space to another just as the detainees themselves get ‘shuttled’ within it. The rhizomorphic structure of rendition causes ‘the camp’ to work differently than that of the gulag in that rendition works not by being caught inside the walls of ‘the camp’, but by being forced to pass through an ever-changing assemblage of transnational spaces. Extraordinary rendition detaches the carceral space of the gulag so that ‘the camp’ can float freely, even transcending political boundaries. This means, at the level of infrastructure, appropriating the architecture of the gulag without being restricted by its confines.</p>
<p>This rhizomorphic description of ‘the camp’ makes sense when one recalls this essay’s opening vignette, which tells the story of Khaled El-Masri. ‘The camp’ experienced by El-Masri was not a space where intelligence agents placed him. Instead, ‘the camp’ of rendition worked as a circuit that intelligence agents forced El-Masri to pass through. This circuit is fluid by his account; it involves the temporary appropriation of airport lounges and hotel rooms for stripping, humiliating and torturing the detained in preparation for the next space and the sets of practices waiting within them. Once passed through, these back rooms get reinserted into the regular order of things, processing luggage and tourists rather than producing bare life. The infrastructure of rendition is made knowable through the Council of Europe’s report discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>). The report describes circuits through which intelligence officers abduct suspected terrorists off the streets and render them to undisclosed, CIA-administered detention centers. Additional detention facilities administered by the US military supplement these sites, including the infamous US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>). The report highlights four types of nodes within this rhizomorphic set of infrastructures that ultimately connect the detention center to the streets. Each of these nodes centers upon air travel, particularly airplanes, ports and hangers. Implied by the report is the situation of these nodes within a wider set of immediate infrastructures, such as roadways, vans, hotels and restaurants, to feed, house and otherwise care for rendition crews.</p>
<p>The first nodes of rendition listed by the Council of Europe’s report are so-called <italic>stopover points</italic>. These are spaces where aircraft land to refuel before, during and after a rendition. The second kind of nodes are <italic>staging points</italic>, where rendition crews prepare and launch operations. Then there are <italic>detainee transfer points</italic>, where rendition flights stop for short periods of time to move detainees from the airplane to a caravan, which brings the detained to a holding center. Finally, the report identifies <italic>one-off pick-up points</italic>, which function like a transfer point, although these sites are infrequently used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>). CIA-operated flights connect these nodes, in various and changing ways, to make circuits. Circuits are more or less regularized flight paths between stopover, staging and transfer points. Their points of connection change in response to particular circumstances or emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>). The report identifies Romania as ‘the only Council of Europe member State to be located on one of the rendition circuits we believe we have identified and which bears all the characteristics of a detainee transfer or drop-off point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>: 17). The report specifically points to the frequent usage by CIA planes of airports in Bucharest and Timişoara. The report continues:<disp-quote>
<p>Certain flights were made between known detention centers and the suspected places in Poland and Romania. The geographical position of these places making them unlikely to be used for re-fuelling, the period spent on the ground in these places by these aircraft, and in particular the fact that the landings in question belong to well-established ‘rendition circuits’, allow us to suspect that they are or were places of detention which form part of the [rendition program] referred to above. (2006: 48)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The report goes on to provide a generalized description of rendition. The description focuses primarily on the processing of detained persons. This is the moment when the local authorities who abduct the victim transfer him into the control of the CIA. Processing occurs in places like airport lounges or hotel rooms, evincing how ‘the camp’ momentarily emerges and then disappears within everyday spaces. Once the detained is in the CIA’s control, intelligence agents move him through a series of additional flights and van rides that eventually lead to a secret detention center. Within the circuit, as is shown below, agents reduce the detained to his or her bare life in preparation for the detention center rather than at the detention center itself. This demonstrates, at the level of infrastructure, that the exceptional space of ‘the camp’ stretches well beyond the confines of the gulag and into the mundane corners of everyday places.</p>
<p>As the report details, rendition begins with the abduction of the detained, usually by officials from the country where the abduction took place. The detained person, referred to in the Council of Europe’s report simply as ‘the man’, is shackled, blindfolded and then brought to an airport or hotel room. In this space, the detained undergoes a ‘security check’, where local authorities hand the detained over to the CIA. The report describes the process as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>[The security check] takes place in a small room (a locker room, a police reception area) at the airport, or at a transit facility nearby. The man [i.e. the detained] is sometimes already blindfolded when the operation begins, or will be blindfolded quickly and remain so throughout most of the operation. Four to six CIA agents perform the operation in a highly disciplined, consistent fashion … Some men speak of being punched or shoved by the agents at the beginning of the operation in a rough or brutal fashion; others talked about being gripped firmly from several sides … The man has all his clothes (including his underwear) cut from his body using knives or scissors in a careful, methodical fashion … The man is subjected to a full-body cavity search, which also entails a close examination of his hair, ears, mouth and lips. The man is photographed with a flash camera, including when he is nearly or totally naked … Some accounts speak of a foreign object being forcibly inserted into the man’s anus; some accounts speak more specifically of a tranquilizer or suppository being administered <italic>per rectum</italic> … The man is then dressed in a nappy or incontinence pad and a loose fitting ‘jump-suit’ or set of overalls … The man has his ears muffled, sometimes being made to wear a pair of ‘headphones.’ Finally a cloth bag is placed over the man’s head, with no holes through which to breathe or detect light … The man is typically forced aboard a waiting airplane, where he may be ‘placed on a stretcher, shackled’, or strapped to a mattress or seat … Factors such as the pain of the shackles or the refusal to drink water or use the toilet make the flight unbearable. [As one rendition survivor commented]: ‘this was the hardest moment in my life.’ In most cases, the man has no notion of where he is going, nor the fate that awaits him upon arrival. (2006: 22–23)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>‘The camp’ that emerges through these practices of extraordinary rendition is rhizomorphic. Intelligence officers produce bare life, not in one space or another, but by passing through an ever changing circuit of backrooms, cargo planes, security vans and detention centers in such a way that one space readies the detained for the practices of domination waiting in another. The workings of this kind of camp rely on dynamic sets of infrastructure, not only to contain bodies, but also to move them in desired ways. ‘The camp’ produced by rendition signals an evolution in the architecture of discipline described by Foucault and embodied by the Communist gulag. The CIA’s extraordinary rendition program rendered ‘the camp’ uprooted, transnationally mobile and ever more diffused into the spaces of everyday life. This mutation of space is important to contrast against the gulag’s permanence as it represents an escalation of scale in the practice of biopolitics. Whereas the gulag created bare life within, and for the ‘protection’ of, the nation-state, extraordinary rendition represents a transnationally coordinated practice of biopolitics, one in which a collaborative ‘global society’ wages war against terrorist threats from within global society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435742">Medovoi, 2007</xref>). In this sense, rendition invokes a different spatial organization of ‘the camp’ vis-à-vis the gulag in response to the very different kind of political project in which it is situated. In turn these camps, as will soon be evident, produced different kinds of bare life to suit their very different political ends.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1466138111435742"><title>The spatial specificity of bare life</title><disp-quote>
<p>[The] essence of the camp consists in the materialization of the state of exception and in the subsequent creation of a space in which bare life and the juridical rule enter into a threshold of indistinction … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435742">Agamben, 1998</xref>: 174)</p></disp-quote>
<p>This article aims to infuse Giorgio Agamben’s theory of ‘the camp’ with greater spatial specificity by reflecting upon the materiality of two different iterations of ‘the camp’ – their physical space and their underlying infrastructure. A camp’s geographical placement, internal organization, infrastructural capacities and the relationships between its interior and exterior spaces cause one camp (such as a gulag) to look and to work differently than another kind of camp (such as the rhizome of extraordinary rendition). Extending this observation further, it is important to note that the material differences between these two different kinds of camps shape the kinds of violence that occur within them, causing bare life to come into being in qualitatively different ways. While survivor testimonies from different kinds of camps undoubtedly have shared elements, victims still narrate their torture, domination and bare self in ethnographically distinct ways. The specificities of each camp’s space, shaped by the wider political projects in which they are situated, go a great way to revealing the particularity of bare life. This becomes evident when comparing the testimonies of victims from Romania’s Communist-era gulags and those from the CIA’s program of rendition. While both iterations of ‘the camp’ evidence what Giorgio Agamben calls bare life, their accounts point to different practices, spaces and experiences. The bare life that results from each camp exhibits specific characteristics that distinguish the suffering of one group of victims from that of another.</p>
<p>As a case in point, consider the following account of the re-education program at the Piteşti Prison offered by a former inmate named Banu Rădulescu. This account is representative of dozens of others from Romania’s gulags, though is particularly elucidating because of its detail and succinctness. Rădulescu’s account describes the gulag as a place where guards and others stripped its inhabitants of their humanity so as to rebuild them into loyal Communists. He describes the process as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Once transferred to Hospital Room No 4, the [prisoner] was gently lulled into a false sense of security by the kindness of those he took for fellow inmates … Then, without warning, heralded by a torrent of blows that woke him from sleep, the torture began … Night after night, he would be beaten to a pulp by these same inmates, his only respite their exhaustion. He would try repeatedly to discover the reason for the abuse [to one day learn that] his crime had been against the Communist Party … The purpose of his visit was ‘re-education’; the methods used to help him repent the error of his ways would open the door to the ever-welcoming arms of the Party … It could take weeks to [fully confess]. And in the meantime, he was forced to witness the latest inmates in Hospital Room 4 being subjected to the same brutality he had just passed through. Woe betides him if he showed the slightest compassion; it would invalidate his confession and his own torture would start all over again … [There was] a final series of tortures designed to humiliate … These bizarre tortures centered round the prisoner and his excrement: his head was forced down the latrine until he choked on it; he was forced to shit on his plate and eat it with his meager diet; if he vomited excrement he was made to lick it from the floor … Christians were forced to blaspheme and to mock their faith; imaginary and scabrous stories of incest in their family fed the salacious appetite of the chief executioner and his assistants as they rummaged in the most intimate and precious moments of their victims’ lives … All that had once defined refinement, education, spirituality, that made people human, had to be demolished and the new man built on this wasteland … (1992: 37)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Rădulescu’s account shows quite clearly the kind of bare life that the space of the gulag produced. The Communist gulag functioned as a geographically anchored place set apart from its surroundings. The gulag’s internal order is yet another series of geographically rooted spaces that lent itself to a particular set of social practices and dynamics. In this instance, guards led the victim into a place marked ‘Hospital Room No 4’. Within the enclosed walls of the room, which in turn are enclosed by the walls of the prison, the victim could go nowhere. He became an unwilling member of an enclosed community, and each member had his part. The lead organizer oversaw the torture while the re-educated prisoners carried out the actual torturing, monitoring themselves and one another in the process to ensure that each punishment was enthusiastically administered. Of course, there were also the community’s newest members: the tortured. ‘The camp’ created a community that enabled bare life to be produced in a personal and personalized way. Within the room’s confines, victims came to know their abusers just as abusers came to know their victims, and most crucially, how to victimize them in a tailored way. The abusers reserved blaspheme for the faithful and defilement for the retentive. It is through these reflexive agonies that people’s social selves withered away only to be remade anew. As with any community, its members advanced through the social structure. After being reduced to their bare life, onetime victims demonstrated their refashioning as faithful Communists by doling out the torture to the next round of victims. Those who properly demonstrated their re-education in this way then moved back into the general prison population. Guards and administrators alike created this community with a very particular kind of bare life in mind: a dehumanized subject that could be reconstituted into a fully faithful supporter of the Romanian Communist Party. The gulag dominated life in the hopes of molding it into a new kind of subject.</p>
<p>The bare life resulting from extraordinary rendition, by contrast, works through a very different kind of space and set of practices to produce a qualitatively different experience. Consider, for example, the rendition of Binyam Mohamed al Habashi. Binyam is an Ethiopian citizen who had held resident status in the United Kingdom since 1994. The Council of Europe’s report on rendition indicates that Binyam underwent his first of two renditions in July 2002. Binyam’s testimony of rendition begins by being handled by a group of five or so unidentified people:<disp-quote>
<p>Dressed in black, with masks, wearing what looked like Timberland boots. [This is how Binyam] describes how they ‘stripped him naked, took photos, put fingers up his anus and dressed him in a tracksuit. He was shackled, with earphones, and blindfolded,’ before being forced onto an aircraft and flown to Morocco … Binyam’s testimony describes various secret detention facilities in which he was held in Morocco, including one prison that was submerged ‘<italic>almost underground’</italic> … Binyam described his ill-treatment in Morocco to his lawyer in several phases: an initial ‘softening up’; a routine ‘circle of torture’; and eventually a ‘heavy’ abuse involving mental torment and the infliction of physical injury. At its worst, the torture involved stripping Binyam naked and using a doctor’s scalpel to make incisions all over his chest and other parts of his body [including his penis]. Binyam says he was subjected to a second clandestine transfer on the night of 21 January 2004. He was once again cuffed, blindfolded and searched. Binyam was then flown to Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was held in the facility he refers to as ‘The Prison of Darkness’ [where he] was not allowed to see daylight. In a detention facility at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, Binyam was forced to write out a lengthy statement prepared by the Americans. [At the time of the testimony’s publication by the Council of Europe, Binyam remained in detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]. The only certain legacy of this case is the deeply disturbing recognition that a human being has, in his own words, been completely de-humanized: ‘<italic>I’m sorry I have no emotion when talking about the past, ‘cause I have closed. You have to figure out all the emotional part; I’m kind of dead in the head.’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435742">Marty, 2006</xref>: 44–47)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The space of rendition shaped a very different experience of bare life for Binyam. His torture occurs not in a stable, enclosed environment, but while passing through a transnational series of temporarily connected spaces. Binyam is constantly put into motion, undergoing tortures in one local to prepare him for the tortures of another. These spaces and practices leave Binyam isolated at the scale of the individual: he is undergoing his own personal hell. This hell, furthermore, is spatially dislocated and disorientating. As the account shows, Binyam often does not know (literally) where in the world he is. Binyam must locate himself to himself (and those advocating for him) within the rhizomatic structure of ‘the camp’ by inventing his own set of spatial designations. Clandestine detention centers, for example, take on mythic aliases, such as ‘The Prison of Darkness’. Likewise, Binyam does not know who it is that administers his torture. As his location changes so too do the interrogators. Binyam does not develop a relationship with his captors although his captors continually develop Binyam’s file, adding to it any new confessions, evidence or information that interrogation brings forward. The overarching aim of this camp is a totalizing domination of Binyam in the hopes of controlling the actions of those he is allegedly involved with: the interrogators must know everything that Binyam knows and does not know for the sake of preventing potential, future terrorist acts. A global community produces bare life for the sake of protecting itself from the threat of terrorism. Unlike the gulag before it, the subjectivity of those rendered bare is of peripheral concern.</p>
<p>Binyam Mohamed al Habashi’s and Banu Rădulescu’s survivor accounts point to the ways in which space and practice converge to shape the workings of any one camp. While both testimonials point to systemic torture resulting in the death of a social self, the space of the gulag and that of rendition work to bring about bare life in different ways and towards different ends. In the account offered by Rădulescu, the space of ‘the camp’ was the space of the prison. ‘The camp’ worked as an environment of enclosure that sought to discipline the wayward Communist subject into a loyal supporter of the Romanian Communist Party. In Binyam’s account, by contrast, the space of ‘the camp’ stretched far beyond the walls of the prison to connect up with airplanes and vans, break-rooms and hotels. The form of ‘the camp’ changed constantly, as did Binyam’s location within it. Binyam, as is the case in other accounts of rendition, is often unable to place himself within a particular nation’s borders much less name the city or building of his detention. Binyam’s movement through ‘the camp’ produced a death of his social self; however, this death was not one moment in a larger project of discipline; nor was it a precursor to entering into a new social role or subjectivity as was the experience for Rădulescu. Instead, Binyam’s reduction to bare life was a brutal act of a global society defending itself from the seemingly uncontrollable ‘threat of terrorism’. Binyam was squeezed for information and then discarded.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1466138111435742"><title>Conclusion: Non-places and the banality of evil</title>
<p>At first glance, the insertion of Communist-era gulags into the United States’ extraordinary rendition program might seem to indicate continuity between the two institutions. At the same time, however, the appropriation of Romania’s Communist-era facilities and their insertion into a trans-national network of torture and abuse marks an evolution in the space, practice and function of ‘the camp’ that is as dynamic as it is worrying. Indeed, extraordinary rendition’s capacity to extend beyond the walls of the prison to incorporate and dis-incorporate everyday lived spaces signals a movement beyond Agamben’s original description of ‘the camp’ as a kind of enclosed environment. Instead, at the level of infrastructure, ‘the camp’ is evolving towards a mechanism within what Gilles Deleuze calls a ‘society of control’ (1992). While the environment of enclosure disciplines, molds, shapes and casts its inhabitants, Deleuze argues, societies of control ‘are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point’ (1992: 4). The space of the rhizomorphic camp of rendition does as much: its coordinates are shifting and pliable, its scope is transnational and its inhabitants constantly move through it. Unlike the gulag, this camp does not seek to re-educate or re-shape the individual but to extract information in the hopes of not only controlling the informant but, more importantly, to control a larger geo-political landscape marked by the seemingly uncontrollable presence of terrorism. ‘The camp’ that bends beyond the environment of enclosure and towards the society of control is impermanent, yet ever more stable. It applies un-giving pressure on those caught within its milieu, but at the same time grows ever more difficult to see. ‘The camp’ is everywhere. Yet ‘the camp’ cannot be located anywhere. ‘The camp’ does not appear in the middle of Times Square, a gallery of the Louvre or in the main terminal of San Francisco International Airport; however, ‘the camp’ could very well thrive in the ‘non-places’ sprinkled within and around these locals. These non-places are the generic and highly functional spaces that we pass through without establishing significant social or historical relations with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111435742">Augé, 2009</xref>), such as bathrooms, waiting lounges, motels, etc. Non-places are the necessary, yet anonymous, crevices integrated within the places where we work, shop, travel and socialize. Absolutely essential to the workings of modern landscapes, these non-places nevertheless escape our serious attention or observation. Within the spatial politics of rendition, non-places take on added significance as the ideal infrastructural site for a new kind of camp, which is so thoroughly integrated into the everyday lived spaces beyond the walls of prisons and gulags as to appear impossibly banal. In a far deeper way than Agamben predicted, this camp appears all around us; however, ‘the camp’ of rendition cannot be recognized, located or commented upon in the same way as the gulag archipelago. It is in large part the banality of rendition’s wider infrastructure – its interchangeable sets of relations between non-places – that makes the violence of rendition not just possible but largely unnoticeable and highly sustainable.</p>
<p>Rendition’s appropriation of non-places as the infrastructure and site of its camp exemplifies the spatialization of Hannah Arendt’s claim that the evil presented in a mundane guise is worse than when presented in all of its horror. This is because banal forms of violence are ‘word-and-thought-defying’ (1992: 252). Though banal abuses result in spectacular forms of violence, they occur in ways that appear unrecognizable and, as a result, become difficult to resist. ‘The camp’ goes unseen, placing its abuses beyond the sphere of what can be articulated. Except for those who are immediately involved – the tortured and the torturers – it is as if ‘the camp’ never happened. Its material traces are not erased through time or by intervention but are simply located where no one is likely to see them. The banality of it all gives way not to protest but to a simple yet pernicious lack of awareness.</p>
<p>All too easily, the non-place of infrastructure goes unnoticed in ethnographic accounts of the political economy of violence and suffering. This presents a missed site for anthropological reflection and activism alike, leaving clouded the effects of various relations between peoples and things and how these relations might be changed to bring about better ends. It also presents a methodological challenge for anthropology. As ethnographers, we are well prepared to think through the historical, social and economic relations that converge on top of marginalized persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111435742">Bourdieu, 2000</xref>). Yet, to meticulously document and analyze the complex workings of structured violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111435742">Farmer, 2004</xref>), this article demonstrates the need to also consider how historical, social and economic relations of abuse materialize in, and work through, infrastructural forms. From systems of roadways, airports and prisons, infrastructure makes certain practices of abuse possible (as opposed to others), shaping the ways that the violence and victimization of ‘the camp’ get experienced and narrated. Ultimately, the non-place of infrastructure that delimits the material space of ‘the camp’ is not ‘apparently innocuous’ as Agamben’s theorization presupposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435742">Agamben, 1998</xref>: 174). The space of ‘the camp’ is not an empty container inside which social practices occur. In stark contrast to the gulag, rendition produces a kind of camp that comes into being through complex spatial dis-articulations and re-articulations. Subsequently, its social practices lean upon a certain spatial sensibility, one that marks the non-place of infrastructure as a critical site for advancing our understanding of the violence of present-day camps.</p>

Regardless, Romanians under Communism believed the <italic>Securitate</italic> to be a large and pervasive police force that was well-diffused into the daily lives of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1466138111435742">Deletant, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138111435742">Tismăneanu, 2003</xref>).

<fn id="fn6-1466138111435742"><label>6</label><p>In <italic>Discipline and Punish</italic>, Michel Foucault develops the carceral archipelago in a theoretically different way than I use here. For Foucault, the carceral archipelago refers to the generalizability of the prison’s techniques of discipline to other modern institutions, such as schools, hospitals and barracks. As these other institutions came to function more like prisons, society turned into ‘clusters of prisons’. The gulag represents a literal example of the carceral archipelago as actual prisons scattered throughout Communist Romania.</p></fn>
