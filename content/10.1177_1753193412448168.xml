<p>Great national events have many unintended consequences. The tragedy of war has frequently seen advances in the surgical management of skeletal injuries. In the First World War, Robert Jones was charged with the responsibility of organizing the management of the many skeletal injuries. By the end of the hostilities he had drawn together a group of young surgeons with progressive and broadly similar views on traumatic orthopaedics. They were to form the dynamic core of the emerging specialty of orthopaedics. The British Orthopaedic Association was launched at a dinner hosted by Robert Jones at the Cafe Royal in London on the 28th November 1917; all but three attending held military appointments.</p>
<p>The Second World War saw the development of hand surgery in the United States of America in precisely the same manner. The Surgeon General of the United States charged Sterling Bunnell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412448168">Figure 1</xref>) (a surgeon whose pre-war reputation in hand surgery was the equivalent of Robert Jones in Orthopaedics in the UK) with the task of optimizing the outcome of hand injuries in the ten major reconstructive centres scattered across the USA. At the age of 62 he shut down his practice and concentrated exclusively on his new task. Early protocols of care were developed across centres by frequent visits from Sterling Bunnell, an arduous commitment for a man in his sixties whose mobility was impaired by a femoral neck non union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412448168">Manske 2011</xref>). Bunnell’s textbook <italic>Surgery of the hand</italic> was first published in 1944 and formed the basis of traumatic and reconstructive protocols for the young military surgeons. The surgeons also met to discuss issues of interest. These meetings were formalized by the creation of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand in January of 1946, with the 29 military surgeons as the founder members and six additional civilian surgeons.</p>

<p>Bunnell was a civilian advisor to the military working with younger surgeons on military attachment. A similar, but less structured situation had evolved in the UK during the Second World War with Guy Pulvertaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412448168">Figure 2</xref>) acting as a civilian advisor (principally to the Air Force, serving the many British and American air fields in Lincolnshire). Some other senior orthopaedic and plastic surgeons took on similar roles with the services in other areas of the country. Younger surgeons (for example Geoffrey Fisk) served as medical officers with direct responsibility for the injured servicemen. In the UK the management of hand injuries grew as a sub-speciality interest during the war, but to a far more limited degree than was occurring in the USA and without a Director of Hand Surgery.</p>

</fig>
<p>During the war, all senior surgeons were orthopaedic or plastic surgeons with only a portion of their time spent performing hand surgery. Guy Pulvertaft’s practice only became exclusive to the hand in 1962, ten years before he retired from health service practice. At the time of his retirement there was only one other full-time hand surgeon in the UK: Atholl Parkes in Glasgow. It is perhaps not surprising that the impetus to set up a UK hand society was somewhat delayed. Local circumstances would not only delay development but also affect the initial product.</p>
<p>The development of sub-speciality groups is not necessarily regarded with enthusiasm by the parent specialities. A hand surgery group would principally affect patients under the care of orthopaedic surgeons. However, the surgeons developing their hand surgery interest were not restricted to orthopaedics. The war had also catalysed the development of plastic surgery skills and an enthusiastic band of plastic surgeons were also keen to progress knowledge and care of hand injuries and hand conditions.</p>
<p>Sterling Bunnell visited London in 1946 and lectured at Guys Hospital and the Royal Society of Medicine. He also visited East Grinstead Hospital and Derby, discussing cases with Sir Archibald McIndoe and Guy Pulvertaft. In 1948 Guy Pulvertaft visited several American hand centres, including Bunnell in San Francisco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412448168">Figure 3</xref>). Julian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412448168">Bruner (1973)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412448168">Figure 4</xref>) notes in his ‘6th McIndoe Lecture’ that McIndoe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412448168">Figure 5</xref>) had mentioned his enthusiasm for the formation of a British Hand Society in 1950. The matter was informally discussed for two years with the impetus principally coming from enthusiastic plastic surgery consultants who had trained in London. Perhaps predictably, the initiatives created tensions within orthopaedics. An orthopaedic doyen articulated the concern in a letter to Guy Pulvertaft on the 28th July 1952. He was aware that Guy Pulvertaft, an orthopaedic surgeon, had approved of the concept:</p>

<p><italic>‘I myself am much against the formation of an association or society, which would poach on the preserves of the British Orthopaedic Association and I would hate to see a bit of legitimate territory removed from the embrace of the BOA and sequested by itself as an autonomous society, purely in the control of rapacious plastic surgeons’</italic></p>
<p>Two days previously Pulvertaft had received a telegram from the BOA President Sir Reginald Watson-Jones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412448168">Figure 6</xref>) advising against the proposal:</p>

<p><italic>‘You must think long carefully and broadly before supporting Society for Surgery of the Hand with clinical meetings, which would mean also Society for Surgery of Spine with neurosurgeons, Society for Surgery of Pelvis with urological surgeons, Society for Surgery of Sternum with thymus surgeons and so ad absurdam. Will write as soon as possible. Reginald’</italic></p>
<p>The original telegram is lost, but a photocopy is reproduced in Charles Chapman’s paper on the development of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412448168">1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Guy Pulvertaft replied that he considered an association would stimulate interest in hand surgery and was supportive of the proposal but aware of the sensitivities and keen to avoid a breach between orthopaedic and plastic surgery. He wondered if some link with the BOA could be maintained.</p>
<p>Further discussion led to a formal invitation by Patrick Clarkson to a dinner at the Athenaum (a London Club) on the 7th November 1952 to discuss the formation of a Hand Club. Seven surgeons attended with Professor James Whillis (anatomist) as the eighth. The host, Patrick Clarkson, was joined by Ronald Furlong, JIP James, Archie McIndoe, Gerry Moore, Rainsford Mowlem and Guy Pulvertaft. The objective of the Club was agreed:</p>
<p>‘to stimulate interest in hand surgery’.</p>
<p>Guy Pulvertaft’s Hand Club file notes on the flyleaf only give one detail about the eight founding members – their parent speciality. There were four plastic surgeons, three orthopaedic surgeons and an anatomist. Membership was restricted to a total of 12, with an annual clinical meeting held on a Saturday morning in their hospitals, where local trainees could attend. In addition, there would be an evening dinner on the Friday, which was restricted to members with an invitation to the serving presidents of the BOA and BAPS to attend if they wished.</p>
<p>The first clinical meeting was held at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary on the 28th November 1953 with an additional member, Richard Battle, and both Society Presidents (Brian McFarlane for the British Orthopaedic Association and John Barron for the British Association of Plastic Surgeons). In addition the previous President of the British Orthopaedic Association, Alan Malkin from Harlow Wood Hospital, also attended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193412448168">Figure 7</xref>). Numbers gradually increased to 12 with the addition of Donal Brooks, John Napier, Jim (Herbert) Seddon and Percy Jayes (Richard Battle resigning in 1958).</p>

<p>Inevitably, pressure grew externally for involvement in the Club. Geoffrey Fisk, in his Presidential address to The Percival Potts Club in 1982, considered Guy Pulvertaft the moving spirit in the birth of the Second Hand Club. It is true that in May of 1956 Guy Pulvertaft invited several young surgeons to Derby to discuss the matter. However, there seems little doubt the principal catalyst for change was Graham Stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753193412448168">Figure 8</xref>) (Robert Robins in papers archived at the British Society for Surgery of the Hand). Graham Stack had convened a meeting at the Royal Society of Medicine in London on the 13th January 1956 to set up a new club, after he had coordinated a request to join the Hand Club with additional applications from Campbell Reid and Adrian Flatt. Their request had been discussed by the Hand Club, which decided they did not wish to expand the Club (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412448168">Campbell Reid, 1983</xref>). A similar situation was to develop in the USA, where the American Society for Surgery of the Hand chose to recruit new members at a slower rate than the interest expressed by young surgeons, spawning the birth of the American Association of Hand Surgeons in 1970. Pulvertaft, in his papers, observes his invitation to Derby was at the instigation of Adrian Flatt, Stewart Harrison, Douglas Reid, Robert Robins and Graham Stack. The meeting took place and the Second Hand Club was established. A wider group of young surgeons were immediately invited to join, such that the initial group rose to 19, with, at the outset, only Rainsford Mowlem and Guy Pulvertaft linking the two clubs. Guy Pulvertaft was asked if he would be the Second Hand Club’s inaugural President and he accepted this role.</p>

</fig>
<p>The two Clubs coexisted for several years with the Second Hand Club expanding steadily and Graham Stack initiating the precursor of <italic>The Hand</italic> journal (the Proceedings of the Second Hand Club). <italic>The Hand</italic> became <italic>The Journal of Hand Surgery (British volume)</italic> which, in turn, has become <italic>The Journal of Hand Surgery (European volume)</italic>. The Hand Club had their final dinner on the 17th January 1964 with the British Club for Surgery of the Hand forming in the October of the same year. Four years later the constitution of the Second Hand Club was altered and the name changed to the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412448168">Stack and Bolton, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>The significance of the Hand Club in the development of hand surgery in the UK was slight. Its principal benefit was to establish the concept of hand surgery as an acceptable sub-speciality interest within an orthopaedic establishment that was suspicious of fragmentation. Professor JIP James (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1753193412448168">Figure 9</xref>) considered it ‘a dining club with hand surgery as gossip’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412448168">Barton 1998</xref>). All the major initiatives we associate with the duties of a national surgical society came with the establishment of the Second Hand Club. The Hand Club gave rise to an additional benefit. The apprehension between specialities at the outset was not forgotten. One of the characteristics of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand had been a consistent harmonious coexistence between the two specialities. I do not think this has come about totally by chance. Both groups have shown considerable sensitivity to the interests of the other speciality. ‘Paranoid’ orthopaedic surgeons and ‘rapacious’ plastic surgeons continue to work together harmoniously to develop their shared speciality.</p>
