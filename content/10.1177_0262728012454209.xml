<p>The Indian legal system has been a neglected topic within Italian legal literature for various reasons, most significantly perhaps because of its perception as totally alien to Italian civil law jurisprudence, as opposed to the deemed common legal nature of Indian law. From the outset, Francavilla highlights this neglect, indicating that ‘research on Indian Law has not developed as we would expect considering the importance of India from the cultural, economic and geopolitical points of view’ (p. 9). Fossilised and outdated assumptions that Asian (and African) legal cultures can and should be taken into consideration solely within the fields of anthropological studies are also responsible for such deficiencies. However, global legal reality is rapidly changing and Indian law is today a globalised entity, present even in Italy, where a huge Indian population, largely involved in the North Italian dairy industry, has been developing its own ‘living law’, including hybrid methods of dealing with disputes. Unfortunately, this well-written and illustrative study only briefly mentions the importance of studying Indian law—and its religious components—from such a global perspective (p. 136) and in a global context. The increasingly contentious phenomenon of trans-national communities should push scholars also to research Hindu (and Islamic) laws as practised in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, a field of study that is almost completely unexplored.</p>
<p>Chapter I of this study sheds useful light on the origins and specific historical components of Indian law. The author, a legal philosopher, offers an interesting exploration of natural laws in specific discussions on Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic legal manifestations. The second chapter, an analysis of the Indian Constitution, focuses on the re-definition of justice along such diverse culture-specific aspects. Francavilla emphasises that the Indian Constitution is formally inspired by Western models, such as the Irish and American Constitutions (and Japan), but is especially informed by Indian legal values and ethics (pp. 85–7).</p>
<p>The book also examines the role of the welfare state and the increasing significance of Public Interest Litigation in India (and in other countries) placing it within the broader topic of access to justice. Regrettably, other alternative forms of dispute settlement are only touched upon briefly (p. 78). Since <italic>lok adalats</italic> and mediation processes are by and large preferred to formal litigation in India, they would deserve more attention.</p>
<p>Constitutionalism is an area where confusions of terminology continue to compromise comparative legal studies. Francavilla acknowledges that often in the legal history of the subcontinent, both Indian and Western scholars have translated Indian philosophical concepts into foreign words that cannot but oversimplify their culture-specific meaning (pp. 130–2). However, the author is caught in a similar definitional trap when he uses the word ‘<italic>laicità</italic>’ (from French <italic>laicité</italic>) when discussing Indian secularism. The meaning and specific history related to the concept of <italic>laicità</italic> in Italy have no use in explaining Indian secularism and could create confusions for non-expert readers.</p>
<p>The third chapter analyses the common law influence on contemporary Indian law. The introduction of common law principles and rules by the colonial administration certainly had a great impact on the Indian legal edifice. However, common law rules and principles have also been altered during this process, making it somewhat inaccurate and misleading to talk about common law as such. The author seems undecided when he declares that the Indian legal system belongs to the common law family (p. 102), but then admits that ‘unorthodox’ legal developments mark the history of independent India (pp. 102–11). Some European scholars still use abstract concepts such as families of laws, but this is now an outdated and heavily criticised taxonomy. Given that India has retained a legal system formally inspired by common law, but clearly Indian in character, should one put it into a separate category or abandon the concept of legal families altogether? Or are all laws simply culture-specific? Some further theoretical discussions would have been desirable.</p>
<p>Particularly relevant, and a subject which rarely appears in mainstream legal literature, are discussions on the official language of Indian state law, which has remained English since colonial times. This issue is not only relevant for its repercussions on access to justice as only about 20 per cent of the population speak English (p. 123). Politically, the official/national language distinction has crucial effects on debates concerning the balance between unity, diversity and uniformity of Indian national culture, of which a lingua franca (English or Hindi) would be a fundamental vehicle. Francavilla argues that because the language of contemporary Indian Law is English, this inevitably favours interest on this subject by Western jurists. However, as he also aptly underlines, ‘the absence of terminological barriers, contrary to the Chinese or Japanese experiences, has fuelled the tendency to diminish the originality of Indian Law’ (p. 122). Does this mean, in coded form, that Indian scholars no longer see the wood for the trees when it comes to analysing their own legal system?</p>
<p>Chapter IV explores the evolution of family laws and the interaction between state law and the various personal laws. After a useful discussion on the inclusiveness of the Hindu ‘religion’ and its reflection on the official laws (pp. 137–9), Francavilla briefly analyses the institution of marriage and some legal issues linked to it, namely divorce law and maintenance, child marriage and the controversial debates on the Uniform Civil Code. The study does not dig deep enough, especially on the continuing practice of child marriage (on which Francavilla has published other, more detailed work) and thus risks creating more misunderstandings within a by and large flawed literature by Indian scholars who are arguing for modernisation and often dismiss local cultural input as human rights violations.</p>
<p>Finally, the last chapter identifies several areas where innovative legal principles could follow a so far unconventional geographical trajectory, arguing that their ratio is potentially exportable from India to other legal systems. In particular, this aspect of the study dedicates extensive attention to the fields of environmental protection and intellectual property. The study under review provides a good overview, but is of course written in a language that most Indians will not know. But we Italians can also write in English, and this book sets important agenda for future work by the author himself and others.</p>
