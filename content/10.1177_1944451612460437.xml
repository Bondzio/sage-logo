<p>Surgical oncology is the branch of surgery that I work with every day in my practice. As the ICU Director and Chief of Anesthesia at a regional cancer treatment hospital, I’m involved in the perioperative care of hundreds of patients each year undergoing surgical treatment for a variety of cancers. I know that this branch of surgery had its modern beginnings in the pioneering work of William Halstead at the beginning of the 20th century who devised the radical mastectomy as treatment for breast cancer. Siddhartha Mukherjee, MD, relates the story of Halstead and his descendent surgical colleagues in beautiful detail in his 2010 biography of cancer called <italic>The Emperor of All Maladies</italic>. Besides Halstead, the book also describes the contributions of another surgeon, Evarts Graham who studied and treated lung cancer in the 1930s.</p>
<p>In his day, Graham did for lung cancer what Halstead had done for breast cancer. By pulling together surgical techniques from earlier tuberculosis treatments, Graham devised novel surgical approaches to excise lung cancers. Just a few years earlier, in Halstead’s time, lung cancer was a rare tumor that was not usually approached surgically. But its prevalence began increasing dramatically in the early part of the 20th century. The cause of this rise was unclear at the time and the early suggestions that increasing rates of cigarette smoking could play a role in lung cancer were generally ignored. Graham himself, a lifelong smoker, famously dismissed this causal connection with the statement, “so has the use of nylon stockings” also increased during the time of rising lung cancer rates.</p>
<p>But Graham had an intellectual change of heart in the 1950s after a persistent medical student named Ernest Wynder convinced Graham to sponsor him in lung cancer research. They developed a new epidemiological tool, the case–control study of smokers and nonsmokers that first convincingly demonstrated the strong association between lung cancer and smoking. Graham went on to do animal studies, showing that painting the purified residue of tobacco smoke onto the shaved backs of lab mice induced skin cancer. By the early 1950s he had evolved into an early outspoken Cassandra, railing about the dangers of cigarette smoking.</p>
<p>Then in 1956, at the height of his medical and scientific prowess, Graham suddenly became ill with “the flu.” Try as he might, he couldn’t shake the malaise and cough and underwent a workup at his hospital, Barnes-Jewish in St. Louis. A single chest X-ray revealed a bronchogenic tumor with widespread metastases, an inoperable case. He wrote poignantly to his friend and colleague Alton Ochsner:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have recently been a patient . . . because of bilateral bronchogenic carcinoma, which sneaked up on me like a <italic>thief in the night</italic> . . . You know I quit (smoking) five years ago but the trouble is that I smoked for 50 years.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He died 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>For Evarts Graham, his bronchogenic cancer became a stealthy assassin, stealing his life away. This must be a common feeling in patients with an acute illness, who develop a sudden deterioration of their health and the unnerving feeling that things are rapidly spinning out of their control. For us in critical care, the hospital is filled with other such “thieves in the night.” In the ICU, we see the septic patient with acute physiologic changes as infection and the inflammatory response overwhelms them. In our cancer hospital, the ever-present potential thief is the pulmonary embolism, which must be kept high on the differential diagnosis list for anyone with an abrupt change in vital signs in the setting of cancer treatment. However, it is rarer for a young, previously healthy person, with no risk factors for pulmonary embolism, to present to the emergency department with physiologic collapse from a saddle embolus. Such is the situation described in the dramatic case report in this issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic>. Fortunately, her team of physicians and nurses that took care of her had remarkable skill and persistence to get her through this episode intact.</p>
<p>Her case had such a rewarding outcome that we are happy to provide full details of her case in this issue. We also present 2 excellent reviews of important pulmonary medicine topics: ventilatory strategies for cervical spinal cord injured patients and a thorough, up-to-the-minute review of acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is also an article that describes the efforts made by an ICU management team to create neuroexcellence, that is, a core of physicians and nurses with state-of-the-art neurointensivist expertise within an existing medical–surgical ICU structure. Finally, there are 2 complementary articles that describe unique use of and monitoring approaches for ventricular assist devices.</p>
<p>In all these articles, we see the efforts of dedicated critical care professionals to turn away the “thief in the night” from their endangered patients. I hope you enjoy their presentation in this issue of the journal.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
