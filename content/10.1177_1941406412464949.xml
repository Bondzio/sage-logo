<p>Providing the appropriate nutrition intervention for premature infants is imperative to improving both short-term and long-term outcomes. Premature infants, especially those born less than 1000 grams, are at greater risk for developing growth failure, osteopenia of prematurity, and negative developmental outcomes from an inadequate nutrition prescription. Neonatal nutrition practitioners, often times, depend on several resources for calculating nutrition requirements for both enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN), which can be time consuming.</p>
<p>Dr Aniruddha Vidwans, MD, a neonatologist, has created an iPhone app titled “NICU Nutrition Calculator” to assist clinicians with creating the proper nutrition therapy for the neonatal population. Clinicians are able to calculate the nutritional intake for infants receiving PN, EN, or a combination of both. The PN screen will calculate total calories/kilogram/day (kcal/kg/d) and glucose infusion rates based on the diet prescription entered.</p>
<p>The EN screen calculates kcal/kg/d, and grams (g)/kg/d for macronutrients. This screen also provides information on the content of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D present in the desired formula. The NICU Nutrition Calculator has nutrient analysis for fortified and unfortified human milk, premature formulas, and other common types of specialized infant formulas used in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</p>
<p>The main advantage of using the NICU Nutrition Calculator is that it allows clinicians quick and convenient assess for calculations through the use of their iPhone/iPod/iPad. A limitation of this app is that the concentrated enteral formulas are in even numbers only such as 22, 24, 26 calories/ounce.</p>
<p>I would recommend The NICU Nutrition Calculator for clinicians to assist them with devising the optimal nutrition therapy for premature infants.</p>
