<p>We are very happy to introduce the special issue of <italic>Clothing and Textiles Research Journal</italic>. The Call for Papers for this issue went out in February 2011. By the end of September 2011, we received 18 manuscripts and, among those, 5 manuscripts were accepted for publication with an acceptance rate of 27.8%. All of these manuscripts were blind-reviewed by two reviewers and both coeditors. The manuscript authored by one of the coeditor was handled by the other coeditor to ensure blind reviews. Over 30 reviewers were involved in this review process, and we appreciate the extra time they gave to provide meaningful and important comments to the authors. Authors have also worked diligently to accommodate all the comments and suggestions made by the reviewers. We thank the authors as well.</p>
