<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the perceived effects of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program on stress and quality of life of women in midlife. A total of 20 nurses, aged 45 to 55 years, who participated in a stress reduction course were contacted for interviews. A total of 9 nurses agreed to be interviewed. Content analysis was used to analyze these interviews. The five themes that emerged from the analysis were as follows: strengthening of interpersonal communication through social support, increased personal awareness through becoming more mindful and reflective, a spiritual awakening, effective ways of dealing with stress, and living life in balance by taking hold of one’s life. This study increased the authors’ understanding of effects/benefits, adherence, and application of MBSR techniques for women in midlife. It is concluded that MBSR may be a useful intervention for nurses in midlife to develop successful strategies for dealing with stress and to improve their quality of life.</p>

<body>
<p>Psychosocial stress is a significant risk factor for heart disease. Midlife is a time period in the life of women that is often fraught with increased psycho-social stress. Women in midlife are often caught in the “sandwich generation” phenomenon of caring for aging parents while raising children, grandchildren, and maintaining employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911424171">Perrig-Chiello &amp; Hopflinger, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As caregivers, women often put the needs of others before their own unique needs. The demands on their time may result in less time devoted to caring for their own health and psychosocial needs. Their health may not be as robust as it was in their youth and without proper attention, health and functioning may be compromised, and coping reserves may be both tested and tapped to their veritable limits. The resultant stress that may be experienced can be detrimental to health. Indeed, chronic stress has been implicated as a factor in the development and progression of coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911424171">Daubenmier, Weidner, Sumner, Mendell, &amp; Merritt-Worden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911424171">Rosengren et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, interventions that focus on coping strategies for stress may play a key role in the prevention of heart disease in women.</p>
<p>There are no known studies where Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been used as a platform for health-related behavior change in midlife women. A study related to health behaviors in college students found that mindfulness relates to a decrease in stress, which contributes to positive health perceptions and health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911424171">Roberts &amp; Danoff-Burg, 2010</xref>). In addition, little is known about the adherence to MBSR over time and its potential long-term impact on both stress reduction and quality of life. To fill this gap, “The Midlife Study,” a 16-week, two-group intervention study was conducted. The experimental treatment group participated in an 8-week MBSR program. In addition, they received 8 weeks of instruction and tools to adopt a heart-healthy diet, and participated in a pedometer-based exercise program. The comparison group received 8 weeks of health education with topics relevant to women at midlife, and they also participated in the 8-week diet and exercise program. The study was designed as part of a program of research centered on the prevention of heart disease in midlife women. Nurses were chosen because of the known documented high stress level associated with this occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911424171">Salmond &amp; Ropis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911424171">Wieck, Dols, &amp; Northam, 2009</xref>). The aim of the qualitative component of this study was to determine the perceived subjective effects of MBSR on stress and quality of life of women who were enrolled in the experimental arm of the study. The interviews were conducted 1 year after completing the course to determine the potential long-term effects on participants’ stress management and quality of life.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945911424171">
<title>Psychosocial Stress, Heart Disease, and Midlife Women</title>
<p>A growing number of studies have shown a potential relationship between psychosocial stress and heart disease, independent of other risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911424171">Brisson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911424171">Daubenmier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911424171">Hellerstedt &amp; Jeffrey, 1997</xref>). Findings from the INTERHEART Study suggest that psychosocial factors are more important than formerly recognized, as there may, in fact, be a causal relationship between stress and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911424171">Sheps, Frasure-Smith, Freedland, &amp; Carney, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The risk for heart disease before menopause in women is relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911424171">Rosamond et al., 2007</xref>). After menopause, the risk for heart disease in women increases dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911424171">Weinberger, 2006</xref>). In fact, the Framingham Study found a fourfold increase in heart disease in the 10 years following menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911424171">Columbia University, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Perimenopause (the time period that precedes menopause for up to 10 years) is associated with age-related risk factors and endocrine changes seen with decreasing estrogen levels. Although cardiovascular disease increases with age in both men and women, there is an additional increase in women that has been attributed to the time of menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911424171">Rosano, Vitale, Marazzi, &amp; Volterrani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911424171">Stevenson, 2007</xref>). The menopausal transition, which encompasses perimenopause, is often a time of great change. There are physiological, psychological, sociological, and lifestyle factors and personal perceptions of menopausal events that can be troublesome. These changes, along with concurrent aging, underscore the need for behavioral lifestyle adjustments to preserve health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911424171">Bellasi, Raggi, Merz, &amp; Shaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911424171">Mosca et al., 2007</xref>). Deleterious changes in cardiac risk factors during perimenopause, including increased stress, point to perimenopause as an important time of health transition and a vital time for intervention to reduce stress and promote health and optimize quality of life.</p>
<p>MBSR is a structured program developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911424171">Kabat-Zinn (2005)</xref>, from the University of Massachusetts. The standard program comprises 8 weeks of 2.5-hr weekly meetings that emphasizes living in the present and encompasses techniques of sitting meditation, hatha yoga, and body scan. Daily practice is encouraged and a full-day retreat of silent meditation toward the end of the 8 weeks is part of the standard program. A number of studies support the use of MBSR in a variety of patients from other populations to aid in stress reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911424171">Davis, Fleming, Bonus, &amp; Baker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911424171">Matchim, Armer, &amp; Stewart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911424171">Tacon, McComb, Caldera, &amp; Randolph, 2003</xref>). Little is known about the effectiveness of MBSR techniques with women in midlife to reduce stress and enhance coping techniques. In addition, it is not known whether the coping techniques learned in an MBSR course persist over time. Therefore, analyzing the long-term adherence of program participants to practices and application of MBSR techniques, and the potential impact of such techniques on stress and quality of life can inform future development of programs designed to reduce stress.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework for this study has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911424171">Frisvold, 2009</xref>), hence, it is described here in brief. The study frame-work was adapted from the framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911424171">Kabat-Zinn (2005)</xref>. Kabat-Zinn proposed that mindfulness can help to optimize adaptive coping strategies. According to the framework, persons can learn to “respond” to stress rather than automatically “reacting to stress” with the stress reaction of “flight or fight,” which elicits stress hormones such as epinephrine. The stress reaction, when chronic, may lead to adverse health states. According to Kabat-Zinn, practicing mindfulness techniques may reduce the frequency and intensity of the fight-or-flight response and may lead to positive health outcomes, such as reductions in stress and anxiety, and to improved quality of life. Midlife, a time in the lives of women often marked with significant physiologic and psychosocial changes, may be viewed as stressful. A common response to this stress is living in a chronic state of an active stress reaction, which may adversely impact health. During this time, women may choose either maladaptive or adaptive coping to deal with stressors. Stress may exert a powerful influence on self-destructive behaviors. Thus, teaching midlife women effective ways to manage stress is critical. Adaptive coping strategies to break the “stress reaction cycle” are therefore crucial and may be instrumental in effective behavior change. Therefore, teaching women in midlife healthy ways to deal with stress through participation in an MBSR course, which emphasizes the concept of mindfulness and living in the present moment, may be an effective intervention to change behavior and encourage adaptive coping techniques.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This study was a planned follow-up of “The Midlife Study,” which was designed to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of the use of MBSR as a platform to reduce stress and improve health behavior change efforts (i.e., improved diet and increased exercise) among female nurses at midlife. In the first phase of the study, investigators explored whether a program of MBSR that was followed by behaviorally focused diet and exercise interventions, compared with an active control group of health education followed by diet and exercise intervention, would result in greater changes in behavior change and weight loss at 16 weeks relative to the control group. It was hypothesized that adding MBSR to a program of diet and exercise would act synergistically to increase adherence. This article reports the findings of the 1-year follow-up of persons who participated in the MBSR program of “The Midlife Study.” The subjective, perceived long-term (≥1 year) effects of the program of MBSR on stress, coping, and quality of life of women in midlife are described.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0193945911424171" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This section of the article describes the method used for the long-term follow-up of participants of the Midlife Study. A qualitative evaluation of an intervention study using semistructured interviews and content analysis was used to answer the research purpose. Details on the intervention, methods, and findings of the original study are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911424171">Frisvold, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Qualitative inquiry in the form of interviews may provide information that is pertinent to the overall effectiveness of the MBSR intervention. It may also reveal the effects of the program in meeting the unique needs of each woman who participated in the course. In this study, qualitative data from interviews of program participants 1 year after program participation provided information related to the perceived impact of training in MBSR on their stress and coping, and its perceived impact on quality of life.</p>
<sec id="section4-0193945911424171">
<title>Setting and Sample</title>
<p>The Midlife Study was conducted at a large tertiary care center in the Midwest. The setting provided a purposeful sample of midlife nurses in a small geographic area. Inclusion criteria for the Midlife Study included (a) body mass index greater than 23 but less than 41, (b) females between 39 and 57 years old, (c) no prior history of completing a mindfulness course, (d) not exercising regularly three or more times per week in the past 4 months, (e) no physical contraindications to exercise, (f) perceived high levels of psychosocial stress, and (g) able to read English. Exclusion criteria included (a) known history of heart disease, (b) systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg, (c) insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and (d) chronic diseases that would preclude use of the diet or exercise components of this study.</p>
<p>The MBSR intervention was led by a trained psychotherapist with more than 15 years experience in MBSR. The 20 participants met weekly for 2.5 hr each week in a small room for face-to-face instruction on yoga meditation, sitting meditation, walking meditation, and mindful eating. The room was empty of all furniture except for meditation pillows. The instructor used both lecture and role-playing to teach concepts. There was a focus during each class on being in the present moment. Each week, the participants were given homework, which involved practicing the various components of the course. During the 7th week, there was a 7-hr silent meditative retreat in a quiet place of refuge surrounded by woods and a river. The course including the retreat lasted 8 weeks.</p>
<p>One year after completing the initial study, all 20 women in the MBSR group were invited by letter to participate in the qualitative study. Inclusion criterion was participation in the MBSR intervention in the Midlife Study. Exclusion criteria included not completing the entire 8-week MBSR course or withdrawing from the original study. Of these 20 women, 9 agreed and were interviewed for this study. The average age of the women in this study was 48 years. They all were college educated, and 8 of the 9 women were married. There were no statistically significant differences between the women who participated and those who did not respond to the interview request on age, income, education, and physiologic markers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945911424171">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine women who had participated in a MBSR to examine their perception of the experience. To prepare for the interview, the women were asked several weeks in advance to reflect on their life since taking the MBSR course. The interviews were conducted in a private room, which was a quiet space that provided privacy, and lasted between 30 and 35 min. A set of questions was developed to obtain information of interest for the study, related to stress reduction and quality of life. For example, each participant was asked the following opening questions: “How has your life changed since participating in the MBSR course?” and “Do you respond to stress differently after taking the MBSR course, and if yes, how do you now handle stress in your life?” Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed, and each tape was listened to twice while reading the transcript to validate the accuracy of what had been transcribed.</p>

<sec id="section6-0193945911424171">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Guidelines by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911424171">Strauss and Corbin (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911424171">Tesch (1990)</xref> were used to perform content analysis regarding the women’s use of MBSR strategies. First, the entirety of the data was read to get the sense of the whole. During this phase, interesting areas of content related to the aim were noted using memos. As this process continued, paragraphs of data were indexed by the topic and noted as emerging codes. Similarities and uniqueness in codes were noted and data were collapsed leading to the formation of categories. Content analysis for these categories continued until discrepancies were resolved among three researchers with qualitative expertise. Finally, common themes were abstracted from the categories to capture the full range of the MBSR phenomenon and the perceived effects of their participation in MBSR on their experience of stress, coping, and quality of life.</p>
<p>Four criteria (credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transfer-ability) were used to evaluate rigor in a qualitative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911424171">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). Credibility and trustworthiness were achieved using reflexive tape recording in the field and reflexive journaling; the investigator’s reactions to certain observations were immediately documented to identify personal bias and preconceived notions that may affect the analysis of data. Dependability was maintained by using the same semistructured interview guide and reviewing decision points during data analysis for content stability. Confirmability was achieved by working with three researchers with expertise in qualitative analysis to reach consensus on the interpretation of the findings. Recording rich, descriptive data was maintained to enhance transferability to other contexts.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Review Board of the health care center where the nurses were employed. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the initial data collection.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193945911424171" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Five major themes emerged from the in-depth qualitative data analysis: (a) a strengthening of interpersonal communication through social support, (b) increased personal awareness through becoming more mindful and reflective, (c) a spiritual awakening, (d) living life in balance by taking hold of their lives, and (e) effective ways of dealing with stress. Each is described below, along with selected excerpts from the text that support and illustrate the themes.</p>
<sec id="section8-0193945911424171">
<title>Strengthening of interpersonal communication through social support</title>
<p>A new-found ability to effectively communicate with families, coworkers, and friends was developed that improved the women’s sense of social support. Through the program of MBSR and application of techniques, participants reported that they learned active listening as an important means of communication. Their ability to problem solve, especially at work, was an added benefit for many women post completion of the MBSR course. The women reported that they felt less angry and were able to walk away from situations where in the past they would have reacted in a way that was less than favorable; this was a pleasant and useful lesson learned. Selected comments illustrating this theme include the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I also feel like I’m listening a little bit more when other people are talking and I’m stopping to connect with them more . . . listening when someone says something instead of jumping in and contributing.</p>
<p>But what I did like about it was that we got really close as a group and we did a lot of communicating and hearing other people’s stories. And just communication skills . . . and so some of the communication things I learned from there was very helpful.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0193945911424171">
<title>Increased intrapersonal awareness through becoming more mindful and reflective</title>
<p>The concept of becoming more aware of being in the present moment through mindfulness, meditation, and the act of reflection was a common theme. The women commented on being more present in their relationships with family and nature. Many women noticed the daily routines of life that were once viewed as mundane were now seen as gifts to be savored through the process of slowing down and “focusing on the here and now.” This sense of intrapersonal awareness was now mindfully incorporated and because of this life held renewed meaning. Comments illustrating this theme include the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I do think that overall I’m definitely a lot more mindful and a lot more aware of living in the moment. I’ve never been a person who has been a worrier, and worries about the future all the time, it’s just not my personality, but I am a person that does 90 things at once and sometimes not pay attention to things as much. I can totally tune my kids out at home, which I think through this I’ve been much, much better at not tuning them out and really being with them when I’m there, so being present with my kids and husband.</p>
<p>The walking was beautiful, and it’s things I haven’t done in years, or just even to go down by the river or whatever, just to hear the sounds and everything and it was just, it was just relaxing . . . turn the list off is ok . . . look at the flowers, look at different things and actually enjoy it, stop and smell the flowers.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193945911424171">
<title>A spiritual awakening</title>
<p>Spirituality was defined differently through the unique lens of the women in this study. For some, there was an awakening or a renewed focus after participating in the MBSR course. This sense of spiritual awakening was developed through different avenues whether through meditative prayer, walking meditation, or spending a day in silence, praying in a manner that had been lost for some time. This sense of refocusing on spirituality was for some an emotive process where they found themselves at a place of peace and contentment. This represented for some a sense of a higher purpose in life and a reconnection with an important element in their lives that they had lost sight of or did not place enough importance on. These selections from the text provide support for and illustrate this theme:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>You need to be quiet—you need to journey inward and allow whatever higher power speaks to us and kind of fill up that space.</p>
<p>I have really taken the walking meditation to heart and use it as a prayerful journey experience and I do that all the time.</p>
<p>It actually made me stronger even in my spiritual being.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193945911424171">
<title>Stress reduction</title>
<p>Stress reduction was a benefit to many of the women who participated in the MBSR program. Stress was a constant occurrence in life but how they as individuals learned behaviors to effectively cope with stress was unique and empowering. Each woman had her own worldview and yet, through focusing on being present, they found that, over time, they felt less stressed and calmer on a daily basis. These verbalizations from participants illustrate this theme:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It made me more in tune to how my body was reacting to stress . . . I think it has actually helped me because of how I deal with stress, I just feel so much more empowered.</p>
<p>So many times in a stressful situation I just say to myself, let it wash, and I can just like physically tell myself because of the practice of mindfulness, tell myself to let it just wash through me.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0193945911424171">
<title>Living life in balance</title>
<p>Balance was defined by some of the women as a sense of living in a place and in a pace that was harmonious and gave them permission to focus on what their unique needs were. Some of the women commented that they had lost sight of who they were and what they needed after years of caring for everyone else. Raising children, working full-time as nurses, providing care to aging parents, and meeting the needs of their partners left them little time or energy to “recharge their batteries.” Through the process of being mindful, reflective, and meditative, they began to realize that taking care of themselves provided benefits to their own health that was priceless and important. This was often something they had lost sight of through the years. These selections from the text of the interviews illustrate the theme:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>And I didn’t know how to protect my time . . . I think it’s [MBSR] brought me back to striving for balance. And it’s like you know what, I have not been home for dinner all week, I need to be home for dinner tonight. There is always something out of balance, but it cannot be my family all the time or work all the time . . . it is learning to know when it’s good enough.</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This qualitative study revealed that the effects of MBSR on stress and quality of life may be long lasting, life changing, and effective. The women in this study felt that although stress in life was constant, through participation in a MBSR course, they now possessed tools to effectively deal with daily stress in work and personal life, and this was perceived as a benefit. Communication skills were strengthened, and in addition, the ability to let issues wash through them rather than internalize and ruminate over served to improve the quality of their lives on a daily basis. The experience of these women may offer a glimpse into life of midlife women who work as nurses. The stressors although unique to each woman still offered some commonalities that many women could identify with and further suggest that certain aspects of the finding were a common theme for many.</p>
<p>The increased ability to find balance in life is a key finding from this qualitative inquiry. Balance in life, which is often neglected in the lives of busy women and nurses, is a concept that deserves more attention in health behavior–change research. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911424171">Sirgy and Wu (2007)</xref> suggested that balance in work and home life are critical to a happy life and recommended that further research on this topic be empirically tested.</p>
<p>An increased sense of spirituality, one of the study’s findings, is consistent with other studies that have examined the relationship between participation in MBSR courses and spirituality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911424171">Flugel Colle et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911424171">Carmody, Reed, Kristeller, and Merriam (2008)</xref> found an increase in spirituality in 44 participants in an MBSR. In addition, this study found that increased spirituality was associated with improvements in health.</p>
<p>MBSR provided many of these women effective ways to deal with stress. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have found stress reduction as a benefit to MBSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911424171">Beddoe &amp; Murphy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911424171">Galantino, Baime, Maguire, Szapary, &amp; Farrar, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the original study, there were no statistically significant differences on stress reduction or an increase in mindfulness for women who participated in the MBSR group as compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911424171">Frisvold, 2009</xref>). Yet, effective stress-coping techniques and an increase in mindfulness were both identified themes in the interviews. Effective communication strategies, a spiritual awakening, and living life in the balance were themes that were identified but were not constructs that were examined in the original study. These identified themes might be of interest in future studies.</p>
<p>As the original focus of this study was to determine effective intervention to reduce stress and thus help prevent heart disease, there are lessons learned from this intervention that may be beneficial for other heart disease prevention studies as well as populations where high levels of stress may be detrimental. Learning to unplug, living life in the balance, and the ability to connect with others with positive interaction and effective communication skills are life lessons that many can learn from. The fact that this course had been taken 1 year previously and its positive life effects still remained spoke to the power of its adherence and life-changing benefits. Improvements in quality of life have been demonstrated in previous studies, and thus, the findings of this study are supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911424171">Flugel Colle et al., 2010</xref>). The program and practice of mindfulness could be incorporated into other intervention programs that aim to reduce stress and improve quality of life.</p>
<p>As it was hypothesized in the original study that women in the MBSR intervention would exercise more and eat a healthier diet, it was interesting that only a few women mentioned a change in being more mindful of diet or exercise during the interviews, and thus, these were not common themes.</p>
<p>One potential limitation to this study was that a year had passed between the MBSR intervention and the interviews. Perceptions of life before the intervention may have been more accurate immediately after the study ended and may have changed over the year’s time. Another potential limitation was the lack of diversity in the sample. It may not be representative of women in midlife because these were nurses with similar levels of education, income, and ethnicity.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that MBSR may be an effective program for women in midlife to strengthen and/or develop effective coping mechanisms. In addition, MBSR, because of its potential positive benefits for women in midlife, might be an effective intervention strategy coupled with exercise and diet to impacts on midlife health. The program is readily available and can be used to reduce stress at midlife. In addition, it may also serve to enhance quality of life through enhancing life balance at midlife—a complex and demanding period of a woman’s life. These women learned new ways of coping with stress and these effects were long lasting and consistent. Prospective studies of MBSR effects on stress and quality of life of women at midlife are recommended, and studies of strategies to reinforce MBSR techniques are also needed.</p>
