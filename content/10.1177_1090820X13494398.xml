<p>We read with interest Captain Harden’s article on the benefits of teamwork training and checklists in the plastic surgery clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13494398">1</xref></sup> Despite the author’s confidence in the benefits of these strategies, there remains doubt in the medical community as to their effect on both process and outcome. In previous work, we found some benefit with teamwork training on observed processes, but this improvement was not evident (or effective) in reducing duration of patient stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13494398">2</xref></sup> This finding can be considered within a human factors framework whereby the human (the locus of the teamwork training intervention) has limited control over the system, culture, and technology of the field, and we hypothesize that to engender long-lasting change, an intervention focused on 1 or more of these other elements would result in greater success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13494398">3</xref></sup> In another study, “Lean” process engineering techniques were utilized with long-lasting impact on safety as well as patient transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13494398">4</xref></sup> We are currently undertaking a multicenter observational study (“The Safer Delivery of Surgical Services”) to assess the safety and quality benefits of teamwork training, standard operating procedures, and “Lean” techniques. This project, funded by the National Institutes for Health Research in the United Kingdom, has been designed to gain understanding of the effects of techniques on surgical processes as well as clinical and financial outcomes.</p>
