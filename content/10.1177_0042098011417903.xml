<abstract>
<p>‘Urban sustainability’ currently receives widespread and generally enthusiastic endorsement, yet concerns are emerging that recent expressions of the concept may actually be working <italic>against</italic> the city and its residents. Based on research in Christchurch, New Zealand (one of the most urbanised countries in the world), it is argued that the assimilation of social, economic and bio-physical environmental elements that gave the idea much of its original legitimacy has been reduced to a minimalist set of material and discursive ‘eco-friendly’ denominators. As a result, only occasional glimpses of the city and its human inhabitants are caught in attempts to operationalise sustainability in urban areas. The effect is that cities, in New Zealand at least, are less liveable and less likeable than they should be. It is suggested that there is a real need to re-urbanise and rehumanise the urban sustainability agenda as a means of realising its integrative and transformative potential.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Urban sustainability is a concept that currently enjoys intense interest and widespread political support. Its attraction is based on a growing awareness that over half the world’s population reside in cities and towns and, furthermore, this urbanising trend looks set to continue. Whilst this alone provides a compelling case for the addition of an ‘urban’ prefix to the now ubiquitous notion of ‘sustainability’, the concept draws additional strength from the city’s ability to act as a convenient administrative unit through which the ‘global’ can be made ‘local’. Consequently, it has become commonplace to incorporate cities into a popular, globalised, sustainability agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011417903">Boone and Modarres, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011417903">Braun, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417903">Mercer and Jotkowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011417903">Welch, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Formerly confined to academic and policy circles, sustainability has “buzzed rapidly into the popular consciousness trailing clouds of positive affect” (Netting, 1993; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417903">Stone, 2003</xref>, p. 94). For many observers, the rhetoric surrounding urban sustainability is compelling but its superficial simplicity hides a raft of complexities and contradictions <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> the role of economic growth, intergenerational versus intragenerational equity, radical versus incremental change and so on. Even basic attempts to define the concept seem to generate a host of rebuttals, refinements and alternatives. Despite extensive discussion, a plethora of indices and indicators, and general fervour surrounding the term, it is debateable whether we have a good idea what urban sustainability entails or how we might actually achieve it. Our aims for this paper thus include exploring what urban sustainability means for different professional urban practitioners, investigating the means through which certain versions of the concept have become naturalised in current urban management practice, and examining the implications of this for the city and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The literature suggests a number of approaches to urban sustainability, with early theorists highlighting bio-physical environmental elements—or at least emphasising the tangible aspects of the urban environment—such as public transport, resource consumption, waste disposal and recycling. This is understandable given the antecedents of the concept that saw bio-physical environmental limits enter the discourse on urban planning and management. Rees and Wackernagel (1997), for example, have defined cities as</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>highly-ordered, dynamic, far-from-equilibrium dissipative structures [that] can grow and develop only because they are able to extract available energy and material from the ecosphere and discharge their wastes back into it (Rees and Wackernagel, 1997, p. 237).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By extension, a <italic>sustainable</italic> city is one that causes no disorder to the host ecosystem by reducing its dependence on external flows, rehabilitating stocks of natural capital and promoting the use of local resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011417903">Rees, 1997</xref>). This approach to urban sustainability leads directly to the view that most cities as currently configured are unsustainable and this is reflected in urban planning and design rhetoric that emphasises building ‘compact cities’ and adopting ‘smart growth’ policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011417903">Vallance <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, bio-physical environmental sustainability is but one ambition of urban residents and their political representatives, and it must be balanced against socio-cultural and economic imperatives. Traditionally, the city has also been regarded as, for example, a ‘growth machine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011417903">Molotch, 1976</xref>), an “institutional process, a theatre of social action, and an aesthetic symbol of collective unity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011417903">Mumford, 1937/1996</xref>, p. 185). More recently, the ‘creative city’ debate has emphasised ways in which the survival of post-industrial cities in the age of globalisation depends on their ability to attract and retain skilled, mobile workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011417903">Florida, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011417903">Hanna and Walton-Roberts, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417903">Peck, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011417903">Clark <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref> have argued that the post-industrial city can be seen as a kind of entertainment engine that must facilitate the quality of life of citizens who view their surroundings almost as tourists do, giving high priority to aesthetics, services and attractiveness. Both production- and consumption-driven urban economic growth connect with the sustainability agenda through the long-standing connection with the notion of ‘development’ popularised in the Brundtland Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011417903">WCED, 1987</xref>). Yet, the concept of development also has its problems. First, blunt measures of economic growth (such as GDP) are often used as proxies for development and, secondly, these measures concern only the accumulation of wealth or material assets rather than other measures of human well-being and accomplishment.</p>
<p>This has led to a range of literature that emphasises urban sustainability as a political ‘space’ that is negotiated both through actual practice and through an on-going contest for the right to construct the symbolic and metaphorical city which is as, if not more, important than its physical form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011417903">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011417903">Merrifield, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011417903">Whitehead, 2003</xref>). This challenges notions of sustainability as some kind of end point or steady state achieved through technical means and recasts the idea as an ongoing complex of social, economic and political processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011417903">Crabtree, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011417903">McDonald <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Such thinking is exemplified in much of the urban environmental justice literature which explores ways in which environmental ‘goods’ and ‘bads’ are distributed throughout the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011417903">Agyeman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417903">Agyeman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011417903">Agyeman, and Angus, 2003</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417903">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>, for a Christchurch example). In highlighting the political nature of cities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011417903">Agyeman and Evans (2003)</xref> have argued that grassroots movements have much to offer the sustainability agenda which tends to be driven from the top–down and is, therefore, unable to assimilate a wide range of concerns.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417903">McCann (2002)</xref> used two case studies to illustrate the ways in which debates over different visions for the city are not usually presented in terms of exchange values so much as the naturalisation of social values that establish certain developments as good, bad, appropriate, unworthy, or even ‘sustainable’. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011417903">Bulkeley (2006)</xref> has illustrated how urban sustainability ‘best practice’ is both a political rationality and governmental technology that various networks and coalitions use to promote particular urban futures. These practices inevitably become “enmeshed in the particularities of places” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011417903">Bulkeley, 2006</xref>, p. 1029) and have to compete with other local governmentalities. Enacting best practice then becomes a matter of individuals trying to make sense of the everyday context in which this knowledge is created and used to challenge or support particular versions of urban sustainability.</p>
<p>These studies all highlight the contested nature of urban sustainability and challenge the idea that sustainability is something that we can measure scientifically and achieve through neutral and apolitical means. They raise interesting questions about how such contests are managed and highlight a need to examine the deeper political implications of managing conflicts in particular ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011417903">Latour (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098011417903">Whitehead (2005)</xref>, for example, have warned that the sustainability movement risks becoming depoliticised because issues tend to be either dramatically ‘overinflated’ and dehumanised, or reduced to the banal in order to assimilate them into everyday life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011417903">Swyngedouw (2009)</xref>, making a similar point, has argued that the popularist, consensual and techno-scientific approach to urban environmental affairs has led to a widespread ‘post-political condition’ that is undemocratic (in a certain sense of the word) and undermines our ability to address questions of environmental justice. On a slightly different note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011417903">Parr (2009</xref>, p. 4) has warned that the concept has not just been depoliticised; it has been co-opted and has become an inherent part of the “logic of late capitalism”, reduced to mere ‘eco-branding’ that serves particular interests.</p>
<p>If the idea of ‘sustainability’ appears increasingly contentious, so too do the concepts of the ‘city’ and the ‘social’. Several aspects of current urban theory are important here. The first challenges the idea that the city is devoid of nature and refers to a range of urban wildthings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011417903">Hinchliffe <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) in the post- or trans-human city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417903">Amin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011417903">Philo and Wilbert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011417903">Wolch, 2007</xref>). Such work tries to challenge or dissolve the neat boundaries that apparently exist between city and country. A second line of thinking challenges the city’s ontological status as geographically bound and fixed in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011417903">Whitehead, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011417903">Boone and Modarres, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011417903">Braun, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417903">Amin, 2007</xref>). In this theorisation, the city is seen as the “sum of its spatial connections” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417903">Amin, 2007</xref>, p. 104) which has implications both for orthodox notions of communities predicated on propinquity and for assumptions about where the urban is formed. Such work emphasises the ways in which the city’s influence extends well beyond administrative boundaries and challenges both the possibility and utility of a distinctly urbanised sustainability.</p>
<p>Such work suggests a need to identify and reach a better understanding of the myriad meanings of urban sustainability and ways in which certain versions of the concept have become naturalised in current urban management practice. Given the extended reach of the city and the numbers of both human and non-human urban residents, it is important that the implications for the city and its inhabitants be explored more thoroughly.</p>
<p>With over 85 per cent of the population living in cities and towns, New Zealand is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, although most of this ‘urban’ population resides in relatively low-density suburban settings. Both its indigenous Maori and colonial heritage is strongly linked to natural and/or bucolic imagery; however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011417903">Latham (2003)</xref> noted a growing ‘contemporary enthusiasm for the city’ in his case study of Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city. This interest in urban affairs has been reflected in a range of other recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011417903">Thorns, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011417903">Dixon and Dupuis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011417903">Freeman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011417903">Vallance and Perkins, 2010</xref>). In addition, the 1999–2008 Labour government led a number of initiatives including the establishment of an Urban Affairs portfolio in Cabinet, a sustainable cities programme, and production of the Urban Design Protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011417903">MfE, 2005b</xref>). Within this context, we have based our study in a particular city—Christchurch—and focused on the ways in which ‘urban practitioners’—people who make a living designing, planning, developing, selling, building and managing cities—have understood and applied the concept of urban sustainability, the extent to which bio-physical environmental aspects were reconciled with other metropolitan imperatives, the ways in which such <italic>rapprochements</italic> were achieved (or not as the case may be), and implications of this.</p>
<p>Although our study is grounded in the experience of a relatively small country in the south Pacific, like observers from elsewhere, we share concerns that separationist paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011417903">Head and Muir, 2006</xref>) of environmental management have not been challenged effectively. In line with many Anglo-American and European cities, in New Zealand vernacular and modernist approaches to urban management are still considered useful. We hope, therefore, that by explicating the situation in New Zealand we may contribute to global debates about urban sustainability.</p>

<sec id="section2-0042098011417903">
<title>Urban Sustainability and the ‘People’s Republic’</title>
<p>Our study focused on exploring the apparent consensus underlying the popularity of the urban sustainability concept and we achieved this through an investigation of urban practitioners’ understandings and applications of the term in the context of their everyday professional practice. Selected for their demonstrable effect on Christchurch’s urban form and function, we conducted in-depth interviews with 45 practitioners including real estate developers (<italic>n</italic> = 5); architects (<italic>n</italic> = 5); residents’ association representatives (<italic>n</italic> = 5); national, regional and city government politicians and employees including policy managers, planners, community advocates (<italic>n</italic> = 15); suppliers of group housing and builders (<italic>n</italic> = 10); and representatives of other local urban and business interest-groups such as the Sustainable Cities Trust (<italic>n</italic> = 5).</p>
<p>Christchurch is located on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island, in the Canterbury province, bounded by the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Alps. The Canterbury region has a long history of Maori occupation and the areas in and around Christchurch have long been popular fishing and hunting grounds. Today, the city of Christchurch dominates the region; it is now the South Island’s main urban area and the second largest in New Zealand. It has a population of 369 000 and is part of an urban region with approximately 400 000 residents (at 2008). Christchurch’s residential landscape is largely suburban with a small area of inner-city boarding houses and apartments. Much of the city is situated on a coastal plain and, apart from limited residential areas on the southern hills of volcanic origin, the urban area is flat and dissected by two small river systems. Prior to the arrival of European colonists in the 19th century, a considerable part of what is now the built environment was wetland and the remnants of this pre-European environment have become valued amenity areas. The city focuses on promoting itself as the ‘Garden City’ and contains over 3000 hectares of parkland much of which is available for public recreation.</p>
<p>While significantly influenced by its agricultural hinterland and British colonial origins dating to 1856, Christchurch’s economy is increasingly based on export-led agriculture, light manufacturing, information technology, education and tourism. The service sector now accounts for almost half of the economic activity in the city. Additionally, a widening gap between high- and low-income New Zealanders since the early 1980s and a rise in the number of dual-earner households have influenced Christchurch’s urban life. The rise of a group of consumers with significant discretionary income has, as in other New Zealand cities, been a stimulus for new patterns of consumption including demand for luxury housing. Conversely, low-income earners and recipients of various forms of social wage have sought housing at the other end of the scale. While still predominantly a city of single-family home dwellers, Christchurch’s urban form has diversified and now includes greater numbers of attached and detached town houses and inner-city apartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011417903">Perkins and Thorns, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011417903">2001a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 1980s, under then-Mayor Vicki Buck who actively encouraged broad citizen participation in local politics, Christchurch developed a reputation as the ‘People’s Republic’. Although this has since steadily eroded—indeed, it has been effectively terminated with the 22 February earthquake that led to the imposition of a state of national emergency<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011417903">1</xref></sup>—at the time of our fieldwork, the Christchurch City Council had a stronger and more ‘activist’ social policy orientation than many other local authorities in the country. Evidence for this is available in the city council’s recent policy and planning documents which have emphasised the application of social, cultural and economic policy alongside the achievement of urban sustainability from a bio-physical environmental perspective by encouraging urban intensification, clean air and water, waste recycling and increased levels of cycling and use of public transport.</p>
<p>These policies and plans find their legislative rationale in two statutes. In New Zealand, both urban and rural planning are conducted under the auspices of the Resource Management Act (1991, amended 2005) which seeks to facilitate private enterprise within the confines of bio-physical environmental limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011417903">Memon and Perkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417903">Perkins and Thorns, 2001b</xref>). The stated purpose of the Act is “to promote the sustainable management of natural and physical resources” and it has been called ‘effects-based’ because it is concerned primarily with managing the bio-physical environmental consequences of activities rather than governing the activities themselves. There was, and still is, plenty of scope for a range of interpretations and applications of the Act, many of which have been tested in appeals to the Environment Court.</p>
<p>A particular interpretation of sustainable management is evident in the publications of the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment, the nation’s key urban environmental agency and the one which administers the Resource Management Act at a central government level. In its 2005 <italic>Simply sustainable</italic> marketing brochure, the Ministry suggested that being sustainable is a matter of</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>minimising waste and maximising resources … green[ing] your office stationery … and choos[ing] energy efficient equipment and appliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011417903">MfE, 2005a</xref>, p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such an approach helps to legitimise a limited bio-physical environmental approach to urban sustainability and contributes to the sense that sustainability is easily achieved.</p>
<p>Planning scholars have criticised the minimal policy direction from the Ministry for the Environment around the implementation of the Resource Management Act, arguing that the nominal co-operation between regional and local or city councils has led to a generally poor set of city, district and regional plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011417903">Ericksen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Much of the optimism from business and green interests that was directed at the Act in its early stages has dissipated in the face of continued environmental degradation and lengthy processing times for even the most basic of resource consent applications.</p>
<p>The second piece of legislation that underpins these new developments and which further complicates an integrated approach to urban sustainability is the requirement under the Local Government Act (2002) that city and district councils develop a long-term council community plan. The local authority’s role is to facilitate the community’s identification of desired outcomes around social, cultural, economic and environmental well-being and then to report back to the community at least once every three years outlining progress made towards these goals. These 10-year plans mark something of a return to the kind of strategic planning that was largely abandoned in the late 1980s but, despite the potential of these plans to offset what some see as the strong bio-physical environmental focus of the Resource Management Act, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011417903">Memon and Thomas (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011417903">Thomas and Memon (2007)</xref> question the extent to which the purpose of the Local Government Act Amendment will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>In terms of planning for urban sustainability, there is room for both conflict and alignments between and within the dictates of these Acts. As but one example, the Resource Management Act seeks to promote the ‘sustainable management’ of natural and physical resources whereas the Local Government Act charges local authorities to act in accordance with the principles of ‘sustainable development’. It has been noted that when conflict between the Acts arises</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Decisions must still be made in accordance with the purpose and principles of the Resource Management Act and the policies of the relevant resource management plan [because] the more specific legislative requirements [of the Resource Management Act] override the more general provisions of the Local Government Act (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qualityplanning.org.nz/related-laws/faq-rma-lga.php">www.qualityplanning.org.nz/related-laws/faq-rma-lga.php</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although other countries will have a different legislative framework, reconciling economic, social and emergent bio-physical environmental imperatives is arguably the most difficult challenge confronting all urban planners. We now turn to our account of one city’s attempt to achieve this.</p>

Contrary to this expectation, when exploring these practitioners’ understandings and applications of urban sustainability, the city became obscured in a thicket of bio-physical environmental issues and concerns, even when the preceding conversation had centred quite firmly on urban locations and features. The following excerpt from an interview with a high-level, local body politician is a good example of urban sustainability being associated with ‘natural’ areas and attributes</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Local body politician</italic>: Well I think [the Riccarton Racecourse] is a beautiful piece of land. We’ve got that wonderful market there on a Sunday. And if we do get this [proposed] tea house it will be a wonderful community facility. So I want the residents around the area to take a bit more of an interest in it … I hope they get as passionate about it as everything else because it’s the only one left.</p>
<p>
<italic>Interviewer</italic>: One of the things that I hear a lot about … is urban sustainability …. Does that mean anything to you?</p>
<p>
<italic>Local body politician</italic>: You know, I was born in Dunedin [a city in the south of New Zealand] and we had a bach [seaside holiday home] at Karitane, a crib as you call them down south. And you’d go over the fields with the dogs and have fun in the paddocks and … Kids today don’t have that … wonderful experience of roaming around in the … environment like I did as a child. And I think that that’s quite sad. And I believe that sustainability also means keeping our waters. Looking after our waterways and seeing that our aquifers are full. Wonderful filters. And so we have to look after it. So to me that means sustainability.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This example demonstrates a marked shift from discussion of a new community recreational facility, the proposed Riccarton Racecourse tea house, to natural features upon introduction of the concept of urban sustainability; and such abrupt changes in conversational trajectory were common. Other interviews exhibited a similar concern for fields, paddocks and waterways when the notion of urban sustainability was raised, even when the city remained foregrounded, as seen in these next excerpts from interviews with a central government politician and an architect</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Senior central government politician</italic>: So urban sustainability has got some real problems. There’s growth and planning for that growth. There’s getting people out of the view that the only way is to have a house and a garden and so all these hills will fill up. Auckland is the one that terrifies me because it could go … The whole dairy and fertile land to the north of Auckland could all be housed over. It does require planning and it’s about planning for transport, for clean air, for safety, for management of energy requirements, all those things.</p>
<p>
<italic>Architect</italic>: So architects for years have looked at Utopic [<italic>sic</italic>] ideals … And so how big is Christchurch going to get? What can it sustain? It’s already sucked in a lot of satellite areas now as it is. Even when I was a kid out the north-west, there were a lot of orchards and … farms, and they’ve now disappeared.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These representative interview excerpts show that when our interviewees heard the term ‘urban sustainability’ their responses were framed in terms of ‘the environment’ or ‘nature’. This suggests that despite a vast and ever-increasing literature devoted to <italic>urban</italic> sustainability, to which our interviewees would have had some exposure, many concerns about the city and its people are veiled from view behind a discourse of bio-physical environmentalism tinged with elements of rurality. This is a surprising outcome given the professional roles and activities of these respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0042098011417903">
<title>The Bio-physical Environmental City</title>
<p>When the city did appear more clearly in the interviews, it usually manifested as some kind of bio-physical environmental entity whose forms and functions were to be modified so as to reduce its impacts on the ex-urban or ‘natural’ environment. The next quotation from an interview with a member of the city council’s planning team is an excellent example of this</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Interviewer</italic>: What would a sustainable city be like?</p>
<p><italic>Planning team member</italic>: Um … a sustainable city? I don’t know what it would look like but I know what it would have to do. It would have to be virtually closed loop on things like toxins. We would have to work out what level the environment would reasonably sustain, and make sure we didn’t exceed that. At the moment it’s being grossly exceeded.</p>
<p><italic>Interviewer</italic>: How would we know what that level was?</p>
<p><italic>Planning team member</italic>: We have to do a lot of research. We know that X level of toxins has an effect on Y species and we do know a lot about that sort of thing. We need to find cleaner ways of doing things. It [the city] wouldn’t necessarily need to generate its own energy but it would have to ensure that the energy … generate[d] in some remote location didn’t have adverse effects on the environment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The city in this view is at least apparent, but it is the city’s physical form that is both problem and solution, so the operationalisation of urban sustainability is confined to tangible, infrastructural elements. Furthermore, these solutions are delivered in technical and apolitical terms. It is highly debateable that a city, as a place where people actually live, work and play, can be usefully thought of, and manipulated, in such a fashion, although this has not stopped some New Zealand local authorities from trying. Proposals for urban intensification are particularly good illustrations of this, but there are other small examples, as shown in this next quotation from a group housing representative whose concerns reflected her professional orientation</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean it all comes down to resource management. It’s all about trying to use products that have the least impact on the environment. Sustainability is a part of all that drama really. And umm … it’s something that everyone’s concerned with, especially those with children and you think that you know perhaps in 30 years time what are my children going to be left with if we don’t recycle and we don’t use product that is not going to break down and all that kind of thing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It might have been be expected that the interviewees’ would characterise or operationalise urban sustainability in ways that reflect their area of expertise. What is more surprising is the way some of the urban practitioners we interviewed focused on the physical or economic rather than human elements of the city in implicitly or explicitly <italic>misanthropic</italic> ways. The following responses are good examples. The first is from an interview with a real estate developer</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Urban sustainability means to me that we shouldn’t be hampering growth or interfering in markets unless there’s good reason to do so. And I’m not hostile to a sound regulatory framework, in fact I’d encourage that, but I think we still have a long way to go to getting that here in New Zealand … And I’ve seen a lot of the problems with the old planning culture [of the ‘interventionist’ Town and Country Planning Act where Social Impact Assessments were common] not being knocked on the head. What I would have liked to have seen was a greater focus on us all having to meet reasoned and reasonable environmental standards.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second response is from an interview with a member of a city council planning team</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Interviewer</italic>: What about if something is sound in a technical environmental sense but it’s something that the community doesn’t want?</p>
<p><italic>Planning team member</italic>: That happens all the time. That’s your cell phone tower, your landfill. They fight them and it’s more difficult under the Resource Management Act to fight it from a NIMBY point of view. Why shouldn’t it happen if it’s environmentally sound?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third response is from another city council employee working in the area of urban policy. They had a strong bio-physical orientation towards urban sustainability and expressed concern that urban residents were not taking such matters seriously</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>City council employee</italic>: We almost need more disasters, or we need more floods … We need these events that wake people up to seeing the global picture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although it may be a commonplace to argue that the sustainability discourse is overly technocratic and that a stronger social orientation is needed, this last comment in particular indicates something rather more serious than simple neglect of social issues. It is quite chilling that a servant of the public would welcome widespread upheaval, dislocation and possibly even physical harm or death to the city’s residents in order to ‘teach people a lesson’ about the environment. Clearly, for some, the biocentric orientation to urban sustainability manifests in outright hostility towards people as a way of driving the environmental cause forward. Within such a milieu, a sustainable city becomes a paradox—reminiscent of the anecdote about the bus that could only run on time if it didn’t stop to pick up passengers.</p>
<p>Even in their less extreme forms, purely bio-physical environmental approaches to urban sustainability often seem to sit uneasily with everyday life in the city. It is very difficult, for example, to imagine actually living in something described as ‘a closed loop on toxins’. In many of the accounts of urban sustainability that we heard, those aspects of everyday life that give the city its flavour, its social dynamism and its institutional richness, were overlooked in favour of a very technocratic, bio-physical environmental interpretation. In these terms, it seems there is little place for people in these ‘sustainable cities’.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, this has been exacerbated by attempts to enshrine ‘sustainable management’ in legislation. The Resource Management Act, and the problems associated with operationalising sustainable management, still confound those who have to work with it, as our practitioners often had to do. The next interview excerpt, from a regional councillor, while lengthy, aptly illustrates how confusion over the Act’s intent and meaning encourages, almost forces, a bio-physical environmental and technical interpretation of sustainability</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Regional] councillors are … dictated to very much by law … particularly the Resource Management Act … So if I go to the Act and I look at the bit that talks about sustaining the life-giving capacity of air, water and ecosystems … and I ask ‘how can I do that?’; and if I look at the part of the Act right next to that which talks about future generations and I ask ‘how I am to do that?’, I have to say about those two pieces of the Act, frankly, I’m damned if I know … What’s the test? … But right after that I come to [a section in the Act] which says I have an obligation to avoid, remedy or mitigate the effects of … actions on natural and physical resources. Then I say ‘here is a test’ … That’s the bit I can see makes sense in terms of what … I understand the decision-making process in relation to the law to be.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Importantly, this tendency to focus on the bio-physical environment at the expense of social, economic and cultural environments is actually and actively worked out through particular urban policies to become a standard part of planning, architectural and building practice. Consequently, the <italic>doing</italic> of urban sustainability centres on the double glazing of windows, installation of solar panels, recycling and providing energy-efficient public transport and the like. Although they represent a very simplistic and superficial reading of sustainability, these are the activities upon which much of the apparent consensus driving the fervour surrounding urban sustainability in New Zealand rests. They represent things that can be achieved in clear, measurable ways, unlike policy proposals associated with the messy, subjective and rich realm of the real people who actually inhabit the city.</p>
<p>Not all the practitioners interviewed were concerned solely, or even primarily, with the bio-physical environmental elements of urban sustainability, but those few practitioners who tried to articulate more comprehensive or holistic versions of urban sustainability really struggled to integrate social, economic and bio-physical environmental elements. These expanded versions were markedly less coherent than bio-physical environmental accounts of urban sustainability. Consequently, relevant interview transcripts are too lengthy and too fragmented to include here but, to summarise, more holistic accounts of urban sustainability suffered the effects of accommodating such wide-ranging topics as war, school lunches, single-parent families and chemical toxins, all in one paragraph! The tendency for such accounts of urban sustainability to spiral ever-outwards seriously hinders those advocates who would see urban sustainability as a driver of more widespread, politicised and comprehensive change.</p>

<title>Restoring and Repopulating the Sustainable City?</title>
<p>These results can assist us in answering a number of questions posed at the outset of this piece concerning practitioners’ understanding and application of urban sustainability in all its fluidity and the role of the city itself in mobilising those ambitions. On the first score, our study revealed both harmony and discord in the understanding of the term urban sustainability amongst urban practitioners in Christchurch, New Zealand. Given the strong emphasis in parts of the city council’s policy work on social development, in the ‘People’s Republic’, we might have expected a more thorough integration of urban sustainability’s bio-physical environmental, social and economic elements. Instead, we found an elided and impoverished sense of urban sustainability in which the city and its residents (and therefore a significant social component) appeared only fleetingly and often not at all; indeed, they were almost invisible. Our data suggest that the complex integration of social, economic and bio-physical environmental elements that gave urban sustainability much of its original legitimacy has been trimmed to a set of lowest common denominators, both discursively (in articulations of the concept) and materially (literally in concrete), through the identification and promulgation of ‘eco-friendly’ measures, such as solar panels, public transport networks, rain-savers, hybrid vehicles and the like. Such measures generated high levels of accord across different interest and professional groups and enjoyed widespread support. Although some may consider this bio-physical environmental focus in both interpretation and application to be an ideal outcome, we have identified a number of important problems.</p>
<p>The first is that ignoring the social world in favour of manipulating the built form of the city and its components shifts our focus to the physical world rather than the behaviour, aspirations and experiences of the residents (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011417903">Soneryd, 2004</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417903">Bonnes <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). As Neuman has noted</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One cannot overlook the fact that [urban] form is both the structure that shapes process and the structure that emerges from a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011417903">Neuman, 2005</xref>, p. 22).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead, we should be asking whether the <italic>practices</italic> of city-building, living, producing and consuming are sustainable because, as Neuman pointed out, urban form is a snapshot of more or less sustainable processes and not a measure of sustainability in itself.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the integrative potential of urban sustainability is clearly lost. In a discourse that focuses on the bio-physical environment, (urban) sustainability—as we found it—lacks social and cultural dynamism and it therefore fails to situate what should be ‘rational’ responses to environmental problems in meaningful urban contexts. As just one example of this, in an attempt to reduce vehicle emissions, the authorities in Mexico City imposed a one-day-a-week ban on private cars. Numerous residents bought an additional vehicle to circumvent the ban, many of which were cheaper, older models with high levels of emissions and, consequently, overall levels of pollution actually increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011417903">Eskeland and Feyzioglu, 1997</xref>). In short, overemphasising the bio-physical environmental aspects of urban sustainability and ignoring everyday activities and contexts where people actually work, live and play, is unlikely to be successful (or sustainable) in the long term.</p>
<p>A third, perhaps more critical, problem identified here is the way constrained bio-physical environmental readings of urban sustainability promote and empower a narrow set of interests (that run counter to concerns for inclusivity and equity that gave the idea much of its original legitimacy) whilst at the same time cleansing the concept of its political content. Supposedly apolitical and apparently neutral techno-scientific and bio-physical environmental interests are well represented; other voices are correspondingly silenced. This was made clear when a planning team member wondered, rhetorically, why such things as cell phone towers and landfills should not happen if they are ‘environmentally sound’, even if the community protests on the grounds of aesthetics or ‘unfounded’ health concerns. If urban sustainability is <italic>in practice</italic> associated so strongly with the bio-physical environment, important social and economic considerations are effectively eliminated. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011417903">Krueger and Agyeman (2005)</xref> in their discussion of ‘everyday sustainabilities’ have argued that such concerns may be addressed under different rubrics elsewhere, the problem, quite precisely, is that they are addressed <italic>elsewhere</italic> rather than in tandem, and often in less important or influential fora. This erodes the concept’s potential to improve our cities in an integrated and holistic way.</p>
<p>Fourthly, our research exposes a real problem with the way the city is constructed in the urban sustainability discourse (which leads to other serious problems with the ways in which the city is reified in concrete). One point worthy of discussion is the degree to which these practitioners distinguished between <italic>urban</italic> sustainability and sustainability/sustainable development more generally. Our data suggest a fairly clear separation in the minds of our interviewees between town and country with the sustainability agenda connected quite firmly to the environment ‘out there’ beyond the city limits. If the city was mentioned, it was usually seen as a mechanism through which the ex-urban or natural environment could be improved. In some ways, this does position urban areas rather well in the context of ideas about the city unbound, extending well beyond administrative boundaries, poised to overcome illusive and unhelpful binaries between society and environment, natural and unnatural, city and rural. In these terms, and if we were able to highlight the connections between town and country more fully, urban residents would become more aware of the adverse effects of their lifestyles and modify their behaviour accordingly. This reading suggests, then, that by casting the sustainable city as an ex-urban concern these practitioners have easily managed to do something academics have only recently achieved.</p>
<p>Yet, a closer reading reveals that the city has not so much been recast as ‘ontologically indistinct’ from the country as largely ignored. This means, unfortunately, that many opportunities are lost and this, in turn, raises questions about what an urbanised sustainability might look like. An urbanised sustainability would obviously be attentive to nature in the city, but it would also look to exploit uniquely urban attributes that still exist despite some claims to the contrary. These speak to Soja’s concept of synoecism (or ‘cityness’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417903">Soja, 2000</xref>). Soja argues that synoecism explains myriad economic and ecological interdependencies or creative and destructive synergisms that come about through “the purposeful clustering and collective habitation of people in space, in a ‘home’ habitat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417903">Soja, 2000</xref>, p. 12). He argues that synoecism explains the development of, among other things, agricultural surplus, military forces, organised commerce and even religious institutions. Thus an urbanised sustainability would be attentive to economies of scale, vulnerabilities (and opportunities) arising from mutual dependence on infrastructure and services, security, anonymity of social exchange and so on.</p>
<p>Overall, our study documents the ways that the transformative potential of the urban sustainability concept as a reconciliation of social, economic and bio-physical environment dimensions has been eroded. This adds empirical foundation to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011417903">Latour’s (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098011417903">Whitehead’s (2005)</xref> contention that the sustainability movement risks becoming depoliticised, floating somewhere between the ‘marvellous and the mundane’. The study also contributes to a growing body of literature highlighting the futility of pursuing an overly bio-centric agenda divorced of social and economic concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011417903">Evans and Marvin, 2006</xref>). Finally, we challenge the current view of the city as conceptually indistinct from the country in order to raise what we see as very important questions about what an urbanised sustainability might involve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042098011417903">
<title>Revealing the City: Urbanising Sustainability</title>
<p>Our study suggests that, in New Zealand at least, the focus on the bio-physical environmental elements of urban sustainability has become so strong that the movement has, indeed, been depoliticised. In pursuing urban sustainability, for the practitioners we interviewed, the application of technical fixes appears to override any perceived need for systemic social and therefore political debate and solutions. Furthermore, the city itself plays a rather ambivalent role: on the one hand, present as a mechanism for ex-urban environmental improvements; on the other hand, absent of people—merely “a closed loop on toxins”. Ontologically, the city may be indistinct from its hinterland (and beyond), but in the quotidian, most people are still operating in particular places, loyal to (if not bound by) geography. Thus reaffirming the city’s active presence in the urban sustainability discourse may help us in several ways.</p>
<p>These are, first, reinforcing the notion that a city is nothing without its people. Re-urbanising and rehumanising the sustainability discourse may help us to overcome the obsession with physical infrastructure and form, and turn our attention to underlying social and economic processes. Brenner contended that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the urban can no longer be viewed as a distinct, relatively bounded site; it has instead become a generalized, planetary condition in and through which the accumulation of capital, the regulation of political–economic life, the reproduction of everyday social relations and the contestation of the earth and humanity’s possible futures are simultaneously organized and fought out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011417903">Brenner, 2009</xref>, p. 206).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead, as Brenner suggested, the urban <italic>is</italic> the social and there is value in revisiting some key lessons from critical social theory, such as those from the Frankfurt School, but in an urban light. For Brenner, a ‘critical urban theory’ would include greater reflexivity, a critique of instrumental reason and investigation of the disjuncture between the actual and the possible. He also advocates for greater theorisation of the socio-urban that may be “unashamedly abstract” and</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>characterized by epistemological and philosophical reflections; the development of formal concepts, generalizations about historical trends; deductive and inductive modes of argumentation; and diverse forms of historical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011417903">Brenner, 2009</xref>, p. 201).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Secondly, emphasising the city will help us to attend to the nature <italic>within</italic>. Rather than manipulating the city to achieve ex-urban goals, residents may be more convinced to change their behaviour by accounts and examples of the way they influence animals, plants and other people within the places where they actually live. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011417903">Capek (2010)</xref> gives an intriguing summary of four such examples that disturb nature/urban boundaries and hint at an urbanised sustainability: ecological restoration projects, human–animal interactions, the ‘post-natural’ environments of pollution and simulated environments that substitute for nature.</p>
<p>Finally, a focus on city-making processes as they actually play out in everyday life may reveal innovative ways of integrating economic, social and environmental goals which, in turn, aggregate towards a more sustainable city or, less optimistically, highlight barriers that prevent us from building better urban areas. The city is home to so many institutions through which multiple versions of the concept can evolve and, as a socioeconomic enterprise, it has the capacity to act as a conduit, giving strength to alternative or ‘transgressive’ networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417903">Murdoch and Lowe, 2003</xref>) of urban sustainability that are more equitable and progressive. The city, long characterised by diversity and difference, perhaps holds the greatest promise of accommodating the multiple and unfolding interpretations and applications of this alluring yet highly problematic idea.</p>
