<abstract>
<p>Minorities’ attitudes can be compared to attitudes of fellow citizen within the host country as well as to attitudes of the motherland. Given the heterogeneity of Luxembourg’s minority groups, this country is a relevant example case in which the comparison needs to involve answering a two-folded question. First, the authors analyze the level of measurement equivalence, that is, the extent to which different groups can be compared. Second, the authors examine whether ethnic-cultural groups within Luxembourg resemble citizens from their native country more than their country of residence. Using European Values Study (EVS) data from 2008 the authors demonstrate different types of outcomes. Results indicate that cultural background is more important than national context in the case of culturally more distant minorities to Luxembourg’s resident population and that national setting is the prevailing factor when minorities are from neighboring countries. The effect of a common national setting is also important with regards to the issue of measurement equivalence, where it contributes to greater comparability of intranational, cross-ethnic comparisons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cross-cultural comparative research usually involves the comparisons of different countries, which is made possible by a growing number of cross-national studies such as the European Values Study (EVS) or the European Social Survey. In this context Luxembourg is a peculiar and interesting case given that it is an ethnically diverse society making within-country cultural comparisons as relevant as cross-cultural comparison. Regardless of how cultural groups are defined, a critical issue is whether attitude questions measure the same concepts across cultures. For instance: Does agreeing with the statement, “A woman is less fit to work in construction business,” indicate a traditional gender role attitude in all societies? In some societies this might merely reflect concerns about health issues. This type of question is pertinent since the analysis of cross-cultural differences in attitudes presupposes that the concepts are measured in an equivalent or invariant way. In fact, finding out that respondents differ in the meaning they assign to survey questions might be the first cross-cultural difference that is observed. Hence, the two questions to ask in cross-cultural research are (a) do different cultures assign the same meaning to attitude questions, and if “yes” (b) how do cultures differ?</p>
<p>A sometimes neglected issue is how do we define cultural groups? In the aforementioned large-scale cross-national surveys cultural groups are most often defined by geographic entity, that is, countries or regions. Countries and regions, however, also identify nationalities or subnationalities of people. The concept of national background is what defines cultural groups in sociological research on ethnic minorities within countries. In that case groups with different ethnic-cultural background are compared. If we combine this two-fold perspective on cultural differences, for example, national setting and ethnic-cultural background, Luxembourg becomes an interesting case within Europe. Luxembourg is a small country that has attracted a significant number of immigrants from their neighboring countries, including Belgium, France, and Germany, as well as from the more distant countries such as Portugal and Italy. Do these immigrant groups think like their fellow residents in Luxembourg or like their ethnic-cultural compatriots from their home country?</p>
<p>In the present study we investigate two important and yet rarely researched issues in cross-cultural research, namely, measurement equivalence of cross-cultural data and comparison of attitudes of immigrant group with attitudes of their compatriots from countries of origin. The former issue is critical in comparative studies as it determines a degree of comparability of obtained data, and the latter question allows for exploration of influences of national contexts and cultural backgrounds on immigrant groups. For this purpose, we make use of the results from the new wave of the EVS that is conducted in 2008-2009. This research, thus, has a two-fold perspective:</p>
<list id="list1-1069397112440945" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>By checking to what extent native Luxembourgers, ethnic-cultural minorities in Luxembourg, and their compatriots from the country of origin differ in the meaning they assign to attitude questions we learn to what extent within- and between-country comparisons can be made. First and foremost, this is a methodological question that represents a precondition to the analysis of substantive results. However, in this research it has a substantive meaning as well. If, for instance, it was found that minorities in Luxembourg assign the same meaning to questions as the native residents of Luxembourg whereas citizens from their countries of origin assign a different meaning, we can conclude that national setting influences how people interpret survey questions regardless of the content that is being measured.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Results from this first analysis sketch the boundaries of the comparisons that are central to the second research question; that is, how do cultures differ in attitudes? More specifically, we are interested in finding out how much the ethnic groups in Luxembourg differ in attitudes compared to native Luxembourgers and to residents from their countries of origin. The former indicates the national setting in which attitudes are expressed, whereas the latter reflects a respondent’s ethnic origin. We like to underscore that our goal regarding this research question is not to explain but rather to explore and describe differences between given cultural groups.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The article is structured as follows. First, we present theories of immigrant integration that discuss integration processes both from a group and an individual level. These theories serve as a background to the research questions asked. Second, we briefly describe the Luxembourg context that serves as the reference point of our comparisons. Luxembourg is the case study chosen for its unique situation of being a small but internationally oriented society with a relatively large immigrant population. Third, we explain the concept of measurement equivalence and the research procedures using a multiple group latent-class factor analysis. And finally, after presenting the data and methodological approach, the empirical results are discussed.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<sec id="section3-1069397112440945">
<title>The Luxembourg Context</title>
<p>Given its diverse ethnic structure, and in many other ways, Luxembourg is a distinct country in Europe. With its population of just above 500,000 citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069397112440945">Eurostat, 2012</xref>) it is one of the smallest countries in Europe, the world’s only remaining sovereign Grand Duchy, with the highest GDP per capita in the world. Culturally and ethnically it is very diverse, influenced by the Romanic and Germanic cultural traditions, with three official languages. Immigrants in Luxembourg account for almost 40% of population (highest percentage in Europe), and immigrant residents and cross-border commuters represent 67% of Luxembourg’s labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1069397112440945">STATEC, 2005</xref>). As a matter of fact, aside from being the minority in labor market, according to population predictions, Luxembourgers will become a minority of residents during the next decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069397112440945">Hartmann-Hirsch, Bodson, Warner, &amp; Reinstadler, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The largest immigrant community is from Portugal (about one third of all immigrants) with many immigrants coming from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. There is a clear difference between residents from neighboring countries of France, Germany, and Belgium and those coming from more distant countries like Portugal and Italy. First, the neighboring countries build upon a history of cultural ties and have their nationals living longer in Luxembourg. Furthermore, the ethnic-cultural minorities coming from the neighboring countries typically fill in the middle to upper occupational levels in the labor market since most of them have higher levels of occupations. Portuguese are coming from the working families, with lower level of education, and usually are employed in the blue-collar positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069397112440945">Berger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069397112440945">Ghemmaz, 2008</xref>). The Italian minority is similar to the Portuguese in terms of social status and educational background, but has a much longer history of presence in Luxembourg society, dating back to the late 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069397112440945">Hausemer, 2008</xref>). In terms of a number of key measures of immigrant integration such as educational attainment, occupational specialization, and parity in earnings, as well as language attainment, one may expect a high degree of similarity in attitudes from ethnic-cultural groups from neighboring nationalities such as Belgians, French, and Germans. A somewhat reduced similarity could be expected from the Italians, due to their lower socioeconomical status and different language, and Portuguese, with similar socioeconomical background as Italians but much shorter presence in the country, could be expected to be most distant. However, in spite of Luxembourg’s ethnical diversity, the cultural distance of the aforementioned minority groups with the native population is not that large, since they all come from Western European countries with a Catholic background. Hence, the problems with immigrant integration and multicultural coresidence are not as prevalent as in some other Western European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069397112440945">Hartmann-Hirsch et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of large portion of minorities of different ethnic origin raises the question to which degree they conform to the common cultural influences of their national setting; that is, how much are they similar in their attitudes and values with their fellow residents in Luxembourg? On the other hand, attitudes and values may be more in line with the culture of the home countries rather than of Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In this work we will compare opinions and attitudes of the five biggest national groups from Luxembourg, namely Portuguese, French, Germans, Belgians, and Italians, with native residents of Luxembourg as well as with the compatriots from their countries of origin. Since the first step of the analysis involves researching the level of measurement equivalence, we elaborate on this issue in the next section.</p>

<sec id="section4-1069397112440945">
<title>The Concept of Measurement Equivalence</title>
<p>A fundamental concern in any cross-cultural research is being sure that differences between groups are due only to cross-cultural differences in the measured constructs and not due to some other factors that vary between countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069397112440945">Hui &amp; Triandis, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069397112440945">Przeworski &amp; Teune, 1970</xref>). In methodology this comparability, called <italic>measurement equivalence or measurement invariance</italic>, is defined as “whether or not, under different conditions of observing and studying phenomena, measurement operations yield measures of the same attribute” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069397112440945">Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992</xref>, p. 117). The issue of measurement equivalence is in no way specific to cross-national research. It is in principle present in any kind of group comparison, whether these groups represent different genders, organization units, testing modes, language groups, and in any other situations where measurement processes can differ between the groups compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1069397112440945">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>). Following the same logic, cross-ethnic comparisons should also be submitted to the analysis of measurement equivalence of the data. This is especially important considering the wide array of cultural and language characteristics in which ethnic groups (may) differ from each other. In this sense, the same reasoning that justifies the examination of measurement equivalence in cross-national studies can be applied to cross-ethnic comparisons.</p>
<p>Although in principle there is no real difference between the measurement equivalence analysis in cross-national and cross-ethnic studies, both in terms of the rationale behind the analysis and in terms of the procedures applied, in practice one can still expect differences in results. This is mostly because the cross-ethnic studies are done in intranational contexts, which makes these groups more similar to each other than the groups studied on the basis of their country membership. In other words, one could expect that the cultural distance is wider in the case of cross-national comparison than when ethnic groups within a specific country are compared. As a consequence, one might expect greater significance placed on measurement equivalence in the cross-national context. This is not to say that national context has a greater influence than ethnic background on the level of measurement equivalence, but rather that any degree of influence of national context is enough to make intracountry comparison more equivalent than intercountry comparison.</p>
<p>Following the same logic, it can be assumed that inequivalence in cross-national comparative research is most likely to occur when culturally distant countries are involved.</p>
<p>One of the solutions in such a case is to find a smaller group of less culturally distant countries that have equivalent results. This can be achieved either by excluding more distant countries from a pooled data set (top-down approach) or by starting with individual countries and including the most similar countries one by one (bottom-up approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069397112440945">Welkenhuysen-Gybels &amp; van de Vijver, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This leads us to our first hypothesis, which is related to the question of measurement equivalence between countries on one side and ethnic groups in Luxembourg on the other. We expect that the results between cultural-ethnic groups in Luxembourg are more equivalent and comparable than those between the other five countries (France, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, and Italy). The degree to which cultural-ethnic groups in Luxembourg are more equivalent depends on the strength of influence of national settings on citizen’s attitudes and values. Furthermore, it could also be expected that it will be easier to establish measurement equivalence of Luxembourg’s scores with France, Belgium, and Germany that are neighboring countries with less cultural distance, than when these scores are compared with culturally more distant countries like Portugal or Italy.</p>

<title>Theories of Immigrant Integration</title>
<p>One of the most prominent classical theoretical perspectives on immigrant integration is assimilation theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1069397112440945">1</xref></sup> Its key proposition is that the immigrants and the native population “converge” over time, becoming more similar in norms, values, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069397112440945">Alba &amp; Nee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069397112440945">Gordon, 1964</xref>). Thus, it is expected that the longer a person lives in the host country, or if a person is born in that country from immigrant parents, he or she becomes more similar with the host population in terms of norms, values, and behaviors. Others have stated that immigrant integration largely depends on the presence of racial and ethnic discrimination and institutional barriers to integrate, both economically and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069397112440945">Glazer &amp; Moynihan, 1963</xref>). In the presence of these barriers full integration will not be achieved in spite of the successes in learning the host language and increasing familiarity with its culture. Finally, a third perspective focuses on “segmented integration” claiming that structural barriers limit access to employment and other opportunities. These barriers have especially severe effects on marginalized members of immigrant groups, leading to divergent immigration trajectories and obstructing and even preventing any integration in some disadvantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069397112440945">Portes, Fernández-Kelly, &amp; Haller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The former theories mainly discuss how group experiences in integration differ. Other perspectives tend to depart from an individual perspective. The intergroup contact theory, for instance, states that mere exposure or interactions between members of ethnic groups can reduce prejudice and improve immigrant integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069397112440945">Allport, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069397112440945">Pettigrew, 1998</xref>). This is especially true if these contacts were characterized by equality in status, common goals, intergroup cooperation, and institutional support. Similarly, the theory of acculturation asserts that immigration represents a process of intercultural communication characterized by mutual and consistent engagement of members of distinct groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069397112440945">Castro, 2003</xref>). This interaction over time leads to incorporation of elements of other cultures into one’s own culture through a process of psychological adaptation known as acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1069397112440945">Redfield, Linton, &amp; Herskovits, 1936</xref>). Other perspectives are less optimistic about prospects for immigrant integration. The “resistance” theory claims that orientations or predispositions that are acquired earlier in life (pre)select subsequent information in a way that new knowledge is incorporated in accordance with preexisting one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069397112440945">Merelman, 1986</xref>). Thus, this perspective stresses the importance of early, “formative” years that limit or filter later learning, making it harder to integrate for those who have come as adults. Finally, from the point of view of the threat theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069397112440945">Blalock, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069397112440945">Blumer, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069397112440945">Quillian, 1995</xref>) it is argued that immigrant groups may be viewed as a threat to the political, economic, and social powers of local residents. This may consequently lead to negative attitudes, prejudices, and hostility toward them, and the level of perceived treat typically increases with (a) the increase in the size of an immigrant group relative to the majority group, and/or (b) the worsening of economic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069397112440945">Blalock, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069397112440945">Quillian, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these theories suggest three general sets of mechanism that lead minorities to either integrate within the culture of the country of residence or define barriers to cultural integration. The first one is “exposure to the new culture,” which according to “assimilation” and “intergroup contact” theories, leads to integration of immigrants into the new setting. The main determinant of this process is time, that is, duration of immigration spell. A second mechanism is socialization, both before and after immigration, which can improve (“acculturation” theory) and restrain (“resistance” theory) immigrant integration. Aside from time spent at each country, education and language are also important factors here, as they may alter the influence of socialization. Finally, the presence of barriers (“discrimination” and “segmented integration” theories) that are the consequences of perceived threats (“threat” theory) can be viewed as the third mechanism whose presence can substantially impair integration of immigrant groups with the native population. The main factors affecting this mechanism are social status, ethnicity, immigrant group size, language, and education.</p>
<p>On the basis of these theories, we can thus formulate our second hypothesis about our expectations regarding how similar attitudes of ethnic groups in Luxembourg are, compared to Luxembourg nationals and their compatriots from their home country. We expect that Portuguese minority’ attitudes will more closely resemble the attitudes of those from their home country than would be the case when they are compared with French-, Belgian- and German-origin minorities. This is because Portuguese have the shortest presence in Luxembourg, they are largest immigrant group, they speak a different language, and they come from working-class families with a social, educational, and economical background that is closer to that prevalent in their home country than that is prevalent in Luxembourg. On the other hand, French, Belgian, and German minorities come from neighboring countries with long cultural ties and common language, they have good positions on the job market and are economically well off, all of which are factors contributing to their greater integration. Finally, we expect Italian minority to be somewhere in between the two groups, with differences between them and the Luxembourgers in terms of language and their socioeconomical background being counterweighted with their longer history of presence in the country.</p>

<title>Method and Data</title>
<sec id="section7-1069397112440945">
<title>Method: Testing for Measurement Equivalence Using a Latent Class Factor Analysis</title>
<p>In this work we test for measurement equivalence using a latent class factor analysis (LCFA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069397112440945">Kankaraš, Moors, &amp; Vermunt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069397112440945">Magidson &amp; Vermunt, 2001</xref>). This method investigates whether the given relationship between a set of observed variables can be explained by one or several latent dimensions, allowing for a simultaneous factor analysis in several groups. In LCFA latent variable(s) are parameterized as categorical, discrete-ordinal variables. LCFA can deal with any type of categorical response variables, nominal as well as ordinal.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for choosing this particular approach to the analysis of ME. First, latent class models are well fitted for the analysis of Likert-type, discrete-ordinal items as well as dichotomous items and do not require traditional modeling assumptions (e.g., linear relationship, normal distribution, or homogeneity of variances). This allows LCFA models to avoid possible biases caused by violations of these assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069397112440945">Vermunt &amp; Magidson, 2005</xref>). Second, LCFA does not require any items in a scale need to be equivalent for identification purposes. Finally, LCFA has proven to be a useful and reliable method in detecting measurement equivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069397112440945">Kankaraš, Vermunt, &amp; Moors, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article we will describe the main characteristics and procedures of the LCFA approach to provide for an intuitive understanding of the approach. Researchers interested in more elaborate technical details can read <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069397112440945">Kankaraš et al. (2010)</xref>. Examples in which the method is applied are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069397112440945">Moors and Wennekers (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069397112440945">Kankaraš and Moors (2009)</xref> and an example for its comparison with other methods such as factor analytic and item response theory approaches would be the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069397112440945">Kankaraš et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>There are two main sets of parameters in an LCFA model. First, there are item- and category-specific intercepts, and second, there are item- and factor-specific slopes. The slope parameters indicate the strength of the relationship between the latent and indicator variables for each group and are thus conceptually similar to factor loadings from the LCFA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069397112440945">Kankaraš et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069397112440945">Magidson &amp; Vermunt, 2004</xref>). Situations in which slope parameters differ across groups are sometimes referred to as “interaction effects” since the grouping variable interacts with and modifies the effects of latent variables on indicator variables; that is, the relationship between the latent and indicator variables is different across groups. On the other hand, the presence of group differences in the intercept parameters is often called “direct effects” since such a model can also be conceptualized by including direct effects of grouping variable on indicator variables. In other words, direct effects are present when groups’ differences in latent variables cannot fully explain the observed group differences in indicator variables.</p>
<p>A model in which each of these parameters is assumed to differ across groups is an unrestricted, <italic>heterogeneous</italic> model that allows inequivalence across group in both types of parameters. It serves as a reference model since in order to establish equivalence and comparability we need a model in which these parameters are restricted to be equal across groups without deteriorating the fit of the model. Imposing restrictions on the heterogeneous model creates various nested, <italic>partially homogeneous</italic> models in which some but not all of the model parameters are restricted to be equal across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069397112440945">Clogg &amp; Goodman, 1985</xref>). A model with no interaction effects, that is, in which all slope parameters are set to be equal across groups, is an especially important partially homogeneous model. Although intercepts are allowed to differ, this model defines the relationship between the latent and indicator variables to be the same across groups, hence making it possible to compare group differences in latent class membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069397112440945">McCutcheon &amp; Hagenaars, 1997</xref>). Finally, if both intercept and slope parameters are restricted to be equal across group, that is to say if there are no direct and indirect effects in the model, complete equivalence and comparability of the results across groups are achieved.</p>
<p>The main objective in the analysis of measurement equivalence (ME) is to choose between these models by selecting the model that fits the data well enough with the lowest level of inequivalence possible. The LCFA typically relies on information criteria such as BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and AIC3 that evaluates both overall fit and parsimony of the models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1069397112440945">2</xref></sup> Chi-square and likelihood ratio statistics are also used, but their usability in the context of cross-cultural research is limited by large samples that are in most cases present in these kinds of studies. In particular, a large sample inflates the power of the test to the degree that it becomes sensitive to the smallest amounts of model misfit.</p>

<title>Data: EVS, Wave 2008-2009—Four Scales</title>
<p>In this study we used data from the new wave 2008-2009 of the EVS that is conducted in 45 European countries (all European countries with population above 100,000), with nearly 70,000 participants. We used data from the following countries: Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Luxembourg. National random samples were drawn from a population of adult citizens aged 18 years or older. We have selected four scales from the survey (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1069397112440945">Table 1</xref>). These scales were chosen for three particular reasons. First, they showed a clear unidimensional structure that simplifies our analyses. Second, the selected scales allowed us to demonstrate a number of different scenarios with regards to measurement (in)equivalence. Third and most important, we selected scales that at face value indicate different contextual situations in which the attitudes are expressed, that is, scales that relate to personal, national, and international issues. The first scale measuring confidence in institutions is made of 18 questions with 4 answer categories (“Confidence in Institutions” scale) and mainly refers to the national context. The second scale consists of four dichotomous items that measure a respondent’s opinion about the capacity of church to give answers to problems in various life domains (“Church Gives Answers” scale). In our opinion this scale represents a personal issue that differentiates individuals within all religions and nations. The third scale consists of a set of 5 items, each with a 10-point scale, that are designed to measure personal fears/uneasiness about the building of the European Union (“EU Fears” scale). The EU defines the cross-national context. The fourth scale has 4 items with 4-point scales that ask participants to rate the importance of various leisure time activities (“Leisure Time” scale). Leisure activities refer to a personal context although a national/regional context might shape the circumstances in which activities can be developed. More details on the characteristics of the four scales are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1069397112440945">Table 1</xref>. With this variety in scales we will be able to illustrate the diversity in outcomes of comparing between different cultural groups.</p>

<p>In this research the coding of the variables is such that respondents with higher scores in the “Confidence in Institutions” scale have higher confidence in institutions; in “Church Gives Answers” scale, are more certain in church’s capacity to give answers to life’s problems, in “EU Fears” scale, are more afraid of the processes of EU integration; and the higher scores in “Leisure Time” scale indicate that respondents place more importance on leisure time activities.</p>
<p>The response variables from each of the four scales have a certain amount of missing values. In particular, the “Leisure Time” scale has only about 1% of cases with missing data both in the six countries and in Luxembourg, whereas the “EU Fears” scale has 8% of cases with missing data in the 6 countries and 11.1% in Luxembourg. Largest proportion of missing values are present in “Confidence in Institutions” scale, with 21.8% missing data in the 6 countries and 28.3% within Luxembourg, and in “Church Gives Answers” scale, with 18.8% in 6 countries 21.7% within Luxembourg. Given the large amount of missing data in these two scales we compared the results of an analysis with listwise exclusion of missing data with an analysis assuming that data are missing at random (MAR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069397112440945">Little &amp; Rubin, 1987</xref>). No substantial differences were found between the two models in either of the two scales.</p>
<p>Five of the six covariates we used in the analyses; that is, “age,” “gender,” “education level,” “church attendance,” and “duration of residence,” have no or only very few missing cases. “Income,” however, has a substantial percentage of missing cases, which is 22.6% in the 6 countries and 23.8% in Luxembourg. Rather than using the aforementioned MAR procedure, we decided to include “income,” which is measured in discrete classes, as a nominal variable with “missing” as one of the categories. In none of the analyses the later “missing” category deviates significantly from the average scores of the respondents, indicating that the missing values in this variable follow a random pattern—at least in its relationship to the scales we examine in this research.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the next sections we present the results in three steps. First, we focus on the analysis of measurement equivalence. Second, comparisons of group scores between ethnic groups and across countries are presented when the results of the first analysis indicate that comparisons can be made. Third, comparison is made between scores of each ethnic group in Luxembourg and their respective countries of origin.</p>
<p>We have decided to conduct two consecutive tests of measurement equivalence. As a starting point we estimate the within-Luxembourg level of equivalence, and in a second analysis we test measurement equivalence between country samples. The logic of this is that we need to first establish within-country equivalence before Luxembourg can be compared with other countries. Also since the Luxembourg sample is a random sample, the different ethnic groups contribute small samples, with 803 Luxembourgers, 215 Portuguese, and about 100 respondents from each of the other 4 ethnic groups. Since the size of the sample influences model fit we need to take into account that the within-country comparisons involves fewer cases than the between-country analyses.</p>
<p>The target sample size at the country level was equal to 1,500. However, since some of the countries—and especially Portugal—apply some strong upweighting, that is, weight factors of 1.8 or higher, of large portions of their original sample, we decided to downweight national samples to 1,000 per country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1069397112440945">3</xref></sup> To compare model fit in latent class analysis researchers rely on information criteria such as BIC or AIC. With large samples, as is the case with between-country comparisons, researchers rely on the BIC statistic since it has a built-in control for sample size, which is absent in other information criteria such as AIC and AIC3. As with L<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1069397112440945">2</xref></sup> statistics the latter two are sensitive to model misfit in cases with large samples. With small samples, however, conclusions are guided by comparing all three information criteria mentioned. If they point toward the same model, that model should be preferred. Ideally, all the groups we are comparing should have been of approximately equal size. One might wonder whether the smaller within-country samples will not more easily point toward a homogeneous measurement model, whereas at the country level a large sample would “push” results toward more heterogeneous models. The fact that we only use BIC in the between-country comparison and the three criteria in the within-country comparison meets this concern. Alternatively, one could estimate models in which the sample size at the country level is reduced to the level of the within-country samples. We have estimated such models by weighting the country samples to be equal to 300. The results of these analyses are consistent with the use of BIC in the between-country comparisons and the comparisons of the three information criteria with small samples (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1069397112440945">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>
<p>After researching measurement equivalence and establishing at least partial equivalence we compare group scores in a given scale. First, we compare countries and ethnic groups in Luxembourg in terms of group mean scores on the four scales while controlling for age and gender of respondents. This way we exclude the possibility that country differences reflect composition differences in terms of age and gender. Second, we include an additional set of covariates that, according to theoretical perspectives presented earlier, may explain part of the differences between groups. These covariates are education, income, and respondents’ duration of residence in Luxembourg (the latter one is applied only in the within-Luxembourg comparisons). In the case of “Church Gives Answers” scale we also added a measure of church attendance as an additional covariates since opinions regarding the church is expected to depend on a person’s level of religiosity. Third, we compare the ethnic group scores with the scores of their respective home countries.</p>

<title>Analysis of Measurement Equivalence</title>
<p>To what extent is the measurement of the four scales equivalent across cultural groups? To analyze this, three models are compared in terms of their fit to the data: a heterogeneous model with inequivalent intercept and slope parameters, a partially homogeneous model with inequivalent intercept but equivalent slope parameters, and a homogeneous model in which both sets of parameters are equivalent. Lower values of BIC, AIC, and AIC3 indicate better fit of models for a given number of parameters. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref> we present the ME analyses for all four scales. For each scale we report the results of (a) the within-Luxembourg ethnic groups comparison, and (b) the between-country analysis.</p>

<title>“Confidence in Institutions” scale</title>
<p>The analysis of ME of the “Confidence in Institution” scale within Luxembourg in most part indicates that the results are equivalent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; see Item 2.1, a.). Here BIC and AIC3 have the lowest values in the homogeneous model, with both intercept and slope parameters constrained to be equal across the national groups, whereas AIC points toward the partially homogeneous model. At the country level, on the other hand, the analysis shows that the best fitted in terms of the BIC value is the partially homogeneous model in which item intercepts are estimated separately in each country (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; see Item 2.2, b.). When reducing the country sample sizes to 300 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1069397112440945">Appendix 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1069397112440945">Table A1</xref>, Item a), which makes the group sample sizes similar to the within-country samples, both AIC values also point to the partially homogeneous model. As indicated before with small sample sizes models selection is based on the fact that the three information criteria lead to the same result, whereas with large samples BIC is preferred since this is the only criteria that penalizes for sample size. Since the slope parameters in this model are equal across countries, this also means that there are no significant differences in the relationship of the latent variable with response variables across countries. Therefore, it is still possible to compare group differences in factor scores across countries, once direct effects are taken into account.</p>

<sec id="section12-1069397112440945">
<title>“Church Gives Answers” scale</title>
<p>Results of the analysis of ME within Luxembourg in the case of “Church Gives Answers” scale indicates that the ethnic group scores in Luxembourg are comparable, since all three fit statistics indicate best fit of the homogeneous model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; see Item 2.2, a.). On the other hand, in the country-level analysis, BIC statistic again indicates that the partially homogeneous model with direct effects is the best-fitted model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; see Item 2.2, b.). This conclusion is supported with the results of the analysis with reduced sample sizes, where the partially homogeneous model is also best fitted in terms of AIC statistic (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1069397112440945">Appendix 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1069397112440945">Table A1</xref>, Item b).</p>

<p>Comparing fit statistics’ values of the three measurement models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref> (Item 2.3, a.) we can conclude that the homogeneous model has the best fit (i.e., has lowest values of BIC, AIC, and AIC3). In the analysis of ME of the “EU Fears” scale for the six countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; Item 2.3, a.) the homogeneous model is the best-fitted model in terms of BIC statistic. Note that when we reduce the sample sizes of the countries to 300 we could apply the “small sample size rule” and we find that all three statistics indicate the homogeneous model (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1069397112440945">Appendix 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1069397112440945">Table A1</xref>, Item c). Hence, we can confidently decide that measurement equivalence is established at both the within- and between-country level. This indicates that the EU context shapes a mutual understanding of attitudes toward the EU.</p>

<title>“Leisure Time” scale</title>
<p>The within-Luxembourg analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; Item 2.4, a.) again indicates that the best-fitting model is the homogeneous model. This means that the results from this scale are comparable within the six national groups in Luxembourg. Results, however, are completely different in the case of the between-country analysis, in which we find that the heterogeneous model fits the data best (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; Item 2.4, b.). Thus, the country scores on this scale cannot be validly compared across six countries, since they have different meaning in different countries. However, this does not necessarily imply that we cannot compare any of these countries. To locate the source of inequivalence we have run separate analyses with data sets that each time excluded one country. It turns out that results are inequivalent in each of the data sets that includes Portugal. However, when Portugal is excluded from the analysis, the remaining five countries have partially equivalent results and can be compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069397112440945">Table 2</xref>; Item 2.4, c.). Hence, leisure time items have a different meaning compared to the other groups.</p>

<title>“Confidence in Institutions” scale</title>
<p>In the analysis at the Luxembourg level Portuguese and Belgium minorities show the largest confidence in institutions, whereas German and Luxembourg nationals have least confidence in institutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1069397112440945">Table 3</xref>, Item a.). Covariates as such had no significant effect and do not change country comparisons.</p>
<p>Since the ME analysis of “Confidence in Institution” scale across countries carried out in the previous step showed that the partial model is the best-fitted model, we analyzed that model with covariates. It turns out that citizens of Luxembourg and Italy are less confident in institutions than average, whereas respondents from Portugal are more confident. It should be noted that country scores change substantially with the inclusion of direct effects (accounting for measurement equivalence). Only income is significantly related to the confidence scale, but the effect of covariates on group scores is minimal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1069397112440945">
<title>“Church Gives Answers” scale</title>
<p>The Portuguese minority is also the most certain about the capacity of church in giving answers on problems in different spheres of life. Luxembourg nationals score lowest on this scale. Effects of church attendance and education are both rather strong in this case and group differences change substantially when controlling for these variables, especially when church attendance is included.</p>
<p>Respondents from Portugal and Italy are most certain about church’s capacity to give answer to life problems, whereas citizens of the other four countries, and especially respondents from Luxembourg, are much less convinced in church’s capacity. Addition of direct effects does not have as profound an effect on results as in the case of “Confidence in Institutions” scale. Church attendance again influences results substantially; it seems that skepticism toward church is mostly due to low religiosity in Germany, France, and Belgium, whereas in the case of Luxembourg skepticism increases when religiosity is taken into account. Respondents’ age and education also have statistically significant effects but with limited influence on country scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1069397112440945">
<title>“EU Fears” scale</title>
<p>Judging by the scale scores, the most afraid of the EU integration processes, on average, are members of the Portuguese minority, with the least afraid being the German minority. The effect of education is substantial especially in case of the Portuguese-origin group. Education makes all groups move toward the Luxembourg’s national average. The effects of income and duration of residence are neither significant nor substantial.</p>
<p>A similar picture emerges in the between-country comparison. Controlling for age and gender, the results indicate that the residents of Portugal are the most afraid of the EU integration, with residents of Italy and Luxembourg being the least afraid. Differences in education level influence the results considerably. When the information on income is added to the model the scores do not change substantially although income has a significant effect as such.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1069397112440945">
<title>“Leisure Time” scale</title>
<p>In the case of the “Leisure time” scale we see that the Portuguese minority places the most importance to leisure activities and Italians the least. Although none of the covariates have statistically significant influence on valuing leisure time, country differences change slightly with the inclusion of education.</p>
<p>As indicated before, the Portuguese sample was excluded from the between-country comparison on the “Leisure Time” scale due to measurement inequivalence. Results indicate that French citizen place the most importance to leisure activities (“la douce France”?) and the German citizens are the least inclined to value leisure activities among the five compared countries (which is, again, in accordance with some laypersons theories). Results are pretty stable even after addition of direct effects and inclusion of covariates. Education has a significant but unsubstantial effect on leisure time attitudes.</p>

<sec id="section20-1069397112440945">
<title>Similarities and Differences Between Countries and Their Respective Nationalities in Luxembourg</title>
<p>In the final stage of this research we integrate the findings from the within- and between-country analysis. The scores presented in the figures are values controlling for the effects of all covariates. The latter implies that the differences between groups cannot be attributed to differences in covariates. To facilitate comparisons we have changed the gamma values of the between-country analyses from values that reflect the difference from the overall mean (= deviation coding) to values that reflect the difference with Luxembourg (Luxembourg score is fixed as 0, the reference category). Hence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069397112440945">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1069397112440945">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1069397112440945">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1069397112440945">4</xref> country scores denote the degree to which scores of the other five countries differ from the score of Luxembourg. Luxembourg’s score is defined by all groups within that country. For that reason the results from the within-Luxembourg analysis using deviation coding can be directly compared to the between-country results since both within- and between-country analyses are now indicating group differences in relation to the Luxembourg’s national average.</p>

<p>The comparison of results in the “Confidence in Institutions” scale reveals two opposite trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069397112440945">Figure 1</xref>). On one side, there is a relative agreement between scores of Portuguese, Belgian, and Italian minorities in Luxembourg with scores of respondents from their respective countries of origin; they all show higher-than-average levels of confidence in institutions. On the other side, French and German minorities differ substantially from their compatriots with the biggest contrast being between German minorities who have little confidence in institutions and Germans in the native country scoring fairly high on trust on institutions. It is also important to note that in general countries are more distinct to the Luxembourg average than that of the ethnic-cultural groups. This suggests that integration in Luxembourg context may be a decisive mechanism.</p>
<p>A similar observation is made when comparing groups on the “Church Giving Answers” scale. All minority groups in Luxembourg are less certain in church’s capacity to answer problems than their compatriots in their countries of origin, the trend that is especially evident with Italian minority. Furthermore, although Portuguese minority again resembles attitudes of Portugal citizens better than that of Luxembourgers, differences in attitudes of French, Belgian, and Italian minorities with respondents from their respective countries are also substantial. Thus, it seems that the new context with its relative skepticism toward church capacities to solve problems reduces immigrant’s belief in church’s capacities but with different consequences, that is, degrees, depending on the minority group in question.</p>
<p>There is a rather big difference in attitudes toward EU integration between French and especially German nationals living in Luxembourg, whose level of fear of the EU integration process is lesser than the national average in Luxembourg, and citizens of Germany and France who are much more afraid compared to Luxembourg’s average. On the other side, Portuguese nationals living in Luxembourg have rather similar attitudes to their fellow nationals in Portugal, who expressed a great deal of anxiety about the EU integration process. The Italian minority in Luxembourg is also not at ease with EU expansion, which is in contrast with their compatriots in Italy, who are much less fearful about it.</p>
<p>Further indication of integration processes is present in the case of “Leisure Time” scale, where French, and especially German, minorities express much more similar attitudes to those of Luxembourg citizens, compared with those from their countries of origin. In particular, when compared to Luxembourg’s average, German and Belgian minorities place slightly more importance to leisure activities, and citizens of Belgium, and especially Germany, view them as much less important. On the other hand, French minorities in Luxembourg seem to place much less importance to leisure time activities than French nationals living in France. It seems that German work ethic and French propensity toward leisure activities that make them so distinct in the country-level scores are muted in their minority representatives in Luxembourg and overpowered by the influence of national context, making them much more similar to their fellow Luxembourg-native residents.</p>

<title>Concluding Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study a cross-cultural comparative perspective is linked to between- and within-country comparisons by answering a two-fold question; that is, what is the level of within- and between-country measurement equivalence, and how do ethnic minorities’ attitudes compare to attitudes of citizens from their host country and home country?</p>
<p>First we analyzed the level of measurement equivalence, that is, the extent to which countries and ethnic groups in Luxembourg assign the same meaning to attitude questions. We have selected four scales from the EVS 2008 to demonstrate different type of results from such analyses. Results showed that the four scales are equivalent within Luxembourg; that is, ethnic groups in Luxembourg interpret the questions in a similar way and that their resulting group scores are thus comparable. On the other hand, country-level analysis showed different results. Although country scores were equivalent in the “EU Fears” scale, they were only partially equivalent in the “Confidence in Institutions” and “Church Giving Answers” scale. Nonequivalence was found in the “Leisure Time” scale, but the main source of inequivalence was data from Portugal. Excluding the Portuguese sample from the analysis resulted in partial equivalence among the remaining countries. These results seem to confirm our initial assumption that equivalence is more difficult to achieve in a cross-national than in an intranational setting. The importance of this finding is that it indicates that the principle of cultural distance might be one of the most important determinants of measurement (in)equivalence. Furthermore, the result also indicates that national context of where one is living may make different ethnic groups alike as far is assigning meaning to survey items is concerned. The latter conclusion is provisional since it was specific to the case of Luxembourg and needs confirmation in other national contexts as well. Nevertheless, even at the country level a fair amount of measurement equivalence was established given that the partially homogeneous model was mostly confirmed.</p>
<p>Second, we asked the question whether ethnic-cultural groups within Luxembourg would resemble citizens from their native country more than that of Luxembourger nationals in their attitudes. In this comparison we included significant background variables, which is important since ethnic minorities are not from a random sample chosen from their country of origin.</p>
<p>A first general finding was that differences between Luxembourg’s minorities’ and Luxembourg’s nationals’ average are much smaller than those observed between populations in their countries of origin and native population of Luxembourg. This was expected since it is hard to imagine that national context of residence would not have any influence at all. A second distinct finding is represented by the case of Portuguese nationals in Luxembourg; in all scales this population expresses rather different attitudes from the Luxembourg nationals’ average and, at the same time, shows attitudes more similar to that of their counterparts living Portugal. This pattern of results indicates that the Portuguese minority is still more closely connected to the culture and worldview of their native country than that of Luxembourg. Only as far as the Leisure Time scale is concerned a comparison of Portuguese minority in Luxembourg with citizens of Portugal was not possible, which is due to measurement inequivalence. A third distinct pattern is represented by German and French minorities. They consistently differ in their attitudes from their compatriots in Germany and France. In most cases they either move toward or even equal the Luxembourg average. Finally, the effects of theoretically important covariates are shown to have limited influence on results with only education and church attendance having substantial influence on group scores.</p>
<p>Overall, these results are in accordance with our expectations derived from theories of immigrant integration. In particular, it turned out that cultural background is more important than national context in case of Portuguese minorities who are culturally more distant to the native population and that national setting is a prevailing factor in case of German and French minorities who are better integrated in the Luxembourg society. The effect of common national settings is also important with regards to the issue of measurement equivalence, where it contributes to greater comparability of intranational, cross-ethnic comparisons. However, contrary to our expectations, inclusion of a number of covariates that are assumed to represent important factors in immigrant integration did not have much influence on the results. This may be attributed to the limited capacity of selected covariates to represent such concepts as social status, socialization, socioeconomical barriers or time spent interacting with host culture, and so on. But it could also indicate that immigrant integration depends more on inherent and specific characteristics of the given cultures that are not so easy to account for.</p>
<p>In the end, we want to stress that we recognize that people are not only objects of various social influences but rather active agents in their interaction with their social settings, with the potential both to change and, what is equally important, to choose the social environment they are living in. Thus, it is likely that (part of) these minorities have chosen to come to Luxembourg precisely because that cultural context fitted their personal characteristics making them already different from the average position of inhabitants from their home country. Likewise, taking into account the substantial proportion of immigrants in Luxembourg it is plausible that they changed Luxembourg national context to their liking to a great deal.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the influences that cultural background and national settings have on people are undeniable and substantial. In this article we have argued that these influences influence how people interpret survey questions (measurement equivalence) on one hand, and immigrant integration on the other.</p>
