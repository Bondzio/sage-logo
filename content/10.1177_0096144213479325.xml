<p>Two decades ago in an important essay, Martin V. Melosi, a pioneer in urban environmental history, defined the field’s proper focus: how “the physical features and resources of urban sites (and regions) influence and are shaped by natural forces, growth, spatial change and development, and human action. Thus the field combines the study of the natural history of the city with the history of city building and their possible intersections.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479325">2</xref></sup> The collection of books reviewed here demonstrates that these themes remain critically important and are still being revisited and revised. David Stradling’s <italic>The Nature of New York</italic> illustrates the interactive growth of the nation’s largest metropolis within the context of its larger state and region, while Zachary J. S. Falck’s <italic>Weeds</italic> creatively analyzes the persistence of nature and natural history (i.e., weeds) in the cities. While by no means tired in their interpretations, these two studies remain perhaps most tied to traditional urban environmental history as defined above—that is, as reciprocal studies of physical forces and cities.</p>
<p>Melosi also diagnosed the weaknesses of urban environmental history: it remained unintegrated in environmental history, which marginalized city spaces; it was undertheorized, especially regarding sociological and geographical theories; and it was narrowly empirical and focused on how cities functioned but not how they grew within the larger framework of the natural world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479325">3</xref></sup> To the extent that Melosi offered these shortcomings as a prospectus to future scholars, this collection of recent books bears out his hopes. Dorceta E. Taylor’s <italic>The Environment and the People in American Cities, 1600s-1900s</italic>, deploys a series of sociological theories on the urban environment, while Jennifer S. Light’s <italic>The Nature of Cities</italic> examines the rich theories urban thinkers applied in practice in the mid part of the last century. These studies mine theoretical perspectives for urban studies, situating the field better within larger theoretical traditions.</p>
<p>Historians have made new leaps. William Scott Swearingen Jr. and James Longhurst both rely on theoretical perspectives, but their books contribute arguably more by exploring the ways politics functioned around environmental themes. Melosi certainly recognized the importance of urban political reform, especially surrounding pollution issues, but he acknowledged that such work was still in its infancy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479325">4</xref></sup> Swearingen’s <italic>Environmental City</italic> and Longhurst’s <italic>Citizen Environmentalists</italic> about Pittsburgh provide nuanced and insightful work on urban political reform, and they impressively connect their specific urban case studies to larger national political trends of environmental activism and policy making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479325">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Melosi’s is not the only conceptual configuration, of course. Christine Meisner Rosen and Joel Arthur Tarr, introducing a special issue of <italic>Journal of Urban History</italic> in 1994, brought forth their own concepts. They posited four main themes for the field: “the analysis of the effects of cities on the natural environment over time; analysis of the impact of the natural environment on cities; the study of societal response to these impacts and efforts to alleviate environmental problems; and examination of the built environment and its role and place in human life as part of the physical context in which society evolves.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479325">6</xref></sup> Taken together, these two prescriptive essays presented a clear set of marching orders for urban environmental history two decades ago. However, there remains a multiplicity of approaches. The eclectic collection under review here offers an opportunity to consider how urban environmental history has evolved since its formative age. What these scholars reveal are strengthening foundations and proliferating case studies, deep concerns about democracy and inequity, and the myriad ways space—physical, social, and political—is produced in cityscapes.</p>
<p>Cities concentrate people, and as such, they concentrate environmental problems associated with humans. They also highlight issues of power among people. Dorceta E. Taylor takes as her study the emergence of elite reformers who sought to impose an urban order on the urban physical and social environments. Taylor, a sociologist, deploys race relations, social movement, and organizational theories in a broadly inclusive study that examines key issues that have plagued cities from the dawn of colonization to the 1980s. These issues included poverty, public health, housing, parks, occupational health, consumer protection, and urban planning. Taylor brings theoretical sophistication to her “historical analysis of the way race, class, and gender shape environmental experiences, perceptions, activism, and the construction of environmental discourses” (Taylor, 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479325">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A common set of actions to address environmental problems have flowed through urban history since colonial days, and Taylor describes the evolution of them. Overcrowding competed with green space priorities. Crowds also generated easy targets for epidemics of various diseases, including yellow fever which first hit Philadelphia in 1699 and returned on numerous occasions or cholera that devastated several American cities in various nineteenth-century outbreaks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479325">8</xref></sup> Combined with concentrated poverty, the hint of ill health drove wealthier residents out from city centers. Since spatial escape was not always possible, urban elites attempted to control urban space and the residents who inhabited them. Sanitation reform, such as sewer systems, and park building, as in New York’s Central Park, became typical efforts. Such attempts, like the City Beautiful movement, demonstrated an evolution from blaming individual behavior to assigning blame based on structural factors and saw reformers begin to suggest city dwellers had rights to cleaner, healthier spaces, such as parks that were sites of rich meaning. Although meant to uplift urbanites, they also imposed an elite order often to the dispossession and then exclusion of poorer residents. But, as with most things, the working class did not idly sit by and accept oppression; but they mobilized for increased access to existing parks and argued for more parks in their neighborhoods using the rhetoric of injustice to garner attention, sympathy, and assistance, as campaigns in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and elsewhere all demonstrated. Zoning became one more element in the urban arsenal to control cities. Residential neighborhoods, once managed by restrictive covenants, came to be incorporated into larger comprehensive zoning regimes that kept industry separate from residences and the wealthy from the poor. While civil rights activism successfully challenged legal racial segregation, zoning has remained critical to organizing American cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479325">9</xref></sup> Working-class urbanites confronted workplace hazards, such as lead poisoning or lung disease, and industrial pollution in their communities and fought back to eventually make such issues important national environmental questions—a process that was somewhat slow to insinuate into the mainstream environmental movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479325">10</xref></sup> Covering these developments in detail with numerous examples make this book likely the most comprehensive study of its kind produced so far and will become an important resource to historians.</p>
<p>Taylor’s essential story is: cities were sites where the disadvantaged faced increased environmental problems; elites sought to protect themselves while reformers improved city spaces in ways that often paradoxically and often purposefully reproduced disadvantages; however, the disempowered repeatedly used discourses from the elite to argue for improved conditions and better access with periodic, though often partial, success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479325">11</xref></sup> Readers who prefer narratives may struggle with <italic>The Environment and the People in American Cities</italic>. Although her examples are legion and generally compelling, a single narrative does not tie it together. Perhaps a book of such a broad scope cannot be captured within a typical narrative arc. Taylor provides countless examples of urban activism over centuries and urges historians to think more theoretically about socioeconomic structures influencing urban spaces. With mammoth research, this book will become a foundational work in urban environmental justice, providing national coverage in the tradition of such case studies as Andrew Hurley’s examination of Gary, Indiana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479325">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Taylor’s national story is largely one of how political economy and social relations shape urban space, Zachary J. S. Falck’s is more materialist in observing city shapes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479325">13</xref></sup> <italic>Weeds</italic> gets into the nooks and crannies of cities, finding the places where weeds took root and proliferated despite the best efforts of homeowners and city officials. In doing so, he imbues great meaning to weeds, using them to explore important questions of urban order (perhaps the most common urban environmental history topic) in social and ecological senses. <italic>Weeds</italic> is a creative study with interesting interpretations about cities, time, and space. As Falck writes, “That any plant can be a weed and that no plant is always a weed mean that plants are only thought to be weeds at particular times and in particular places” (Falck, pp. 4–5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144213479325">14</xref></sup> Thus, weeds make for unique and even provocative subjects that reveal especially well how cities are indeed part of larger ecological systems. Until very recently, eradicating weeds from cities was an unquestioned priority. Doing so was a sign of progress; it was a way for cities to distinguish themselves from the past and from other places. However, as Falck shows, denying weeds their place was like denying ecological time. Weeds typically are associated with people and with disturbance. Thus, their presence mark places of human and ecological change. Falck uses weeds to show this truth in multiple ways, in multiple cities, over more than a century.</p>
<p>Reformers from the end of the nineteenth century through most of the twentieth century and all over the United States sought to eliminate weeds. Urban Americans believed that weeds symbolized social disorder. Weeds meant that urban lots were not being utilized and that meant economic disorder; they were associated with delinquency, and that meant social chaos; they indicated environmental decline—even pollution—and that meant an environmental mess. Removing them would re-impose desired urban order. But because weeds followed human activity, regulating weeds meant regulating people, which was a costly proposition. Eventually, chemicals promised a solution. But while chemicals might remove ragweed, it did not alter the larger conditions that produced weeds or allowed them to flourish. In road rights-of-way or at the edges of cities and suburbs, weeds and debates grew, showing cities’ ecological influences following paths out of town.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479325">15</xref></sup> One 1950s debate was interesting as an ecologist, Frank Egler, argued that the best way to control weeds was to cultivate other plants instead of only herbicides. Such an idea offered an alternative to a total herbicidal solution, and Egler saw nature even in the roadsides (Falck, pp. 123–32). In more recent times, animosity toward weeds reflected concern about urban decay, while eventually concern about exotics entered into the rhetorical and management regime. Conversations about weeds continued to be about belonging—socially and ecologically. In creative ways, Falck reminds us again and again that cities exist in natural systems. And while weeds may remind urbanites of disorder, they also can remind urban historians that cities are natural, too, in time and space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479325">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>These two books are quite different, but in telling national stories about American cities, they offer useful perspectives. Other historians have taken national approaches but mostly with an infrastructure focus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144213479325">17</xref></sup> Taylor’s account reminds us that access to pollution or parks depended on evolving patterns of race and class, while Falck reminds us that what is wanted (in plants and in people) shifts with time. They both show, then, cities as products of complex historical forces, forces that include the evolutionary systems of plant germination or the patterns of racial exclusion. These authors are especially effective at placing cities within time. But cities are also situated in space, part of larger systems of states and regions.</p>
<p><italic>The Nature of New York</italic> by David Stradling is perhaps the oddest selection reviewed here, as it does not purport to be urban environmental history at all. Stradling acknowledges that a state as a study site makes little ecological sense, but cultural and historical reasons show us that there are reasons to study a state. But this approach allows us to consider the ways a city interacts with its hinterlands, a process that has been central to environmental history since William Cronon’s influential <italic>Nature’s Metropolis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144213479325">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Stradling begins his study with a chapter on Indian land use and colonial changes to the land, and then he moves forward toward recent developments in urban parks and restored forests. Much of the history of New York rests in engineering. From the Erie Canal which transformed the region’s commerce and watersheds to Robert Moses’s thruways in New York City that did much to decentralize the city, engineers followed market demands extending New Yorkers’ influence and power through the landscape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144213479325">19</xref></sup> In New York City that meant public health measures eventually to improve everything from water quality to housing conditions. It also saw the Brooklyn Bridge and other feats allowing residents to spread further from downtown as transportation revolutions changed the spatial nature of the city. By the dawn of the twentieth century, the city’s watershed extended into the Catskills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144213479325">20</xref></sup> Thus, people filled the city and moved away, and they simultaneously drew from upstate hinterlands, displacing rural residents along the way. In this way, New York City exemplified the ever-extending reach of urban America using economic, political, and technological power and influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144213479325">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the postwar era, New York like the rest of the nation awoke to greater environmental hazards, so the history of the last half-century has been marked by conflict between development and environmentalist values. Various public interest groups organized against such corporations as Consolidated Edison or Hooker Chemical when companies’ activities threatened with pollution from proposed or past activities. While threats from incinerator pollution or nuclear fallout seemed visibly obvious, scientific uncertainty and political inertia often made regulation lax and remediation slow. Multiple urban crises by the 1960s and 1970s made urban environmental issues a part of larger protests. Problems such as lead poisoning, garbage disposal, and rats accompanied overcrowded and poor New York City. Stradling tracks these and other issues well and connects them to developments within the national movement. New York (city and state) was well represented in pushing the movement forward. For instance, legal protests in the 1960s over a proposed Con Ed power plant led to environmentalists gaining the legal right of standing in court in <italic>Scenic Hudson v. Federal Power Commission</italic>, while toxic waste with tragic consequences in Love Canal upstate prompted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (popularly known as Superfund) to pass Congress in 1980. In these and other political campaigns and remedies, New Yorkers fought against market forces and historical momentum that saw nature as a source for cash and a sink for pollution.</p>
<p>Stradling claims that his history of New York touches “upon all the significant themes in American environmental history” (Stradling, 2). <italic>The Nature of New York</italic> persuades readers of the state’s and city’s exemplary status in the field. For urban historians, New York City has been topic of long attention. Stradling’s volume, along with the many germane sections of Taylor’s study, means the environmental components of the city’s history, from parks to pollution, will have more examples and richer sources.</p>
<p>Intellectual forces also guided the process of urban development, as Jennifer S. Light shows in her study on Chicago urban intellectuals in the mid-twentieth century. Her book, <italic>The Nature of Cities</italic>, explores the ways urban experts in planning, social sciences, and real estate deployed ecological thinking in influential ways to understand and ultimately manage city space.</p>
<p>A central ecological metaphor guided urban professionals in Chicago, and since Chicago led the nation in urban thinking, the nation. The metaphor was the life cycle. According to early twentieth-century ecological thought, as Light explains, ecosystems moved through predictable stages of life that ended in a stable climax. Just as conservationists in rural landscapes sought to intervene in the life cycles of forests or farms to promote better management of resources, urban professionals hoped to manage cities in much the same way. For instance, whereas foresters might clear a forest to promote more vigorous timber growth, urban planners might clear a slum to improve urban growth. In the 1920s and 1930s, urbanists applied ecological concepts to cities, called it a branch of human ecology, and analogized cities’ “structure, behavior, and evolution” with natural systems. The analogies were not perfect, and urbanists did not concern themselves with detailed and nuanced scientific debates but used “the broad explanatory powers of concepts, including natural area, competition, and succession” in their conceptualization of urban space (Light, 7).</p>
<p>Conceiving the city as going through predictable stages of growth and decline allowed intellectuals to predict—and, they hoped, to control—the shape of urban development. And prediction offered them tools to model, for instance, real estate zones that were seemingly “natural,” scientifically rationalizing racial segregation (Light, 37). It also was a short step from conceiving cities as akin to natural systems to seeing them as akin to natural resources that could be managed. Just as the New Deal ushered in renewed activity in natural resource planning for rivers, forests, and farmlands, it launched efforts at intervention in cities to restore balances that had been unwound by human failures. For farmers that might mean changing plowing patterns, but for urban planners, it meant using the power of eminent domain or organizing neighborhood improvement districts to improve wasted or damaged urban space, all framed as an element of community conservation.</p>
<p>A central irony ensued. Just as urbanists were drinking at the life cycle well and applying it locally and nationally, ecologists and conservationists were revising their sense of nature’s life cycles, finding the concept a bit too pat to describe ecosystems adequately. So, while the notion of ecological equilibrium had lost some favor, it continued to guide influential urban planners, especially in national urban policy. Light describes the assumptions embedded within that vision: “That residential development extended outward from a downtown core, that blight followed a predictable wavelike pattern, that economic and social problems mapped onto areas of physical decay, and that housing reform would help to cure cities’ broader ills—these basic assumptions were alive and well in Philadelphia and Portland, Cleveland and Detroit, Denver and Houston, Los Angeles and beyond, when opportunities to plan for renewal arrived” (Light, 139). As renewal efforts proceeded in such cities, the life cycle assumptions of growth–decay–change were seen as ill-fitting to the reality, for stable linear development did not follow, a lesson ecologists also had learned.</p>
<p>As Light argues persuasively, urban thinkers saw more continuity than discontinuity between cities and the country. Although pioneering work like Cronon’s <italic>Nature’s Metropolis</italic> have shown the material connections between city and country, <italic>The Nature of Cities</italic> does an intriguing job of showing the intellectual connections between the scientific approaches to understanding the city and the country. For four decades at least, urbanists like Homer Hoyt, an influential economist who worked in both Chicago and Washington, D.C., adapted ecological concepts, especially those of Frederic Clements, believing that cities followed predictable patterns that could be discerned and controlled and planned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144213479325">22</xref></sup> This intellectual component demonstrates the surprising crossover of conservation and ecology thinking from rural and wild to urban settings. This makes Light’s book an important one for urban environmental historians and points urban historians to heretofore unexplored areas of intellectual history.</p>
<p>Few would place Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Austin, Texas, within the same category given the heavy industrial basis of the former and the government and education center of the latter. But considering them together, especially in the heady days of the 1960s and 1970s, illustrates important trends concerning environmental representation in political reform. <italic>Citizen Environmentalists</italic> and <italic>Environmental City</italic> reveal how common were the strategies activists took even when the threats differed quite widely. That environmentalists in each city approached solutions in similar ways tells us that urban environmental politics worked within common nascent structures across the nation.</p>
<p>In his study of anti-pollution activists in Pittsburgh who formed GASP (Group Against Smog and Pollution), Longhurst works hard to focus his study on the public debate and exercise of citizenship by activists. To him, the environmental components of the movement were less important than the movement elements—that is, the exercise of citizenship in organizing protests and ultimately influencing policy making.</p>
<p>Longhurst details the ways that public hearings became the key to mobilizing citizens against corporations. GASP led the way with demands for broad-based citizens’ inclusion in regulating pollution, achieving standing to be heard at the local Variance Board which gave citizen environmentalists a substantive role in regulating corporate polluters. Longhurst uncovers who made up GASP and the approaches they took: “they were mixed-gender, middle-class professionals who used the language of citizenship, professional expertise, and maternalism to gain access to environmental policymaking and enforcement institutions” (Longhurst, 58).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144213479325">23</xref></sup> It proved an effective combination of people and strategies. They capitalized on their strong social position to gain access to the political system and deployed important rhetorical strengths, alternating maternalist claims about healthy cities and citizens with expert testimony. The former often was used in educational and organizational campaigns while the latter was deployed at Variance Board meetings. Combined, activists forged public spaces to protest the damage caused both to the atmosphere of Pittsburgh and the political system that had for too long supported polluting industries and excluded citizens.</p>
<p>There were limits to local influence and control, however. GASP members, and other supporting citizen environmentalists, became substantive partners in the regulatory regime. However, when GASP brought suits against U.S. Steel and Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel in the 1970s amid a struggling economy, it discovered that corporations still exercised significant power, could easily use delaying tactics, and framed environmental compliance against job losses in ways that resonated with many. Yet, that GASP could even bring suit, of course, was an achievement of citizen environmentalism from these years that saw citizens’ relationship with the state fundamentally change (Longhurst, 170).</p>
<p>Although Austin, Texas, was not characterized by the same legacy of industrial pollution that led to widespread calls by citizens for urban cleanup, concern about its livability prompted longstanding citizen activism somewhat akin to the Pittsburgh experience. Swearingen’s <italic>Environmental City</italic> follows citizens who fought to shape modern Austin and define its sense of place. These debates centered mainly on questions of growth. In essence, residents asked whether Austin “would be a place defined by economic output, money, and wealth” or if it would be “a place defined by its quality of life” (Swearingen, 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144213479325">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Swearingen explores the founding efforts to make Austin an environmental city. The main targets of these efforts were to protect or develop parks and greenbelts, especially along Austin’s numerous creeks and lakes, while the key forces propelling action were the numerous organizations that formed, often among middle-class women and neighborhood associations, including WE CARE Austin (Women’s Environmental Coalition Alerts you, Relates your efforts, and Enlists your action) or the Austin Environmental Council (Swearingen, 57–65). As these organizations came together (looking demographically much like Pittsburgh’s GASP) in the 1960s and 1970s, they initiated a decades-long process of transforming Austin.</p>
<p>That process began with shifts in administrative rules and political realignments. By the mid-1970s, activists successfully managed to gain city council seats, as well as instituted citizens’ boards with oversight capacities, ensuring that environmental protection was a component used in decision making. Over the next decade or so, the environment moved from being one issue within a political coalition to being its own issue that powerfully shaped Austin politics. That is, rather than being something specifically deployed in one instance, the environment became a general issue that brought people together. Places like Barton Springs brought activists together to slow or regulate urbanization because pollution threatened the quality of life Austinites had grown to associate as something unique about their community. Preserving that sense of place, that sense of community, required that the environment be preserved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144213479325">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Paradoxically, growth and environmental protection intensified with neighborhoods being the main sites of contention and each increased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144213479325">26</xref></sup> That is, more places were protected, just as growth occurred in other areas. By the 1990s, Swearingen contends that both growth and environmental protection had won. Most important perhaps was the ways in which growth now happened: not by happenstance or without opposition. “Smart growth” became one of the watchwords, for instance, to promote a “livable city” that promoted economic development and environmental protection (Swearingen, 189–93).</p>
<p>Swearingen concludes in “The Doing of It” that a crucial part of the environment of Austin was the social environment. The “doing of it”—that is, the doing of environmental politics had become part of the community, part of the sense of place, part of what made Austin special. As Swearingen writes, “The desire to do these things was caused by an idea of Austin as a place defined by its quality of life rather than as a center of profit taking. The <italic>doing</italic> of these things through city politics and policy not only strengthens that sense of place, but recreates it in physical and social form. The environmental movement of Austin and the environmental meaning created each other. Together they have created—and are still creating—the Environmental City” (Swearingen, 247).</p>
<p>Despite significantly different ecological and economic settings, Austin’s and Pittsburgh’s environmental movements shared several components. In both, middle-class women used their social standing to lobby for protection. That professionals, experts, and often their wives populated the movement in these cities is no surprise; that was the predominant demography in the national movement during the 1970s, the seedbed era. In mobilizing for change, the movement cracked open closed systems of regulation (Pittsburgh) and planning (Austin) for municipalities, making them significantly more democratic. While critics charge environmentalism with elitism, these books demonstrate how activism opened decision making rather than closed it, made it more democratic rather than more elitist. The process now, of course, is longer and more complex and contentious with public input, but as Longhurst concludes, “While government meetings may be more quiet and predictable without citizen input, they won’t be the meetings of a democracy” (Longhurst, 179). In this way, <italic>Environmental City</italic> and <italic>Citizen Environmentalists</italic> present an urban corollary to those who have argued that wilderness politics at the same time democratized land-use decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144213479325">27</xref></sup> In this way, both books also demonstrate the ways local case studies intersected with the national experience—something all the books in this collection do.</p>
<p>In an influential essay, historian Timothy J. Gilfoyle assessed urban history as a field with “no totalizing theory, hegemonic interpretation, or universal paradigm. A plurality of microtheories characterizes the history of American cities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144213479325">28</xref></sup> So it is with urban <italic>environmental</italic> history. While there are undeniably influential scholars like Martin Melosi and Joel Tarr and classic books like <italic>Nature’s Metropolis</italic>, the reality is urban environmental history remains a vibrant and somewhat sprawling field. And that has some great benefits.</p>
<p>Like urban history in general, there is no stifling orthodoxy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144213479325">29</xref></sup> The work is not mired in tired, minute historiographical debates. Topics from weeds to political organizing to intellectual underpinnings dominate the debates, which are filled with diverse approaches and methodologies. Cross-fertilization opportunities open avenues for comparative studies, for interdisciplinary innovation, and for creative interpretations.</p>
<p>Yet there are some challenges to this state of the field. Namely, large-scale national narratives and syntheses are lacking, which can make it difficult for appropriate context. For example, Swearingen’s “environmental city” of Austin is certainly not the only place that saw itself as protecting a special sense of place, and some comparisons to other places might have allowed us a deeper understanding both of Austin’s uniqueness and typicality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144213479325">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Calls for syntheses are frequent as a field comes of age, of course, and that should not diminish the discrete studies reviewed here. They are unique, compelling, and fulfilling. Although a single theme does not unite these six books, they collectively advance our sense of the urban past in the process revealing the often contentious history of environmental decision making, social marginalization, and ecological management.</p>
<p>Insights from some recent urban environmental scholarship are not so well represented here. Although racial marginalization is present in some of these books, Coll Thrush’s work on American Indians in Seattle is exemplary, yet we see virtually no Native voices or experiences in this collection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144213479325">31</xref></sup> Cities with particularly difficult ecological challenges such as frequent droughts or floods or some other “natural” disaster are not well represented here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144213479325">32</xref></sup> It is clear, urban environmental historians are still hard at work, filling in the maps of urban spaces and discerning the patterns of environmental inequality.</p>
<p>These books, authored by environmental historians and sociologists, reveal urban worlds through material, intellectual, social, and political prisms. Together, they show a diverse set of focuses, a unique collection of methodologies, and wide range of arguments. They are a good sample. They are meeting Melosi’s prescriptions and fit in Rosen and Tarr’s framework. They demonstrate a variety of urban experiences, as well as a deepening quality of this collective work.</p>

<p>Maureen A. Flanagan argued for environmental justice being an organizing theme for urban environmental history using social categories (e.g., race, class, gender) to understand differential urban experiences. See Flanagan, “Environmental Justice in the City: A Theme for Urban Environmental History,” <italic>Environmental History</italic> 5, no. 2 (2000): 159–64. Taylor’s book is a dense compendium of stories designed to explain urban development paying close attention to class, racial/ethnic, and gender components. No summary can do it justice, but a few thematic highlights can perhaps provide a sense of its coverage. My summary in particular does not do justice to Taylor’s original research in financing of public parks and her work in zoning law.</p></fn>

<p>Because “weed” is such a problematic term, Falck deploys a series of clever terms throughout the book that allow a playfulness with the writing that is not typical in scholarly monographs.

<p>As Klingle and Sanders have shown, for example, Seattle has long seen itself as environmentally special. Klingle, <italic>Emerald City</italic>; Sanders, <italic>Seattle and Urban Roots</italic>. William Issel has described similar citizen groups in a freeway revolt in San Francisco in the 1950s and 1960s that seems quite analogous to what occurred in Austin; “‘Land Values, Human Values, and the Preservation of the City’s Treasured Appearance’: Environmentalism, Politics, and the San Francisco Freeway Revolt,” <italic>Pacific Historical Review</italic> 68, no. 4 (1999): 611–46.
