<p>Along with growing scholarly interests in entrepreneurship, empirical analyses have been extensively conducted by sociologists and economists on socioeconomic determinants of business success with its contextual predictors. This book by Robert Fairlie and Alicia Robb especially focuses on racial inequality in entrepreneurial performance, in terms of business closure, profit size, paid employee(s), and size of sales. Their discussion preliminarily starts from the question, why is the entrepreneurial performance of African American- or Latino-owned businesses statistically inferior than that of White- or Asian American-owned ones, and why have these racial patterns remained roughly unchanged over the past two decades?</p>
<p>One of the important merits this book has is the use of restricted data of the Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, enabling the authors to explore the financial, human, and social capital to explain the discrepancy in entrepreneurial performance among racial- and ethnic-minorities. According to Fairlie and Robb, intergenerational links in business ownership, the owners’ education level, prior work experience in a similar business, and the size of startup capital are particularly important factors that explain the discrepancy in entrepreneurial dynamics. Policy implications are offered in Chapter Six, and useful descriptions on some data sets for further researchers who are interested in racial inequality on business performance are also provided in the appendix. <italic>Race and Entrepreneurial Success</italic> adopts various quantitative methods, assuming readers to at least have an intermediate level of knowledge on quantitative analytic techniques, including OLS, logistic, and probit models with some familiarity of the nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method.</p>
