<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past three decades, childhood obesity has been a growing challenge for patients and health care professionals. It is estimated that 40% of children in North America were overweight or obese in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813479443">1</xref></sup> The goal of treatment for obese children is to establish permanent healthy lifestyle changes, leading to improved long-term physical health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479443">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary care setting is an ideal place to initiate and monitor treatment for patients at risk of obesity. Beginning a treatment plan during primary care visits has been shown to be effective in establishing healthy habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813479443">3</xref></sup> Pediatricians should intervene early by screening for unhealthy weight trajectories to prevent obesity from developing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813479443">4</xref></sup> The American Medical Association Expert Committee outlines several stages of treatment for obesity, including obesity prevention and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Recommended treatment strategies include discussing a diet with balanced macronutrient intake, monitoring behavior through use of activity logs, reducing television time, and increasing physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479443">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though the importance of early intervention and treatment is well established, limited research has been recently published on how well the current guidelines for screening and treatment are followed in the primary care office. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency with which children from the <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> program with body mass indices (BMIs) at or above the 95th percentile for age were screened for elevated BMI and/or received obesity-related treatment during one or more visits to a primary care provider. We also wished to evaluate what kinds of obesity treatment strategies were initiated in these patients with an elevated BMI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922813479443" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> program, in association with the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences, provides health screenings for children in kindergarten through fifth grade throughout the urban core of Kansas City. The database for <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> contains longitudinal health information from the screenings of nearly 13 000 children per year. The <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> database was chosen because students in the urban core of Kansas City are composed of multiple ethnicities and socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479443">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data for the <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> database are generated at annual health screenings of children aged 5 to 12 years at 53 elementary schools in the greater Kansas City area. Each child is screened for height and weight measurements, and BMI is calculated as a relative percentile for age based on the standards set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479443">6</xref></sup> BMI percentile for age was chosen to reflect how overweight the child is, because BMI is a moderately sensitive and specific indicator of excess body fat in children greater than or equal to the 95th percentile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813479443">7</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-0009922813479443">
<title>Participant Selection</title>
<p>Data were obtained from the <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> database for students screened in academic years 2007 through 2010. To be included in this study, a child must have had a calculated BMI above the 95th percentile for age during at least two of the three study years. Several primary care clinics located in close proximity to the schools served by <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> were contacted and given the opportunity to participate in the study. De-identified database records containing only the patient’s birth date and no other personal health information were matched with participating clinic medical records by birth date. The medical records of these patients were collected and reviewed and became the study population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813479443">
<title>Data Abstraction Methods</title>
<p>Chart review of those children meeting the inclusion criteria examined documentation for three different types of data: positive identification of an elevated BMI, total number of clinic visits, and therapies implemented by the physician during each visit. Each chart was assessed for whether or not the patient’s BMI status was explicitly documented. It was also noted if the patient received some form of therapy for the elevated BMI during each visit, regardless of whether or not an elevated BMI status was documented. The types of obesity-related therapies that were assessed included nutritional counseling by the physician; referral to a dietitian; dietitian counseling during the visit; exercise history taken; nutritional history taken; whether the child was advised to increase their level of activity or exercise; whether a food or activity log was prescribed; and whether the physician advised a limitation to the child’s “screen time,” defined as time spent in front of a television or computer. The following disease states have been associated with elevated BMI and presence of these disease states were evaluated on chart review: hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813479443">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813479443">9</xref></sup> type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813479443">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813479443">11</xref></sup> acanthosis nigricans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813479443">12</xref></sup> lower extremity musculoskeletal disorders due to slipped capital femoral epiphysis, fractures and Blount’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813479443">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479443"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813479443"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813479443">16</xref></sup> depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813479443">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813479443">18</xref></sup> asthma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813479443">19</xref></sup> acid reflux,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813479443">20</xref></sup> and sleep apnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813479443">21</xref></sup> Race, as reported by the patient, was also recorded.</p>
<p>To provide additional insight into the data found following the chart reviews, primary care providers from clinics participating in chart review as well as academic faculty at our institution were offered surveys and face-to-face interviews. Interviews and surveys were conducted after chart review and did not influence how the obesity treatment was provided, treated, or documented. The surveys provided for an additional, quantitative analysis to the data obtained from the medical records and consisted of predetermined statements. Each statement was ranked by the physician, using a 5-point Likert-type scale, regarding their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement. The interview process provided strictly qualitative information but allowed for supplemental information to the responses provided in the surveys, as well as provided an outlet for the primary care providers to freely give their input on the topic of childhood obesity and its challenges.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 39 568 children were screened by <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> during the academic years 2007 to 2010. Of these, 8773 (22.2%) children were determined to have a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813479443">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, 1944 children (22.2%) had two or more BMI values above the 95th percentile. The medical charts of the 1944 children with two or more BMI screening values were searched for by birth date at local physicians’ offices. Of the six local physician’s offices invited to participate in the study, two agreed to participate. The medical charts for 158 (8.1%) obese children were matched by birth date at these primary care settings and were reviewed. The majority of the study population (n = 112, 70.9%) identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813479443">Table 2</xref>). Although all the children in the study population where known to be at or above the 95th percentile for BMI, less than half (n = 68; 43.0%) were identified in their medical record as having an elevated BMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922813479443">Table 3</xref>). Fortunately, a majority of these medical record–identified obese children were prescribed obesity-related treatment (n = 61/68, 89.7%). The unfortunate interpretation to this finding is the fact that the majority of the known obese children did not get identified in their medical records as being obese (n = 90, 57.0%). Although there may be several potential rationales for this omission in documentation, one might anticipate that their physical presence with the clinician might still invoke the need for obesity-related recommendations and treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of the study population (n = 97, 61.4%) did not receive obesity-related therapy, even though 7 (7.2%) obese children were documented in their medical record as being obese or having an elevated BMI. Not surprisingly, no child was offered obesity treatment if their medical record did not indicate concurrent elevated BMI (albeit an omission on the weight-related designation).</p>

<p>Data revealed that the proportion of notations of a provider-identified elevated BMI increased as the child’s visit frequency increased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922813479443">Table 4</xref>). A total of 83 patients visited the physician between one and five times, with 23 (27.7%) of these children receiving an elevated BMI identification in their chart. A total of 25 children visited the physician 15 or more times, with 18 (72%) of these children receiving an elevated BMI identification. When obesity-related treatment was begun, an average of three treatment strategies was encouraged at one time. Nutritional counseling by the physician was used the most frequent amount of times for weight management (n = 49, 35%), followed closely by simply taking a nutritional history (n = 42, 30%). Activity or food logs were not used in any of the children in our study population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0009922813479443">Table 5</xref>). The most commonly occurring obesity-associated comorbidity noted in the study population was asthma (n = 18, 41.9% of all comorbidities listed), followed by type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 13, 30.3% of all comorbidities listed), with no children being documented as having depression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0009922813479443">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Ten health care professionals were interviewed and surveyed to explain how they managed the care of their obese patients, as well as any perceived barriers to effective treatment. Almost all clinicians agreed that BMI is an important factor in assessing a patient’s overall health. Most also realized that other health conditions may be directly related to obesity. Those surveyed also expressed concern with compliance, even if BMI counseling was offered. Practitioners most strongly agreed with the statement “It is important to address BMI when a child presents to my clinic” (mean score = 4.86 out of 5) and least likely to agree with the statement “When I do offer weight loss counseling or give advice about any of the above suggestions, I feel that my patients are compliant” (mean score = 2.15 out of 5; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0009922813479443">Table 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pediatric obesity is an epidemic in America, and many barriers to recognition and treatment must be addressed before there will be adequate impact on this growing disease. In addition to the social stigma that comes with being overweight in childhood, there are a number of medical illnesses associated with obesity that can contribute to the overall declining health of young people. With all the associated medical conditions and their overwhelming prevalence in the United States, it begs the question: is childhood obesity being treated adequately in the United States, and if not, what are some of the barriers that practitioners face in identifying obesity and implementing therapeutic interventions for its effective treatment?</p>
<p>There are several plausible answers to the question. One of the first problems in treating overweight children in our study population seemed to be as simple as overcoming language barriers; for example, English-speaking practitioners needing to communicate with Spanish-speaking parents. With difficulties in communication, dietary counseling may not be possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813479443">22</xref></sup> Information gathered during the interview portion of this study suggested that, “It would be helpful if we could have informational resources at our clinic about a healthy diet printed in Spanish as well as English,” (Interview, Nurse Practitioner).</p>
<p>Additionally, ethnic points of view about what constitutes an “overweight” or “obese” child may be contributing to the problem. Beliefs about what an attractive weight is may be affected by culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813479443">23</xref></sup> For example, it has been reported that African American girls are more satisfied with heavier bodies than are Caucasian girls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479443">5</xref></sup> Likewise, the Hispanic population’s perceptions of weight differed from other groups:<disp-quote>
<p>Parents, Hispanic parents especially, call their normal-weight children “skinny” and the kids that go to the 90th percentile and above (in weight) “normal.” Parents must be in agreement that there is a problem with their child’s weight before any real progress in treating the child can occur. (Interview, Nurse Practitioner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another concern is patient compliance. Changing the eating habits of children may not be feasible because of the socioeconomic status of the families and the availability of healthy meal options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813479443">24</xref></sup> In addition to the increased cost of healthier options, the neighborhood retail food stores may be a contributing factor to the child’s obesity status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813479443">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813479443">26</xref></sup> It has been found that the incidence of overweight, especially in those children initially higher than the 85th percentile in BMI for age, is increased in children from low-income backgrounds, even as young as 3 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813479443">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813479443"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813479443">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Changes in eating habits may take the cooperation of the whole family. Practitioners should encourage parents to treat their child’s weight issue as a family concern, helping to educate them about the danger of obesity in childhood. By informing parents about the increased morbidity of cardiovascular illness later in life in those with pediatric obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922813479443">30</xref></sup> they may be motivated to change their own lifestyle and to be more supportive of their child’s weight loss journey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922813479443">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922813479443"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922813479443">33</xref></sup> Parents can serve as role models to their children, helping to mold their eating and activity behavior from an early age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479443">5</xref></sup> Accessibility of wiser food choices is critical and, as stated by a family practitioner during one of the interviews, “Parents need to have healthy snacks available and have a way to encourage and reinforce healthy snacks.” Involving the whole family will also help the child who is at risk or already overweight from feeling singled out. Part of the clinician’s job is to help counsel families to motivate them along the path to a healthier lifestyle. By helping the family to change together, goals can be set, and the child can be recognized for their achievements.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges in suggesting appropriate weight management strategies may lie within the graduate medical education programs of primary care specialists. It has been reported that few pediatricians and family practitioners feel adequately prepared to tackle the growing problem of obesity. Adequate training during residency is lacking, especially education in the counseling required to care for obese children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922813479443">34</xref></sup> Additionally, there is limited training available in some programs in the prevention of childhood obesity, even with the acknowledgment of obesity’s importance and prevalence in society today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922813479443">35</xref></sup> This may lead to underdiagnosis and undertreatment of obese children in the primary care setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922813479443">36</xref></sup> Luckily, clinicians do seem willing to learn, as echoed by the following insight from one of the medical providers interviewed for this study:<disp-quote>
<p>The five-year cure-rate for obesity is zero, which has always stuck with me since my residency. Though I am making progress towards my goals of addressing obesity with my patients, I wish I had done a better job from the start. The whole point is for all of us (pediatricians) to get better at treating it. (Interview, Pediatrician)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Time spent with the patient may also be a factor, as physicians who spend more time with their patients are more likely to discuss healthy weight maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0009922813479443">37</xref></sup> With limited time during a patient encounter and poor insurance reimbursement for the treatment of childhood obesity, the demands that are placed on the clinicians are significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0009922813479443">38</xref></sup> In our study, out of 158 patient charts evaluated, 30 (19%) children were not covered by any insurance or were labeled as “self-pay.” 63 (39.9%) children were on Medicaid. There were 66 (41.8%) patients’ charts where the insurance information was left blank or could not be found. There were no children in our study who were covered by private insurance; however, the clinics associated with our study serve predominantly low-income urban families, especially of Hispanic ethnicity. Many of the physicians in our study noted that while endocrinology referrals were indicated, they were seldom given since many families could not afford the referral visit.</p>
<p>Although some interesting findings were revealed when using the <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> database and conducting retrospective chart reviews at local clinics in urban Kansas City, there were some limitations in the study design. Data were only collected at two of the five clinics contacted. Subsequently, a small percentage of the patient charts for those who fit the study inclusion criteria were able to be located at these specific clinics and ultimately reviewed. Further, the <italic>Score 1 for Health</italic> program only serves as a representative group of the greater Kansas City area and is not inclusive of the overall urban population. Most (79%) of the students screened by the <italic><italic>Score 1 for Health</italic></italic> Program were of non-White ethnicities (Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian, and unknown), and 86% of the students qualified for the National School Lunch Program sponsored by the federal government.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479443">6</xref></sup> It has been shown that minority, low income populations may have increased correlations with obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0009922813479443">39</xref></sup> The majority of the patient charts that were found for this study came from self-identified Hispanic children (71%). Furthermore, inherent in any retrospective chart review, the data were fully reliant on the accuracy of the physician records.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because there has been a plateau in the prevalence of high BMI from academic years 2003-2004 to 2005-2006, there is reason to be optimistic about the future of pediatric obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0009922813479443">40</xref></sup> However, many clinicians are still not able to recognize or treat this disease. There is little consistency amongst health care providers in which therapies are most useful, and disagreement continues as to which barriers to treatment are most incumbent to beginning therapy. The responsibility of encouraging every child to live a healthy lifestyle lies with both the clinician and the patient, and more research needs to be done on how clinicians can realistically and successfully incorporate effective management of pediatric obesity in the care of each patient.</p>
