<abstract>
<p>This study examined the impact of three dimensions of digital literacy on privacy-related online behaviors: (a) familiarity with technical aspects of the Internet, (b) awareness of common institutional practices, and (c) understanding of current privacy policy. Hierarchical regression models analyzed data from a national sample of 419 adult Internet users. The analyses showed strong predictive powers of user knowledge, as indicated by the three discrete dimensions, on privacy control behavior. However, the findings were mixed when accounting for the interaction between knowledge and Internet experiences. There were limitations on the extents of knowledge and action related to personalized information. Furthermore, those limitations divided with sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and education. Ramifications for the current status of the FTC policy are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the role of digital literacy in the control of personal information online. The central question is whether and to what extent user knowledge functions as an enabler for active information control on the Internet. The investigation is twofold. First, the study examines the function of knowledge in new media use and privacy control behavior. Second, the analysis aims to identify the locus of any digital divide that may be prevalent among the public, with particular concern about user skills controlling inappropriate surveillance. On the deeper level, this study questions the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Internet policy grounded on the assumption of an omni-competent user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211418338">FTC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The explicit consideration of knowledge is significant when considering the consequences of digital inequalities in users’ ability to protect themselves from undue surveillance. Theoretically, it is valuable to contextualize Internet privacy in the digital divide debate by bridging the two fields that already moved beyond the concern of online access at the infrastructural level. In fact, as most civic lives migrate to online platforms, citizens are increasingly open to data surveillance, collection, and appropriation against which, under the FTC policy, the individual is in essence the sole guardian. Overall, the way in which to empower users against surveillance carries enormous practical and policy values.</p>
<p>The current study begins with a brief review of the literature on digital literacy, discusses prior studies, and poses research questions and hypotheses. Then, the study analyzes the extent of public knowledge in relation to the control of personal information and accounts for potential patterns of effects.</p>

<title>Digital Literacy and Privacy</title>
<p>Literacy is one of the most fundamental human conditions in diffusing democratic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211418338">Pool, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211418338">Neuman (1991)</xref> highlighted the centrality of literacy in promoting participatory orientation and developing a viable civic culture. The notion of digital literacy describes individual knowledge regarding computer-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211418338">Bunz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211418338">Dutton &amp; Anderson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211418338">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211418338">Hargittai (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">2004</xref>), a second-level digital divide, the difference in user skills, impairs the democratic potential of the Internet as political and civic activities move online. In this sense, it is crucial to identify the genesis of digital divide at the user level, that is, what distinguishes differentiated uses in various aspects of Internet use. Scholars consistently point out that individual differences in cognitive ability may well explain different types of digital media skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211418338">Freese, Rivas, &amp; Hargittai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211418338">Hargittai &amp; Hinnant, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, some research suggests that different levels of expertise can promote or inhibit users in specific domains, such as personalized data use and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, the hotly contested privacy settings on social networking sites, such as Facebook, focused serious scholarly attention on personalized data control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211418338">boyd &amp; Hargittai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211418338">Debatin, Lovejoy, Horn, &amp; Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211418338">Fogel &amp; Nehmad, 2009</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211418338">boyd and Hargittai (2010)</xref> reported a substantial number of young Facebook users were aware of and concerned about potential privacy threats, contrary to the wide misconception that young people do not care about privacy. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211418338">Lewis, Kaufman and Christakis (2008)</xref> documented the behavioral patterns of publicly displaying personal profiles among college students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211418338">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211418338">Solove (2007)</xref> suggested that given the delicate boundaries of social networking and online interaction, privacy control should be understood in terms of granular degree, not in absolute terms. Although advanced research in the field has emerged, few studies address the fundamental genesis of behavioral variations in predicting users’ abilities to control personalized information. This gap warrants a systematic inquiry to explicate a predictive model of privacy behavior.</p>
<p>This study puts forth a new measure of digital literacy that focuses on privacy and online privacy-related behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211418338">Goffman (1959)</xref> theorized that individuals should be able to manage or control private–public boundaries by selectively revealing one’s identities (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211418338">Agre, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211418338">Bellotti &amp; Samarajiva, 1998</xref>). Note the critical role of knowledge assumed to be in operation, that is, awarenesses of institutional systems and social practices may well equip individuals to take appropriate actions. In the digital era, the idea encompasses critical understanding of data flow and its implicit rules for users to be able to act. Literacy may serve as a principle to support, encourage, and empower users to undertake informed control of their digital identities. In short, to exercise appropriate measures of resistance against the potential abuse of personal data, it may be that users should be able to understand data flow in cyberspace and its acceptable limits of exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211418338">Ball &amp; Webster, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Prior Studies</title>
<sec id="section4-0093650211418338">
<title>Earlier Efforts</title>
<p>Earlier privacy studies attempted to identify the extent of consumer understanding regarding various aspects of data surveillance. Central to these efforts was the posited function of knowledge in exercising information control. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211418338">Culnan (1995)</xref> observed the low level of awareness among U.S. consumers regarding the removal process from direct mailing lists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211418338">Milne and Rome (2000)</xref> also found a lack of procedural knowledge for name removal process despite the fact that most respondents indicated their intention to “opt out.” In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211418338">Nowak and Phelps (1997)</xref> indicated wide uncertainties and misinformation prevalent among consumers about the practices of direct mail marketers.</p>
<p>In the Internet era, the practices by database marketers came to the forefront of the scholarly and policy concern. Research efforts sharpened to observe the consequences of knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211418338">Dommyer and Gross (2003)</xref>, for instance, found significant associations between users’ levels of awareness concerning privacy protection strategies and their telephone directory “opt out” status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211418338">Graeff and Harmon (2002)</xref> suggested an explicit connection between demographic variables and the level of knowledge. In addition, a Pew Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211418338">Fox, 2000</xref>) measured the knowledge of Internet users among different segments of the online population with its general finding, including a low level of familiarity with “cookies,” confirmed in subsequent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211418338">Pew, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211418338">Culnan and Armstrong (1999)</xref> reported that user awareness of fair procedural practices in websites alleviated the levels of privacy concern. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211418338">Hoffman, Novak, and Peralta (1999)</xref> indicated that users, when explicitly aware of malpractices by sites, tend not to disclose information. These findings were significant in that they illustrated a dichotomy between the stated concern and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211418338">Park, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211418338">Sheehan &amp; Hoy, 1998</xref>) that could be potentially moderated through increased knowledge. However, most findings were limited because they measured a single variable, such as familiarity with “cookies,” as a proxy variable for user knowledge (e.g., Pew, 2000). Furthermore, different measurement scales based on convenience samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211418338">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211418338">Park, 2008</xref>) made it difficult to generalize the findings in any specific causal directionality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093650211418338">
<title>Refined Studies</title>
<p>In a series of carefully designed surveys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow (2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow, Feldman, &amp; Meltzer, 2005</xref>) advanced this line of research. What Turow contributed is the sophistication of the measures that observed the public understandings of data practices by websites. In 2003, the first national sample survey found two alarming facts concerning (a) the widespread ignorance among the public regarding the fundamental aspects of data flow and (b) the lack of protective steps taken on the part of consumers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow (2003)</xref>, this was particularly startling because the cognitive power of the users remained limited in contrast to the advances in institutional surveillance techniques. The second survey by Turow et al. in 2005 confirmed these findings. The updated study further identified the significant association between demographic characteristics, such as education, gender, age and income, and the lack of knowledge, attesting to the presence of a “knowledge gap” among users of different population segments. Some respondents reported falsifying information when they were explicitly aware of data surveillance. However, the level of misunderstanding remained wide. Most consumers misunderstood the mere presence of a privacy policy statement as data protection and performed few informed cost-benefit decisions about potential data misuse and surveillance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211418338">Acquisti and Gross (2006)</xref> narrowed the discussion to the interactive environment of a social networking site. In their Facebook study, they found that most member-users were unaware of internal data-collection rules, regardless of their different levels of concern and their frequency of site use. Although some managed their privacy, it was with limited (or misinformed) awareness of the visibility of their personal data. Furthermore, their levels of protective skills were highly limited despite the fact that most <italic>did</italic> adopt one or two strategizing behaviors (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211418338">Acquisti &amp; Grosslags, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211418338">LaRose &amp; Rifon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211418338">Metzger, 2004</xref>).This finding was critical because it linked low levels of knowledge and low levels of data management in a highly interactive environment. In addition, the reaffirmation of inattentive media use entails further examination of the individual decision-making process, that is, how inattentive user habits can turn into the practices of active information control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0093650211418338">
<title>A Step Further</title>
<p>It is important to note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow (2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>) placed user knowledge and use in a broad context of social differentiation, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211418338">Acquisti and Gross (2006)</xref> analyzed information processing at the individual level. Combined, the contribution from both works offered significant understanding regarding the decision-making process in Internet privacy behaviors. In essence, the lack of knowledge about the extent of data flow is posited as a hindrance to the complex decision-making process, whereas the socioeconomic divide possibly remains the genesis of such limits.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most prior studies rarely identified the consistent role of knowledge on empirical ground. First, knowledge assessments were limited to one-dimensional measures that relied on a single item (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211418338">Fox, 2000</xref>) and failed to capture the diverse dimensions of cognitive structure. Second, analytically, prior studies did not explicitly test the relationship between knowledge and differentiated uses with multivariate regression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211418338">Acquisti &amp; Grosslags, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211418338">Acquisti &amp; Gross, 2006</xref>), despite the posited function of knowledge in the decision-making process. Third, drawing from the strategic marketing literature, a majority of earlier studies rarely advanced any consistent theoretical basis that explained the linkage between knowledge and new media behavior.</p>
<p>This is not to imply that prior research has not been useful. Indeed, the accumulation of the findings serves as a superb reference point to better predict the function of user knowledge. Warranted, however, is an analytical model that integrates individual cognitive differences into the broader context of the social divide and contributes advanced theoretical understanding of the second-level digital divide in terms of information privacy behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypotheses and Research Questions</title>
<p>In sum, this study tests the explicit premise of digital literacy as applied to Internet privacy and identifies the function of knowledge in strategizing behaviors. In general, researchers theorized that critical understanding is required of citizens to participate in digital activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211418338">Jenkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211418338">van Dijk, 2005</xref>). Specifically, it follows that the more knowledge users have about data flow, the more equipped they will be to manage to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211418338">Barnes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, the less aware users are, the more they are susceptible to manipulation and unable to act and control information flow in their best interest.</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211418338" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1):</italic> Users with a high level of knowledge are more likely to exercise information control than those with a low level of knowledge.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question (RQ2):</italic> To what extent do the users exercise control over personal information?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When positing the function of knowledge, however, the discrete dimensional structure of knowledge should be beyond the simple bipolarity of presence or absence. In fact, scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211418338">Kwak, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211418338">Neuman, 1986</xref>) investigated the different impacts of knowledge as multidimensional measures to capture the dynamics of human behaviors. Previous studies noted that technical familiarity had positive effects on digital media and Internet uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211418338">Hargittai &amp; Hinnant, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in other domains, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow (2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>) recognized the centrality of awareness of behavioral marketing practices and related policy environment as empowering consumers. This led to the following hypotheses on the subtlety of knowledge dimensions:</p>
<list id="list2-0093650211418338" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a (H1a):</italic> Users with a high level of technical familiarity are more likely to exercise information control than those with a low level of knowledge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1b (H1b):</italic> Users with a high level of institutional surveillance awareness are more likely to exercise information control than those with a low level of knowledge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1c (H1c):</italic> Users with a high level of policy knowledge are more likely to exercise information control than those with a low level of knowledge.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In predicting information behavior, it is also critical to note that variations in Internet access experience, such as years of use and daily use, had significant impacts on the levels of skills in various aspects of the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">2004</xref>). The freedom to use the Internet anytime, anywhere, and for any purposes was also one of the most significant single predictors for levels of online skills. As applied to personal information control, the effects of various levels of access experience may contribute to the digital divide, keeping levels of user knowledge constant.</p>
<list id="list3-0093650211418338" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2):</italic> Internet access experiences will be positively associated with the levels of information control skills.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, differences in socioeconomic status (SES) may negatively affect skills. Prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211418338">Castells, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211418338">DiMaggio, Hargittai, Neuman, &amp; Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211418338">Loges &amp; Jung, 2001</xref>) consistently pointed out the role of SES in maintaining different levels of digital divide in skills. Also, there was evidence that in personal privacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211418338">Turow &amp; Hennessy, 2007</xref>) offline status, such as age, gender, income, and education, affects privacy protection behavior.</p>
<list id="list4-0093650211418338" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3):</italic> There will be significant associations between users’ sociodemographic status and their information control skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3a (H3a):</italic> Income will be positively associated with the levels of information control skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3b (H3b):</italic> Education will be positively associated with the levels of information control skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3c (H3c):</italic> Age will be negatively associated with the levels of information control skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3d (H3d):</italic> Gender (female: higher) will be negatively associated with the levels of control skills.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, it is reasonable to assume the presence of interaction effects between the first-level predictor (Internet experience) and the second-level predictor (knowledge), while controlling for other demographic characteristics. These respective digital divide predictors, when intertwined, may deepen existing skill gaps. The effect of knowledge may or may not be present in moderating or accelerating influences of various aspects of Internet access experiences.</p>

<title>The Study Population</title>
<p>The study examined a national probability sample of 419 adult Internet users (aged 18 and above). The Knowledge Networks (KN) recruited the panel respondents, using random digit dialing (RDD). The cross-sectional data included adult Internet users with online access at home, eliminating web-TV-based panel participants. The initial sampling frame included both listed and unlisted phone numbers and was not limited to computer owners. Once a household was randomly contacted by phone, KN recruited a household member(s) to the panel from which the survey participants were selected by chance. The panel participants were directed to a survey site and completed an online survey, which took about 10 minutes for completion. Administration of the survey occurred between October 31 and November 12, 2008.</p>
<p>The demographic characteristics of the KN panel were not far different from those of the general population. For the exclusive Internet user KN panel, however, a more appropriate baseline would be a nationally representative sample of U.S. Internet users. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211418338">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics about the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents in comparison to a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211418338">Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 2010</xref> wired and wireless Internet survey sample. The KN panel closely aligned with the Internet user profile of the FCC sample. However, the levels of income and age, on average, were slightly higher in this study sample. The time disparity between the two samples (2008 and 2010) may account for the differences as broadband became more affordable and widely diffused. Given the extent to which older and more affluent user groups are present in the sample, however, readers should use caution in making generalizations based on this study’s findings. The total sample size was 456 from 663 initial contacts, with a completion rate of 69%. The final data set was limited to 419 after an item validity check.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093650211418338">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Knowledge: Independent variable</title>
<p>Digital privacy literacy was operationalized as user awareness in three dimensions: (a) technical familiarity, (b) awareness of institutional practices, and (c) policy understanding. Technical familiarity was rated with five items on a 6-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 6 = <italic>very familiar</italic>). Eight true-false knowledge items were used for surveillance awareness and seven true-false items were measured for policy understanding, later coded 1 for correct answers with 0 assigned to all other responses. Each dimension of user knowledge was combined to create an index, adapted from prior studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211418338">Hargittai &amp; Hinnant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211418338">Pew Internet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>; α = .82, technical knowledge; <italic>Kuder-Richardson</italic> 20 reliability = .79, surveillance awareness; <italic>Kuder-Richardson</italic> 20 reliability = .73, policy knowledge). This was to capture a whole dimension of data flow in the context of institutional surveillance practices. Two additional items (privacy-specific risk and protection awareness) specified technical familiarity to capture subtle knowledge structures that may be present in user behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0093650211418338">
<title>Information control behavior: Dependent variable</title>
<p>One of the main purposes in this study was to identify information control behavior as currently in daily routine. Information control was operationalized as user behavior in strategizing data release—that is, whether to opt out or not. Thus it was central to capture how users systematically manage/control personal data and its flow (that can be associated with one’s identity). Information control is multifaceted in nature, requiring a combination of social and technical skills as intertwined in Internet uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211418338">Marx, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211418338">Resnick, 2002</xref>, for “sociotechnical” capital). Following this, preexisting survey items were elaborated into (a) social and (b) technical dimensions. Within the social dimension, we made a distinction between active and passive control to capture the subtlety of user behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0093650211418338">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Respondents were asked to report the extent to which they were involved in each of the information control behaviors on a 6-point scale, ranging from <italic>never</italic> to <italic>very often</italic>. Eight items were used for the social dimension and we measured four items for the technical dimension, modified from the extant literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211418338">Acquisti &amp; Gross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211418338">Marx, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211418338">Metzger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211418338">Pew Internet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>). Informed by the preestablished items, the survey established the criterion validity of each item. Each item was a question that asked (a) the type(s) of information strategies adopted and (b) the intensity, as indicated in the frequency of use, of such strategies. The composite index (summation of items) was created to construct a continuous scale for each dimension (α = .80, social; α = .70, technical dimensions).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093650211418338">
<title>Internet experience</title>
<p>Two items measured online experiences in daily routines as they were related to differentiated uses of the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211418338">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211418338">2007</xref>). First, we asked how long (in minutes) Internet was used. Second, we measured the number of years of experience with Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211418338">Kwak, Skoric, Williams, &amp; Poor, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211418338">Hargittai and Hinnant (2008)</xref> also noted the predictive power of autonomy of use on user skills.

<sec id="section14-0093650211418338">
<title>Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>As noted above, this study aimed to assess the potential influence of offline sociodemographic characteristics on online skills. Four items (income, education, age, and gender) were used.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0093650211418338">
<title>Analytical Strategies</title>
<p>The analyses proceeded as follows. First, descriptive data identified the overall trends in user knowledge and behavior. Second, a series of hierarchical (moderated) regressions tested the hypotheses for each of the knowledge dimensions, accounting for multilevel influences. Hierarchical regression is useful to identify explanatory powers of the variables in each level, while considering the order of the predicted causal priority. Age, gender, education, and income were included in the first block, with Internet experiences in the second block. A total of nine interaction terms between knowledge and Internet experiences were created for the final equations. The variables were standardized prior to entry in each block to reduce potential problems of multicollinearity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211418338">Kwak et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The second block in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093650211418338">Table 2</xref> shows (a) the type and (b) the intensity for each dimension of information control. Overall, the sample respondents adopted one or more types of control strategies. Nevertheless, the levels of personal information control were consistently low. In the technical dimension, the mean score was 13.12, indicating most users rarely adopted or used technology through either web browser or privacy enhancing technologies (PET). In the social dimension, the public involvement remained moderate. The users exercised relatively high levels of information control in terms of (a) withdrawal, (b) hiding, and (c) avoidance (<italic>M</italic> = 13.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.13). However, in the dimension of (a) complaint, (b) rectification, and (c) multiple account use, most respondents reported low levels of involvement (<italic>M</italic> = 11.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.99). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093650211418338">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093650211418338">4</xref> present the distributions of individual knowledge and behavior measures.</p>

<p>There was no difference in the level of information control in terms of economic status. Furthermore, the level of education had no clear impact in either information control dimension.

<p>The findings revealed robust support for Hypothesis 1a, the positive role of knowledge as measured by technical familiarities, in both social and technical dimensions (β = .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; β = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The support was strong and the knowledge block alone (incremental <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) accounted for .051 and .147 in each dimension. However, the support was mixed when knowledge was specified in terms of privacy-specific familiarity. In a separate hierarchical regression that accounted only for privacy risk awareness (phishing), the support was evident. Yet the level of privacy protection knowledge (that is, familiarity with p3p) alone offered no support in the combined social index measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0093650211418338">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, in the tech dimension, familiarity with p3p was found relatively weak in effect size and significance (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>There was support for the posited association between knowledge and levels of information control when knowledge was indicated by users’ awareness of data-surveillance practices (Hypothesis 1b). The support was robust across both social and tech dimensions (β = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; β = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). As a block, the knowledge accounted for .091 and .066 of the variance (incremental <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>). The regression results also supported Hypothesis 1c, which indicated knowledge in terms of policy understanding. Strong support existed for the social dimension (β = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) with consistent support for the tech dimension (β = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>To examine Hypothesis 2 (positive associations between Internet experiences and the level of information control), four items were analyzed. The second blocks in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093650211418338">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0093650211418338">6</xref> show that the supports from year of use and daily use were consistent in both dimensions (β = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; β = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, social; β = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; β = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, tech). Autonomy was significant only in the tech dimension (β = .16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). For Hypothesis 3, the impact of age remained consistent and significant as the hierarchical model provided support for both social and tech dimensions (β = −.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; β = −.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Regarding gender, there was no difference in the social dimension, but a significant difference in the tech dimension (β = −.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating male users tended to exercise more information control in that aspect. The influences of income and education did not reach significance levels.</p>
<p>To examine RQ3, the interactions between the first- and the second-level predictors were analyzed after controlling for all prior blocks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0093650211418338">Table 7</xref>). In the social dimension, a significant interaction between technical familiarity and daily use was present (β = −.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In the tech dimension, technical familiarity interacted with year of use, daily use, and autonomy (β = −.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; β = −.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; β = −.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093650211418338">Figure 1</xref> displays the consistent pattern of interactive effects of technical familiarity in both social and tech dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0093650211418338">5</xref></sup> Awareness of data surveillance and policy understanding interacted with daily use in the sociodimension (β = −.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; β = −.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, the support was far from robust because none of the interaction terms showed significance in the tech dimension.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, our aim was to examine the impact of digital literacy on new media behaviors in a predictive model. The focus was on the locus of digital divide, with particular concern on user skills and capacities to control their personal information in an increasingly digital world. We included more nuanced measures of knowledge and information control in the discrete dimensions. The extent of knowledge effect was tested, taking into account the multilevel influences in hierarchical models. Interactions between Internet access experiences and knowledge were also observed.</p>
<p>The findings supported the hypotheses that derived from digital divide literature and earlier empirical privacy studies. First, the findings supported the hypothesized functions of technical familiarity, surveillance awareness, and policy understanding on personal information control behavior. However, the extent of knowledge and action remained limited, divided by sociodemographic status. The impact of age was the most consistent in explaining information control behavior (see Freese et al., 2004). In sum, the main thesis was robust, showing knowledge likely supported, encouraged, and empowered users to action.</p>
<p>The role that each knowledge dimension played, however, was subtle (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211418338">Neuman, 1986</xref>). The familiarity with p3p, the most direct item that concerned Internet privacy protection, provided no or modest support (albeit, the lack of support is likely due to its low variance), while the familiarity with generic Internet terminologies offered greater significance. Furthermore, the findings were mixed when accounting for the interactions between knowledge and Internet experiences. While technical familiarity in interaction with Internet experiences provided support in both dimensions of information control, there was little support for such interactions with surveillance awareness and policy understanding in the social dimension and no support at all for the tech dimension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0093650211418338">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This suggests that the cognitive dimensions may be highly correlated but operate in subtle and slightly different behavioral contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0093650211418338">Figure 2</xref>), far from producing monolithic effects of knowledge. At least from this study, it is clear that generic technical familiarity functions as the most significant predictor of personal information control as its explanatory power is supported in other Internet uses, such as online content creation and sharing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211418338">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211418338">Hargittai &amp; Hinnant, 2008</xref>). Further studies are needed to verify this subtle operation of a particular type of knowledge. In the delicate dynamics of the movement from knowledge to concrete actions, experimental studies may extract differentiated behavioral routes unique to privacy-specific risk and protection awareness.</p>

<p>The results also shed light on a value of the multilevel model that derives from new media literature. Each level of predictors, (a) knowledge, (b) Internet experiences, and (c) sociodemographics, were significant, advancing analytical understanding of privacy-related behaviors online. This demonstrates the value of merging insights from new media studies with the Internet privacy literature. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow (2003)</xref> noted, a rather striking ignorance of online data flow practices may lie at the heart of public inaction.</p>
<p>Finally, the presence of the age gap deserves serious attention. The wide divide of age in information behavior is not surprising. However, the fact that older users are less skillful than are younger people in privacy control creates a grim scenario in which they may be the worst victims of identity theft or related online crimes. The social embarrassment of being “foolish” may further dampen older users’ enthusiasm in seeking help or learning privacy-related technology. Gender in this regard also raises concern. The results indicate female users score lower than male counterparts in technical knowledge and behaviors. Yet a significant body of literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211418338">boyd &amp; Hargittai, 2010</xref>) reported no gender difference in online activities, while a few studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211418338">Fogel &amp; Nehmad, 2009</xref>) indicated female users exercised even more privacy control than male users did on social networking sites. Thus one should interpret this study’s finding with caution until further studies establish the persistence of the gender gap in the tech-related information control behavior.</p>
<p>With regard to the interaction effects, the large effect of Internet access experience among those with low levels of technical familiarity merits further scrutiny. This may mean that users with a low level of technical familiarity still benefit from high-tech experience and access, whereas those with no adequate infrastructural access cannot when they remain ill informed. This is a significant finding that suggests a certain type of knowledge compensates for lack of Internet access experiences in encouraging privacy-related behaviors. Put differently, the respective predictors of technical familiarity and Internet experiences, when combined, seem to magnify existing privacy-related skill gaps.</p>
<p>Another important finding is the resilience of mass inaction and lack of knowledge. In the last few years, new media research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211418338">Hargittai &amp; Hinnant, 2008</xref>) has shown that high variations in skill levels persisted despite the surge in online access. The privacy literature has also demonstrated that the typically low levels of knowledge have not changed over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211418338">Turow et al., 2005</xref>). More so, it confirms the replication of the persistent divide in online activities and cognitive skills among different segments in the privacy domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211418338">DiMaggio et al., 2001</xref>). Note that the sample surveyed for the current study included a group of Internet users with high access experiences, a relatively high education level, and broadband Internet connection. Thus the findings regarding income and education are likely conservative. Given such tech-rich experiences, it is also surprising to observe the extent of lack of understanding and action, with the significant connection between two.</p>

First, this study demonstrates the presence of a second-level digital divide in Internet privacy beyond the level of access. It is important to note that the FTC policy assumes that users are typically well informed about data flow and are capable of appropriate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211418338">Turow, 2003</xref>). However, evidence suggests the presence of a digital literacy divide that may function as an impediment to systematic information control, further reinforcing the socioeconomic and demographic divisions in an increasingly digital world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211418338">DiMaggio et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211418338">FTC (2009)</xref> consistently prioritized the rollout of free personal information flow over stricter online regulations of data collection, retention and uses, assuming the balance of power between websites and individual users. Yet the users are stratified and far from competent in exercising privacy control, different from such policy premise. Furthermore, while knowledge plays a critical role in privacy behavior, the levels of understanding of surveillance practices common in websites remain miniscule among the majority of users. This shows that the policy assumption regarding most online users may be fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>Given the unique nature of the data set for a national sample, the findings should serve as a departure point to recognize the function of discrete dimensions of knowledge. It remains unclear why privacy-specific familiarity provided less explanatory power than generic Internet tech familiarity in the multilevel model, although it may be likely that the extremely low variation of p3p (<italic>M</italic> = 1.47; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.88) reduces its power. In addition, the causality could hardly be ascertained due to the cross-sectional nature of the survey data. Nevertheless, a novel contribution of this project is that the dimensional knowledge measures as independent variables are dissected to analyze information control skills in discrete levels. In this vein, a longitudinal panel study with the inclusion of more nuanced survey items will establish causal claims. Analytically, a two-stage model with larger cross-sectional sample data will parcel out precise temporal priority between knowledge and action.</p>
<p>A fruitful next line of research in this area may involve the psychological obstacles of Internet users, such as inconvenience and efficacy, which might deter even the most technically knowledgeable users from engaging in robust protective behavior. Respondent status within a household may also link to a level of engagement in information control because the control of the computer in a household dictates who get engaged in protective behavior and to what extent. This will be critical in further inquiry to capture perhaps the most realistic setting of online privacy and personal information control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0093650211418338">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Digital literacy plays a central role in promoting and at times constraining active information control online (e.g., Freese et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211418338">Hargittai, 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211418338">Neuman, 1991</xref>). Some users are better positioned to exercise control, whereas others remain incapable of active role. Digital literacy should be promoted across all segments of the user population to encourage active and effective electronic participation in civic and economic life.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211418338">Lewis et al.

<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211418338">Hargittai (2009)</xref>, we included a bogus knowledge item to check the validity of the response. Thirty-seven people reported a high level of familiarity with this item. Furthermore, these respondents reported extremely inflated scores in other key variables (knowledge, behavior, and attitudes), challenging the validity of the responses by this particular group.</p>

<p>The social dimension is the combined score of the passive and the active information control items. Passive control behaviors included (a) withdrawal (two items), (b) avoidance, and (c) hiding identities, whereas active behaviors were (a) complaining, (b) rectifying (two items), and (c) using multiple accounts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211418338">Marx, 2003</xref> for the typology of surveillance neutralization moves).</p>

<p>In the social dimension, β = .19, <italic>t</italic> value = 3.62 was found for privacy risk awareness (phishing, <italic>M</italic> = 3.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.76). However, privacy protection awareness (p3p, <italic>M</italic> = 1.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.88) generated no support (β = .06, <italic>t</italic> value = 1.18). When the social dimension was parceled out, very weak support was found in the active dimension (β = .09, <italic>t</italic> value = 1.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), with no support for the passive dimension of information control (β = .06, <italic>t</italic> value = 1.24).</p>

<p>We plotted the interactions, using standardized coefficients in the final equations after controlling for other blocks. For the purpose of demonstration, the combination of 0 (<italic>low</italic>) and 1 (<italic>high</italic>) was assigned to each of the four groups.</p>

<p>We ran additional analyses to observe the interaction between sociodemographic status and Internet experiences. A total of 12 interaction terms were created and entered into the hierarchical models. We truncated the models to simplify the computations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211418338">Kwak, 1999</xref>) and did not include three discrete knowledge dimensions. In the social dimension, the significant interactions between education and (a) daily use (β = −.09, <italic>t</italic> value = −1.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and (b) autonomy (β = .15, <italic>t</italic> value = 3.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were found. Age also interacted with year of use (β = −.12, <italic>t</italic> value = −2.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In the tech dimension, only gender interacted with year of use, but support was weak (β = .08, <italic>t</italic> value = 1.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) with none of the other interaction terms found significant.</p>
