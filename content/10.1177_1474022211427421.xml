<abstract>
<p>In recent years, many studies have highlighted the changing nature of scholarly research, reflecting the new digital tools and techniques that have been developed. But researcher uptake of these tools is strongly influenced by existing information behaviour, itself affected by a number of factors, particularly discipline. This article outlines findings from a recent study which used six case studies to look at the information behaviours of researchers working in different disciplinary fields or academic departments, or using specific tools. The study suggested that researchers’ uses of, and attitudes towards, digital technologies are affected by existing disciplinary habits and preconceptions. Furthermore, it found that the computational and collaborative complexity of the tools that researchers used was linked to their disciplinary backgrounds.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474022211427421"><title>Discipline matters</title>
<p><sc>it is difficult to gainsay the enormous change</sc> – almost a revolution – that has occurred in humanities research alongside the development of mass computing. The most routine manifestation of this development for most researchers will be the ready availability of electronic journals. In the UK, both expenditure on, and usage of, electronic serials have increased enormously in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427421">Nicholas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022211427421">Research Information Network, 2010</xref>). However, much grander claims have been made for digital data, and the possibilities offered by powerful computers in this area seem impressive. Ever since Jim Gray introduced the idea of large-scale data analysis as the ‘fourth paradigm’ of research, academics in a range of disciplines have been seeking ways to harness the power of computing to advance knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211427421">Hey et al., 2009</xref>). In the sciences, this has historically focused upon very large datasets, although there is also a growing interest in the outputs of so-called ‘small science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211427421">Lyon, 2007</xref>). Some humanities disciplines, particularly archaeology, might be considered analogous to science in terms of the scale of data collection and the potential for computational analysis. For others, reliant upon bounded historical collections of letters or parish records, for example, the parallel may be less obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022211427421">Harley et al., 2010</xref>). Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211427421">Brown and Greengrass (2010)</xref> argue that even in these cases technological advances help to drive research agendas. In some cases, it is suggested that the users themselves may not be aware of the extent to which their priorities and questions are influenced by the technologies available to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211427421">Bates, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, for these possibilities to be realized, data must be discoverable, and researchers must be able to share their findings and work in progress. Again, new computing technologies have played an important role in helping researchers to share their data and findings, formally and informally. Data centres in the UK are a relatively well-established mechanism for sharing research data, but it is only recently that they have made their holdings available online, in some cases in a format which allows researchers to repurpose them to suit their own scholarly needs. Such developments have been accompanied by an increase in usage, in both downloads and deposits (Research Information Network, forthcoming). A second, important way that computing technologies have influenced sharing of outputs and data is the growth of social media. At present, enthusiastic or frequent engagement with these technologies is a niche activity, and it is not yet clear whether such researchers represent a vanguard, or something more akin to a splinter group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211427421">Proctor et al., 2010</xref>). But those who do engage with Web 2.0 think that it brings benefits to their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211427421">Nicholas et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This, then, is the information environment of today’s researcher. Huge amounts of scholarly knowledge – processed, in the form of articles; and unprocessed, in the form of raw data – are available online. Researchers can access the information they need from their university workstation, their home computer and on the move via mobile technologies, and via a range of platforms including publishers’ websites, aggregators, data centres, academic websites and social media. But their ability to engage with this unprecedented level of access is shaped, in part, by their own information preferences, preconceptions, and even prejudices. These characteristics are of course idiosyncratic, but research has uncovered some trends within information behaviours.</p>
<p>What factors account for different levels of adoption and use? Previous research identifies factors affecting the way researchers behave around information as falling roughly into two main categories. First, there are the <italic>supply-side influences</italic> – new technologies, tools and processes which allow wider access to growing corpora of scholarly information. Within this category we might include developments such as electronic journals, social media, digital datasets and the repositories in which they are stored. Second, there are the <italic>demand-side characteristics</italic> – the features of researchers themselves which affect their information practices. Among these we might consider demographic characteristics such as age and seniority, and learned behaviours which are often linked to established practices and habits within their discipline, sub-discipline, or even research group. Crucially, for most disciplines, these norms have been formed within a research environment which is, for the most part, analogue. This article therefore looks at researchers’ behaviour in six areas of the humanities, examining how they handle information within their research and identifying continuities and differences between ‘digital’ and ‘analogue’ practices.</p>
<p>Age and seniority both play important roles and are, of course, linked, as a number of studies have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211427421">Bennett and Buhler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211427421">Carpenter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211427421">Nicholas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211427421">Proctor et al., 2010</xref>). What is perhaps the most important influence on researchers’ information habits is the behaviour of their colleagues, leading to identifiable trends within disciplines. This has been recognized in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427421">Nicholas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474022211427421">Tenopir et al., 2004</xref>). Distinctions can be made at a very high level: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211427421">Proctor et al. (2010)</xref> find meaningful differences between physical scientists and life scientists and researchers in the social sciences, arts and humanities in use of Web 2.0 tools, for example. However, these headline findings may mask more nuanced variations in habit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022211427421">Nicholas et al. (2011)</xref>, for example, identify different referencing habits when comparing physicists, chemists, and earth and environmental scientists, all of whom would fall under the definition of ‘physical sciences’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474022211427421">Tenopir et al. (2004)</xref> even find distinct sub-groupings within a discipline: in the US, medical faculty members with PhD degrees are more likely to read content online than those with MD degrees. And a RIN/NESTA report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211427421">Research Information Network and NESTA, 2010</xref>) was able to show that, even within disciplines, a particularly enthusiastic principal investigator can influence their colleagues’ attitude and behaviour when it comes to sharing research findings and data. These findings all suggest that the way researchers approach information is strongly affected by the principles and habits that they have learned from their close collaborators.</p>
<p>How do these learned behaviours, principles and habits respond to the computing-driven changes within the information environment? Researchers’ ability to engage fully with the possibilities of digital information, in particular with the growing amount of data available online, will be determined at least in part by their existing attitudes to what might be termed ‘analogue’ research information. Expectations about what information looks like, how it should be presented and how it should be treated have been formed within this analogue environment. These expectations do not necessarily translate easily to the digital world, and this can cause researchers to feel concern or doubt about integrating new technologies into their work.</p>
<p>In some areas, humanities researchers have engaged enthusiastically with new technologies. The emergent discipline of digital humanities has drawn comparison with some of the large data-driven eScience programmes, although it has not necessarily enjoyed as much support for developing infrastructure as the physical and life sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022211427421">Borgman, 2009</xref>). Researchers are clearly aware of the possibilities offered by digital resources, and particularly digital datasets. They are also aware of some of the potential conflicts between new ways of working and existing standards.</p>
<p>One important area of conflict is quality assurance and trust. Academic concerns about information gleaned from sources that are not peer-reviewed, especially online sources, is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211427421">Carpenter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211427421">Nicholas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211427421">Proctor et al., 2010</xref>). In some instances, this is general mistrust of the web, similar to how many researchers feel about Wikipedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211427421">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). But, for other researchers, concerns crystallize around a specific issue, often the lack of documentation about how content was selected for digitization from a much bigger analogue collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474022211427421">Warwick et al., 2008</xref>). An Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) study on peer review of digital resources addressed some of these issues, recognizing that, without an established quality assurance mechanism, digital resources will struggle to achieve parity of esteem with more traditional research outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211427421">Bates, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenges of peer review and quality assurance transcend format. But in other areas digital resources create problems for researchers which did not exist within the print world. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211427421">Meyer et al. (2009)</xref> describe how a keyword search on digitized nineteenth-century newspapers often failed to distinguish between ‘riot’ and ‘not’, because of the quality of the original print. In solving one problem – sorting through massive amounts of data – digital technologies have created another. Moreover, the flexibility of digital resources can mean researchers struggle to conceptualize the collections that are available to them, compared with the ease with which they can understand the extent of a library or archive holding simply by looking at it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474022211427421">Warwick et al., 2008</xref>). Clearly, these examples show analogue habits failing to translate readily into a digital world.</p>
<p>Research suggests that in some respects analogue and digital scholarship retain much in common. Most studies agree that disciplinary needs remain very important, and that a ‘one size fits all’ approach to digital provision is probably doomed to failure. The high importance of certain resources to small numbers of researchers was one reason that the AHRC study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211427421">Bates, 2006</xref>) on peer review rejected usage statistics as a way of measuring quality – the researchers were concerned that the crucial role played by these resources might be missed, with dire consequences for their long-term sustainability. Researchers investigating the possibility of a single portal for digital resources found that researchers needed such a portal to be highly customizable, and concluded that a single repository or portal was unlikely to meet the needs of all researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211427421">Brown and Greengrass, 2010</xref>). This concurs with the conclusion reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474022211427421">Warwick et al. (2008)</xref> that, for both content and interface, it is ‘naïve’ to suggest that a single solution exists.</p>
<p>Thus, previous studies have established some areas where researchers’ existing information behaviours translate easily to a digital world, and other areas where they create some level of conflict or confusion. The aim of this study is to examine, in six specific cases focused around a digital resource (Old Bailey Online<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022211427421">1</xref></sup> and Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music [DIAMM]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022211427421">2</xref></sup>), a field (Corpus Linguistics), a research project (The Digital Republic of Letters), and a department (University of Birmingham English Department<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022211427421">3</xref></sup> and University College London [UCL] Philosophy Department<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474022211427421">4</xref></sup>), how such issues manifest themselves in researchers’ day-to-day practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211427421">Bulger et al. (2011)</xref> for detailed description of methods and case selection).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022211427421"><title>Changes in practice</title>
<p>Researchers in all six cases were engaging with digital resources, although where and when they used them varied between disciplines. The resultant changes in practice correspond quite closely with those observed in previous studies.</p>
<p>The first major observation, acknowledged by researchers in most cases, was the ability to undertake data analysis at a much greater speed than had previously been the case. The ability to search entire archives at the click of a mouse has clearly made a difference for many researchers: as one user of Old Bailey Online said, ‘you can do things now in five seconds which it took you three months to do a few years ago’. DIAMM users also identified the value of high-quality digital images, citing for instance the ability to compare instances of a single letter by clipping and pasting it into graphics software, rather than laboriously tracing letters by hand. This ‘speeding up’ of research was evident in most of the cases, with the exception of the Philosophy Department, which had almost no use of digital data resources.</p>
<p>Another important issue was the ready availability of resources that had previously been difficult to access. One English researcher mentioned that access to digitized manuscripts and newspapers reduced travel time: ‘[earlier] it would take a 3-day research trip – and even then, maybe, these books might be dispersed across different libraries’. DIAMM users cited the importance of being able to access and work with delicate manuscripts, the originals of which might have serious restrictions on usage, imposed for conservation reasons. In several cases, researchers noted the way that their working practices had changed, with research becoming much more desk-based, and often taking place at home rather than in the library, archive, or office. For some – Old Bailey Online users – this development was not wholly positive, as they missed the social nature of archival work.</p>
<p>In several cases, the availability of online resources seemed to offer researchers a new and important broader context for their work. One English researcher’s work on Donne had been enhanced by the resources made available on Early English Books Online (EEBO), placing the author in his wider cultural context. Similarly, researchers using Old Bailey Online and DIAMM were enthusiastic about the opportunities offered by linked data and amalgamation of several databases. They would like to see linked data enhanced in future development of both sites. The Digital Republic of Letters project is entirely based on contextualizing a wide range of data sources by digitizing and linking them, allowing new interpretations of the original material. There is a hint here that digital technologies are allowing researchers to explore new questions, although, as we shall see later, in many cases the technology is enabling the exploration of an existing research interest, rather than prompting new lines of intellectual enquiry.</p>
<p>A final, interesting development across several cases is the hybrid use of print and digital resources, where the choice of format changes depending upon the task. One philosopher uses printed texts for cross-referencing citations and page numbers, but uses a digital copy when searching for a specific term. Academics in the English and Philosophy departments reported using Google Books to skim chapters in order to decide whether it was worth acquiring a hard copy of the publication.</p>
<p>These developments are mostly pragmatic, based upon the relative usefulness of the two formats. In other cases, however, researchers admit that their choices are less easily explained. For example, most researchers cite the print version of sources, even when they have actually made greater use of the online resource within their work. One researcher on the Digital Republic of Letters project reported feeling ‘sneaky’ when doing this, and highlighted the slightly absurd situations that can arise. ‘I’ll see other scholars citing these weird early 20th century editions of 18th century books and I’ll say, wait, I know where you got that from, that’s from ARTFL<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474022211427421">5</xref></sup>! But, you know, of course they don’t cite it.’ Such behaviour can, as researchers acknowledged, mean that usage of digital resources is under-recognized, and can reinforce unhelpful stereotypes about the value of online resources. These, as we shall see, clearly exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022211427421"><title>Learned behaviours</title>
<p>One musicologist said ‘I do feel pressure to work more with originals than with the digital images because of the traditions of the field. There’s this notion in the field that you can always get more out of seeing the original than seeing a digital image of it.’ In fact, this notion directly contradicts musicologists’ experience (as a cohort) of working with digital data. In many cases, digitization allowed more detailed examination of the manuscripts, enabled new research findings, and even prompted new research questions. But disciplinary norms have not yet caught up with these developments, and considerable value is still attached to analogue techniques.</p>
<p>In other cases, disciplinary traditions and learned behaviours determine the types of digital tools and services that are developed for or by researchers. For example, according to participants in our case study, there is no tradition in philosophy of collaborating to access and analyse research data. Therefore, their online engagement with raw data sources remains limited to accessing electronic versions of texts: there is no attempt to develop their practice into a more collaborative enterprise in line with the possibilities offered by the internet. However, there is a strong tradition within the discipline of sharing work in progress, by circulating pre-publication versions of papers for comment and criticism. In this respect, they have taken much greater advantage of new digital technologies, with many philosophers running personal websites to disseminate their work before it is published. An online tool which aggregates philosophy preprints, Phil Papers, scans these pages and provides updates to subscribers, so they are aware of the latest work. Similarly, some philosophy students mentioned reading blogs in order to keep up to date with the literature. So in philosophy, communications technology has been adopted to make pre-existing communications easier, but not to change practice so that researchers collaborate in new areas.</p>
<p>Not all researchers in the study adapted so readily to Web 2.0 technologies, and many felt unsure about its validity as a research input or output. Researchers in the Old Bailey Online case mentioned that they did not make extensive use of blogging, because they were not sure that they would have any outputs that might be of interest to a blogging audience. In their field, there is no tradition of scholar bloggers, or of communicating unpublished research results widely, so they cannot conceive of blogging as an alternative or addition to more traditional methods of scholarly communication, as it is in philosophy.</p>
<p>Others expressed concerns that users assume digital collections are complete when in fact decisions to digitize are often arbitrary, based on funding or timing rather than contribution to scholarship. Members of the Digital Republic of Letters project recommended including metadata to describe a collection, making transparent the scope of a corpus, and noting exclusions. The Old Bailey Online, for example, provides a description of its collection including its limitations, though some researchers remain concerned that less experienced users may assume that the collection is complete. In fact, search engines such as Google do not provide a list of websites, especially journal collections, included in their search algorithm and some researchers believe they therefore provide an illusion of completeness that may lead to bias. Underpinning these concerns are notions of a corpus learned from analogue behaviours, in which the scope of a given collection is clearly and visibly defined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022211427421"><title>Disciplinary development?</title>
<p>As we have mentioned, researchers recognize the value of digital technologies in helping them to speed up their work, and for many this means that they can answer new research questions. As one Old Bailey Online user put it, ‘I think it does enable you to take on questions you would have dropped or run away from before’. A philosopher agreed, saying ‘the availability of digital texts has encouraged me to pursue interests in rather obscure areas, or sets of areas, because I get more done in less time than previously’. A scholar working on the Digital Republic of Letters suggested that simple tools like keyword search mean that he can follow up hunches which add to an argument but would be too time consuming to do without digital technologies.</p>
<p>In some cases, researchers believe that this ability to work in new ways has affected the course of the discipline. An Old Bailey Online user argued that the ability to follow a named individual through court records ‘changes the nature of history in a way, because it becomes tracing individual lives and ordinary lives rather than elite lives’. But historians in other fields – particularly South Asian studies, for example – have been documenting and analysing the lives of non-elites for decades. So the research made possible by the Old Bailey Online database does not represent an epistemological change in historical studies, it simply brings an existing approach into play in a new area. It is noteworthy that technology has driven this change in relation to the time and place covered by Old Bailey Online content; in other fields of historical study the interest in non-elites has tended to be theory-driven.</p>
<p>In other cases, the boundaries were clearly being pushed. The Digital Republic of Letters was the clearest example of this, with researchers suggesting that ‘we’re going from simple word retrieval to text-mining, so rather than treating a digital version of a book just as a digital version of a book, seeing it as an opportunity to ask new questions and to read it in an entirely different way’. It is significant that, in this case, researchers and developers worked closely together, and were recruited to the project in part because their interests crossed boundaries between humanities and computer sciences. Therefore, both sides were able to have informed conversations about how technological developments might affect the discipline, and to build tools that allowed researchers to invent new questions, rather than ones which helped them answer questions that had perhaps always existed.</p>
<p>For most researchers, however, technology could not replace human input. This can apply in quite prosaic ways; for example, in order to find every mention of a particular individual, one Old Bailey Online researcher had to use nine different spellings of his name. Databases cannot yet recognize the instances where ‘Dunckesley’ and ‘Tunikerly’ refer to the same person, and distinguish them from instances where they may not. In other respects, the need for the human element goes much deeper, reflecting the role of cognition and understanding, as opposed to computation, in research. As one researcher and developer put it, ‘At the end of the day, research and interpretation are a human activity … [Technology] changes the scale on which we can do things, but it isn’t going to change the fact that <italic>we</italic> want to do things. We want to be the person understanding. I want to sit back and go “Oh, my God. Now I understand why Plato was doing that.” The computer can help me, but it can’t replace me in understanding.’ It is particularly interesting that the researcher in question sees two needs: the research needs human input, but the researcher also needs to feel that their intellect has had some influence over the research outcome.</p>
<p>But this statement does not close off the possibility of disciplinary development through computational techniques. In particular, the developers that we interviewed had quite strong views about how computational techniques might play a greater – and possibly conceptual – role in research practice. As the same developer explains, the tools may help find a needle in a haystack, ‘but what if you want to know what the shape of the haystack is? You don’t have a needle. You’re wondering what needles are here that I’d want to stick in my foot in the first place.’ Another, with a similar viewpoint, said that ‘what we haven’t yet done is develop the new questions and the new paradigms that should be possible, and that we as imaginative scholars should be able to imagine’. A sense emerges that researchers need to see computational techniques as a stimulus for new intellectual approaches to their discipline, not just a tool which makes existing approaches easier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1474022211427421"><title>Complexity</title>
<p>Our case studies reflect two trends that are apparent in previous research: (1) that information technologies are growing increasingly powerful and able to perform more and more complex tasks, and (2) that scholars across disciplines are increasingly collaborating on their research and dissemination. To better understand these co-occurring trends, we created the complexity continuum as a useful heuristic to explore the relationship between scholars and their technologies. The complexity continuum visualizes these trends as an intersecting relationship between the complexity of technologies and the complexity of collaborating with other researchers. The two-dimensional matrices, shown below, can help to understand information seeking, access, use and dissemination behaviours in terms of their technical and organizational complexity. The horizontal axis illustrates computational complexity, ranging from lower to higher. Likewise, the vertical axis represents the collaboration complexity, also ranging from lower to higher, and is embodied in work behaviours and communication practices. The scale we use does not imply any value judgement: information resources with lower computational complexity may be just as important and valuable, even more so, than their more complex counterparts. However, the relative complexity of one set of resources in comparison to another has important implications in terms of types of users, uses, and the likelihood of uptake.</p>
<p>The top right sector of these diagrams represents the technologies and behaviours that are both computationally and collaboratively complex, such as communicating and working with others via Web 2.0 tools. In the top left sector, we include multi-institution digitized resources, which are complex to build and maintain, but largely rely on simpler technology. The bottom right sector shows computationally intensive uses of information that can be done individually or by small groups of researchers, such as text mining. Finally, the bottom left sector, particularly the extreme corner, is where the fabled humanities scholar of yore lives: working alone, covered in the dust of archives, possibly referring to a computerized card catalogue. In reality, as we shall see, modern humanities scholars such as those represented by the cases in this research, regularly span across these sectors in their day-to-day uses of information.</p>
<p>The following diagrams, then, show the types of information sources identified in the six cases and map the cases onto the complexity continuum. These visualizations are currently qualitative illustrations of our understanding of these resources and their use, although we plan in the future to collect additional empirical data to refine and validate this conceptualization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474022211427421">Figure 1</xref> shows data from the two departments we studied (Birmingham English and UCL Philosophy). A number of resources are shared by the cases (represented by the oval clouds). For the Birmingham English Department, along with the full range of simple collaboration tools such as email and Skype, scholars use RSS feeds and Twitter to learn about new research. They are also engaged with more complex computational activities including developing software and using text-mining tools. Likewise, the UCL Philosophy Department, which is less likely to engage with collaborative computational information uses, nevertheless relies on resources such as blogs and newsfeeds to engage with other researchers. Both of these cases, however, are on average relying on less complex technologies for their research, and demonstrate some complex collaborative information uses, but generally not in the context of co-occurring complex information uses.
<fig id="fig1-1474022211427421" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Complexity continuum of academic departments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1474022211427421-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1474022211427421">Figure 2</xref> the two resource-centred cases are somewhat further to the right on the computational complexity axis, representing higher complexity. Unlike subjects in the department-based cases, users of Old Bailey Online and DIAMM are developing tools, software and databases, and are using visualization tools. Digital humanities initiatives, including digitizing resources, building databases and data interfaces, and creating tools for broader use by humanities scholars, are becoming increasingly common. They often involve both computer scientists and humanities scholars, with domain expertise, as is the case with both Old Bailey Online and DIAMM. These two cases represent types of humanities scholars more engaged with computationally complex tools.
<fig id="fig2-1474022211427421" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Complexity continuum of resource-centered cases.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1474022211427421-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1474022211427421">Figure 3</xref> shows, as might be expected, that corpus linguistics and the large-scale Digital Republic of Letters project are further along the computation complexity axis to the right than the other cases. The Digital Republic of Letters is the case furthest to the top along the vertical collaboration complexity axis. Both of these cases are using computational resources to develop complex tools and databases. In both cases, however, more traditional resources, such as hardcopy materials and library catalogues, remain important. This suggests that researchers are not moving <italic>from</italic> less complex information uses <italic>to</italic> more complex ones, but are <italic>broadening</italic> their information ecosystems.
<fig id="fig3-1474022211427421" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Complexity continuum of fields and projects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1474022211427421-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>One question arising from the complexity continuum diagrams shown here is whether there is a general trend across disciplines upwards and to the right on the continuum, or whether the most complex uses are and will remain outliers doing specialized research alongside the relatively unchanged mainstream of humanities researchers.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1474022211427421" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that humanities researchers’ usage of digital information resources is highly influenced by their existing research practices and habits, developed when using analogue services. Disciplinary traditions are particularly important in influencing uptake, as with the philosophers who blog because it makes it easier to continue their existing practice of sharing preprints. But the types of resources available to researchers also affect their digital engagement. This is particularly noticeable with the Digital Republic of Letters project, where researchers from a range of fairly traditional disciplines worked with developers to build a very sophisticated set of digital tools and subsequently exhibited the ‘complex’ behaviour associated with the much newer (and completely technology-dependent) field of corpus linguistics. This contrasts with the Old Bailey Online case; although some users felt that they were breaking new disciplinary ground, most felt that they were merely applying new techniques to old questions. Indeed, the developers we spoke to felt rather frustrated by this. So the complexity of the tools available, and the relationship between researchers and developers, affect the ways in which these tools are used.</p>
<p>We also observed a hybrid use of digital and analogue resources. In some cases this was simply based upon what format would best suit a specific task – for example, keyword searching is easier in digital texts, but cross-referencing is easier with a paper book. But there was also evidence of a continuing use of print, not because it is well suited to a specific task, but because it is somehow considered ‘better’ within the discipline. None of our interviewees seemed to hold this viewpoint, but several noted that their behaviour was affected by their perception of how others within their field thought about digital resources. That said, some researchers were concerned about the relative completeness of print and digital archives, with legitimate concerns about the criteria for selecting content for digitization and users’ ability to understand what proportion of a complete collection they were seeing.</p>
<p>In general, most researchers recognized that their digital activity was, in many ways, a continuation of their previous work. While many talked about how the tools had ‘revolutionized’ their discipline, for the most part they were referring to speed and ease, rather than conceptual progress. However, there are some interesting glimmers of what could come in the future from the Digital Republic of Letters project. The key seems to be having developers and researchers work alongside each other, to push both the technical and the intellectual boundaries of a discipline.</p>
