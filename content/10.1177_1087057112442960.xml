<abstract>
<p>Estrogens, acting through estrogen receptor α (ERα), stimulate breast cancer proliferation, making ERα an attractive drug target. Since 384-well format screens for inhibitors of proliferation can be challenging for some cells, inhibition of luciferase-based reporters is often used as a surrogate end point. To identify novel small-molecule inhibitors of 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>)–ERα-stimulated cell proliferation, we established a cell-based screen for inhibitors of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα induction of an estrogen response element (ERE)<sub>3</sub>–luciferase reporter. Seventy-five “hits” were evaluated in tiered follow-up assays to identify where hits failed to progress and evaluate their effectiveness as inhibitors of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells. Only 8 of 75 hits from the luciferase screen inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of ERα-positive MCF-7 and T47D cells but not control ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Although 12% of compounds inhibited E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation in only one of the ERα-positive cell lines, 40% of compounds were toxic and inhibited growth of all the cell lines, and ~37% exhibited little or no ability to inhibit E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation. Representative compounds were evaluated in more detail, and a lead ERα inhibitor was identified.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-throughput screens based on luciferase reporter assays are widely used to evaluate the effects of compounds on a pathway or target of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112442960">1</xref></sup> Reporter assays are often used as surrogate markers for a process such as cell proliferation that is more difficult to establish in 384- or 1536-well high-throughout screens. Although there have been several studies of off-target effects due to direct interaction of a compound with the luciferase protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057112442960">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112442960">3</xref></sup> much less is known about the ability of a simple luciferase reporter assay to predict small-molecule effects on a complex process, such as cell proliferation. Using inhibitors of estrogen receptor α (ERα) as a model, we evaluated how effectively a primary screen based on inhibition of a luciferase reporter predicted the ability of small molecules to selectively inhibit estrogen-ERα-dependent growth of human breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>The complex of estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) and ERα, plays a critical role in the growth and metastases of breast cancer. The important role of estrogens in breast cancer is illustrated by the widespread therapeutic use of aromatase inhibitors that block estrogen production, as well as the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and faslodex/fulvestrant/ICI 182,780 that work by competing with estrogens for binding to ERα.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057112442960">4</xref></sup> The progressive development of tumors resistant to tamoxifen and other ERα antagonists,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057112442960">5</xref></sup> as well as to aromatase inhibitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057112442960">6</xref></sup> underscores the continued importance of ERα as a therapeutic target.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that the ability of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα to regulate nuclear gene expression plays a key role in the ability of estrogens to stimulate proliferation of ERα-positive breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112442960">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112442960">8</xref></sup> The E<sub>2</sub>-ERα complex regulates gene expression by direct binding to DNA sequences termed <italic>estrogen response elements</italic> (EREs) and closely related sequences and by tethering to DNA through other proteins bound at AP1 and SP1 sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057112442960">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057112442960"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057112442960"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057112442960">12</xref></sup> The E<sub>2</sub>-ERα complex can also act in the cytosol to rapidly activate several membrane-associated protein kinase–based signaling pathways. However, selective activation of the progrowth ERK1/2 signaling pathways by the E<sub>2</sub>-ERα complex is not sufficient to stimulate E<sub>2</sub>-dependent growth of breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057112442960">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent reports have described assays using growth as a biological end point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057112442960">14</xref></sup> Although effective in 96-well plates, due to high sensitivity to small changes in the initial plating conditions, our assays for E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation of breast cancer cells did not exhibit sufficient reproducibility and precision for use in 384-well high-throughput screens. We therefore developed a screen using endogenous ERα in T47D, human breast cancer cells, stably transfected to express a luciferase reporter containing three consensus EREs ((ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112442960">15</xref></sup> The readout is the ability of small molecules to inhibit the E<sub>2</sub>-ERα induction of the (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase reporter. Although E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-regulated gene expression is essential for E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-dependent cell proliferation, we found that there was an imperfect relationship between the inhibitory potency of compounds in the luciferase reporter assay and their potency as selective inhibitors of estrogen-dependent cell proliferation. This led us to characterize in some detail the properties of 75 verified hits from the reporter assay. Around 10% of the verified hits functioned as selective inhibitors of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation of breast cancers cells. We identified several causes for the failure of most of the hits to function as selective inhibitors. As a primary screen, HTS using luciferase reporter assays represents a viable, but imperfect, way to identify small-molecule inhibitors of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-induced cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Automated High-Throughput Screening and Manual 384-Well Plate Luciferase Assays</title>
<p>High-throughput screening (HTS) luciferase-based assays were carried out by adding test compounds to plates using a Matrix PlateMate Plus instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), equipped with a 384-well pin-transfer apparatus. To reach the desired final concentration for screening with limited volume options available using the pin-transfer apparatus, 0.1 µL of each 10-mM compound stock in DMSO was transferred into 70 µL serum-free RPMI-1640. Then, 60 µL medium containing each test compound was then withdrawn from the plates using a 384-well tip cartridge, leaving 10 µL of each compound at 14.28 µM. Cells were harvested at a density of 1-million cells/mL in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% CD-FBS. A 1:500 dilution of 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) in ethanol (EtOH) and a vehicle-ethanol control were added to the (+)E<sub>2</sub> and (−)E<sub>2</sub> cell stocks, respectively. Cells were plated at a density of 10 000 cells/well by pipetting 10 µL of cells into each well using a Matrix Wellmate dispenser. The final concentration of test compounds was 7.14 µM. The screening medium contained 0.1% (v/v) EtOH, 0.07% (v/v) DMSO, and 10 nM E<sub>2</sub>. Plates were centrifuged for 2 min at 500 rpm and incubated for 24 h (37 °C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>“Hits” from the primary HTS were reconfirmed by diluting 10-mM compound stocks in DMSO to 20 µM in serum-free RPMI-1640. Cells were harvested at a density of 1 million cells/mL in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% CD-FBS. A 1:500 dilution of 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) in EtOH and a vehicle-ethanol control were added to the (+)E<sub>2</sub> and (−)E<sub>2</sub> cell stocks, respectively. Cells were plated at a density of 10 000 cells/well by pipetting 10 µL of cells into each well. The final concentration of test compounds was 10 µM, and the medium contained 0.1% (v/v) EtOH, 0.1% (v/v) DMSO, and 10 nM E<sub>2</sub>. Plates were centrifuged for 2 min at 500 rpm and incubated for 24 h (37 °C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>All plates were frozen at −20 °C overnight following the 24-h incubation and thawed to room temperature to promote cell lysis. Then, 10 µL Bright-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 15 min on the bench before measuring luminescence.</p>

<title>96-Well Luciferase Assays</title>
<p>Five to 6 days before the experiment, T47D-KBluc cells were subcultured and plated at a high density (about 30%–40% confluence) in RPMI-1640 + 10% FBS. Two days later, the medium was changed to RPMI-1640 +10% CD-FBS. After 3 or 4 days with a medium change on day 2, the cells were harvested and counted, and 50 000 cells in 100 µL medium were added to each well of a 96-well white-wall clear-bottom plate (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in RPMI-1640 + 10% CD–calf serum (CS). The medium was replaced the next day with medium containing the test compounds with or without hormone. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated off, and 30 µL Bright-Glo reagent (Promega) was added. To help lyse the cells, the plate was placed on a shaker for 5 min. To remove any bubbles in the wells, the plate was subjected to centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 2 min.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in MEM supplemented with 10% CD-CS, and plated into 6-well plates at a density of 300 000 cells/well. The medium was replaced with treatment medium the following day, and the cells were treated for 24 h. The cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and whole-cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, 1 mM EGTA, 30 mM NaF, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orhovanadate, 1 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM phenylmetholsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were collected, and debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15 000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C. Then, 20 µg total protein was loaded onto 10% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, separated, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with monoclonal ERα [6F11] antibody (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) or control monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent immunodetection with an ECL Detection Kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and were visualized using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).</p>

<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p>pS2 mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent and purified with the RNAeasy mini-kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and 0.5 µg RNA was reverse transcribed using a DyNAmo cDNA synthesis kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). Then, 10 ng cDNA product was added to a primer mix, such that the forward and reverse primer final concentration was 50 nM. Primers used in qRT-PCR were as follows: pS2, forward (5′-ACCGGACACCTCAGACACG) and reverse (5′-CTGTGT TGTGAGCCGAGGC); 36B4, forward (5′-GTGTTCG ACAATGGCAGCAT) and reverse (5′-GACACCCTCCA GGAAGCGA).

<title>A Cell-Based Screen for Inhibitors of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα Induction of an (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-Luciferase Reporter Gene</title>
<p>Regulation of nuclear gene expression is central to the ability of estrogens bound to ERα to induce proliferation of breast cancer cells. The widely used breast cancer therapeutic tamoxifen acts by competing with estrogens for binding to ERα and interfering with recruitment of coactivators critical for ERα-mediated gene expression. To identify novel small molecules that directly or indirectly inhibit E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-mediated gene expression, a cell-based primary screen was developed using ERα-positive T47D human breast cancer cells stably transfected to express a luciferase reporter whose expression is driven by three copies of the consensus estrogen response element (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112442960">15</xref></sup> Dose-response studies show that E<sub>2</sub> robustly and reproducibly induces expression of the luciferase reporter (<bold>Fig. 1A</bold>).

<p>In some screens, a constitutively active luciferase reporter can provide a useful indicator of the specificity and toxicity of potential small-molecule inhibitors. However, small-molecule inhibitors of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-induced gene expression should also inhibit the proliferation of ERα-positive human breast cancer cells and might thereby decrease the activity of a constitutively active Renilla luciferase internal standard. To test this, we compared the effect of several well-established, specific, and nontoxic inhibitors of ERα with a mildly toxic compound identified in our follow-on assays. The well-known therapeutics tamoxifen, raloxifene, and faslodex and the toxic compound all produced similar substantial declines in expression of the constitutively active luciferase reporter gene (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S1</bold>).</p>
<p>Since the constitutively active luciferase could not distinguish toxic compounds from bona-fide ER inhibitors, we used tiered assays to filter out toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Small-molecule hits were first screened for inhibition of DHT–androgen receptor (AR) induction of a prostate-specific antigen-luciferase (ARE-luciferase) reporter in stably transfected HeLa cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112442960">16</xref></sup> This provided a way to initially flag compounds as toxic, which was later reconfirmed in subsequent toxicity assays. A second reporter also functioned as a crude method for assessing the nuclear receptor specificity of small molecules, given that ERα and AR share a high degree of structure homology and conservation in upstream signaling pathways. It also provides a way to detect inhibitors of luciferase enzyme activity. Alternatively, inhibitors of luciferase enzyme activity could have been detected by growing the T47D-kBLuc cells in the presence of estrogen alone, lysing the cells, and then adding the small molecule being tested and the luciferase reagent.</p>
<p>Compounds were considered hits in the primary screen if, at a concentration of 7.1 µM, they reduced luciferase units by at least 50%. All compounds reaching the 50% cutoff had reached statistical significance, as defined by ±3 SD from the negative reference. To evaluate the effective size of inhibition, we used strictly standardized mean difference as a secondary metric in lead selection.</p>

The shorter time cells were exposed to compounds in the reporter assay, 1 day as opposed to 3 days, likely accounts for the more limited inhibition seen in the reporter assay. Since compound 45 was toxic to all the cells across a broad range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref>), it was not analyzed further. Compound 4 was identified as a potential selective inhibitor of ERα action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). Compound 4 elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-induced (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ~4.0 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>).

The IC<sub>50</sub>s for inhibition of the proliferation of the ERα-positive cells were 3.7 and 1.7 µM for the MCF-7 and T47D cells, respectively, and 12.8 µM for the ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In evaluating a single reporter luciferase-based assay as a surrogate assay for estrogen-induced proliferation of cancer cells, two potential sources of off-target effects stand out: small molecules that inhibit because they exhibit direct interaction with luciferase and small molecules that are broadly toxic. Both types of small molecule can reduce luciferase activity and be scored as hits in the primary screen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057112442960">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112442960">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Approximately 37% (28 of 75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>) of the hits identified in the luciferase assay did not reach the cutoff for inhibition of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation in both MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. This included the 21 compounds in the “no-growth inhibition” category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 18–37) and the 7 compounds in the “toxic” category that only inhibited cell growth in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 69–75). Nearly all of the latter compounds (6 of 7) inhibited cell growth modestly (&gt;25%) in both ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines. The more pronounced effects on cell growth in the ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of this cell line to damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112442960">16</xref></sup> The no-growth inhibitors could be further subclassified as (1) compounds that modestly inhibited cell proliferation but did not reach the 50% cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 18–28) or (2) compounds that exhibited little or no ability to inhibit E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation of the breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 29–38). Partial growth inhibition may reflect different dose-response curves for inhibition of gene expression and cell proliferation. Consistent with this idea, the concentration of the noncompetitive ERα inhibitor TPSF required to inhibit cell proliferation is ~3-fold higher than is required to inhibit the luciferase reporter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112442960">16</xref></sup> Compounds that showed no ability to inhibit E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation of the breast cancer cells might be acting as direct inhibitors of luciferase enzyme activity. However, 8 of 9 compounds that failed to significantly inhibit growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 29–38) also failed to significantly inhibit the ARE-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>, 29–38). This suggests that these compounds are not functioning as luciferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Approximately 49% (37 of 75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>) of the compounds were toxic, as a result of their ability to inhibit cell growth in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Approximately 81% of the toxic compounds displayed global toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 39–68), whereas 19% selectively inhibited growth of the MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 69–75). The large number of toxic compounds is likely due to the high sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112442960">16</xref></sup> the rigorous 4-day treatment interval used to assess for growth effects, and the more stringent growth inhibition cutoffs used to classify compounds as toxic (30% cutoff vs. 50% cutoff for ERα-positive cell lines). Our data suggest that use of an alternative reporter system in parallel with the primary screen has predictive value in flagging potentially toxic compounds. Approximately 70% of the compounds considered toxic inhibited the ARE-luciferase reporter by &gt;30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>, 39–75). These compounds all displayed SSMD scores &lt;–2 (<bold>Suppl. Fig. S2</bold>, 39–75), demonstrating that these reductions in ARE-luciferase were statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Conversely, only 11% of “nontoxic” compounds inhibited the DHT-AR-induced ARE-luciferase reporter by &gt;30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>, 1–38). Yet, 3 of these nontoxic compounds represent “lead” compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057112442960">6</xref>, and 7). This suggests that data from a secondary reporter system should aid in evaluating toxicity and should be used in concert with additional toxicity assays, rather than serve as a rigid cutoff for evaluating candidate leads. The identification of leads that inhibit both reporters may reflect modulation of receptor activity via direct interactions with small molecules at structurally homologous sites or through indirect interaction via targeting-conserved upstream signaling pathways. Importantly, the ARE-reporter provides a preliminary measure of nuclear receptor specificity for small-molecule “leads” and provides a starting point for tailoring subsequent assays toward subsets of “leads.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising was our finding that some small-molecule hits from the (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase reporter assay inhibited proliferation in either T47D cells or MCF-7 cells but not in both cell lines. MCF-7 and T47D cells are the most widely used lines of ERα-positive breast cancer cells. These cell lines were independently derived from different tumors. Since the hits were identified using a primary screen for inhibitors of (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase expression in stably transfected T47D cells, and T47D cells contain less ERα than MCF-7 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087057112442960">24</xref></sup> we anticipated we might identify small molecules that were more effective in T47D cells than in MCF-7 cells. Instead, we identified some small molecules that were toxic in MDA-MB-231 cells but only damaged one of the two cell lines and a few small molecules that preferentially inhibited proliferation of each of the cell lines without damaging MDA-MB-231 cells. Compound 14 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferation of T47D cells with little effect on proliferation of MCF-7 cells. At 10 µM, compound 14 inhibited proliferation of the T47D cells by ~81% with no effect on proliferation of the MCF-7 cells or MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). In contrast, compound 11 killed all the MCF-7 cells and actually stimulated estrogen-dependent growth of the T47D cells from 2.5 to 20 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). The surprising properties of compound 11 demonstrate that effects on cell proliferation can be entirely dissociated from effects on reporter gene expression. It is unlikely that compounds 11 and 14 directly target ERα action as they had little or no ability to inhibit estrogen induction of pS2 mRNA in the same T47D line used for the luciferase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 6C</bold></xref>). These data illustrate the importance of early evaluation of primary hits using more than one cell line. Since T47D cells proliferate more rapidly in full serum compared with stripped serum supplemented with estrogen, small molecules such as compound 11 can also exhibit off-target effects on pathways that lead to increased cell proliferation. The higher frequency of small molecules that activate growth in T47D cells may reflect the fact that MCF-7 proliferation rates in the presence of estrogen are near maximum and are higher than those of T47D cells, making MCF-7 cells much less susceptible to off-target effects that increase rates of cell proliferation.</p>
<p>About 10% of the primary hits from the luciferase screen represented leads that inhibited estrogen-dependent proliferation of both the MCF-7 and T47D cells with minimal effects on proliferation of the ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>, 1–8). From 1 to 5 µM, compound 4 elicited progressive inhibition of the proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells with little effect on proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112442960"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Since compound 4 showed some toxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells at 10 µM, we used 5 µM to test its effect on estrogen induction of pS2 mRNA. Consistent with its effect on the (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-luciferase reporter and on E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation, compound 4 effectively inhibited induction of pS2 mRNA and is a lead compound for further development.</p>
<p>The application of cell-based assays in HTS remains inherently challenging. The large number of biological targets and high degree of crosstalk between integrated signaling pathways predispose cell-based assays to higher “hit” frequencies, lower confirmation rates, and higher numbers of toxic compounds in follow-up assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087057112442960">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087057112442960">26</xref></sup> Approximately 10% of the verified hits from the luciferase-based screen ultimately met our end point for selective inhibition of estrogen-dependent proliferation of ERα-positive cell lines. Although this might seem to argue for a cell proliferation–based screen, a primary screen based on inhibition of cell proliferation would have exposed many of the same issues. Since single-cell proliferation assays do not usually distinguish between toxic compounds and those targeting the pathway of interest, many of the hits from a proliferation-based screen would have emerged as toxic when tested in a control cell line. Our finding that some compounds exhibit cell line–specific inhibition of estrogen-dependent proliferation means that compounds identified in a single cell line may still fail in other cell lines because they do not target ERα. In our hands, assays for estrogen-dependent cell proliferation assays in 384-well plates exhibited less precision and reproducibility than luciferase-based assays and require several days compared to one day for luciferase assays. Although luciferase-based assays offer the advantage of improved efficiency in HTS, assay interference remains an important obstacle to generating high-quality leads. Although the role of assay interference in our screen is largely unknown, the coupling of multiple cell proliferation assays to the primary screen provided an effective filter for rapidly eliminating compounds that lack target specificity. Alternatively, this empirically driven approach of asking cells to tell us what small molecules are capable of inhibiting E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-stimulated proliferation provides a way to select for bioactive compounds, independent of their ability to elicit assay interference in the primary screen. Recent studies have shown that several important small molecules function as dual inhibitors of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent kinases and luciferases, including resveratrol and the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD090859.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087057112442960">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057112442960"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087057112442960">29</xref></sup> Since the role of E<sub>2</sub>-ERα in gene expression is essential to stimulating breast cancer cell proliferation, and a number of pathways can modulate ERα transcriptional activity through posttranslational modifications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112442960">30</xref></sup> our screen would not preclude identification of such bioactive compounds. Small molecules generally target several sites in cells and, through signal integration and unintended crosstalk, can elicit toxicity that is readily observed in downstream readouts such as E<sub>2</sub>-ERα-mediated gene expression. Carrying out multiple cell proliferation assays, using cells with and without the target, provides a very effective toxicity filter. This is reflected by the large numbers of toxic compounds we identified. With appropriate follow-on verification assays carried out in multiple cell lines, a luciferase-based primary screen represents a useful surrogate assay for a more complex process, such as hormone-stimulated cell proliferation.</p>
