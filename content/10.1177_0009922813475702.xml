<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The impacts of adverse social determinants of health (SDH) and poor environmental conditions on child health are emerging as a new pediatric morbidity of the 21st century. Conditions more commonly associated with poverty, including food insecurity, housing instability, substandard housing, homelessness, and inadequate parental education, are associated with higher rates of behavioral and developmental pathology and are clearly related to health outcomes and utilization for children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475702">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813475702"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813475702"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813475702"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475702">5</xref></sup> Therefore, physicians who provide care for underserved children must possess competency in screening for social and environmental risks factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475702">6</xref></sup> Acquiring these skills is critical for resident physicians since their continuity clinics often care for children from underserved backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813475702">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Effective child advocacy training, including SDH, is an important aspect of pediatric resident education and an Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirement for training in pediatrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813475702">8</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown improved competency, knowledge, and ability to identify resources after advocacy training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475702">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813475702"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813475702">11</xref></sup> Residents in our program receive advocacy training and report they consistently screen for SDH during well-child care (WCC). Despite these reports, local data suggests that the prevalence of social risks within our primary care setting greatly exceeds that which is consistently detected by our residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813475702">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a result of the changing climate in medical education influenced by tighter duty hours and increasing clinical demands, we sought an innovative and efficient way for residents to acquire additional training on screening for SDH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813475702">13</xref></sup> Over the past 30 years, trigger films or videos that depict patient–physician or physician–physician encounters have gained increasing popularity as a vehicle to promote reflection, stimulate discussion, and provide learners an opportunity to practice responding to various challenging situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475702">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813475702"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813475702">16</xref></sup> In the current medical education environment, trigger videos can be quite valuable for educators for they provide exposure to various clinical scenarios and challenges that residents may not routinely encounter in the face of increasing requirements that limit their time for education and face-to-face contact with patients and families. To provide our residents with more exposure to various SDH faced by our patient population and train them how to more effectively screen, study personnel developed an innovative curriculum that included a variety of trigger videos that modeled appropriate and inappropriate techniques for screening for and addressing various SDH. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of this novel curriculum that combined trigger videos modeling SDH screening coupled with facilitated group discussions at improving resident comfort and practice patterns screening for SDH during WCC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922813475702" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a nonrandomized study of an educational intervention. It was approved as an exempt study by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Institutional Review Board. The study was conducted from October 2010 to October 2011.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922813475702">
<title>Study Setting and Subjects</title>
<p>The study was conducted at CCHMC, which has a large pediatric and internal medicine-pediatric (Med-Peds) training program. CCHMC has more than 180 categorical and combined residents and attracts trainees from across the United States.</p>
<p>All the postgraduate level 2 (PL2) categorical pediatric residents with continuity clinic at 2 hospital based clinics (clinics A and B), and all PL2 and postgraduate level 3 (PL3) Med-Peds residents were invited to participate. Med-Peds residents have their continuity clinic at a combined Med-Peds clinic (clinic C). Clinic A is a large, urban, academic primary care center that serves as the continuity site for approximately 75 pediatric residents and has 35 000 visits annually. Clinic B is an offsite community health center that has 19 pediatric continuity clinic residents and approximately 10 000 visits annually. Clinic C is a also a large, urban, outpatient clinic that serves children and adults of all ages and serves as the continuity site for 28 Med-Peds residents with approximately 12 000 adult and pediatric patient visits annually.</p>
<p>All 3 clinics care for predominantly economically disadvantaged populations and use an electronic health record with standardized templates for WCC visits. Although the electronic health record templates differ slightly between the clinics, they all have multiple screening questions built into the WCC templates that prompt screening for the major SDH, including food security, housing conditions, public benefits, maternal depression, and domestic violence. All 3 clinics follow the same precepting and supervision guidelines. The faculty at all 3 clinics are affiliated with the same College of Medicine and have the opportunity to attend the same educator faculty development courses. Social service support at varying levels is available at all three clinics; legal partners are available for consultation for physicians at clinics A and B.</p>
<p>All residents invited to participate in the study had already completed the required intern advocacy rotation. The advocacy training consists of a 2-week rotation that combines a variety of didactic and immersion experiences that focus on injury prevention, anticipatory guidance, and issues related to poverty. The residents were assigned via convenience sampling into the educational intervention or the control groups based on their ability to attend the educational session due to their call schedules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813475702">
<title>Development of the Educational Intervention</title>
<p>Faculty with content expertise developed scripts for four trigger videos that depicted typical scenarios of resident physicians screening for SDH in continuity clinic. The videos were created using attending and resident physician volunteers at the institution and recorded with a personal video camera. For each of the 4 trigger videos, 2 versions were created using the same actors: an appropriate and inappropriate example. In the appropriate examples, residents were faced with triggers that led them to screen for food insecurity, public benefits denial, housing conditions, and domestic violence. In the inappropriate examples, residents failed to screen despite similar triggers. Videos were presented during an educational conference that was attended by only intervention group residents. Each of the paired trigger videos were shown following which faculty facilitated small and large group discussions that focused on successes and potential areas of improvement for screening for SDH and recognizing social risk factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922813475702">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>After providing consent, residents completed a pre-intervention survey assessing their attitudes and self-assessed screening practices for SDH. Over the next 3 months, 4 faculty conducted direct observations on a convenience sample of residents from each site (clinic A, n = 10; clinic B, n = 3; clinic C, n = 6) at a single WCC visit during which they evaluated resident screening practices for SDH using an SDH-specific observation tool. Faculty members were blinded to whether a resident was in control or intervention group. Prior to the direct observations, faculty members collaborated to determine how to score the checklist to limit variability. The survey completion and direct observations were done in different settings. The educational intervention was then administered at the aforementioned resident conference session attended by those in the intervention group. Two months later, all residents were asked to complete the Post-intervention survey. During this time, faculty also completed a second direct observation on all control and intervention residents that were observed pre-intervention and evaluated the residents using the same SDH observation tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922813475702">
<title>Survey and Observation Tool Development</title>
<p>The resident surveys and the SDH observation tool were developed de novo for this study by an interdisciplinary group of education experts from CCHMC. Both were reviewed by members of CCHMC’s Medical Education Research Group and piloted by the pediatric Chief Residents for content validity and amended accordingly. The surveys used a 5-point Likert-type scale to enquire about residents’ comfort and screening practices for SDH (food insecurity, public benefits, housing conditions, domestic violence, and maternal depression) during WCC. The pre-surveys also inquired about the number of social hardships experienced by the resident during their childhood and their perception of the previous training on SDH training they had received. The survey was distributed via an Internet survey platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>) to resident e-mail accounts. The SDH observation tool was based on a review of the literature and expert local opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813475702">17</xref></sup> The tool used a dichotomous checklist format of yes or no questions regarding if a resident inquired about a variety of SDH during the visit or provided referral or counseling on these SDH. The tool also obtained a measurement of time, in seconds, spent screening for SDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813475702">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0009922813475702">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All survey and observation data were analyzed via the SAS statistical platform, version 9.2 (Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were used for resident demographic information and data from questions related barriers to comprehensive SDH screening. Survey responses and time spent inquiring about SDH were analyzed via the Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Screening practices noted on observation were analyzed via McNemar’s test.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Forty of 46 residents (87%) invited to participate completed the pre-intervention surveys, including 29 pediatric and 11 Med-Peds residents. Thirty-six of those 40 residents (90%) completed the full study going on to complete the post-intervention surveys, plus observations for the select group of residents. Of the 4 residents who failed to complete the entire study, including the post-intervention survey and observations, three were in the intervention arm, and one was in the control arm. Reasons for failing to continue in the full study included schedule changes and leave of absence.</p>

<p>Following the intervention, there were no statistically significant differences between the control and intervention groups with respect to self-reported knowledge of and screening practices for various SDH (housing, public benefits, domestic violence, food security, and maternal depression). Nineteen residents were observed during the study both before and after the intervention occurred; 8 were in the intervention group and 11 in the control group. When comparing the first direct observation to the second, residents in the intervention group screened for sources of familial support (87.5% vs 37.5%; <italic>P</italic> = .046) and housing conditions (75% vs 25%; <italic>P</italic> = .045) at a significantly higher rate. Intervention residents also trended toward increased screening for utility issues, and offering additional counseling and resources (<italic>P</italic> = .08, for both; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813475702">Table 2</xref>). Residents in the intervention group also spent significantly more time screening for SDH with a median increase of 165 seconds (<italic>P</italic> = .04) as compared with control residents who had a median increase of 30 seconds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922813475702">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Education on screening for SDH that affect child health is a critical skill that must be gained by pediatric and Med-Peds residents during their training. Given the compression of duty hours and increasing clinical requirements, using innovative and multimodal delivery strategies to provide SDH education and training is paramount.</p>
<p>Few of our residents were raised in households with social hardships, which is consistent with demographic information of medical students in the United States and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813475702">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813475702">19</xref></sup> According to adult learning theory, personal experience is a strong motivator for future learning and practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813475702">20</xref></sup> Although many of our residents lack these experiences to reflect and build new knowledge on, they are expected to empathetically care for patients and families who face these social challenges, making this education and training essential.</p>
<p>Intervention residents who received this innovative curriculum had a significant change in their screening for adverse housing conditions and family support systems on faculty observation. Furthermore, intervention residents were less likely to note lack of knowledge and discomfort as barriers to screening as compared to control residents. Although, resident confidence and self-reported SDH screening practices did not differ between the groups, we believe this may be because of the brief pilot curriculum. Conceivably, additional SDH-focused education, including regular refreshers, would lead to an improvement.</p>
<p>Intervention residents had a statistically significant increase in the median time spent screening for SDH. We believe this is a critical measure as it can be a sign of the quality of discussion between the physician and family and may be more important than the actual number of screening questions asked. Intervention residents were noted on direct observation to offer counseling and resources to families more frequently. Although this did not reach statistical significance, we find it promising that counseling practices and discussion of potential resources trended toward a positive change. Since direct observations were only performed on a subset of residents, additional observations are necessary to determine if this trend in practice patterns is significant. If counseling and resource discussions truly change, it is conceivable that need-based interventions targeting well-established SDH would result, potentially mitigating the negative health effects of social and environmental risks.</p>
<p>The impact of social and environmental risks on the health of adults and children is complex, and screening, counseling, and intervention practices require a career to refine. Although immersion experiences, interaction with social and legal providers, and personal experience working with families under the guidance of faculty are critical, in an era of increasing duty hour standards they may not be feasible. Therefore incorporating innovative delivery strategies such as a targeted curriculum that incorporates trigger videos that model appropriate and inappropriate engagement of families to screen for SDH followed with group discussions led by experienced faculty is crucial.</p>
<sec id="section10-0009922813475702">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were limitations to the pilot study of this novel curriculum. This was an educational intervention on a small group of pediatric and Med-Peds residents from one residency program, over 1 year, with a limited sample size. The limited change in observed practice patterns could have been related to the smaller sample of resident observations and therefore may have not had sufficient power to detect significant practice change. Since an individual patient’s risk factors and needs are likely to influence the depth of screening, and this level of data was not obtained during the observation this too may have had an effect on resident screening practices. In addition, the findings of our study may not be generalizable to other settings given the unique training, resources, and infrastructure available at our institution.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, steps were taken to try to limit bias. To eliminate variability between raters during the observation only four faculty members performed the observations. Prior to the observations, these faculty members met to discuss and review completion of the direct observation tool based on the video trigger cases, to ensure there was agreement on how to score the tool. In an attempt to minimize the Hawthorne effect, or the bias introduced when study participants know they are being observed, residents were not reminded at the time of their observations that they were being observed to note their screening and counseling practices regarding SDH.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Empathetic and engaging physician assessment of SDH is a key component to addressing disparities and improving child health. Given the changing climate in medical education, influenced by work compression and increasing clinical demands, innovative educational techniques are imperative to train residents to address SDH. This pilot study of a curriculum that incorporates trigger videos that model appropriate and inappropriate engagement of families during screening for SDH followed by faculty facilitated group discussions resulted in residents inquiring more frequently about family support and adverse housing conditions and spending increased time screening for SDH. Findings also suggest that an increase in counseling and discussion of resources may have occurred. Although further study is required to determine statistical significance of the curricular innovation, feasibility at other training programs, and establish reliability and validity of these novel survey and observation tools, we are optimistic that our innovative curriculum stimulates behavior changes that could improve the quality of their screening for SDH-related issues. These changes in screening behavior may lead to more need-based interventions that could potentially alleviate adverse outcomes from high risk social and environmental circumstances.</p>
