<abstract>
<p>It is important to have the stroke survivors move as soon as possible to improve disability as well as related problems such as fatigue, sleep, and depression. However, there were few reports on a movement intervention for the inpatients who were in the rehabilitation unit just after taking acute care. An enjoyable intervention was developed that promoted movement focusing on plegic limbs and looked more like a game or a play; the game was designed to be a group activity that could be led by nurses. Twenty participants participated in 30- to 40-min sessions, 3 times a week for 2 weeks. Functional status (cognitive, motor, and total), fatigue, sleep, and depression were measured. Except for the cognitive function, all outcomes were significantly improved in the experimental group as compared to those in the control group. Safe and enjoyable nursing interventions should be developed and implemented to improve disability and related problems for the poststroke inpatients.</p>

<body>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1054773812439204">Rosamond et al., 2007</xref>), and hemiplegia or hemiparesis is one of the most common persisting disabilities of stroke survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773812439204">Carlsson, Moller, &amp; Blomstrand, 2003</xref>). About 50% of stroke survivors were in a disabled state, primarily hemiparesis. Hemiparesis primarily causes movement limitations and thus leads to a sedentary lifestyle, which in turn leads to many other problems such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812439204">de Groot, Phillips, &amp; Eskes, 2003</xref>). These additional problems are related to demographic and clinical characteristics, such as gender and marital status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1054773812439204">Srivastava, Taly, Gupta, &amp; Murali, 2010</xref>), number of strokes and mental status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812439204">Chatterjee, Fall, &amp; Barer, 2010</xref>), and social support and caregivers’ mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1054773812439204">Suh et al., 2005</xref>). But all problems are closely related to movement limitation and are variously interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773812439204">Carlsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773812439204">Lerdal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773812439204">Paparrigopoulos, Tzavara, Theleritis, Soldatos, &amp; Tountas, 2010</xref>). For example, fatigue was experienced by 72% of patients and was a significant predictor of movement limitation in daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812439204">Glader, Birgitta, &amp; Asplund, 2002</xref>) and associated with sleep disturbance and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812439204">de Groot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773812439204">Lerdal et al., 2011</xref>). Poststroke depression occurred in one third of stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1054773812439204">Srivastava et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1054773812439204">Suh et al., 2005</xref>), and dependence in activities of daily living was the most important predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812439204">Astrom, Adolfsson, &amp; Asplund, 1993</xref>). Sleep disturbance was observed in 78% of stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1054773812439204">Pasic, Smajlovic, Dostovic, Kojic, &amp; Selmanovic, 2011</xref>). These problems affect the prognosis of stroke patients through mortality, stroke recurrence rate, lowered quality of life, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773812439204">Culebras, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812439204">de Groot et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, interventions to promote movement or physical activity are necessary to improve these related problems as well as increase range of movement. Physical activity was effective to improve fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression in stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812439204">de Groot et al., 2003</xref>), cardiac patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773812439204">Paparrigopoulos et al., 2010</xref>), and community-dwelling adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773812439204">Lee, Kim, Davis, &amp; Kim, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, most formal and conventional rehabilitative interventions for inpatients have mainly focused on improving motor function of specific disabled parts, usually upper limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1054773812439204">Morris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812439204">Myint et al., 2008</xref>). These interventions did not improve hemiparesis-related problems measured by daily activities or depression. Also, patients have reported that they are usually bored when undergoing this kind of intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812439204">Choi, 2000</xref>). Boredom is a barrier to engagement in rehabilitative activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773812439204">Rimmer, Wang, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>). One of the reasons that inpatients feel bored is that most interventions are conducted individually. Group exercise has been reported as enjoyable and fun in qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812439204">Carin-Levy, Kendall, Young, &amp; Mead, 2009</xref>). Another way to make intervention enjoyable is to employ competition and reward, according to the hypothesis that competition and reward make behavior enjoyable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1054773812439204">Weiner, 1995</xref>). Also, it has been argued to be more enjoyable when intervention does not feel like formal treatment and participants feel as if they are playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1054773812439204">Woo &amp; Lee, 1998</xref>). Enjoyable intervention makes participants move and laugh; laughter is energizing, health promoting, and intrinsically rewarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773812439204">Huntley, 2009</xref>). Laughter is a powerful tool to improve hemiparesis-related problems. The beach ball game for stroke inpatient is a good example, as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1054773812439204">Woo and Lee (1998)</xref>.</p>
<p>Also, it has been recommended to have poststroke patients resume movement as early as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1054773812439204">Salter, Foley, &amp; Teasell, 2010</xref>); however, most interventions are performed for patients in communities or long-term care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1054773812439204">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>). Few studies have been implemented looking at this topic in stroke inpatients. Moreover, independent nurse-led interventions are rare, even though nurses are the health professionals who spend the most time with inpatients and bear the main responsibility for their care. And, as we know, most interventions to relieve fatigue, sleep disturbance, or depression have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773812439204">McGeough et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1054773812439204">Salter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1054773812439204">Welin, Bjalkefur, &amp; Roland, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, there have been few nursing interventions for poststroke inpatients, despite the need to move poststroke inpatients as early as possible to improve problems induced by movement limitation, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression, as well as movement limitation itself. To maximize the effect of the intervention, it must be enjoyable. Based on the above studies, an enjoyable nurse-led intervention for poststroke inpatients was developed to promote physical activity enough to improve movement of plegic limbs as well as related problems. It is better to resemble a game or play and be implemented in a group to make it enjoyable.</p>
<p>Based on the results of the beach ball game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1054773812439204">Woo &amp; Lee, 1998</xref>), a method was developed that sought to induce movement of upper and lower limbs using simple toys. Woo and Lee showed that simple beach ball game reduced depression in stroke inpatients. This study investigated the effects on the functional status (cognitive, motor, and total), fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression of inpatients with hemiparesis who resided in the rehabilitation unit of an acute setting. Because many stroke inpatients usually have only formal and conventional rehabilitative interventions over a limited time, the findings from this study could have important implications for the improvement of rehabilitation nursing practice.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1054773812439204">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Since all participants resided in the same unit, it was impossible to keep the contents of the experiment from the control group. Therefore, a nonsynchronized, nonequivalent control group pre- and post-test design was used. The data for the control group were collected over 2 months, and the data for the experimental group were collected before and after the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1054773812439204">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The intervention was performed in the rehabilitation unit of the university hospital at the one of the cities in South Korea. The unit usually had 60 to 70 inpatients, normally in an acute or subacute state, and 20 to 25 registered nurses who worked there regularly. Patients were included in the study if they (1) were in the rehabilitation unit and had been diagnosed with stroke, (2) had mild to moderate limb movement limitation on one side, (3) had no serious perceptual or cognitive dysfunction based on the Mini Mental State Examination-Korea (MMSE-K; score &gt; 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773812439204">Kwon, &amp; Park, 1989</xref>), and (4) wanted and consented to participate in the study.</p>
<p>Twenty participants were recruited into the experimental group and 25 into the control group. At a significance level of .05, mean effect size of 0.78 based on current data, and total sample size of 46, the power was 0.73 (G * Power 3).</p>
<p>The content of intervention and inclusion criteria were approved by physicians to guarantee the safety of the participants. The intervention was also approved by the university hospital IRB (institutional review board) committee from which the patients were recruited, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1054773812439204">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>A nurse-led intervention using children’s toys was developed to promote physical activity, focusing on movement of plegic upper and lower limbs. A toy football set was chosen to promote movements of the lower limbs, and a golf set was chosen for upper limbs. They looked like real football and golf sets, except for their size.</p>
<p>To identify a reference point, the pilot study was implemented with eight participants. Participants kicked or hit a ball 3 times at points 1, 2, and 3 feet away from the goal. The point 2 feet away from the goal, at which 70% of the trials were successful, was made the reference point.</p>
<p>To make the intervention enjoyable, it was implemented as a competitive team game. That is, participants were evenly and randomly divided into two teams. Starting at the point 2 feet away from the goal, participants kicked the ball until the goal was missed twice. Every time a participant succeeded in putting the ball into the goal or hole, the distance was increased by 1 foot. The farther the point from which they succeeded, the more points they received. To ensure that participants consciously used their plegic side, a red ribbon was tied to the unaffected side, and a goal was not counted if they had used that side. The participants cheered and encouraged their team members to win, while unconsciously using their plegic limbs. After the game ended, various prizes were given.</p>
<p>The intervention was performed in a room at the unit usually used for patients and their families to watch television, meet visitors, and so on. For patients’ safety, chairs were arranged against the wall. The intervention was performed around 4 p.m. At that time, all usual daily care, such as physical or occupational therapy, was finished and patients mostly lazed around in bed. The game took 30 to 40 min and conducted every other day for 2 weeks. Participants were encouraged to practice during the rest of the day. Before starting the game, they were always reminded how to play and what the rules were. Two nurses who worked on the unit were involved. One nurse led and coordinated the procedure. She reinforced the methods, the rules, the order of play, and so on. The other assisted patients when they moved, kept score of each team, prepared and provided prizes, and so on. The participants’ families were encouraged to stay in the intervention site for the patients’ safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1054773812439204">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Control group data were collected first. After all of the participants in the control group were discharged, the intervention started. Experimental group data were collected before and 2 weeks after intervention. Data were collected by their physicians and trained research assistants. Data collection took 30 to 40 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1054773812439204">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Age, gender, marital status, religion, job status, economic class, and education were collected as sociodemographic variables. Duration of stroke, side of hemiparesis, number of hospital admissions, and number of operations were collected as clinical variables.</p>
<p>Functional status was blindly measured by physicians using the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773812439204">Keith, Granger, Hamilton, &amp; Sherwin, 1987</xref>). Since all patients were routinely measured for functional status by their physicians every week, the physicians did not know which patients were in the experimental or control group. FIM includes 5 cognition and 13 motor items, all using 7-point ordinal scales (1 = <italic>total dependence on assistance</italic>, 7 = <italic>complete independence</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1054773812439204">Ottenbacher, Hsu, Granger, &amp; Fiedler, 1996</xref>). Total scores ranged from 18 to 126. The FIM has been found to be a reliable measure of function for stroke survivors (Cronbach’s alpha = .93) with interrater correlations ranging from .86 to .88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1054773812439204">Granger &amp; Hamilton, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Fatigue was measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773812439204">Mendoza et al., 1999</xref>), which was designed to assess the severity and impacts of fatigue in cancer patients but has been expanded to many disease and community samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812439204">Broderick et al., 2008</xref>). The inventory is composed of 9 items evaluated in a 10-point graphic rating scale. Scores were summed, and totals varied between 0 and 90; higher scores indicated greater fatigue. High internal consistency and validity (Cronbach’s alpha = .95-.96) have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773812439204">Mendoza et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812439204">Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, &amp; Kupfer, 1989</xref>), which measures 7 areas of sleep quality and patterns on a 3-point Likert-type scale. The scores of the seven areas are summed to yield a global PSQI score, with a range of 0 to 21; higher scores indicate lower sleep quality. Several studies using PSQI have reported high validity and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .83, test–retest correlation coefficient = .85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812439204">Buysse et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Depression was assessed with the Korean version of the State Depression Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773812439204">Jun, 1999</xref>), a self-report instrument frequently used to assess depressive symptoms in Korean participants. Respondents rated their mood on 10 items using 4-point Likert-type scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773812439204">Jun, 1999</xref>). High scores are indicative of individuals who currently feel sadness, hopelessness, and/or loneliness. Scores on this scale, however, do not indicate depressive symptomatology. Reliability as identified by Cronbach’s alpha was .94, and concurrent validity as identified by correlation with CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) was .89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773812439204">Jun, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1054773812439204">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>SPSS 18<sup>+</sup> was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics were used to show the demographic and clinical characteristics of the two study groups. Since there were no significant differences in demographic or clinical variables between the two groups, parametric (<italic>t</italic> tests) or nonparametric (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> or χ<sup>2</sup> tests) tests were used depending on the level of measurement and the distribution of each variable. Two-tailed test was done at the .05 significance level.</p>

Thirty-two patients suffered a left hemiparesis and 13 suffered a right hemiparesis. The average duration since stroke was 4.21 (4.10) months. On average, each patient had been admitted to the hospital as a stroke patient 1.78 (1.50) times and undergone stroke-related operations 1.07 (0.72) times.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The enjoyable nurse-led intervention was effective in improving functional status and reducing (i.e., improving) fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression among poststroke inpatients with hemiparesis. Strategies that encouraged patients to move and laugh seemed to improve all variables. Otherwise, patients in the unit were usually inactive all day, with the exception of some therapy time.</p>
<p>Motor function improved more in the experimental group than in the control group. This positive result could be because the intervention was focused primarily on movement of plegic limbs and used a simple method to discourage conscious use of the unaffected side. The method was based on the concept of a constraint-induced movement reported as a way to consciously move plegic limbs while applying a constraint on unaffected limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812439204">Myint et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>One interesting result was that fatigue was reduced even in spite of the increase in activity. This finding can be explained with reference to previous evidence-based studies that reported two types of fatigue. One was acute fatigue, which occurred at the end of a busy day or after physical exertion; those with acute fatigue responded quickly to rest or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773812439204">Hart &amp; Freel, 1982</xref>). The other was chronic or disease-induced fatigue associated with a disease process, an activity, or some psychological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812439204">de Groot et al., 2003</xref>); those with chronic fatigue were responsive to activity or regular exercise, even at low intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1054773812439204">Neuberger et al., 1997</xref>). Because the fatigue experienced by poststroke patients is disease-induced fatigue, it can be decreased by increasing activity and enhancing psychological factors. This hypothesis is consistent with findings that investigated the effects of the participants’ usual physical activity and depression on fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773812439204">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1054773812439204">Neuberger et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Sleep disturbance was one of the most complained-about and overlooked symptoms. Because one of its causes was inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773812439204">Paparrigopoulos et al., 2010</xref>), the intervention under study, which promotes activity, was effective at reducing sleep disturbance. As sleep disturbances such as sleep-disrupted breathing and excessive daytime sleepiness are risk factors for stroke and delaying factors for recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773812439204">Culebras, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812439204">Feng, He, Zhang, &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>), they should not be overlooked by health professionals.</p>
<p>Depression was also significantly improved only in the experimental group. This result might stem from increased activity and the characteristics of team-game intervention. Games are fun, and the group aspects of games are effective at providing social interaction and making intervention more enjoyable. When a group consists of a specific population with similar characteristics, as with our group, positive behaviors will be additionally facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1054773812439204">Scherer, Scherer, &amp; Pimenta Carvalho, 2007</xref>). This point is especially important in poststroke hemiplegic patients, who often feel and act clumsy and are reluctant to show their movements to others who have no disabilities.</p>
<p>In contrast to the other variables, the cognitive function was not significantly improved in the experimental group. This might be interpreted in several ways. First, cognitive function may not have improved because this intervention was focused primarily on motor function. Previous results have reported that motor function, depression, and cognitive function are correlated, suggesting that cognitive function improved with the improvement of motor function and depression scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1054773812439204">Ostir, Berges, Ottenbacher, Graham, &amp; Ottenbacher, 2008</xref>). However, in this study, motor function and depression scores were not likely to improve enough to affect cognitive function. Hence, if the intervention is implemented with the hope of improving cognitive function, some additional strategies may be necessary.</p>
<p>Second, a ceiling effect might have occurred, because we included participants who had relatively intact cognitive function. The mean MMSE-K scores were 28.25 in the experimental group and 25.80 in the control group, not significantly different from the normal range of similarly aged people (24.92 to 26.70; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773812439204">Park, 2005</xref>). In our participants, it may not be possible to increase cognitive function.</p>
<p>Even though there were positive effects from the intervention, there remain some limitations to be considered. First, the results are applicable only to patients who have sufficient cognitive function to understand the instructions and sufficient motor function to move by themselves to some degree. Our participants also had relatively intact cognitive function, based on MMSE-K scores and the ability to perform some everyday activities. Second, external validity might be low because of a novelty effect. That is, most of our participants had not previously experienced this kind of intervention; thus, the same results would not be guaranteed after a repeated intervention. Various strategies may need to be involved depending on the goal of the intervention. The novelty effect was likely one of the reasons that the participants did not report boredom even with a simple and repeated activity. Finally, all patients were scheduled to have an occupational or physical therapy for about an hour at the therapy room. We did not control the type of therapy that participants took regularly because we tried to include the relatively homogeneous participants in terms of outcome variables. However, this might limit the validity of the study. So we recommend collecting the data about the type of therapy to improve the validity of the study.</p>
<p>It was supposed that competition and reward made the intervention enjoyable and motivated participants to participate and practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1054773812439204">Weiner (1995)</xref> reported that enjoyment of a behavior requires an incentive or reward and that people engage in particular behaviors to experience enjoyment. Especially, in the case of low-interest tasks, rewards enhance free-choice intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812439204">Cameron, Banko, &amp; Pierce, 2001</xref>). However, this hypothesis may not be applicable to all participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1054773812439204">Reiss, 2005</xref>), in that competition and reward may be harmful to or undermine intrinsic motivation. Therefore, it is necessary to inform participants of the nature of the intervention and get their consent before performing it.</p>
<p>The intervention was developed and led by nurses. Nurses are the main medical staff who deal with patients and are the only ones who are with them for all day, know their status exactly, and have the knowledge and ability to cope with any emergency situation, as well as the ability to lead and manage other staff, patients, and family members. It is not recommended for nursing assistants or volunteers to lead intervention for inpatients, since they may not have the responsibility and ability to manage any untoward situations or accidents that may occur during the intervention.</p>
<p>Even though variables such as motor function and depression significantly improved in the experimental group, this may not be meaningful clinically enough to change or modify other therapy. Since the intervention was implemented only over a short period of time and the participants were in relatively good condition, it was not easy to achieve clinically significant levels of improvement. Although improvement was clinically insignificant, that is not a reason not to perform this kind of intervention. It was meaningful to perform intervention to promote movement or physical activity for stroke inpatients just for the reason that it reminded participants of the importance of movement or activity to manage various problems they experienced after their strokes.</p>
<p>Stroke inpatients typically have movement limitations to a certain degree when they are transferred to the rehabilitation units. However, it is not usual nursing practice to promote movement for inpatients at the rehabilitation unit. This study will be an example for the development of future practice and studies designed to provide and test nurse-led interventions for the inpatients at rehabilitation units. This study’s findings suggest that the intervention to promote movement or physical activity improves motor function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Using a nonsynchronized, nonequivalent control group pre- and post-test design, we investigated in poststroke inpatients with hemiparesis the effects of enjoyable nurse-led intervention promoting physical activity that focused on the movement of plegic limbs, looked like a game or play, and was implemented in a group. After 2 weeks of intervention, the motor function of the experimental group had improved. In addition, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression induced by movement limitation were reduced more in the experimental group than in the control group. Although these results were preliminary, it is recommended that enjoyable nurse-led interventions be developed and implemented for poststroke inpatients with hemiparesis. Because this kind of nursing intervention is safe and feasible in most units and can be designed to be enjoyable while using various strategies to obtain various goals, it is appropriate for the inpatients in rehabilitation units even if long-term positive effects are not guaranteed. Also, it is recommended to replicate this type of study at different sites and using a larger sample in order to validate the results and explore the feasibility.</p>
