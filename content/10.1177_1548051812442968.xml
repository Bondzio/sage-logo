<abstract>
<p>In this research, the authors present theoretical explanations for quantitative and qualitative types of changes to evaluate the malleability of general self-efficacy (GSE) and specific self-efficacy (SSE) measures due to domain-specific training. First, the authors hypothesize that the change in the GSE measure due to sales training is a quantitative mean-difference (alpha) change. Second, they hypothesize that the change in SSE due to sales training is a qualitative (beta or gamma) change. Results of latent variable cross-lagged analysis on sales trainee data (<italic>N</italic> = 417) support the authors’ hypothesis that the difference in GSE was quantitative. Findings also provide partial support of the second hypothesis that a change in a SSE measure was qualitative. The qualitative change is attributed to the novelty and complexity of the particular SSE tasks (i.e., direct selling). Additional analysis of rank-order consistency further validates the measures and demonstrates the GSE measure was consistent before and after training whereas the SSE scales were not as consistent. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Self-efficacy, which is most commonly defined as the belief that one can perform a task or set of behaviors successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1986</xref>), is positively related to a wide range of employee behaviors, learning outcomes, and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442968">Brown, Lent, Telander, &amp; Tramayne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen, Gully, &amp; Eden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442968">Gist, Schwoerer, &amp; Rosen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442968">Gist, Stevens, &amp; Bavetta, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442968">Harrison, Chadwick, &amp; Scales, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442968">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812442968">Salas &amp; Cannon-Bowers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812442968">Stajkovic &amp; Luthans, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442968">Tracey, Hinking, Tannenbaum, &amp; Mathieu, 2001</xref>). Consistent with the tenants of self-efficacy and social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442968">Gist &amp; Mitchell, 1992</xref>), empirical evidence suggests that training can be used to enhance self-efficacy related to a specific task, which will positively influence individual effectiveness to perform that task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812442968">Colquitt, LePine &amp; Noe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812442968">Eden, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442968">Eden &amp; Kinnar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442968">Gist et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442968">Haccoun &amp; Saks, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812442968">Mathieu, Martineau, &amp; Tannenbaum, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442968">Schmidt &amp; Ford, 2003</xref>). Thus, in general a high level of agreement exists among researchers regarding the importance of specific self-efficacy (SSE) related to its development and its effects on performance.</p>
<p>As individuals become more efficacious to perform specific tasks, their efficacy beliefs also “generalize” more broadly to other tasks and behaviors that are unrelated to the targeted domain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442968">Bandura, Adams, Hardy, &amp; Howells, 1980</xref>). This general self-efficacy (GSE) reflects one’s belief in his/her ability to succeed across situations. GSE is particularly useful in predicting behavior in new situations for which employees lack knowledge and prior experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442968">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>). Therefore, GSE is an important individual difference variable to understand in training contexts in which learners acquire knowledge and skills. Researchers have explored GSE as a moderator to examine differences on learning outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442968">Eden &amp; Kinnar, 1991</xref>), as a control variable to better assess the effects of independent variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442968">Davis, Fedor, Parsons, &amp; Herold, 2000</xref>), and as a dependent variable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer, May, Hollensbe, &amp; Mencl, 2005</xref>) in training contexts.</p>
<p>Based on our review of theory and findings we conclude some ambiguity related to the malleability of GSE and SSE and their measures due to training exists. First, GSE has been conceptualized and treated as a relatively stable dispositional characteristic in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442968">Gibbons &amp; Weingart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442968">Harrison et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812442968">Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442968">Weitlauf, Cervone, Smith, &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). However, this perspective is inconsistent with social learning theory that supports the malleability of GSE based on the global effects from the development of SSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Empirically, mean differences in pre- and posttraining measures have shown that GSE can be changed through training at statistically significant levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812442968">Eden &amp; Aviram, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). To reconcile theory with empirical findings, we address the following research question in the current study: “To what extent is GSE a malleable construct?”</p>
<p>A second issue concerns the evaluation of the changes in SSE as a result of training. Although it is a common practice to assess the difference in pre- and posttraining SSE by examining mean scale scores (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442968">Martocchio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442968">Weitlauf et al., 2001</xref>), we believe this approach is not accurate for determining SSE changes since learning can influence trainees’ perceptions of the task(s). This is especially true when the learner is initially unfamiliar with the task(s) addressed in training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442968">Gist &amp; Mitchell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812442968">Stevens &amp; Gist, 1997</xref>). Thus, an additional research question we explored in this study is the following: “To what extent can learning a task alter the way one judges his/her SSE?”</p>
<p>The purpose of this research was to answer these questions and clarify the types of change that can occur in GSE and SSE due to training. Using latent variable cross-lagged analysis, we examined the measurement equivalence of self-efficacy scales using pre- and posttraining measures to identify the type of change occurring as alpha (a quantitative change), beta (one form of qualitative change), or gamma (a second form of qualitative change). We support these findings by evaluating the rank-order consistency of GSE and SSE measures taken before and after training. We begin with a brief review of self-efficacy to understand the processes by which self-efficacy can be changed through training and explain the process for evaluating the changes empirically.</p>

<title>GSE, SSE, and Malleability</title>
<p>Self-efficacy is one mechanism that determines individuals’ motivation, affect, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1989</xref>). It forms the foundation of human agency through self-reflective processes for which individuals consider past experiences, personal capabilities, task requirements, and situational factors to make judgments regarding their expected future actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442968">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442968">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442968">2006</xref>). Qualities of a highly efficacious individual include choosing to assume somewhat challenging tasks, expending high levels of effort to achieve tasks, persevering when faced with obstacles, and remaining efficacious in the face of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442968">Bandura, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>At the most global level of generalization, researchers have studied GSE as a stable, personality-like variable referring to one’s belief of being capable to complete different tasks across a wide variety of situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442968">Harrison et al., 1996</xref>). As a trait-like personality characteristic, GSE is a “dynamic, multifaceted belief system that varies across different activity domains and under different situational demands” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1999</xref>, p. 193). Research findings show GSE positively influences a broad range of state-like characteristics (e.g., SSE), learning proficiency, and performance outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812442968">Chen, Gully, Whiteman, &amp; Kilcullen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442968">Harrison et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812442968">Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442968">Weitlauf et al., 2001</xref>). Individuals with high GSE will generalize their existing expectations of their abilities to perform tasks in new situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442968">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>). Related to training, individuals who possess a high level of GSE are more confident they will learn during training and are more confident they will perform the task well after training compared with those with a low level of GSE.</p>
<p>In contrast to a static personality trait that is not susceptible to immediate changes, GSE is a <italic>dynamic</italic> personality trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1999</xref>). Human capabilities that include intentionality, forethought, self-reactiveness, and self-reflectiveness allow each of us, as a human agent, to be an active participant in everything we do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442968">Bandura, 2006</xref>). Because of human agency, individuals develop, adapt, and reflect on past experiences such that those experiences change our beliefs about the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442968">Bandura, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442968">Markus &amp; Wurf, 1987</xref>). In particular, successful experiences have a cumulative effect on individuals’ self-perceptions that results in increases to GSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, rather than expect GSE to remain constant over time, such as before and after a training intervention, GSE should theoretically be somewhat malleable as published empirical findings have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442968">Bandura et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812442968">Eden &amp; Aviram, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). It is plausible that training targeted at one particular skill will affect self-efficacy at specific <italic>and</italic> general levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442968">Weitlauf et al., 2001</xref>). We expect the change in GSE due to training to be incremental since training will not likely cause a person to extensively alter their self-relevant beliefs such as GSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442968">Markus &amp; Kunda, 1986</xref>). Therefore, GSE should be malleable in subtle ways due to training, reflected by a quantitative change in pre- and posttraining scale scores.</p>
<p>In addition to the global self-efficacy construct that does not involve situational or task details, self-efficacy can be as specific as the task to be performed (Bandura, 1997, 1999). At the intermediate level of specificity, the focus is a related group of activities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442968">Agarwal, Sambamurthy, and Stair (2000)</xref> examined “computer self-efficacy,” which refers to one’s confidence to use information technology. At the highest level of specificity, the researchers examined “Windows 95 self-efficacy” and found a positive relationship between this SSE and trainees’ perceptions of “Windows 95 ease of use.” Other researchers examining SSE as a training outcome have demonstrated its positive effects on subsequent related task behaviors such as volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442968">Eden &amp; Kinnar, 1991</xref>) and negotiating skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442968">Gist et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812442968">Stevens &amp; Gist, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of self-efficacy’s positive influence on task performance, the development of self-efficacy may be included as a training objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812442968">Kozlowski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812442968">Luthans, Youssef, &amp; Avolio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812442968">Machin &amp; Fogarty, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442968">Schmidt &amp; Ford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). Training methods designed specifically to enhance learners’ self-efficacy incorporates sources of self-efficacy grounded in social learning theory including mastery experiences/performance accomplishments, vicarious/modeling experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442968">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Throughout the learning process these methods allow the learner to better understand the task, the task complexity, the task environment, his/her abilities to complete the task successfully, and the ways to perform the task differently than what she/he knew prior to training. These examples of cognitive “reframing,” which relates to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442968">Gist and Mitchell (1992)</xref> refer to as “information-processing issues,” provides theoretical support for why learners may view their SSE about a task in a way that is fundamentally and qualitatively different after training compared with before training.</p>
<p>Essentially, training methods consistent with the four sources of SSE development have the potential to provide knowledge and experiences to the extent that learners alter the way they perceive the task or their attributes related to completing the task. For example, methods should be designed to increase the amount of cognitive stimulation during training while learning new knowledge and skills. Increased mental stimulation through learning creates cognitive changes that significantly benefit individuals’ cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812442968">Marquie et al., 2010</xref>). Training should also help clarify expectations specific to a task through the information provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442968">Gist &amp; Mitchell, 1992</xref>). Clear expectations generate employee engagement related to the tasks as well as positive effects on performance and other work outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812442968">Harter, Schmidt, &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, training that details a specific process required to complete a task may demonstrate to a learner that a “common” task may actually be more complex or more novel than originally thought.</p>
<p>All these examples require an in-depth level of cognitive processing in the learner that is also likely to alter his/her judgments of SSE. Therefore, training interventions may be designed using methods that change a person’s perception of the task. Based on this view, we suggest that it is unrealistic to expect that a person’s judgment of SSE after training will be the same as the person’s judgment of SSE before the training. The resulting change in SSE takes place based on the level of information processing about the task, and we propose that this change can be qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. We expect the qualitative change to be more likely to occur as the level of information processing increases. In the following section, we present the types of quantitative and qualitative changes and formulate the study’s hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1548051812442968">
<title>Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Changes</title>
<p>An applicable typology of quantitative and qualitative changes specific to our expectations for GSE and SSE involves alpha, beta, and gamma changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812442968">Golembiewski, Billingsley, &amp; Yeager, 1976</xref>). Alpha change refers to the absolute change reflected in the mean difference of the scale scores across time—a quantitative type of change. Beta change is more complex than alpha change. It reflects the change in how individuals perceive the subjective metric of the scale score across points in time. In this case, trainees interpret the rating scale (e.g., <italic>slightly agree, agree, strongly agree</italic>) differently after the training than before the training, which is a qualitative change. Gamma change represents the highest level of qualitative change in which the meaning or the interpretation of an entire construct changes over time. An example of gamma change was identified in organizational research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442968">Thompson and Hunt (1996)</xref>. Their findings showed that employees reconceptualized overall job satisfaction due to job redesign efforts that occurred during organizational change; when new tasks were added to their jobs, their beliefs about their jobs and corresponding job satisfaction changed as well. Understanding alpha, beta, and gamma types of changes is especially important to the study of self-efficacy, since GSE and SSE are measured using self-report scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>These types of changes are determined empirically using latent variable cross-lagged analysis (through structural equation models) to assess the measurement equivalence of the pre- and posttraining measures. The process begins with the evaluation of gamma change. This is done by examining differences in the pattern of zero and nonzero factors loadings of the scale items between the pre- and postmeasures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442968">Millsap &amp; Hartog, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Self, 1993</xref>). When gamma change is present, no further analysis is necessary. However if no gamma change exists, then beta change is examined. Statistically, beta change occurs when the pattern of zero and nonzero factor loadings at the two points in time are the same, but differences are evident in the factor loadings and indicator intercepts. The third step, assessing alpha change, is performed if gamma and beta changes are not present. Alpha change exists if factor loadings and indicator intercepts remain constant over time but factor score means change significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Self, 1993</xref>). It is necessary to evaluate change in this order because quantitative change (alpha change) is only meaningful if no qualitative change has occurred (gamma or beta change). We apply the approach used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442968">Millsap &amp; Hartog, 1988</xref>) to assess the pre- and posttraining measures of GSE and SSE in order to identify types of changes occurring in each construct. Based on the theoretical discussion of GSE and SSE and the applicability of the types of changes, we offer two hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1548051812442968" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The difference between pre- and posttraining measures of GSE will be quantitative as alpha change.</p></list-item>

<title>GSE, SSE, and Consistency</title>
<p>Because a trait-like individual difference construct is relatively stable over time, the measure of a trait such as GSE before training should be consistent with the same measure taken after training. In contrast, state-like constructs such as SSE should be directly affected by training. As such, the measure of a state is likely to change in some way after a training intervention.</p>
<p>One way to determine the consistency of measures taken at two different time periods is to assess the rank-order of the respondents at each point in time. For a personality trait, the rank-order of the trainees’ scores at Time 1 should be consistent with the rank-order of the score taken at Time 2; this consistency is not expected for measures of state-like constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442968">Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000</xref>). This rank-order consistency assesses stability in personality traits using test–retest correlation coefficients and is conducted at the latent score level while controlling for measurement errors. Therefore, even though GSE is a dynamic personality characteristic that can be enhanced somewhat through training, the structure of GSE should be consistent over time as evidenced by a strong relationship between pre- and posttraining measures of GSE.</p>
<p>In contrast, as previously explained, SSE is expected to change qualitatively over time such that significantly predicting posttest scores from pretest scores is unlikely. Thus, to further demonstrate SSE is a state-like individual-level characteristic, we expect that it will not exhibit rank-order consistency, and the relationship between pre- and posttraining measures of SSE should be weak and nonsignificant. Stated as a hypothesis:</p>

<title>Design and Participants</title>
<p>To examine gamma, beta, and alpha change in GSE and SSE, we reanalyzed data collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al. (2005)</xref>. These researchers collected data through a field study of employees selling educational reference books and software. The training intervention consisted of a 5-day orientation and sales training workshop for all newly hired recruits. Training sessions focused on increasing work SSE; participants were taught task requirements and skills required to sell the products door-to-door in various locations across the United States. Training methods included lectures, video presentations, and simulations, as well as role-play activities involving modeling, practice, and feedback intended to enhance SSE. The design was consistent with social learning principles for enhancing SSE.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of training, a survey that included GSE, SSE, and demographic items was administered. After the 5 days of training, a posttest survey assessing the same variables was administered. Pre- and posttraining surveys were matched by participant, which resulted in a 75% response rate yielding a sample of 417 participants. The mean age of the participants was 20.10 years, and 60% were males. The majority were college sophomores or juniors (36% and 33% respectively), and the mean GPA for the sample was 3.07/4.00.</p>

<sec id="section6-1548051812442968">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>GSE was measured using the 17-item “General Self-Efficacy” scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442968">Sherer et al. (1982)</xref>. The items were measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Example items included “When I make plans, I am certain I can make them work,” “I give up on things before completing them” (reverse coded), and “I do not seem capable of dealing with most problems that come up in life” (reverse coded); all items are provided in a table and the factor analysis is described in the Results section. The internal reliability of the GSE scale at Time 1 was α = .87 and at Time 2 was α = .88, which is consistent with previous research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>, for a review of the measure).</p>
<p>Schwoerer and her colleagues developed 12 items for the sales training described above to measure what they called “Work-Specific Self-Efficacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). The items were based on the organization’s description of the skills and abilities required of the sales job and asked trainees to indicate the extent to which they felt confident in their ability to perform each of the tasks (7-point Likert-type scale, 1 = <italic>not at all confident</italic> to 7 = <italic>extremely confident</italic>). Items included “handling rejection,” “keeping business records,” and “doing precall preparation;” all items are provided in a table.</p>
<p>In the previous research for which the scale was developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>), no factor analysis was reported. Therefore, we analyzed the factor structure of the 12-item “Work SSE” scale to determine its validity. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we found that the data best fit a two-factor structure using 10 of the 12 items, and we labeled the factors Direct Sales Self-Efficacy (DSSE) and Sales Administration Self-Efficacy (SASE). The analysis, resulting scales, and interpretation of the factors are described in detail in the Results section. The alpha reliabilities at Time 1 and Time 2 were all within the acceptable range for organizational research (DSSE: T1 α = .87, T2 α = .76; SASE: T1 α = .84, T2 α = .82).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To examine the type of change resulting from the targeted training intervention, mean and covariance structures (MACS) analysis was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442968">Ployhart &amp; Oswald, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442968">Sörbom, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>).

<p>Gamma change is evaluated by examining the pattern of zero and nonzero factor loadings across time. To examine gamma change, identical configurations of fixed (at zero) and free factor loadings were estimated for pre- and posttraining efficacy in Step 1; this was done for GSE and SSE separately. If this baseline model does not fit, there is evidence for gamma change.</p>
<p>Provided the model in Step 1 is found to be adequate, nested submodels are compared to ascertain beta change and alpha change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442968">Stark, Chernyshenko, &amp; Drasgow, 2006</xref>). Thus, we then proceed to Step 2, where factor loadings for pre- and posttraining efficacy are constrained to be equal, with the pre- and posttraining vectors of latent means, κ and α, fixed at zero for identification purposes. A substantial decrement in fit from Step 1 to Step 2 indicates beta change. This is because the factor loadings are not equivalent across time; that is, there is no metric invariance and indicators are now differentially related to the construct of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>If invariance is found in Steps 1 and 2, then τ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and τ<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> can be constrained to be identical in Step 3. A substantial decrement in fit from Step 2 to Step 3 indicates a change in indicator intercepts, which is also indicative of beta change because it suggests that trainees have recalibrated the way they use the response scale. In other words, there is no scalar invariance or “systematic response bias” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>, p. 38). On the other hand, if this model fits reasonably well beta change is not present and differences in latent means are examined for evidence of alpha change at Step 4.</p>
<p>For repeated measures data, where the same individuals are assessed at both time points, it is usually necessary to allow error terms δ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and ϵ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for each observed indicator <italic>i</italic> to correlate across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442968">Ployhart &amp; Oswald, 2004</xref>).

</inline-formula> Large changes show that the nested model of interest is not comparable with the initial model.</p>
<p>Aside from comparing adjusted chi-squares to evaluate model differences, three categories of fit indices produced by LISREL were used to assess model–data fit. First, comparative fit indices were used to compare the hypothesized model with the independence model. These include the nonnormed fit index (NNFI; also known as the Tucker–Lewis index) and the comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442968">Bentler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812442968">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980</xref>). The closer these values are to 1.0, the better the model fit. Second, the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) value was examined; a value of .08 or less indicates good fit. Third, the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) value, which is a measure of the standardized difference between the observed and model-implied covariance, equal to or less than .08 indicates a good fit.</p>

<p>We examined beta change next. In Step 2, constraining the factor loadings to be equal across time did not substantially change the adjusted chi-square to degrees-of-freedom ratio. Thus, there was metric equivalence. In Step 3, further constraining the intercepts revealed scalar nonequivalence. Here, increases in indicator means for Item 1, “When I make plans, I am certain I can make them work,” and Item 11, “When unexpected problems occur, I don’t handle them well” (reverse scored), were observed at Time 2. Although this could be an effect of leniency bias rather than a substantive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442968">Ployhart &amp; Oswald, 2004</xref>), these general efficacy items seem that they could be related to sales training activities designed to build resilience in the sales trainees. Post hoc consideration that Item 1 is similar to SSE tasks of setting goals and keeping to a schedule and Item 11 is similar to the SSE task of handling rejection suggests the increase in indicator means on these GSE items may be a reflection of the training effects targeting work SSE. However, since the partial invariance scalar model with the intercepts for Items 1 and 11 free was not statistically different from the metric equivalence model, insufficient evidence for beta change was present. Lack of beta change warranted an evaluation of alpha change.</p>
<p>A comparison of the latent means in Step 4 revealed that GSE increased over time. This difference demonstrated that the change in GSE was an alpha change in which a quantitative shift occurred, providing support for Hypothesis 1. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1548051812442968">Table 3</xref> shows a summary of the GSE MACS analysis.</p>

<sec id="section11-1548051812442968">
<title>SSE Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Change Results</title>
<p>In the original analysis of this data, all SSE items were presumed to load on one factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). When we attempted to fit a one-factor model to the Time 1 covariance matrix for these items, the data resulted in a poor fit of the model. Therefore, an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to assess the latent structure of the SSE scale at Time 1. An examination of the scree plot revealed that a two-factor solution of the Time 1 SSE measure was more appropriate. Items that loaded on the first factor were closely related to direct sales tasks; we refer to this measure as Direct Sales Self-Efficacy (DSSE). Items that loaded on the second factor were specific to the administrative tasks associated with the sales job; we call this measure Sales Administration Self-Efficacy (SASE). Factor loadings are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1548051812442968">Table 4</xref>. To determine the fixed (at zero) and free factor loadings, the exploratory factor analysis solution for Time 1 was used in the subsequent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Relatively higher factor loadings were not constrained to zero; these factor loadings are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1548051812442968">Table 4</xref> in bold font. The modification indices for the CFA model of the Time 1 measure revealed that Item 4, “Pre-call preparation,” and Item 5, “Making a presentation,” loaded on both the DSSE and the SASE factors. Because this resulted in poor statistical fit, the two items were excluded from subsequent analyses. The revised 10-item model fit the data at Time 1 well. Tests of the 10-item model at Time 2 also showed good statistical fit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1548051812442968">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>The MACS analysis statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1548051812442968">Table 5</xref>. In Step 1 of the MACS analysis, the 10-item scale was used to examine the free baseline model. Initially, cross-paths (i.e., the path from Time 1 DSSE to Time 2 SASE, and the path from Time 1 SASE to Time 2 DSSE) were estimated as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051812442968">Figure 1</xref>. However, the path coefficients were close to zero and there was no significant difference between the model with cross-paths constrained to zero and the initial model. This means that one facet of SSE does not predict the other facet. All fit indices showed reasonably good fit. Hence, this baseline model showed that there was little gamma change because the same factor pattern held across Time 1 and Time 2. This baseline model was next used for evaluating beta and alpha changes.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548051812442968-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>In Step 2, constraining all of the factor loadings yielded a statistically significant change as compared with the baseline model with no cross-paths. To determine which loadings to free, we examined the estimated loadings for the initial free baseline model without cross-paths. The unstandardized loadings across time for DSSE appear to be different from loadings across time for SASE. Thus, all item loadings on the DSSE factor were freed across time, while loadings on the SASE factor were fixed as equal across time. However, this model was still significantly different from the baseline model. We found that additionally freeing Item 6, “Finding a place to live,” on the SASE factor gave rise to a nonsignificantly different model.</p>
<p>All loadings were different for the DSSE factor at Time 2 compared with Time 1, which demonstrated that beta change occurred in this measure. Although not explicitly considered in our initial hypothesis, it appears that the sales training resulted in a reduced relationship between the direct selling factor and the propensity of endorsing the scale items. In part, this may be due to a more accurate perspective on the realities of direct sales tasks at Time 2 compared with perceptions assessed at Time 1. The indicators representing direct sales tasks have become differentiated due to training and hence are less correlated. (We note that metric equivalence is a prerequisite for testing scalar invariance, or the equivalence of indicator intercepts across time. So although Step 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1548051812442968">Table 5</xref> shows that indicator intercepts could be constrained as equal for this factor, the change in loadings nevertheless depicts beta change.)</p>
<p>In contrast, there appears that beta change was not evident in the SASE factor. This is because in Steps 2 and 3, all factor loadings and indicator intercepts could be constrained as equal across time, with the exception of Item 6, “Finding a place to live.” It is likely that participants were more confident of finding a place to live due to the sales training; however, college students generally have experience with this type of task.</p>
<p>Finally, Step 4 shows that the latent means for SASE increased across time, indicating that alpha change occurred in the SASE measure. Since we determined the change in DSSE to be beta change, interpreting the shift in the latent mean is not accurate. Hypothesis 2 is partially supported by the qualitative change that occurred for the DSSE measure.</p>

<title>Rank-Order Consistency Results</title>
<p>Rank-order consistency is determined by regressing the posttraining SSE measures and the GSE measure on the pretraining SSE measures and the GSE measure, respectively. Significant pathways indicate consistency in the relative standing of individuals through training. We hypothesized that GSE would exhibit stronger rank-order consistency across time due to its trait-like nature as compared with SSE factors (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548051812442968">Figure 2</xref>). To examine the extent to which the rank-order of GSE and SSE were consistent over time, an MACS analysis modeling GSE and SSE factors together was conducted. We used the constraints on the factor loadings and indicator intercepts from the preceding analyses because these fit the data well across time. The pretraining latent means of GSE and SSE factors were fixed at 0 to identify the model, but the posttraining latent means were freely estimated. This larger model fit the data well (NNFI = .97; CFI = .97; RMSEA = .044; SRMR = .059).</p>

<p>Each self-efficacy construct at Time 1 directly predicted the corresponding self-construct. For example, Time 1 DSSE was related to Time 2 DSSE, but Time 1 DSSE was not related to Time 2 SASE or Time 2 GSE. This correspondence reflects the consistency of individual rank-orderings on each construct across time. The standardized relationship between GSE across time (.80) is substantially larger than DSSE (.14) and SASE (.25), providing evidence that the GSE measure is more consistent across time compared to SSE. Hypothesis 3 was supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Past research on GSE and SSE has found that training affects the mean levels of both GSE and SSE, suggesting that GSE is as malleable as SSE despite GSE’s conceptualization as a trait. Our study addressed this issue and demonstrated the importance of delineating possible construct change types within the gamma, beta, and alpha change framework. In this research, we also sought to clarify self-efficacy theory by explaining why GSE is a malleable construct and by investigating the ways in which GSE and SSE are malleable due to learning. First, we justified that GSE is a <italic>dynamic</italic> trait-like construct that may be positively influenced by training. Importantly, this research clarifies a long-standing puzzle as to why GSE is malleable in training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). Given the nature of GSE as a broader, dispositional construct, we showed that its epistemic definition, demonstrated by the relationship of the scale indicators to the underlying construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442968">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>), was not affected by training even though mean scores were. Therefore, GSE is an important consideration for workplace motivation as jobs become increasingly complex and challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>), and GSE should be considered a relevant training outcome that is applicable to all employees. Being able to enhance self-efficacy at a global level is especially valuable since employees must learn to meet continually changing work demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442968">Bandura, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we provided empirical evidence to support the claim that SSE can change qualitatively over time due to training. This finding is consistent with the theoretical explanation of information processing that occurs during training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442968">Gist &amp; Mitchell, 1992</xref>). More specifically, individuals are likely to change the way they think about their self-efficacy on work-related tasks because of what they learn in training and how they learn it. Our interpretation of the change in DSSE as beta change and the change in SASE as alpha change suggests that individuals alter their cognitions differently during the learning process for tasks that are novel and complex than for tasks that are familiar. In the case of DSSE, the sales trainees learned what the direct sales tasks were and how to complete them through information, modeling, and practice. The sales trainees were college students who were not likely to have prior knowledge or experience of the direct sales tasks of selling reference materials door to door. In contrast, the sales trainees were more likely to have some knowledge of the administrative types of tasks such as keeping records and completing forms that are generalizable to other contexts. The manner that DSSE cognitions were influenced during training is further substantiated by the learning experience. Specifically, trainees participated in role play practice that focused on direct sales tasks to provide them with mastery experience giving demonstrations.</p>
<p>Empirically, the factor loadings of the Time 2 DSSE items significantly decreased from the Time 1 measure, which was a consequence of lowered interrelationships between indicators. In addition, because of the qualitative type of change, the mean difference for DSSE is not directly interpretable as was implied by the previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). Given this finding, we cannot make the inference that individuals’ DSSE increased due to training. However, we can say with more certainty that the training changed the way the learners thought about their responses to the DSSE items, and the Time 2 measure of DSSE is the most accurate self-assessment. As such, the finding implies that measuring pretraining SSE may be irrelevant to training outcomes and supports reasoning for including SSE as an outcome measure after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442968">Haccoun &amp; Saks, 1998</xref>). The latter point is especially important since posttraining SSE is a good predictor of performance results.</p>
<p>The standardized predictive relationships between the latent constructs focused on rank-order consistency to determine whether the constructs were similar across time. It should be noted that the results of the construct rank-order in this research hold where alpha change has occurred, which supports the use of the GSE measure to determine mean levels of change over time and due to training.</p>
<sec id="section14-1548051812442968">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Several strengths are present in this research study. First, we provided theoretical justification for mean-level increases in GSE that previous research had identified empirically. Because GSE is a dynamic trait that is based on the accumulation of successful experiences, GSE is expected to increase due to successful training programs. Second, we provided a different lens to examine changes in self-efficacy measures over time. This perspective broadens the theoretical framework for developing and modifying self-efficacy by demonstrating that learning affects perception, which is a qualitative change. Empirically, understanding gamma and beta changes in addition to alpha change helps inform the practice of measuring self-efficacy, discussed below. Third, the statistical analysis provided the mechanism to validate the SSE items that had been used previously. Our findings showed that a two-factor model of the 10-item scale fit the data better than the one-factor, 12-item scale reported initially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442968">Schwoerer et al., 2005</xref>). Fourth, we were able to use a large sample size for the study. A sample size of 400 has been found to provide high power and precision of factor analytic estimates when testing for measurement invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812442968">Meade &amp; Bauer, 2007</xref>), and our sample size was 417.</p>
<p>A limitation of the research that was beyond our control was that we were working with data from a previous study. A primary concern regarding this issue was use of the GSE scale in the research. Specifically, other researchers have modified the 17-item GSE measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442968">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>) to use because of validity issues such as multidimensionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Fortunately, in our research, we found that a one-factor model fit the data well and reliability of the scale was good. However, our analysis also revealed that two GSE items may have been similar to SSE items. Had Schwoerer and her colleagues used a more recent and more valid scale such as the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>), we would be able to draw conclusions with a greater degree of certainty and the results would be more applicable to research that incorporates the new scale. An additional concern with using existing research for this study was the SSE measure. The measure would be more valid if the scale had been pretested prior to the administration for the full sample of sales employees.</p>
<p>In addition, the ability to generalize the findings to other studies of SSE and to other populations of employees is limited because of the highly specific type of job for which the training was conducted. However, we believe that the study is meaningful for researchers investigating SSE to understand the nature of the change that can occur based on the study and to explore mechanisms for which qualitative changes are likely.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice and Research</title>
<p>Organizational implications of the research include the ability to enhance GSE by using training methods targeted at increasing SSE and the measurement of GSE and SSE. First, GSE should be an important outcome of any training program. As individuals develop types of SSE through various training interventions, the effects will accumulate to positively influence their GSE as well. As GSE increases, individuals will believe they can be more successful across situations, and will be more motivated to perform various tasks.</p>
<p>A second implication is that training interventions targeting work-related SSE or other domain-specific attitudes may result in changing the “criterion space” of the scales. In this study, the subjective metric changed substantially on DSSE as a consequence of the intervention’s aim to improve the participant’s ability to engage in direct sales. Notably, some interventions aim not merely to exert a directional push in attitude but to change a root idea substantially or to introduce new information that amends the intrinsic attitudinal structure. Therefore, analysis of training evaluations are needed that can account for qualitative changes in attitudinal training outcomes assessed by examining gamma and beta changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442968">Terborg, Howard, &amp; Maxwell, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442968">Thompson &amp; Hunt, 1996</xref>). Human resource development (HRD) professionals can be trained to measure and evaluate qualitative changes in addition to traditional quantitative changes, particularly when pre- and posttraining measures are used.</p>
<p>Several areas for future research arise from this study. As mentioned above, researchers can use the gamma, beta, and alpha framework in addition to the rank-order consistency approach to determine the consistency of the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442968">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the change in GSE could be examined using a more distant time period between pre- and posttraining assessments to provide insight on the permanence of GSE’s quantitative malleability. Studying different types of SSE and the measures used to assess them to determine the presence and extent of qualitative changes will contribute to the self-efficacy literature. That research will be further complemented by exploring individual and contextual mechanisms causing the changes. We also encourage researchers who study other “self” concepts to examine those measures using the gamma, beta, and alpha change framework.</p>
<p>The results of the analyses provided and discussed in this research demonstrate the importance of examining the type of change that occurs in training and other research or evaluation contexts in which change is assessed. For example, where no statistically significant mean differences are found, qualitative changes may still occur. Similarly, mean differences may be established using statistical testing, though the meaning of the construct may differ and the nature of the change may be misunderstood. Thus, conceptual and empirical attention to alpha, beta, and gamma changes that could occur because of training offers the potential to provide more complete information about training goals and objectives through evaluation. Such information, in turn, could inform training improvement efforts and other human resource development training investment decisions.</p>
