<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Network researchers have viewed social relations as underlying the diffusion of ideas among individuals or firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012470408">Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012470408">Coleman et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012470408">Michaelson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012470408">Valente, 1996</xref>). The assumption underlying this stream of research is that ideas in question are difficult to evaluate and that individuals rely on the opinions of others before forming their own. In other words, social relations influence individual attitudes toward new ideas. Accordingly, the diffusion of new ideas may depend on the extent to which different individuals or firms are connected through social relations. Influence by others further suggests that a few individuals, such as opinion leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012470408">Burt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012470408">Katz, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012470408">Valente, 1995</xref>) and network brokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012470408">Watts, 1999</xref>), perform an important role in the diffusion of ideas.</p>
<p>While network researchers have developed various models of social relations as to the diffusion of ideas, however, two issues remain unresolved. First, local acceptance precedes global diffusion. When a person presents an idea, his or her neighbors are likely to be the first evaluators, and subsequently the first adopters, of that idea. However, if the neighbors choose to ignore the idea, it would vanish unnoticed. Such an idea, then, fails to have a chance to reach opinion leaders or network brokers, the influential individuals who could advocate the idea to the rest of a community (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1978</xref>). However, researchers have largely ignored the pivotal role of the first adopters in the diffusion of ideas.</p>
<p>Second, an individual may not be influenced by others when he or she accesses simple ideas (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012470408">Rogers, 2003</xref>). In this case, individuals who are well informed may evaluate and adopt such ideas independently, an ideal situation presumed by the classical models of economics. Indeed, the growth of information technology (IT) opens up new ways of spreading ideas quickly, such as online communications, and leads to virtually cost-free information access. If so, everyone is able to access the source of information directly, without relying on social relations to access and evaluate novel ideas. However, this logic runs counter to the research on social influence by others.</p>
<p>This study examines the role of the first adopters in the diffusion of ideas that are easy to evaluate. To this end, we draw on the diffusion events of individual blog-posts in an online social community commercially managed by NHN Corp., a leading internet company in South Korea, from 1 June to 30 June 2006. In this study, we show that the diffusion of an idea is associated with both the strength and structure of social relations around the source; that is, the originator of the idea. Specifically, it is likely to diffuse to remote contacts through social relations under the following conditions: (1) the proportion of strong ties held by the source increases or (2) the social relations surrounding the source become dense.</p>
<p>This study contributes to the literature by identifying conditions that encourage the spread of simple ideas to a wider audience. First, our findings show that the neighbors of the source; that is, the first adopters, play a pivotal role in the online diffusion of simple ideas. In particular, it implies that information that is validated and supported early on by a cohesive group is likely to diffuse to remote contacts. Second, our results also suggest that individuals well equipped with IT are plagued by a plethora of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012470408">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012470408">O’Reilly, 1980</xref>). Accordingly, most ideas remain unnoticed not because they are inaccessible but because there is just too much information. This study thus suggests that social relations serve as filters that select a particular set of ideas among all those available to individuals and help diffuse them across individuals.</p>

<title>Long-distance diffusion of ideas</title>
<p>The sharing of ideas takes two distinct forms. One form is the direct transfer of ideas from the source to the target, for example, public announcement. The other form is the indirect transfer of ideas that involves multiple intermediaries between the source and the target. For the successful sharing of ideas, the direct transfer is concerned with the way that the dyadic exchange of ideas takes place, whereas the latter is concerned with the extent to which ideas spread to remote contacts via intermediaries. For the purpose of discussion, we refer to the first case as short-distance diffusion and the second case as long-distance diffusion. Unless there is direct access to the source, a large-scale sharing of ideas occurs typically through long-distance diffusion. Therefore, the focus of the research is on what determines the extent to which ideas diffuse to remote contacts.</p>
<p>Network researchers have viewed the structure of interpersonal relations as an important factor that facilitates the long-distance diffusion of ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012470408">Burt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012470408">Coleman et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012470408">Friedkin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012470408">Strang and Soule, 1998</xref>). They observe that social relations may exert influence over individual attitudes toward new ideas. The reasons are as follows: first, when a person alone is unable to verify an idea, one may rely on the opinions of others regarding the idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012470408">Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012470408">Erickson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012470408">Menzel and Katz, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012470408">Strang and Macy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012470408">Valente, 1996</xref>) and second, access to an idea itself is either costly or infeasible so that a person relies on his or her friends who know of the idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012470408">Burt, 1992</xref>). From these two conditions—that is, verification difficulty and access cost, it follows that who we know will determine what we know and that the diffusion of new ideas may depend on the extent to which different individuals are connected through social relations—that is, the structure of interpersonal relations.</p>
<p>For example, a two-step flow of idea diffusion suggests that when ideas are difficult to evaluate, individuals rely on important others; that is, opinion leaders, who decide whether to advocate ideas to others and that the diffusion of ideas thus depends on social influence by opinion leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012470408">Burt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012470408">Katz, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012470408">Valente, 1995</xref>). From a network perspective, it implies that knowledge diffuses widely once opinion leaders are well connected to the rest of a community.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter’s (1973)</xref> Weak Ties model suggests that network brokers or network bridges—relationships between otherwise disconnected contacts—may facilitate the diffusion of ideas by sufficiently connecting dissimilar individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012470408">Watts, 1999</xref>). The model draws on an established tendency, namely, homophily, which states that similar people get to know each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012470408">Cartwright and Harary, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012470408">Davis, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012470408">McPherson et al., 2001</xref>). Such similarity includes task-related knowledge, demographic backgrounds, and personal tastes. Given homophily, the diffusion of ideas through social relations may not lead to a large number of adopters. The reason is that while similar individuals build strong ties between each other, that is, friends, there will be no relation at all between them and dissimilar others. Accordingly, social influence may not have an effect on dissimilar others. Instead, ideas diffuse only to friends and are localized.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter (1973)</xref> suggested that knowledge may diffuse to the rest of the community only when dissimilar others connect to one another. He pointed to network brokers who develop weak ties to others as a candidate for bridging dissimilar others. Weak ties refer to social relations whose duration is short, interactions are infrequent, or emotional attachment is low. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012470408">Watts (1999)</xref> further demonstrated that only a few network brokers suffice to diffuse information across dissimilar individuals.</p>
<p>Whether opinion leaders or network brokers expedite the diffusion of ideas, influence by others posits that a few influential individuals outweigh others in idea diffusion with respect to their ability to influence others. It is because they shrink substantially the number of intermediaries that stand between the source of an idea and its potential adopters. When one seeks to spread his or her ideas to unknown persons, he or she needs to rely on many intermediaries with whom he or she does not have direct connections. Diffusion that involves many intermediaries may be slow and disappear unnoticed. In contrast, ideas endorsed by influential individuals may spread successfully to remote contacts. They do so because opinion leaders have more direct contacts than the average person, and network brokers connect those who rarely interact with one another. Hence, information that reaches influential individuals such as opinion leaders and network brokers is likely to travel easily beyond a closed circle of friends. Without influential individuals, diffusion may not proceed on a large scale.</p>
<sec id="section3-1476127012470408">
<title>The influence of the originator’s network</title>
<p>While various models of social relations are presented as to the diffusion of ideas, researchers with an emphasis of a few influential individuals have been silent on how diffusion events came about in the first place. This neglect presumes that early adopters of ideas have little, if any, effect on the large-scale diffusion of ideas across individuals. However, early adopters play their own roles in a limited way; they are able to preclude the diffusion of ideas by not advocating them to their neighbors. When ideas fail to remain active, they are less likely to attract attention from influential individuals. If so, they may not spread widely across individuals. In other words, the global diffusion of ideas calls for the local acceptance of them in the first place.</p>
<p>Hence, the diffusion of ideas involves two distinct types of individuals: initial contacts and subsequent contacts. The initial contacts refer to those who select an idea first and introduce it to the rest of the community. Without the working of the initial contacts, ideas proposed by originators remain unnoticed by the crowd (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1978</xref>). However, the subsequent contacts refer to those who indirectly learn about an idea from the initial contacts or other subsequent contacts.</p>
<p>Influential individuals are typically the subsequent contacts unless the idea originator is directly connected to them. In this regard, existing models of social influence focus on a few influential individuals over the initial contacts. The influential may help to expose the idea to a larger set of subsequent contacts and thus increase the chance of it being diffused widely. Nonetheless, the initial contacts may perform a pivotal role in the diffusion of ideas under the following two conditions.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned above, the initial contacts themselves are influential individuals. For example, when the initial contacts are network brokers, an idea that passes the first selection stage is likely to have a better chance to diffuse widely into the rest of the community. This is a rather trivial case.</p>
<p>Second, the initial contacts may gain their importance as the influential lose their ability to affect other subsequent contacts. This is likely to occur when ideas are easy to access and evaluate so that the subsequent contacts are able to make informed decisions without consulting the influential. Indeed, IT allows ideas to be accessible at a minimal cost. With one click, experts’ opinions are readily available from the Internet. Furthermore, individuals can bypass experts and access relevant information directly. Ideas that are simple and readily available thus render the influential to lose their avowed prestige over the course of idea diffusion.</p>
<p>However, one may go further and give a counterargument that for the same reason, idea diffusion no longer requires social influence; that is, owing to IT, both the influential and the initial contacts lose their importance in the diffusion of ideas. Rather, individuals capable of processing available information will make informed and thus rational decisions independently. Accordingly, short-distance diffusion may prevail.</p>
<p>One issue with this counterargument lies in its implicit and tenuous assumption that individuals have sufficient capacities to process information. The literature suggests otherwise. Individuals are constrained by well-documented cognitive limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012470408">Simon, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012470408">Tversky and Kahneman, 1974</xref>). Such cognitive limitations hinder independent decision making. For example, information released by a large number of experts and available at a low cost poses a new problem—individuals are plagued by information overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012470408">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012470408">O’Reilly, 1980</xref>). That is why managers are increasingly concerned with soliciting attention from consumers who are already overwhelmed by a plethora of information (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012470408">Hayes, 2008</xref>). In this regard, most ideas remain unnoticed not because they are inaccessible but because there is just too much information available to choose from.</p>
<p>Owing to cognitive limitations, initial contacts, especially close contacts, may continue to have a pivotal role in idea diffusion even when ideas are readily available and easy to evaluate. This is what we refer to as the condition of <italic>information abundance</italic>. The reasons are as follows.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned earlier, initial contacts serve to screen ideas available to the subsequent contacts. This screening function becomes valuable under information overload because only a few ideas receive attention from individuals and thus a majority of the ideas are short lived. Ideas that are warmly accepted by the initial contacts are likely to remain alive long enough to attract attention from the subsequent contacts.</p>
<p>Second, the initial contacts that are strongly tied to the idea originator—that is, friends—are more likely than the weakly tied ones—that is, acquaintances—to advocate the originators’ ideas to the subsequent contacts. As mentioned above, individuals of similar preferences and demographics are likely to develop social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012470408">Louch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012470408">McPherson et al., 2001</xref>). Given homophily-induced social relations, friends—that is, strongly tied partners—are likely to exhibit similar preferences and attitudes over an idea. Moreover, these partners may want to avoid a divergent opinion over an idea, which leads to cognitive dissonance, a psychological state that each individual is motivated to minimize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012470408">Davis, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012470408">Heider, 1946</xref>). Hence, the originator’s ideas are more positively evaluated and selected by his or her strongly tied partners than strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012470408">Bian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012470408">Borgatti and Cross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012470408">Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012470408">Levin and Cross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012470408">Szulanski, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, through strong ties, ideas are likely to diffuse to remote contacts without being distorted. Socially close contacts tend to interact frequently and intensively so that they serve as conduits for the reliable and voluminous flow of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012470408">Aral and Van Alstyne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012470408">Centola and Macy, 2007</xref>). This exchange of information allows each party to attend quickly to new ideas endorsed by the other. When the originator’s idea is quickly and positively adopted by his or her close friends, whose friends in turn select this idea quickly, the idea spreads rapidly through a chain of strong ties. One downside to the diffusion of ideas through strong ties is that such ties are costly to maintain, thereby aggravating the cost of information access through strong ties. Yet, under the information abundance condition, the access cost may not impede the diffusion of ideas. Hence, the diffusion of simple ideas available at a trivial cost is likely to take place through the initial contacts that are strongly tied to the idea originator.</p>
<list id="list1-1476127012470408" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>. Under the condition of information abundance, an idea is likely to diffuse to remote contacts as the proportion of strong ties held by the idea originator increases.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>One implication of H1 is that under the condition of information abundance, the initiators of global diffusion are not necessarily opinion leaders or special individuals, as commonly assumed by the two-step flow of diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012470408">Katz, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012470408">Valente, 1995</xref>). Rather, the hypothesis emphasizes simple friendships; that is, strongly tied partners who introduce one’s idea to the rest of the community. In this regard, the implication of H1 is compatible with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012470408">Watts and Dodds’ (2007)</xref> study, which shows that the presence of easily influenced initial contacts is sufficient for successful diffusion.</p>
<p>From a network structure perspective, strong ties depicted by H1 have the following counterpart: the density of the originator’s network. Both structural balance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012470408">Burt and Knez, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012470408">Cartwright and Harary, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012470408">Davis, 1963</xref>) and homophily in social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012470408">McPherson et al., 2001</xref>) indicate that two parties are likely to develop strong ties when they share the common third party. In other words, the three strongly tied partners tend to form dense networks or network closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012470408">Coleman, 1988</xref>). Hence, the effects of strong ties are equally applicable to dense networks; that is, the originator embedded in densely connected social relations is in a better position to diffuse his or her ideas.</p>
<p>Besides, network density also serves to filter ideas while alleviating information overload that afflicts individuals. When one of the originator’s direct contacts pays attention to an idea, network density helps amplify the exposure of a given idea to the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012470408">Aral and Van Alstyne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012470408">Burt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012470408">Coleman, 1988</xref>). Suppose a network consists of three people, the originator, and his or her contacts <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, all of whom are friends. Suppose also that contact <italic>A</italic> knows of the originator’s idea and finds it interesting. When contact <italic>A</italic> finds his or her friend, contact <italic>B</italic>, endorses the idea, at least he or she feels that the idea is popular among his or her friends. Such a repeated exposure to an idea underlies a positive attitude toward it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012470408">Gigerenzer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012470408">Zajonc, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, ideas circulating in a dense network remain active longer than those in a sparse network. Given ideas that are short lived, the process of diffusion requires a group of advocates to repeatedly mention a given idea in order to keep it active, especially when the majority of others are ignorant of the idea. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012470408">Burt (1992)</xref> noted, individuals in a dense network are repeatedly exposed to the same ideas. While they do not necessarily agree, at least they remember the ideas and tell others about them. Network density is thus viewed as a tool for preserving the original idea in the course of diffusion that involves many intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012470408">Bae and Koo, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Both H1 and H2 posit that the structure and strength of the originator’s ego network determines the likelihood of his or her idea spreading throughout a community. However, the sharing of ideas between the originator and his or her initial contacts alone does not necessarily guarantee global diffusion of his or her ideas. This requires that the originator’s ideas move beyond the members of his or her ego network and flow into the subsequent contacts.</p>
<p>One question that naturally arises from H1 is whether strong ties are conducive to global diffusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter (1973)</xref>’s Weak Ties model may shed light on this question. This model posits that network bridges help amplify the exposure of an idea to a large number of subsequent contacts. This implies that when the originator’s strong ties are network bridges, his or her idea is likely to diffuse successfully. Yet, the Weak Ties model also suggests that network bridges should consist of weak ties; that is, the relationship between individuals who interact infrequently with one another; it precludes the possibility that in the presence of homophily, network bridges are strong ties, namely, the forbidden triad, by pointing to the tendency that a person’s close friends are likely to be friends with each other as well. If so, idea diffusion through strong ties appears to be incompatible with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter (1973)</xref>’s Weak Ties model.</p>
<p>However, organizational scholars have long recognized that individuals in a contemporary society tend to maintain nonoverlapping friendship. With the concept of partial inclusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476127012470408">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978</xref>: 29–32) acknowledged that a person can have multiple memberships, for example, one within a group and one outside the group. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012470408">Simmel (1955</xref>: 138) also noted that a key feature of modern life is an individual’s ability to maintain multiple, nonoverlapping memberships. To the extent that the interests of individuals are diverse, it is possible for a person to belong to two different social groups whose interests differ from each other and whose members do not overlap. If this is the case, strongly tied bridges may not be infrequent. The forbidden triad is then not forbidden.</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012470408">Burt (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012470408">Lin (2001)</xref> observed that weak ties are simply surrogates for network bridges, downplaying the role of tie strength. Several researchers have also observed that strongly tied bridges are more effective than weakly tied ones under certain circumstances. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012470408">Bian (1997)</xref> distinguished between information and opinions, showing that while weakly tied bridges diffuse information effectively, strongly tied bridges transfer opinions effectively. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012470408">Carpenter et al. (2003</xref>: 421) even found that strongly tied bridges convey more information than weakly tied ones.</p>
<p>Another reason for strongly tied bridges is the stability of network structure. In understanding the Weak Ties model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012470408">Burt (1992)</xref> uncovered the important issue that social relations are costly to maintain. Network bridges are efficient structures because just a few substantially reduce the social distance between otherwise disconnected contacts; that is, the number of intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012470408">Watts, 1999</xref>). Yet, the downside to the network bridges that consist mainly of weak ties is that these network structures are unstable and thus is the diffusion of ideas. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012470408">Aral and Van Alstyne (2011)</xref> showed that the volume of ideas flowing through network bridges is smaller than that of strong and cohesive ties, indicating that network bridges are not an effective carrier of ideas. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012470408">Centola and Macy (2007)</xref> showed that idea diffusion via network bridges is unstable when complex ideas diffuse through social relations. Insofar as strong ties are conduits for the reliable and voluminous flow of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012470408">Aral and Van Alstyne, 2011</xref>), strongly tied bridges will be a stable yet inefficient media for idea diffusion. To the extent that the costs of maintaining and learning from social relations are negligible, however, it is more likely that ideas diffuse through stable channels rather than efficient channels. Hence, the diffusion of ideas is likely to take place through strongly tied bridges. Taken together, we expect the following.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>H3</italic>. Under the condition of information abundance, an idea is likely to diffuse to remote contacts when the ego network density of the idea originator is low and the proportion of strong ties held by the idea originator is high.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Under the condition of information abundance, ideas compete for attention so that the initial contacts of the originator perform an important role in the course of diffusion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012470408">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this. Verification difficulty refers to the ease of evaluating an idea. When an idea is simple, verification difficulty is low. The <italic>x</italic>-axis refers to the cost of accessing a given idea. When the originator has a star-like ego network and is directly connected to all the subsequent contacts, the diffusion of ideas is a simple process of transferring an idea to the originator’s direct contacts. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012470408">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the two types of long-distance diffusion, where a group of people introduces an idea to another group, which in turn redistributes the idea to other groups and so on. Diffusion via small world networks draws on the influential network brokers. Their ability to spread ideas to remote contacts lies in the role of the influential to shrink the number of intermediaries between the source and the potential adopters. In comparison, diffusion via strong ties depends greatly on the initial contacts, who pay selective attention to ideas and keep them alive before the subsequent contacts give attention to the ideas. Our discussion suggests that under the information abundance condition, a large-scale diffusion is likely to be mediated through strong ties.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, one corollary to H3 is that idea diffusion will be successful as the ego network of the originator becomes dense yet the proportion of strong ties decreases. Taken together with H2, this lends a direct support to the Weak Ties model such that a cohesive group is useful for the online diffusion of ideas when it is mingled with weak ties.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section5-1476127012470408">
<title>Data</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses, we assembled data from the diffusions of individual blog-posts in an online social community commercially managed by NHN Corp., a leading Internet company in South Korea over a one-month period from 1 June to 30 June 2006. According to the survey of Businessweek, released on 2 June 2008, NHN ranked 27 among top 100 IT companies worldwide. We chose these diffusions across online social networks for the following reasons.</p>
<p>First, online social networks have served as a burgeoning platform in which individual knowledge is transformed into collective knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012470408">Constant et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012470408">Fulk and DeSanctis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012470408">Wellman et al., 1996</xref>). In particular, blogging has become a popular way of transferring knowledge through the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012470408">Kumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012470408">Nardi et al., 2004</xref>). The data may represent an increasingly important information channel available to organizations as well as individuals.</p>
<p>Second, the sharing of ideas is objectively observed. Unlike the adoption of behavior, the sharing of ideas often does not leave any trace. Yet, the data on blog-posts offer an objective way to identify the sharing of ideas between individuals: scrap. A service called “scrap” is frequently used among bloggers to move the blog post of someone else to one’s own blog. Once a new post is created, it diffuses across blogs through the scraping behavior of bloggers. A blogger’s scrapping indicates that the blogger accesses the post and evaluates it positively. Hence, the data on blog-posts allow for a conservative test of idea diffusion.</p>
<p>Third, these online networks provided a large number of detailed observations on the temporal process of diffusion. A conventional approach to diffusion studies is to focus on a few successful diffusions and examine the determinants of their success. Yet, unobserved failed diffusions may bias any inference on observed successful diffusions. The easily traceable, large-scaled observations of diffusions in an online community may mitigate the concern for selectivity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012470408">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of privacy concerns, we were allowed to access and analyze the sample of blog-posts from 1 June to 30 June 2006. As of 30 June 2006, 13,675,055 bloggers were registered with this service, and 284,544 of these bloggers scrapped at least once. For this one month observation period, the average number of scraps per post was 3.2; the average number of posts created per day was 226,611. In comparison, on 1 June 2006, a total of 200,258 posts were created. The average numbers of scraps for these posts for the 30 days were 3.4. This indicates that ideas created in early June 2006 did not enjoy advantages over those created in late June with respect to the number of scraps. Given ideas’ competition for attention, it also indicates that ideas not receiving immediate response from other bloggers were less likely to get attention afterward: ideas were short lived. Moreover, this comparison indicates that blogging activities were relatively stable through the observation period.</p>
<p>We selected blog-posts using the following two criteria: first, blog-posts were scrapped at least once—because we were concerned with the way in which a blog post diffused, we excluded from the sample those that were not scrapped; that is, did not diffuse at all and second, bloggers creating posts were tied to at least two other bloggers through the act of scrapping. It was necessary to keep at least three bloggers before analyzing the ego network structure. Note that to construct a global blogger network, we used all the registered bloggers as of 30 June 2006. Yet, to estimate the effects of the bloggers’ ego network structure, we excluded cases where ego or the originator was tied to only one other blogger. The resulting sample contained 61,980 bloggers who created 411,078 posts that were scrapped at least once during the observation period.</p>
<p>To determine whether bloggers’ network exhibits the properties of a small world network, we computed the small world quotient, which compared the clustering coefficient and average path length of our global network with those of a random network. For any blogger, the average number of the direct contacts was 5.8, whereas that of indirect contacts that are two steps away from the blogger was 192; that is, there was one giant component in this blogger network, which included 85.7% of the bloggers in the network. For the giant component of the blogger network in 2006, the actual clustering coefficient was 0.1173, whereas the clustering coefficient of a random network was 0.00004. Due to computational loads, we randomly sampled 5% of the bloggers and computed their path length. The actual average path length for this sample was 6.157, whereas that of a random network was 5.878. Hence, the small world quotient was 2261.4, indicating that this blogger network was a small world network. The value of the quotient was similar to the value of 2396.8 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012470408">Watts (2003</xref>: 96) for the network of co-stars among movie actors. The average path length was smaller than in the previous year, which indicates that the potential diffusion distance between the originator and his or her remote contacts was on the decrease. Moreover, we examined the degree distribution of bloggers in our sample. The exponent for the power-law distribution was −1.45, indicating that a majority of the bloggers in our sample were commonly tied to a few bloggers; that is, power bloggers. The degree assortativity—that is, the degree to which bloggers of same number of friends get to be friends, declined from 0.09 in 2003 to 0.003 in 2006, indicating the same tendency.</p>

<sec id="section6-1476127012470408">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>For the simplicity of the discussion below, we referred to a blogger scrapping the original post as the initial contact or the first-step receiver and a blogger scrapping the receiver’s scraps as the second-step receiver. The active set of a post refers to the sum of all the dyads of the originator and receivers involved in the course of diffusing a given post. Against this setup, we defined measures in the following way.</p>
<sec id="section7-1476127012470408">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The unit of analysis was a post, not a blogger. In particular, we considered posts that were scrapped at least once. Accordingly, we examined how far a given post diffused among bloggers through the act of scraping. The extent to which an idea diffused to remote contacts was defined as the maximum path length between the originator and his or her subsequent contacts for a given post. This measure presumes that as a given post spreads over a long distance, the number of bloggers using (i.e. scrapping) that post will also increase. The empirical correlation between the number of scraps and the maximum path length for the diffusion of a given post was 0.213 and significant at a 0.01 level, indicating that this presumption was valid. However, we employed the measure of path length, not the number of scraps because the latter does not distinguish between short- and long-distance diffusion. For example, when a post was heavily scrapped by bloggers in dense neighborhood, the number of scraps would be relatively high, but the maximum length of a post would be relatively short.</p>

<title>Independent variables</title>
<sec id="section9-1476127012470408">
<title>Tie strength</title>
<p>A tie existed between two bloggers whenever one party scrapped the other party’s post. We characterized the tie strength of a given post as that of the active set; that is, all the dyads of the originator and the receivers involved in the diffusion of a given post. To this end, it was necessary to define the tie strength of each dyad. Compared with offline social interactions, online social networks could be relatively weak with respect to tie strength. Yet, recent research on online social networks shows that online and offline social networks tend to overlap and that bloggers increasingly develop emotional attachment to online social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012470408">Golder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012470408">Kossinets and Watts, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012470408">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012470408">Table 1</xref> shows, the average blogger had 0.693 registered neighbors with a maximum value of 68, a number that was substantially smaller than the average number of friends per user in Facebook (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012470408">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that registered neighbors were selectively chosen. Indeed, a survey of 58 regular users of this blog service, conducted from March to May of 2011, showed that some bloggers interacted intensively with select others, namely, “registered neighbors” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476127012470408">Appendix 1</xref>). Although two opposing attitudes about registered neighbors were present in the survey, the propensity for bloggers to develop emotional attachment to registered neighbors appeared to be higher as they spent more time in using this service. For example, the correlation between weekly blog use hours and the sharing of personal problems with registered neighbors is 0.283.</p>

<p>Against this background, we defined a dyad of registered neighbors as a strong tie. All the weakly tied partners were visitors to a blog, who did not receive formal confirmation from the blogger as a registered neighbor. Given the nature of online interactions, they were virtually strangers. Accordingly, the tie strength of a post was defined as the ratio of strongly tied dyads to the active set of the post. In particular, tie strength (1) refers to tie strength between the originator and his or her initial contact; that is, the first-step receiver. In the similar vein, tie strength (n) refers to the strength between the (n-1)th step receiver and nth-step receiver. The tie strength of a post varied from 9.9% for a dyad of the originator and the receiver to 32.3% for a dyad of the second-step and third-step receivers. This pattern tentatively indicated that a post of a longer maximum path length diffused through strongly tied dyads.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1476127012470408">
<title>Ego network density</title>
<p>For the test of hypotheses, we focused on the sharing of ideas that is supported by “social structure.” We viewed ties in registered neighbor networks as social ties or relations that resembled social contacts in the offline community. Hence, by using a network in which two bloggers were connected as registered neighbors, we calibrated the extent to which the originator occupied a bridge position between his or her strongly tied partners. A high value for the ego network density indicated that the originator was less likely to bridge otherwise disconnected contacts. In particular, the originator’s ego network density was computed as the actual number of ties among the initial contacts divided by the maximum number of ties possible among them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the network structure through which a given post is diffused can be examined by determining the ego network structure of an nth-step receiver. In this way, one could trace the diffusion of a post and see whether the post diffused via bridges. Apart from the computational difficulty associated with this task, this alternative presumes that every bridge in the course of diffusion is of equal importance. However, under the condition of information abundance, our theory suggests that owing to problems associated with attention, the initial contacts are more important than the subsequent contacts in the course of diffusion. Therefore, we chose the originator’s ego network as the basis for computing the bloggers’ bridge positions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1476127012470408">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Users of the online social network also accessed ideas through a public announcement on the main (or first) page of the blog service as well as through a search engine attached to the main page. Unlike word-of-mouth communication, the main-page announcement and the search engine did not require social networks to diffuse ideas. Hence, we controlled for the effects of the main-page announcement by including a dummy variable for whether a post was available from the main page of the blog service. In our data, 0.3% of the posts were displayed on the main page.</p>
<p>To further exclude alternative explanations, we included the following controls at the blog level: the number of registered neighbors, activeness, popularity, and receptivity. First, the probability that an idea flows through strong ties depends on the absolute number of strong ties available to ego. To control for this constraint, we included the number of registered neighbors available to the original creator of a post. Second, we controlled for the originator-specific attributes in a bid to identify the independent effects of tie structure and strength. Activeness refers to the extent that a blogger created new posts and was measured by the number of posts created. Popularity refers to the degree that posts created by a blogger were positively accepted by others and was measured by the ratio of the number of scraps made by others to the total number of posts created by a given blogger. Finally, receptivity measures the tendency for a blogger to accept other users’ points of view. It was measured by the number of scraps made by the blogger. The rationale behind these controls is that a blogger is in a better position to diffuse his or her own information as he or she gains attention from others by being prolific, popular, or caring.</p>

<p>where <italic>Y</italic> is the maximum path length of a post; <italic>X</italic> is a vector of covariates, including tie strength, ego network density, and control variables; β is a vector of the parameters to be estimated; and <italic>u</italic> is an error term. In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1476127012470408">equation (1)</xref>, the covariates differ in their levels of measurement. For example, tie strength was measured for each post, whereas ego network density was measured at the blogger level. Because a blogger could create multiple posts during the observation period, the error terms would reflect unspecified attributes of a blogger and be clustered within a given blogger.</p>
<p>This violation of the independency of errors led us to consider the mixed-effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012470408">Bryk and Raudenbush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012470408">Luke, 2004</xref>). This model distinguishes between fixed and random effects with respect to statistical inferences. The fixed effects apply to the mean of the population under study, whereas the random effects vary with a sampling procedure; that is, apply to a particular blogger in our sample. Accordingly, we decomposed the error term into three random effects: for the intercept, for the slope of tie strength, and for posts by the same blogger, all of which were assumed to be normally distributed. The random effects for the intercept capture between-blogger variance not explained by covariates and those for posts capture the within-blogger variance that is not attributable to the dependent variable of this study. To fit this model, we employed the residual maximum likelihood estimator.</p>
<p>The descriptive statistics of covariates and their pair-wise correlations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012470408">Table 1</xref>. Note that successful diffusion <italic>via social networks</italic> should reach as many actors as possible. This condition is captured by the maximum path length. Unless actors are directly connected to one another, successful diffusion results in a longer path length. Accordingly, we analyzed the data by either including or excluding these diffusions of path length of 1 to separate the pattern of successful diffusions from that of unsuccessful ones. In doing so, we took into account the possible biases that may arise from the local clustering of ties.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012470408">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the behavior of the two key variables—the maximum path length and tie strength. Before interpreting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012470408">Figure 2</xref>, the following should be noted. First, 93.8% of the posts that were scrapped have the maximum path length of 1. Second, these posts accounted for 95.7% of all scraps. Third, 7.9% of the scraps were made by registered neighbors. Accordingly, a large proportion of posts did not diffuse successfully, and the sample mean of tie strength reflects mostly the feature of posts whose maximum path length was 1.</p>

<p>Among posts that were scrapped, approximately 1% of them diffused to third-step receivers or beyond. The ratio of strongly tied dyads to the active set—that is, tie strength, increases with the maximum path length yet tapers off after a maximum path length of 8. Note also that there were only 15 cases in which posts had a maximum path length larger than 10. The maximum value of tie strength was 0.542 and was found in posts whose maximum path length was 13. While caution should be taken to make any inference from this behavior, the data still imply that long-distance diffusions were apparently built on strongly tied dyads. To further examine this conjecture, we ran the mixed-effects model as follows. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012470408">Table 2</xref> provides restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates for the effects of tie strength on the maximum path length of a post.</p>

<p>Models 1 and 2 analyze all of the observations, whereas the findings of models 3 and 4 are based on posts whose maximum path length is larger than 1. The patterns are, however, consistent across these models. As expected, the effects of the main-page posting are positive, indicating that a post available on the main page of the blog service is likely to diffuse widely. Because posts announced in the main page of this online community do not depend on social relations to diffuse the ideas, we should expect two distinct types of diffusion: one directly diffusing to bloggers through a public communication channel such as the main page and the other diffusing indirectly to bloggers via online social networks. The originator with many registered neighbors appears to diffuse one’s posts farther (e.g. β = 0.018 in model 1), indicating that long-distance diffusion may depend on the originator’s degree centrality; that is, the number of registered neighbors. Model 4, for example, suggests that the originator whose ego network density is 0.2 is likely to diffuse his or her ideas to the third-step receivers when his or her registered neighbors are more than 40.</p>
<p>Tie strength is positive and significantly associated with the maximum path length of a post, lending a support to H1. As shown in model 1 (β = 0.151), a post with many strongly tied initial contacts is more likely to diffuse farther than one with few strongly tied ones. To control for the effects of short-distance diffusion, we take a subsample analysis in model 3, which includes diffusion whose maximum path length is larger than 1. We still find that strongly tied dyads are conducive to the maximum path length of a post (i.e. β = 0.214 in model 3).</p>
<p>Consistent with H2, the ego network structure of the originator is also significantly associated with the length of diffusion. As shown by the positive effects of ego network density, models 1–4 indicate that ideas originated by nonbrokers are more likely to spread over a long distance; that is, long-distance diffusion may begin with the originator located in a dense network.</p>
<p>The behavior of ego network density merits further attention. The positive effects of ego network density are apparently incompatible with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter’s (1973)</xref> view of bridges with respect to diffusion. Yet, models 2 and 4 reconcile these two conflicting studies. Consistent with H3, the negative interaction between tie strength and ego network density suggests that ideas originated by brokers are likely to diffuse farther when these brokers are strongly tied to their initial contacts. To further illustrate this, we use the estimates in model 2 and compute the effects that are induced by the changes in the originator’s ego network. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1476127012470408">Figure 3</xref> compares a case where the originator’s tie strength is at the sample mean with one in which the originator’s tie strength increases by 1 standard deviation. Note that the other covariates are set to their sample mean respectively. The comparison clearly shows that the ideas of the originator are likely to diffuse to remote contacts as ego network density is low yet tie strength increases.</p>

</fig>
<p>As mentioned earlier, H3 concerns the sharing of ideas beyond the originator’s neighborhood. For this, we needed further evidence to capture the sharing of ideas by the originator’s subsequent contacts. To this end, we re-ran model 4, but with a new dependent variable, which is the logged number of scraps made by the subsequent contacts. As expected, the interaction between tie strength and tie structure in model 5 is significant and negative.</p>
<p>The theory of this study also suggests that ideas are more likely to reach remote contacts when it passes mainly through strong ties. This pattern requires the presence of so-called forbidden triads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1973</xref>); otherwise, ideas will circulate in a closed circle of strongly tied partners. For posts whose maximum path length was 3, we examined whether the originator was likely to have a strong tie to the subsequent contacts when his or her initial contacts were already strongly tied to the subsequent contacts. The correlation between tie strength (1) and tie strength (2) was 0.307, whereas the correlation between tie strength (2) and tie strength (3) was 0.309. Yet, the correlation between tie strength (1) and tie strength (3) was 0.169. This suggests that even when the originator’s initial contact is strongly tied to a subsequent contact, the originator may not necessarily have a strong tie to the subsequent contact; that is, the forbidden triad is feasible.</p>
<p>The results of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012470408">Table 3</xref> show that ideas diffuse via strong ties when long-distance diffusion occurs. The total tie strength in model 1 refers to the proportion of strong ties for all the dyads involved in the diffusion of a given post. The positive effect of total tie strength indicates that strong ties may matter throughout the whole process of diffusion. Yet, a caution should be taken to make further inference out of model 1. It is because the correlation of the total tie strength with tie strength (1) is 0.81 and its correlation with tie strength (2) is 0.661. This means that the source of strong ties for long-distance diffusion is likely to be relationships at the early stage of diffusion. Yet, the results reported in model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012470408">Table 3</xref> clearly show that strong ties may serve an important channel for idea diffusion whether they are present in the earlier or later stage of diffusion, whose coefficients are 0.271 and 0.562, respectively.</p>

<p>One unspecified factor that may obscure the findings of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012470408">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012470408">3</xref> is the content of a post. It is possible that the success of diffusion rests on the content of a post; that is, whether a post contains information is either interesting or salient; yet, such effects are relegated into errors in our analysis. Hence, we undertook additional analysis to see whether this unspecified factor may bias our results. We first sampled power bloggers of this online community as of May 2011, with the criterion that they had blogged prior to June 2006. Power bloggers were identified by the service provider, and 26 were sampled. We then examined the diffusion success of 1003 posts made in June 2006 by these bloggers. Because all of these bloggers had comparable reputations within this online community, the diffusion success of their posts should be ascribed to factors other than blogger characteristics. This online community had an official classification system that identified the content of each post. Each blogger declared the content of their posts by voluntarily registering its classification category. This analysis shows that the differences in content captured by the classification categories are not significantly related to the number of scraps made for a given post, which means that diffusion observed in our study may be independent of its content.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This article examines whether the diffusion of ideas depends on the structure and quality of relationships between the originator of an idea and his or her initial contacts when both verification difficulty and access costs are low. To this end, this study takes diffusion itself as a unit of analysis rather than the sharing of ideas between two people. From the analysis of online social networks, this article shows that ideas are more likely to diffuse if the originator has an open network composed of strong ties. When diffusion via public and direct announcement is excluded, namely, short-distance diffusion, the findings of this article suggest that social relations are still conducive to the diffusion of ideas even when verification difficulty and access cost are trivial.</p>
<p>The fact that the originator needs to maintain strongly tied bridges suggests that to diffuse his or her ideas, the originator needs to develop voluntary supporters or fandom, whose members are not necessarily opinion leaders or highly influential experts. In other words, an idea that is validated and supported early on by a cohesive group is likely to diffuse widely. A few strong supporters, despite having dissimilar interests, make the originator exert a global influence. For example, a marketer of Apple initially circulates his or her product information among vivid supporters of Apple and can expect this information to diffuse widely into other segments of potential consumers. The other equally important implication is that tie strength can be substituted with tie structure; that is, whenever brokers seek to overcome the structural weakness of long-distance diffusion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012470408">Centola and Macy, 2007</xref>), they need to build strong ties around their brokerage positions.</p>
<p>Concerning tie strength, the Weak Ties model proposes that strongly tied dyads are likely to connect to redundant contacts. Any idea flowing through these dyads may circulate only within this closed network of dyads. This implies that there should be negative or little association between successful diffusion and tie strength at the network level. Yet, the findings of this study suggest that at least for the ego network of the originator, the maximum path length of a post has to do with tie strength.</p>
<p>Do these findings lead us to reject the Weak Ties model? We do not think so. Rather, we propose that another pattern of diffusion is possible. Our findings suggest that three different patterns of diffusion are possible at least in the realm of online social networks: public announcement, weakly tied bridges, and strongly tied bridges. First, ideas may diffuse without the help of social networks. With a public announcement, every actor of a community can directly access the source of an idea. The disclosure of accounting information is such an example. Second, diffusion occurs in accordance with the Weak Ties model; that is, ideas may diffuse widely via weakly tied bridges when verification difficulty as well as access cost is high. Finally, when verification difficulty as well as access cost is trivial, the originator with the strongly tied network bridges may diffuse one’s message successfully.</p>
<p>One may note that the negative interaction of tie strength and ego network density in our study leaves little room for the working of weakly tied bridges. However, it is premature to deny the benefits of weakly tied bridges because the empirical design of this study focuses only on the network structure of the originator. It should also be noted that one important implication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012470408">Watts’ (1999)</xref> small world networks is that the local- or ego-level network structure does not capture the global-level network structure. Hence, the positive effects of ego network density may not necessarily exclude the role of weakly tied bridges that are present in the global-level network. Indeed, diffusion depicted by the Weak Ties model draws on network bridges, which may occur either in the early stage or the later stage of diffusion. Rather, what our study shows is that under the condition of information abundance, the originator’s ego network merits special attention.</p>
<p>One question that remains is whether diffusion depicted by our model is also applicable to the diffusion of complex ideas. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012470408">Hansen (1999)</xref>, weak ties would be an effective channel for ideas that are simple, not complex. Given that blog-posts are likely to contain simple and easily codified ideas, one would expect that blog-posts diffuse successfully via weak ties. Yet, our study hinges upon one boundary condition—ideas compete for attention. Under this condition, the cost of accessing experts’ opinions and instructions on complex ideas is sufficiently small—and here, the challenge facing individuals is identifying what information to pay attention to. In this regard, the simple provision of more information at a trivial cost may lead to information overload rather than an ideal decision-making situation where well-informed individuals make independent choices. Insofar as ideas from known sources receive sufficient attention, ideas will flow easily through well-known and thus strongly tied partners. If so, strong ties may direct and channel attention, thus selecting a given idea in the course of diffusion, as is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012470408">Figure 2</xref>. For this very reason, idea diffusion will take a rather inefficient, long-distance path than an efficient, short-distance path that directly accesses experts’ instructions.</p>
<p>In addition, this study helps elaborate on a brokerage-based view of social capital, which shows that network bridges are the sources and carriers of novel ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012470408">Burt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012470408">Granovetter, 1973</xref>). With the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012470408">Watts (1999)</xref>, social capital scholars along this line have paid little attention to outcomes that network bridges would yield at the community level. Rather, they have been concerned with economic benefits that accrue to a person or a group as a result of having a certain type of social relationship (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012470408">Oh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012470408">Reagans and Zuckerman, 2001</xref>). This study suggests that whether intended or not, the originator’s networking activities may have an influence at the community level, that is, the global diffusion of ideas, when the members of a community are plagued with a plethora of ideas to process.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, this study has implications for diffusion research. In particular, it shows that for a better understanding of idea diffusion, it is necessary to examine the origin of ideas, especially the ego network of the idea originator. Our study pays attention to the distinction between initial diffusion (i.e. diffusion in the ego network of the originator) and later diffusion (i.e. diffusion beyond the ego network of the originator); it suggests that under the condition of information abundance, the initial diffusion and thus the origin of ideas matters for a further spread of ideas beyond the ego network of the originator. While the macro-level research on diffusion has not focused on the network structure of the originator, the findings of this study are applicable to diffusion at the interorganizational level in the following ways. First, diffusion scholars observe that legitimate practices adopted by central actors have a higher chance of being diffused widely at the community level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476127012470408">Davis and Greve, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012470408">Haunschild, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012470408">Shipilov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012470408">Westphal et al., 1997</xref>). In doing so, the identity of early adopter becomes important in the process of diffusion. Yet, what our study shows is that the creator of a practice would be more important when multiple, legitimate alternatives are available to the potential adopters; that is, a practice proposed by the originator with strong supporters would weigh more than one that fails to maintain voluntary supporters in the beginning. Moreover, our study suggests that the change agents of institutional practices—institutional entrepreneurs—are likely to be mobilized groups rather than prestigious organizations that introduce a new practice to the others. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012470408">Stinchcombe (1965</xref>: 107), our study implies that a group of organizations sharing common interests is sufficient enough to initiate the diffusion of ideas or practices.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012470408">Strang and Soule (1998)</xref>, a desirable research design of diffusion is one that allows for the identification of what is observed by each potential adopter. The reason is that underlying diffusion processes may differ depending on whether the potential adopters observe a given practice or the consequence of adopting a practice. Our study employs the behavior of scraps, which are voluntary in nature and directly observable, and suggests that the observation of strongly tied partners endorsing a practice (i.e. an idea in our context) underlies the diffusion of ideas either when the potential adopters are rather indifferent to the consequence of a practice or when experts’ opinions on the consequence are too many to choose from.</p>
<p>The research design of this study allows us to examine the diffusion of multiple ideas in a single population, including those that fail to diffuse. However, one important limitation of this study is that the content of ideas is not explicitly examined. Rather, we relegate the unspecified content of ideas into the error term. A future study may look into whether the effects of tie strength vary with the content of ideas. Another limitation is that our analysis is static. We do not examine whether temporal changes in network structure have an impact on the diffusion of ideas. We assume that the observed network structure remained constant during the one-month observation period. While one month is rather short for a network to change substantially, it will be interesting to see whether network change inhibits or facilitates the process of diffusion. In addition, future research may draw on this study to examine the context in which cognitive limitations vary. Other things being equal, for example, a post is less likely to diffuse widely when it competes with many other posts for individuals’ attention. Given that the number of posts created in our sample was relatively stable during the observation period, one may sample a longer period to capture the effects of the total number of posts that vary over time.</p>
<p>In network research, attention is given to actors embedded in social relations, not isolates that are outside the relation. Hence, the influence of the originator’s network will be overestimated, provided that a person devoid of ideas is unpopular and thus fails to enter social networks. Yet, the proportion of strong ties in our estimation may attenuate this possible bias because the effect of this measure is independent of the originator’s degree centrality; that is, a proxy for the popularity of the originator in social networks. Note also that a post from an experienced person whose previous posts were frequently scrapped may have a better chance to diffuse widely than one from an inexperienced person. Our mixed-effect model with controls may correct for such an unobserved heterogeneity of the originator, but future research may extend this study by tackling the variation in the source with respect to popularity.</p>
<p>While our theory hinges upon the relative importance of the originator’s local network, it is also likely that the originator’s global centrality may play a role in this process. Yet, model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012470408">Table 3</xref> suggests the chain of strongly tied dyads as a diffusion channel for ideas. This means that whether you have a strongly tied partner is more important than whether you are a globally central person. Yet, the role of a global network position awaits further tests. Two more research opportunities merit further discussion. One is the speed of diffusion. Although the extant research on macro-level diffusion concerns mainly the scale of diffusion; that is, how many people adopt a given practice, it will be theoretically and practically important to know whether the speed of diffusion, especially in the early stage of diffusion, may determine the success of diffusion at the later stage. The other is to test the capacity of dense neighborhoods to create ideas collectively. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012470408">Kijkuit and Ende (2010)</xref> showed that dense networks are good at refining new ideas. In this regard, it would be interesting to see whether ideas refined collectively are more likely to diffuse successfully or not. Last but not least, this study presumes that offline social networks may be closely aligned with online social networks. It would be interesting to examine the extent of convergence between offline and online social networks.</p>
