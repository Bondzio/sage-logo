<abstract>
<p>It has been suggested that parents’ feeding behaviors are associated with the eating behaviors of their children. The objective of this study was to develop the Child Mealtime Feeding Behavior Questionnaire (CMFBQ) to assess the strategies used by mothers in response to picky eating by their children at meals. The participants, 834 mothers of 3- to 6-year-old children attending kindergartens and nursery schools in Tokyo and Fukui, Japan, completed the self-administered questionnaires. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of data obtained from these participants produced an 18-item scale with 4 subscales: “behavioral strategy,” “passive coercion,” “punishment and reward,” and “permission.” The internal consistency (Cronbach’s <italic>α</italic>) of these subscales ranged from .65 to .82. Maternal punishment and reward and maternal permission were positively associated with children’s picky eating; however, other behavioral strategies, including passive coercion, were not significantly related to children’s picky eating. The CMFBQ can assess the strategies used by mothers to encourage their children to eat meals. Researchers and health practitioners can use this measure to better understand how mothers motivate their children to eat meals and to consider the implications of these practices for children’s eating behaviors without placing an undue burden on respondents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, increasing numbers of Japanese mothers have begun to worry about their children’s picky eating habits. Indeed, 34% of mothers with 1- to 4-year-old children reported experiencing anxiety related to their children’s picky eating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412466673">1</xref></sup> Previous studies have investigated various aspects of picky eating behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412466673">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412466673">3</xref></sup> Steyn et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412466673">4</xref></sup> defined a picky eater in terms of two attributes: consuming small amounts of food and eating a limited variety of foods. Previous studies have reported that picky eaters consume less diverse diets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412466673">5</xref></sup> fewer foods containing recommended micronutrients, and fewer vegetables, and have lower body mass indices compared with nonpicky eaters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412466673">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parents are highly involved in the development of their children’s eating behaviors, food preferences, and energy intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412466673">7</xref></sup> Food habits do not remain stable throughout a lifetime; however, the basis for healthy eating is established during early childhood. Previous studies have reported that early feeding interactions influence eating preferences and behaviors in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412466673">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412466673">9</xref></sup> Some parents frequently encourage or pressure children to eat healthful food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412466673">10</xref></sup> However, this pressure has been shown to produce negative associations with consuming food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412466673">11</xref></sup> Batsell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412466673">12</xref></sup> studied recall of forced consumption in a sample of college students. In all, 76% (n = 107/140) of students who completed the Forced Consumption Questionnaire reported forced-consumption episodes involving an authority figure (e.g., parent). Furthermore, 72% (n = 77/107) of respondents said that they would not eat the food that they had been forced to consume. Therefore, this study focused on the feeding strategies that are used by parents when their children exhibit picky eating habits at mealtimes.</p>
<p>Social–cognitive theory has shown that behaviors are learned through individual observation and social experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412466673">13</xref></sup> This theory underscores the importance of “modeling,” a process whereby children observe and learn parental behavior. Thus, parental behaviors directly influence children’s behavior. Considering this, the present study focused on parental feeding behaviors, which can be observed by children and which influence their eating behaviors, rather than on parental attitudes, which children cannot observe. Additionally, information on parental behaviors, as distinguished from parental attitudes, is helpful for health practitioners, who can then offer advice to parents about the use of specific positive behaviors, such as modeling. Furthermore, a focus on behaviors can aid in future studies on the parental behaviors that are associated with picky eating among children.</p>
<p>Several scales, including the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412466673">10</xref></sup> the Parent Mealtime Action Scale (PMAS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412466673">14</xref></sup> and the Caregiver’s Feeding Style Questionnaire (CFSQ),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412466673">15</xref></sup> have been developed to measure maternal feeding behavior and attitudes. The CFQ has been widely used as a measure of parental attitudes and behaviors that have been shown to increase the propensity for obesity in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412466673">16</xref></sup> This 28-item questionnaire is composed of 7 subscales, including “perceived responsibility” (3 items), “perceived parental weight” (4 items), “perceived child weight” (3 items), “concerns about child weight” (3 items), “restriction” (8 items), “pressure to eat” (4 items), and “monitoring” (3 items). Previous studies have reported a relationship among children’s eating behavior, body weight, and pressure to eat by parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412466673">3</xref></sup> The CFQ, however, is not designed to recommend the strategies, such as modeling, that should be used to encourage eating by children. Moreover, the CFQ includes parental behaviors and attitudes in each subscale.</p>
<p>The PMAS was recently developed and focuses on parental mealtime behaviors. The 31-item PMAS has 9 subscales, including “snack limits” (3 items), “positive persuasion” (4 items), “daily fruit and vegetable availability” (3 items), “use of rewards” (4 items), “insistence on eating” (3 items), “snack modeling” (3 items), “special meals” (4 items), “fat reduction” (3 items),” and “many food choices” (4 items).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412466673">14</xref></sup> The PMAS measures eating at mealtimes and additional eating during the day (ie, snacking), but it does not include items about modeling at mealtime.</p>
<p>The 19-item CFSQ is used to determine the feeding strategies used by parents to get preschool-aged children to eat during mealtimes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412466673">15</xref></sup> The CFSQ includes 2 subscales, “being demanding” (ie, parent centered; 12 items) and “being responsive” (ie, child centered; 7 items). However, this measure, focused on encouraging children to eat, does not include items addressing modeling.</p>
<p>Thus, these extant measures have several limitations. First, they do not address parental feeding behaviors in response to children’s picky eating. Second, although parental modeling behavior has been suggested as a way to increase the intake of healthy foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412466673">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412466673">18</xref></sup> and is considered important by social–cognitive theory, these measures do not measure or evaluate modeling behaviors at mealtimes. Therefore, the present study assessed the validity and reliability of the Child Feeding Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire (CMFBQ) for measuring parental feeding behaviors in response to children’s picky eating at mealtimes.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The sample in the present study consisted of parents of children between birth and 6 years of age. The children attended 1 of 11 kindergartens or 3 nursery schools in Tokyo or Fukui, Japan. The principal of each school distributed the questionnaires to a total of 1388 families via classroom teachers. One parent in each family completed the self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on parental feeding practices toward the youngest child in the family. The completed questionnaires were collected at the schools and forwarded to the researchers. The present study was approved by the Ochanomizu University Ethics Review Committee. All participants were informed of their right to refuse to participate and were given information about the protection of their privacy.</p>

<title>Child Mealtime Feeding Behavior Questionnaire</title>
<p>The items on the CMFBQ are based on strategies that are commonly used to encourage children to eat during mealtimes. To develop the questionnaire, we conducted interviews with mothers. Two different interview formats were used—a group interview with 6 mothers of children who attended kindergarten in Tokyo and individual interviews with 5 different mothers of children who attended nursery school in Tokyo. Participants were asked, “How do you encourage your child to eat when he/she does not want to eat his/her meals?” All interviews were recorded and transcribed, and maternal feeding strategies were subsequently generated from these records. First, to ensure the objectivity of the data extraction, 2 researchers independently extracted sentences about parental feeding behaviors from the transcribed audio-recordings. Second, the agreement of the 2 reviewers regarding which sentences to extract was checked. Third, discrepancies resulting from disagreements between the 2 researchers about which sentences to extract were discussed and resolved by the 2 researchers and an additional researcher. Feeding strategies mentioned in the existing literature on this topic were also used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412466673">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412466673">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412466673">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412466673"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412466673">21</xref></sup> We extracted relevant items that measured maternal feeding behavior, rather than those that measured attitudes, and items related to encouraging children to eat at mealtimes, rather than at any time during the day. We created 46 items from the interview data and adapted 46 items from the extant literature. Following discussions among researchers to eliminate similar items, the final questionnaire included 34 items. The participants responded to questions about each of the feeding strategies on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>agree</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section6-1941406412466673">
<title>Child Feeding Questionnaire</title>
<p>The present study examined 2 subscales of the CFQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412466673">10</xref></sup> to examine criterion-referenced validity because this scale is the most widely used questionnaire addressing whether parental feeding behaviors are associated with being overweight and engaging in unhealthy eating behaviors during childhood. The subscales assessed “restriction,” a measure of the extent to which parents attempt to restrict their child’s eating during meals (8 items) and “pressure to eat,” a measure of parental pressure on children to consume more food (4 items). Participants used a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>agree</italic> to respond to the items on the CFQ. Higher scores were reflective of a greater reliance on the respective feeding practices. The internal reliability and validity of the CFQ have been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412466673">10</xref></sup> All the items were translated into Japanese. Experts in children, the English language, and diet reviewed the translation.</p>

<sec id="section7-1941406412466673">
<title>Picky eating</title>
<p>These 3 items were developed based on the interview data gathered via the CMFBQ. Children’s picky eating behaviors were assessed with items, including, “At mealtime, my child eats only the same foods,” “During meals, my child does not eat food that he/she dislikes,” and “At mealtimes, my child does not eat much.” Participants responded by rating each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>never</italic> to 5 = <italic>always</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1941406412466673">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Data were collected that included the age of the participants, the employment status of the mother, the sex and age of the target child, the number of siblings in the family, and the target child’s birth order within the family. Parents also provided their child’s weight and height, which were used to calculate the obesity index ({(actual body weight [kg] − standard body weight)/standard body weight} × 100). The obesity index is widely used in clinical practice and epidemiological studies in Japan to evaluate body type. The standard body weight of preschool children was calculated with a formula obtained from the Growth of Infants and Preschool Children survey conducted by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412466673">22</xref></sup> The formula for boys is <italic>Y</italic> = 2.06 × 10 − 3<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> − 0.1166<italic>X</italic> + 6.527. The formula for girls is <italic>Y</italic> = 2.49 × 10 − 3<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> − 0.1858<italic>X</italic> + 9.0360 (<italic>Y</italic> = standard body weight [kg], <italic>X</italic> = height [cm]). Children in the present study were classified as underweight (−15%), normal (−15% to 15%), or overweight (&gt;15%) according to the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412466673">23</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-1941406412466673">
<title>Content validity</title>
<p>Child care experts confirmed the content of the questionnaire in terms of the respondents’ privacy, such as parental age and the questions’ correspondence to actual behaviors. In addition, 6 mothers who were not involved in the present study reviewed and completed the questionnaire prior to the beginning of the study to determine whether it was difficult to complete.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-1941406412466673">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Demographic information was collected about the participants and their children. Previous studies have reported that fathers and mothers engage in different feeding behaviors with their children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412466673">24</xref></sup> In the present study, very few fathers responded to the questionnaire; therefore, only data provided by mothers were included. Moreover, data from only 3- to 6-year-old children were included in the study because they were old enough to challenge their mothers about food that they disliked. Missing data were replaced with the median score for each item from the CMFBQ. The 34 items on the CMFBQ were entered into an exploratory factor analysis. This analysis was conducted using 3 criteria: Subscales were required to include at least 3 items, items had to load at least .35 in only one subscale, and subscales could not have equal loadings of multiple factors. The hypothesized 4-factor model from an exploratory factor analysis was examined for construct validity by using a confirmatory factor analysis. The same data set was used in the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Cronbach’s α was used to examine the reliability of the subscales. Moreover, the frequency of each parental feeding practice was ascertained.</p>
<p>To test for validity, the total and subscale scores on the CMFBQ were correlated against the CFQ subscale. The associations among children’s picky eating, the obesity index, and CMFBQ subscale scores were also determined. These analyses relied on Pearson’s correlations and one-way analyses of variance. Significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Data were analyzed with PASW Statistics version 19.0 for Windows and Amos version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc, Tokyo, Japan, 2010).</p>

<title>Selection of Items</title>
<p>Five items were excluded from the 34 total feeding-strategies items. The item “I take my child’s favorite food away or tell him/her I will do so” displayed limited variability because of a floor effect. More than 80% of the mothers reported that they disagreed or slightly disagreed with this item. Four of the items, including (<italic>a</italic>) “I share food that tastes good with my child,” (<italic>b</italic>) “I tell my child that the leftover food is <italic>mottainai</italic>” (a Japanese term meaning a sense of regret concerning waste when the intrinsic value of an object or resource is not properly used), (<italic>c</italic>) “I suggest a small goal to my child such as ‘one bite’,” and (<italic>d</italic>) “I tell my child that eating will bring him/her good things such as health” showed limited variability because of a ceiling effect, as 80% or more of the mothers agreed or slightly agreed with these statements.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics and Reliability of Subscales</title>
<p>The psychometric characteristics of the four CMFBQ subscales, including the descriptive statistics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412466673">Table 2</xref>), were assessed for internal reliability and validity. The score for each subscale was calculated as the mean of the 5-point rating scale because internal reliability was confirmed (Cronbach’s α = .65-.82). The mean (standard deviation) of the total score for each behavioral strategy (8 items), permission (4 items), punishment and reward (3 items), and passive coercion (3 items) were 27.8 (5.8), 9.8 (3.1), 10.4 (2.8), and 8.0 (2.9), respectively.</p>

<p>Correlations between the scores on the CMFBQ subscales and those on the CFQ subscales (ie, restriction and pressure to eat) were determined (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941406412466673">Table 3</xref>). The results indicated that punishment and reward, passive coercion, and behavioral strategy were correlated with restriction. However, scores on permission were not associated with scores on restriction. Scores on punishment and reward, passive coercion, and behavioral strategy were positively associated with scores on pressure to eat. Moreover, scores on permission were negatively associated with scores on pressure to eat.</p>

<p>Associations between children’s picky eating behavior, obesity indices, and scores on the CMFBQ were also examined. Maternal punishment and reward and permission were positively associated with children’s picky eating (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1941406412466673">Table 4</xref>); however, not all results regarding behavioral strategy and passive coercion were significantly related to children’s picky eating. No subscales were significantly associated with the children’s obesity indices, although mothers with underweight children tended to be more likely than mothers with children of normal weight to rely on behavioral strategies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, a new 18-item CMFBQ consisting of 4 subscales related to maternal encouragement of children’s eating behaviors was developed. The 4 subscales were behavioral strategy, passive coercion, punishment and reward, and permission. This questionnaire was able to measure maternal feeding behavior with respect to children’s picky eating behaviors independent of the body type of the child.</p>
<p>All items, including those addressing behavioral strategies, were based on social–cognitive theory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412466673">13</xref></sup> They addressed ways to promote a child’s self-efficacy with respect to eating meals. The subscales included verbal persuasion, vicarious experiences, and mastery experiences as ways to increase children’s self-efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412466673">25</xref></sup> Indeed, researchers have found that children’s food consumption increased when parents persuaded children to try some of the foods presented in shared family meals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412466673">20</xref></sup> The use of vicarious experiences or modeling is recommended to parents to encourage children to eat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412466673">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The items included under passive coercion, the first subscale, assessed parent-centered strategies, which were negatively associated with children’s food intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412466673">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412466673">27</xref></sup> Therefore, mothers who frequently rely on passive coercion may be more controlling than are mothers who rely on behavioral strategies. However, the use of passive coercion was positively correlated with restriction and pressure to eat at the same correlation strength as was behavioral strategies. A previous study reported a correlation between the authoritative subscale of the CFSQ and the restriction (<italic>r</italic> = .16, nonsignificant) and pressure-to-eat (<italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) subscales of the CFQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412466673">28</xref></sup> Our data suggest that both behavioral strategies and passive coercion should be recommended to parents. However, these correlations were not strong, and future studies should focus on the association between passive coercion and children’s eating behaviors.</p>
<p>The use of punishment and reward was associated with negative parent and child behaviors. Moreover, this subscale showed the strongest positive correlation with restriction and pressure to eat, and this strategy was used more frequently than were behavioral strategies and passive coercion to alter children’s picky eating behavior. Previous studies have reported that increased use of restriction and pressure to eat was associated with adverse results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412466673">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412466673">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, permission allowed children to respond to internal cues of satiety/hunger and was negatively related to pressure to eat. Moreover, the mothers of children with many disliked foods were more likely to use permission. It is, however, possible that parents who frequently used permission displayed neglectful parenting in response to their children’s eating behavior. Hennessy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412466673">30</xref></sup> reported that a permissive feeding style, which is highly responsive to a child’s requests and places few demands on children, was associated with increased intake of low-nutrient-dense foods by children. Additionally, although the present study did not find an association between permission and children’s bodyweight, it did find that a permissive feeding style was related to higher body mass indices among children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412466673">31</xref></sup> Mothers who rely more of permission may give children their favorite snacks when the children do not eat meals. Future studies should explore the association between parental permission and snacking by children.</p>
<p>The present study has several limitations. First, this study relied solely on maternal self-reports. Second, because the size and composition of the sample were limited, additional studies with larger and more diverse samples are needed. Additionally, the results regarding validity should be further confirmed by using a different data set.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this is the first study to develop a scale of maternal feeding behaviors related to the encouragement of children to eat during mealtimes. The development of a comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool provides many new research directions. Moreover, the CMFBQ is easy to complete because it consists of only 18 items. This scale is an effective tool for researching parental feeding practices associated with meals and may be helpful for those in other countries dealing with children with picky eating habits. Whereas previous studies have focused on both maternal feeding behaviors and attitudes, the CMFBQ separates maternal feeding behaviors from maternal attitudes. The CMFBQ enables health practitioners to advise parents about positive feeding behaviors such as modeling, which previous measures did not address. It is our hope that these valid and reliable measures will help to clarify the effects of parental feeding practices.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study developed a new 18-item measure, the CMFBQ, which consists of 4 subscales related to maternal encouragement of children’s eating behaviors. This questionnaire measures maternal feeding behavior with respect to children’s picky eating behaviors, independent of the body type of the child. Furthermore, this questionnaire focuses on parental feeding behaviors, which may enable health practitioners to provide better advice to mothers who express anxiety about their children’s picky eating habits.</p>
