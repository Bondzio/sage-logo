<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: Exposure therapy has been identified as an effective treatment for anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The use of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in the past decade has increased due to improvements in virtual reality technology. VRET has been used to treat active duty service members and veterans experiencing posttraumatic stress symptoms by exposing them to a virtual environment patterned after the real-world environment in which the trauma occurred. This article is a systematic review of the effectiveness of using VRET with these two populations. <bold>Method</bold>: A search of 14 databases yielded 6 studies with experimental or quasi-experimental designs where VRET was used with active duty service members or veterans diagnosed with combat-related PTSD. <bold>Results</bold>: Studies show positive results for the use of VRET in treating combat-related PTSD, though more trials are needed with both active duty service members and veterans. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: VRET is an effective treatment, however more studies including random assignment are needed in order to show whether it is more effective than other treatments. There are still many barriers that the use of VRET with military populations would need to overcome in order to be widely used, including helping veterans become accustomed to the technology; assisting veterans who have spent a longer period of time avoiding anxiety-inducing stimuli in accepting an initial increase in anxiety; clinician concerns about the technology interfering with the therapeutic alliance, and clinician biases against the use of exposure therapy in general; and high treatment dropout rates.</p>

<body>
<p>Concern over the best methods to prevent and treat combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military service members and military veterans has been of particular interest with the resurgence of military service members who are serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Preventative programs such as comprehensive soldier fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612459891">Casey, 2011</xref>) acknowledge the need for the military services to have a more frank discussion with their service members about PTSD. The stigma within the military of a PTSD diagnosis prevents many service members from seeking treatment, even when they recognize the symptoms of PTSD in themselves. While military programs, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, have sought to educate service members and their families about the importance of seeking treatment for PTSD, the threat of having a diagnosis of PTSD on their service record stops many service members from seeking help. Some have been able to seek treatment outside of the military health care system, but such treatment can be costly. Another related population is military veterans who, like their present-day counterparts, did not seek treatment or for whom no appropriate treatment was available.</p>
<p>The preferred treatment for anxiety disorders is exposure therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612459891">Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008</xref>), also known as prolonged or gradual exposure therapy. Exposure therapy is a type of behavior therapy where the client is taught cognitive and behavioral techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, recognition of automatic thoughts and schemas, and cognitive restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612459891">Pull, 2005</xref>). The client is taught to utilize these interventions while the therapist gradually exposes the client to the cause of anxiety, increasing the intensity of exposure as the client is able to tolerate in order to help the client become more accustomed to the stimuli-evoking anxiety. Clients also undertake self-conducted exposure-based exercises as homework in between formal treatment sessions. Two types of exposure therapy have dominated the field: in vivo therapy, where the therapist and client are able to experience exposure to anxiety-evoking stimuli in increasingly naturalistic settings; and imaginal exposure therapy, where the therapist leads the client in imagining the cause of anxiety. Usually exposure therapy (ET) in imagination is followed by real-life exposure. These two types of exposure therapy are sometimes poorly tolerated by service members and veterans who have combat-related PTSD because of the distinctness of the settings in which the trauma occurred, and because of the tendency of clients to suppress thoughts that activate PTSD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612459891">Riva et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A relatively new exposure-based treatment for PTSD that has gained attention in the media and the therapeutic community is the use of virtual reality programs. Using virtual reality in place of real-life or imaginal exposure therapy allows clients to receive and process exposure to traumatic events in a relatively safe environment. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been tested with persons experiencing PTSD symptoms in multiple trials and with many different causes of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612459891">Gerardi, Cukor, Difede, Rizzo, &amp; Rothbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612459891">Pull, 2005</xref>). In their meta-analysis on the use of VRET for anxiety disorders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612459891">Powers and Emmelkamp (2008)</xref> found VRET to have a slightly more powerful effect than did real-life exposure treatment.</p>
<p>This review will assess studies of the effectiveness of VRET when used to treat service members and military veterans diagnosed with combat-related PTSD. It will also consider the practical use of the technology, including the cost of treatment and the possible application of VRET in the assessment and prevention of PTSD in active duty soldiers.</p>
<p>PTSD is a type of anxiety disorder brought on by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event or events. Traumatic events are defined by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612459891">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) as events “that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others” (p. 467). The response to the trauma also yields feelings of hopelessness, fear, or horror. The traumatic event must be reexperienced in some way, such as through nightmares or physical reactions to events resembling the trauma. There must also be an avoidance of stimuli that cause thoughts about the trauma and increased arousal, such as hypervigilance. These symptoms must have lasted for more than 1 month, and must be causing clinically significant distress for the individual.</p>
<p>Therapists using VRET to treat PTSD seek to simulate a virtual world that is as similar as possible to the real-world environment in which the traumatic event occurred. This is referred to as a “sense of presence” in the virtual world, or the level to which clients actually feel the virtual environment mirrors reality. In a qualitative study of clinician perceptions about VRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612459891">Kramer et al., 2010</xref>), clinicians expressed concern that the virtual environment would not be realistic enough in order to trigger and then reduce anxiety. However, in their evaluation study of the realism of two virtual Iraq scenarios, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612459891">Reger, Gahm, Rizzo, Swanson, and Duma (2009)</xref> conducted a convenience sample study with 93 soldiers not diagnosed with PTSD to see if the soldiers, who had been deployed to Iraq one or more times, felt this sense of presence. A majority of the soldiers rated the convoy scenario (86%) and the city environment (82%) from adequate to excellent.</p>
<p>VRET uses several technology-based methods to engage all five senses of the client, making the exposure feel as realistic as possible. The technology used generally includes a “controlled delivery of sensory stimulation via the therapist, including visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile cues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612459891">Gerardi et al., 2010</xref>, p. 299). Visual effects include being able to change the time of day, weather, number of pedestrians and vehicles, street debris, Humvees, planes, and helicopters clients see within the virtual world. Most of the machines include an orientation tracker, which allows clients to move about the virtual environment via headgear that responds to the movements of the participant. Olfactory senses are also engaged using scent palettes, which blow smells such as spices or burning rubber, and are controlled by the therapist. The therapist can also include sounds such as sirens, people crying, gunshots and mortars, helicopters, improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, car bombs, and sounds of an insurgent attack. In their narrative review of the many uses of VRET, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612459891">Gerardi et al. (2010)</xref> describe two scenarios available in their virtual Iraq:
<disp-quote>
<p>The city incorporates scenes such as marketplaces, security checkpoints, mosques, apartment buildings that can be entered, and rooftops that can be accessed. The Humvee scenario includes a desert setting with overpasses, checkpoints, debris, broken-down structures, and ambushes that can be introduced. (p. 303)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, clients’ seats are manipulated to create tactile vibrations in order to mimic a car ride, helicopter ride, or an explosion. An example of the equipment and virtual reality scenarios utilized in VRET can be seen in many media reports on the subject, such as a news report conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on the costs and benefits of VRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612459891">Virtual Iraq Afghanistan Media Story CBC, video file</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar virtual settings can be created for veterans of wars in other areas of the world. Specific to this article are virtual environments that mimic settings in Vietnam for veterans of the Vietnam War, and in Africa, where a war was fought by Portuguese soldiers in Africa between 1963 and 1970.</p>
<p>As explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612459891">Rothbaum, Hodges, Ready, Graap, and Alarcon’s (2001)</xref> article on the use of VRET with Vietnam veterans, VRET treatment spans several weeks of therapy, generally meeting twice a week for 90 to 120 min each session. The first session of VRET treatment is spent in assessing clients and gathering information about the traumatic event they experienced. Sessions 2 and 3 are spent in acclimatizing clients to the virtual reality equipment and environment, and in teaching clients cognitive behavioral interventions to practice when their symptoms increase, such as breathing and relaxation techniques. Further therapy sessions are spent in using the virtual environment to expose clients to traumatic memories while they describe the events in detail. Homework assigned to clients generally includes listening to recordings of the therapy sessions while practicing cognitive behavioral interventions learned in therapy.</p>
<p>Some who have been working on virtual reality technology have anticipated the use of it as an assessment tool to determine whether a soldier is emotionally and mentally fit to return for another tour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2012</xref>). Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612459891">Kraft, Amick, Barth, French, &amp; Lew, 2010</xref>) also anticipate the use of virtual reality in reassessing the driving ability of combat service members returning from Iraq or Afghanistan who have been diagnosed with PTSD or traumatic brain injury (TBI), as these two disorders may critically affect returning soldiers’ ability to drive. In these ways, virtual reality technology may benefit soldiers as an assessment tool, rather than solely a treatment for PTSD.</p>
<p>VRET has also been looked at as a prevention tool. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612459891">Stetz, Long, Wiederhold, and Turner (2008)</xref> conducted a study in which virtual reality and stress inoculation training were used to try and prevent medics who would be serving in Iraq or Afghanistan from later developing PTSD. Stress inoculation training consists of exposing the participant through virtual reality technology to traumatic events they may encounter in their future service in hopes that when they encounter similar traumatic events in reality they will be able to use their practiced cognitive behavioral skills to lessen their chances of developing PTSD in the future. While no distal measures of whether the stress inoculation training provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612459891">Stetz et al. (2008)</xref> are given, posttests suggest exposing military medics preemptively to stressful situations may harden them against trauma. Such a preventative effort may be useful to all military personnel, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612459891">Reger et al. (2009)</xref> report that 67% of a convenience sample (<italic>n</italic> = 93) of military service members had provided aid to persons who were wounded during their combat experience. Exposure to such secondary trauma can sometimes serve as the initiating event triggering the onset of PTSD; however, if service members were given preventative virtual reality stress inoculation training, their chances of developing PTSD due to this exposure may decrease.</p>
<p>One of the concerns of implementing virtual reality therapy on a wide-scale basis is the approximate cost of purchasing and setting up the virtual reality equipment and in training therapists to use the equipment effectively. In their preliminary results utilizing virtual reality technology with active duty soldiers with PTSD, Rizzo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612459891">Reger, Gahm, Difede, and Rothbaum (2009)</xref> approximate some of the costs of setting up an adequate amount of virtual reality equipment in order to make the virtual environment realistic enough to help effect change. However, the authors only provide actual dollar amounts regarding the Head Mounted Display (US$1500) and the Logitech control pad (&lt;US$120) that creates vibrations in the seat of the participant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612459891">Table 1</xref> is a list <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612459891">Rizzo et al. (2009)</xref> give of equipment needed to set up a virtual reality therapy environment. In an interview with CBC news, Rizzo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612459891">Virtual Iraq Afghanistan Media Story CBC, video file</xref>) estimates the total cost of virtual reality hardware to be approximately US$15,000, stating that the computer software for conducting VRET can be obtained through him at no cost.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612459891">Wood et al. (2009)</xref> articulate the possible financial benefits implementing virtual reality technology could have if the military were saved the money of having to replace service members who would have left the military due to PTSD symptoms. They estimated that the training cost savings for the 12 participants in their study would be just under US$330,000, whereas the training cost savings of treating PTSD with treatment as usual would be close to US$193,000.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612459891">Pull (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612459891">Riva et al. (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612459891">Gerardi et al. (2010)</xref> state that VRET may be more cost effective than imaginal or real-life exposure therapy because it can be less time-consuming. This may be because the technological equipment allows the clinician to have greater control over the magnitude of exposure in a virtual environment than they would have in trying to help the client imagine graded images of the trauma or feared object, thus taking less time overall to treat clients. Using virtual technology may also be less costly than trying to have a real-life experience with the client. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612459891">Gerardi et al.

<title>Common Measures Used to Assess PTSD in Military Service Members</title>
<p>The first, most common measure used in studying the effectiveness of treatment for PTSD is the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612459891">Gamito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612459891">Ready, Gerardi, Backsheider, Mascaro, &amp; Rothbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612459891">Ready, Pollack, Rothbaum, &amp; Alarcon, 2006</xref>). The CAPS is a measure that assesses the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms. Another measure commonly used with military service members is self-report PTSD Checklist, Military Version (PCL-M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612459891">Reger et al., 2011</xref>). The Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612459891">Gamito et al., 2010</xref>) is a self-report instrument that measures PTSD symptoms of avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal, and the Symptoms Checklist Revised (SCL-90-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612459891">Gamito et al., 2010</xref>) is used to measure psychopathology. Finally, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2012</xref>) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612459891">Gamito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612459891">Ready et al., 2006</xref>) are used to measure depression levels in clients, while the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2012</xref>) is used to measure anxiety levels in participants.</p>
<p>Therapists also use what are called Subjective Units of Discomfort/Distress Scale (SUDS) when using VRET. SUDS are generally not tracked or measured for experimental purposes, but are used to understand how the client is responding in the moment to the level of exposure in the virtual reality environment, and to decide if the level of exposure should be increased or decreased based on participant reactivity. Physiological monitoring through biofeedback is also often used to monitor client response to the virtual environment and, in one study in this review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612459891">Wood et al., 2008</xref>) was used to measure the effectiveness of VRET.</p>

<title>VRET With Active Duty Service Members</title>
<p>In their randomized controlled trial of VRET with active duty soldiers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612459891">McLay et al. (2011)</xref> used a convenience sample to locate potential patients. They assigned 20 service members to VRET (<italic>n</italic> = 10) or to treatment as usual (<italic>n</italic> = 10, with one participant not completing postassessment tests) using random assignment, and used the CAPS as their outcome measure. While the VRET intervention appeared to follow the standard VRET treatment protocol, the treatment as usual group was not assigned to any particular treatment. Rather, they were assigned to receive one or more of the treatments available for PTSD provided by the two hospital locations, which included prolonged exposure (PE) therapy, EMDR, group therapy, psychiatric medication management, substance rehab, and inpatient services. Unfortunately, only the number of mental health visits, and not what type of treatment the TAU patients were receiving, was tracked. The findings for this study may not, therefore, truly reflect the comparison between a VRET group and a TAU group, as we are unsure what type of treatment the TAU group specifically received. Also, the TAU group was, at some point, changed to a waiting-list group. It is unclear at what point this information was given to TAU group members, which may have affected their confidence in the TAU treatment they received. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612459891">McLay et al. (2011)</xref> found seven out of ten of the VRET patients improved at least 30% on their CAPS scores from pretest to posttest. There was no significant difference between CAPS scores after treatment; however, the authors found a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in the change from pretest to posttest mean scores between the VRET group (<italic>M</italic> = 35.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 24.7) and the TAU (<italic>M</italic> = 9.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 26.6) group, favoring VRET.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612459891">Reger et al. (2011)</xref> conducted a convenience sample study with 24 active duty soldiers diagnosed with PTSD (<italic>n</italic> = 18) or anxiety NOS (<italic>n</italic> = 6) who had been deployed at least once to Iraq or Afghanistan. The service members had either requested to receive VRET as a treatment or had received previous treatment for their disorder that was unsuccessful. The VRET was based on a training manual for the conduct of PE, delivered by a clinical psychologist with formal training in both VRET and PE. Patients received treatment a mean of 27.8 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.3) after the trauma, and received an average of 7.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.3) treatment sessions. Researchers used the self-report PCL-M to measure treatment outcomes, and found patients reported a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) improvement in PTSD symptoms from pretest (<italic>M</italic> = 60.92, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.03) to posttest (<italic>M</italic> = 47.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.7), with a large effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.17).</p>
<p>A quasi-experimental convenience sample study of 20 active duty service members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2012</xref>) used the PCL-M, PHQ-9, and BAI to measure PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety.

For <italic>n</italic> = 17 participants, scores on the PCL-M also showed a large effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 2.17) between baseline (<italic>M</italic> = 53.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.6) and 3-month follow up (<italic>M</italic> = 28.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.0). PHQ-9 scores at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 20, <italic>M</italic> = 13.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.4) and posttreatment (<italic>M</italic> = 7.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.7) were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .002), as was the difference between baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 17, <italic>M</italic> = 12.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.4) and 3-month follow up (<italic>M</italic> = 5.7, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>VRET With Veterans</title>
<p>In their study comparing VRET with present-centered therapy (PCT), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612459891">Ready et al. (2010)</xref> recruited clients currently in treatment at the Atlanta VA Medical Center’s Mental Health Clinic (<italic>n</italic> = 11, VRET <italic>n</italic> = 6, PCT <italic>n</italic> = 5), with one participant from each group dropping out. The clinician who interviewed participants was a licensed clinical psychologist with several years of experience working with this population and was blind to participant assignment. Clinicians used the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic>, the CAPS, and the Beck Depression Inventory as measures. PCT as the comparison group included psychoeducation about PTSD, problem-solving techniques, and a focus on the “here and now” problems clients experience. Both the VRET and PCT groups experienced improvement in symptoms; however, the authors report “there was not statistically significant improvement in CAPS or BDI scores when individual treatment conditions were isolated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612459891">Ready et al., 2010</xref>, p. 52). The authors state that the small sample size impeded significant differences between groups from being found. The VRET group seemed to have lower baseline CAPS scores (<italic>M</italic> = 87.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.43) than the PCT group (<italic>M</italic> = 101.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.51). This is likely an artifact of the random assignment procedure used with a small sample. The authors calculated effect sizes for the mean change in the CAPS and BDI scores for each group. The mean change in CAPS scores for the VRET treatment group yielded a small Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> of 0.28 from pretest to posttest (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> = 31.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 39.1) and a medium Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> of 0.56 from pretest to follow up (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> = 25.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 28.1). Differences in the mean improvement of BDI scores did not yield significant results. It is unclear why the authors chose to combine the treatment groups and use a dependent samples <italic>t</italic> test to compare changes in CAPS scores on the entire sample between baseline, post-treatment, and follow up. An independent samples <italic>t</italic> test of the same data for the VRET group at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> = 101.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.51), posttreatment (<italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>M</italic> = 75.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 22.22), and follow up (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> = 87.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.32), compared to the PCT group at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>M</italic> = 87.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.43), posttreatment (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> = 59.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 32.24), and follow up (<italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>M</italic> = 64.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 34.08) did not reveal any statistically significant differences.</p>

It is unclear why, but the SCL-90-R and BDI were not administered to the imaginal exposure and waiting list groups at baseline or posttreatment.

The IES-R scores for the VRET group were reduced, whereas these scores for the imaginal group and the waiting list control group increased, however the differences were not statistically significant.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies using VRET report several difficulties. First, the nature of the treatment itself appears to be difficult for veterans to either comprehend or trust. It is suspected that the current generation of service members may be reacting more positively to using virtual reality as a method of treating PTSD because they were raised in a generation more familiar with this type of technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612459891">Ready et al. (2010)</xref> describe the older veteran population as being tentative about trusting the technology to actually help with their PTSD symptoms.</p>
<p>Another difficulty in using VRET with a veteran population is the amount of time that has lapsed between the traumatic events and the treatment. Authors suspect the larger time lapse, in which participants have worked harder for a longer period of time to suppress their PTSD symptoms, causes participants to have a more difficult time in allowing themselves to relive the traumatic event in the virtual environment. As a reliving of the events multiple times is necessary in exposure therapy, this population has a much more difficult time in succeeding with exposure therapy in general. Though the clinicians explain to participants and their families that an increase in symptoms is likely to occur at the beginning of treatment, veterans seem to see this increase in symptoms as evidence that the treatment is worsening their condition and may cause many to terminate treatment. A qualitative study of clinician perceptions of VRET found clinicians not trained in the use of VRET expressed concerns about the safety of using VRET with veterans, questioning whether the virtual environment would exacerbate the symptoms of veterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612459891">Kramer et al., 2010</xref>). However, in their meta-analysis on the use of VRET with anxiety disorders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612459891">Powers and Emmelkamp (2008)</xref> conducted a meta-regression analysis which showed that an increase in the number of virtual reality treatment sessions yielded larger effects sizes. This difficulty in recruiting veterans as participants in trials using VRET has perhaps stunted possible improvements that could be made to treatment protocols that would benefit veterans. Case studies determining how VRET can be better tailored specifically to acclimatizing the veteran population to exposure therapy and to virtual reality technology may be necessary. There have also been high dropout rates in studies where participants are active duty service members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612459891">McLay et al., 2012</xref>), which could be attributed to difficulties in balancing treatment with military duties, the time commitment of treatment sessions (90-120 min twice weekly for 8-12 weeks), and the possibility of transfers to other military bases occurring mid-treatment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612459891">Kramer et al. (2010)</xref> also note that the use of virtual reality technology as a form of treatment may cause the therapeutic alliance to suffer as a result. Therapists expressed concern that multitasking conducting therapy and controlling complex computer software would prevent the development of an effective therapeutic relationship. Measurement of how VRET can either positively or negatively affect the therapeutic alliance may be useful in understanding how using a virtual environment can affect the usefulness of the relationship between therapist and client.</p>
<p>Overall, the studies in this review found VRET to be beneficial to both active duty service members and veterans experiencing combat-related PTSD. Each group has a different set of difficulties preventing them from seeking or receiving treatment, which is evidenced by high levels of attrition. It may also explain the difficulty in setting up experimental trials to test the efficacy of this treatment. Because the use of virtual reality technology is such a specific field, and because the purchase and training of virtual reality equipment expends both financial and time resources, the use of VRET in order to treat military service members and veterans for PTSD is not likely to spread quickly. While the actual cost of virtual reality technology is becoming less expensive, hesitation in the field over using exposure therapy in general, despite its positive results, will likely continue to hinder this form of treatment.</p>
<p>One last area where future studies using VRET may want to focus is the distal impact VRET may have. Treatment providers want to ensure positive treatment results continue over time. It has been suggested that studies follow veterans and service members who have been treated with VRET for up to 2 years in order to measure the distal effects of the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612459891">Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008</xref>). If positive distal effects of the treatment can be more readily established, the benefits of the treatment would perhaps balance out the difficulties seen in implementing it on a wide-scale basis.</p>
