<p><italic>Trauma</italic>, like all journals has changed and evolved since it was first published in 1999. In the years since then it has become recognised as a leading journal in its field. Trauma was originally established to provide access to review articles summarising the current state of knowledge across every aspect of the management of the trauma patient. In its first few years it published what we hope and believe was a stimulating mixture of review articles and historical pieces intended to appeal to the generality of trauma practitioners across all professions and specialties. As our circulation has grown, so our pool of authors has become increasingly international. In recent years we have added case reports to <italic>Trauma</italic> and we will be soon publishing short topic reviews which will be edited by our new editorial colleague Matt O’Meara.</p>
<p>As editors, we have found in recent years that we are been sent increasing numbers of papers detailing original research across all areas within clinical trauma. Although our initial intention was to remain true to the principals of publishing only high quality review material, we have now decided as Editors that the time has come for us to begin publishing original research. Such original research will stand alongside our ongoing commitment to publishing the best international reviews. I am delighted to say therefore that from late in 2013 we will be publishing in each issue a number of original research papers, since the flow of such copy is already sufficient to allow us to do this.</p>
<p>I hope that readers of the Journal will appreciate this change and that they will consider <italic>Trauma</italic> as a potential journal to which they might submit their own original research. Over the past 14 years <italic>Trauma</italic> has established itself firmly in the UK trauma community and we very much hope that this new development will strengthen the journal in the years to come.</p>
