<abstract>
<p>Survivor voice is essential to effectively implement survivor-focused IPV (intimate partner violence) services. In this focus group study, domestic violence survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 30) shared detailed perspectives as service seekers and recipients, whereas national hotline advocates (<italic>n</italic> = 24) explored relationships between service providers and survivors based on their interactions with both. Four thematic categories related to enhancing IPV services emerged: <italic>providing empathy, supporting empowerment, individualizing care</italic>, and maintaining ethical boundaries. Advocates identified additional factors that interfered with quality services, including the following: <italic>inadequate organizational resources, staff burnout, lack of training</italic>, and <italic>poor integration with other community resources</italic>. Respectful, empowering relationships are the centerpiece for quality IPV services.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Significant numbers of women, children, and men are affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212437137">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). Although IPV has historically been viewed as a social problem confined to individual households, attitudes about the prevalence and acceptability of IPV have changed dramatically. Correspondingly, community-based services for IPV victims have become much more widely available over the past several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212437137">Shephard &amp; Pence, 1999</xref>). The expansion of IPV services can be in large part attributed to the broad success of the battered women’s movement. This grassroots feminist movement views widespread violence against women as having both personal and political solutions rooted in dismantling gender-based societal inequalities. Early domestic violence advocates provided refuge and empowerment for individual battered women, and at the same time they pushed to change laws and increased public funding for domestic violence services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212437137">Schechter, 1982</xref>). The passage and subsequent reauthorizations of the Violence Against Women Act opened up significant levels of federal funding for domestic violence services, including the provision of more than US$125 million for shelters in the 2006 budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212437137">Laney, 2005</xref>). This legislation only accelerated historical trends and, as a result, both the demand for, and the availability of, IPV services increased greatly in most communities across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212437137">Schechter, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to positive effects, many policies and programs have also had unintended negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212437137">Danis, 2003</xref>). For example, proarrest and no-drop policies were developed to encourage law enforcement to take domestic violence assaults more seriously by requiring the imposition of criminal sanctions on perpetrators. Unfortunately, these same policies have unintended consequences, such as the loss of perpetrators’ financial contributions to the family, which potentially disempower and create barriers for certain victims. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212437137">McDermott and Garofalo (2004)</xref> discuss,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>harsher and more certain punishment of a husband or lover will not empower a victim who simply wants the violence (not the relationship) to end, nor will victim services help a victim who wants to be left alone. (p. 1246)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, when the success of IPV interventions are measured narrowly, using outcomes such as leaving the abusive relationship, survivors are similarly disempowered, and more incremental progress toward their own goals is often hampered or rendered invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212437137">Dienemann, Campbell, Landenburger, &amp; Curry, 2002</xref>). The prevailing model of crisis services where shelter survivors receive shelter for between 30 and 90 days also optimistically assumes that survivors—even those who with low income or have small children—will be able to achieve financial and housing stability within that short period of time.</p>
<p>Some domestic violence experts have been calling for a critical examination of current policies and programs. Notably, Davies and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437137">Davies, Lyons, &amp; Monti-Catania, 1998</xref>) recommend that domestic violence service delivery be realigned from “service-defined advocacy,” where women’s needs are identified in terms of available services, to “woman-defined advocacy,” where needs are identified related to the specific circumstances and priorities of the woman seeking help. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212437137">Goodman and Epstein (2009)</xref> advise that all IPV services be developed with consideration of three guiding principles: <italic>voice, community</italic>, and <italic>economic empowerment</italic>. Service providers incorporate <italic>voice</italic> by responding to the particular contextualized need of individual survivors. They take <italic>community</italic> into account when they value relationships that support victim safety. A focus on <italic>economic empowerment</italic> is achieved when advocates prioritize solutions targeted at battered women for whom poverty creates additional hurdles (p. 135). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212437137">Elliot, Bjelajac, Fallot, Markoff, and Reed (2005)</xref> encourage service providers to conduct an audit of all agency policies and procedures to assure that an empowering and healing environment is fostered for both service recipients and staff. Utilizing trauma theory, they have generated 10 principles to guide service provision and create a setting that is “respectful, welcoming, safe, and helpful” and reduces systemic triggers and opportunities for retraumatization.</p>
<p>A common thread in these models is the centering of survivors’ needs within all aspects of IPV services. Thus, survivors’ voices and experiences are crucial in developing and implementing woman- or survivor-focused services. In this article, we analyze data from a unique sample of domestic violence survivors and national domestic violence hotline advocates. Survivors shared detailed perspectives as service seekers and recipients, and advocates shared their view of the “big picture” based on their many interactions with both survivors and providers nationally. Utilizing these dual perspectives we identified four thematic categories related to enhancing IPV services and four factors that seemed to interfere with the provision of quality services.</p>

<sec id="section2-1077801212437137" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This project utilized focus groups, a qualitative data collection method that involves bringing a group of homogeneous participants together with a moderator to discuss a particular topic or issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212437137">Berg, 2004</xref>). Focus groups allow for the generation of a large number of ideas gathered in a manner that reduces the power differential between researchers and participants. This advantage was a critical consideration for working with survivors who have been disempowered in many of their interactions. The methodology, which is described in more detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212437137">Bell &amp; Kulkarni, 2006</xref>), included a total of eight focus groups, four with advocates (<italic>n</italic> = 24) recruited from a national hotline and four with survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 30) recruited from a local multisite, multiservice agency for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. We initially attempted to recruit a more diverse sample of survivors, including those who were not receiving services, those in same-sex relationships, and people with disabilities, but found that the effort was exceeding the time and financial resources available to the project. This limitation is somewhat offset by the experiences of the hotline advocates who had provided services to a broad spectrum of survivors. Using these two samples allowed us to access first-hand experiences of survivors using a local service as well as an assessment of services nationwide by a group of experienced hotline advocates.</p>
<sec id="section3-1077801212437137">
<title>Sampling and Recruitment</title>
<p>Hotline advocates were recruited via email and received an incentive of US$50 for their participation. IPV survivors were recruited by a bilingual recruiter via flyers and word of mouth. Survivor participants received US$35 in gift cards for their participation in order to minimize any inadvertent coercive effect on the mostly low-income survivors, which is why incentives for survivors were less than those for advocates. Child care was provided for survivor participants. Maximum variation sampling was employed to include the perspectives of staff in different job categories and survivors who varied across important dimensions, including ethnic, racial, and language groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212437137">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Separate groups were conducted for African American survivors and Spanish-speaking survivors. All participants provided informed consent. The study was conducted with Institutional Review Board approval.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077801212437137">
<title>Sample description</title>
<p>Most advocate participants were female (87%), and approximately half were European American. Overall, this was an experienced group of advocates, with three quarters of the participants reporting having worked as an advocate more than 1 year. A majority of advocates had at least a college degree, and many possessed a graduate degree. Advocates worked a variety of shifts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212437137">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Focus Group Questions</title>
<p>Separate focus group scripts were developed for the survivor groups and the advocate groups. Survivors were asked about the process by which they realized that they needed help, the types of help needed, and their ranking of service needs and identification of helpful and unhelpful services. Advocates were asked about the types of calls they received, the services required by these different types of calls, their ranking of service needs and service availability, as well as identification of regional variations in services. All groups were asked about special needs of survivors from specific populations, such as ethnic or cultural groups, as well as survivors with special circumstances, such as survivors with disabilities, and about the advice they would give to IPV service providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077801212437137">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>All groups were conducted by the primary researchers except the Spanish-speaking survivor group, which was conducted by an experienced bilingual IPV counselor, a bilingual recruiter who took notes, and a translator/transcriber who took process notes and transcribed the focus group into English. All focus groups were audiotaped and then transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077801212437137">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Transcriptions were spot checked by the researchers for accuracy against their notes and the audiotapes and then coded by attaching a word or phrase to capture the meaning of each unit of transcription text. The researchers used N6, a qualitative analysis software program, to code transcripts onscreen and manage the analysis database. Two researchers created an initial list of codes by reading a single transcript, developing codes, and comparing them until there was consensus. These codes were then applied to subsequent interviews. Additional codes and subcodes were developed as new information emerged from the transcripts. Researchers met and discussed the coding process at regular intervals. After all the transcribed material was coded, the coded material was examined and grouped together into themes, comparing and contrasting responses between the survivor group and the advocate group. Two additional researchers participated in review of revised themes, and the research team discussed, revised, and achieved consensus on the revised categories. No significant thematic differences were detected between the Spanish speaking, African American, and other groups.</p>
<p>A summary of advocate findings and a summary of survivor findings were created. These were then shared with a small group of research participants who had volunteered to review and comment on emerging findings, a process called “member checking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212437137">Berg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212437137">Padgett, 1998</xref>), designed to increase the trustworthiness of the findings. Three member-check groups were conducted—one with advocates, one with English- speaking survivors, and one with Spanish-speaking survivors—in which we presented preliminary findings and additional analyses. There were no substantive disagreements with the summary findings. An incentive of US$25 was provided for participants who reviewed the findings. Participant responses from these groups were incorporated into the analysis and findings of the study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077801212437137">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Survivors and advocates described both helpful and unhelpful service experiences with local service providers. Elsewhere, we have described the barriers that survivors encounter when attempting to access services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212437137">Kulkarni, Bell, &amp; Wylie, in press</xref>). However, survivors and advocates also raised issues about the quality of the relationship between the survivor and the service provider rather than simply the type of service provided. These will be discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section9-1077801212437137">
<title>Qualities of Helpful Resources</title>
<p>Based on the experiences of survivors and advocates, four distinct thematic categories emerged that captured the ways in which providers enhanced service delivery: <italic>providing empathy, supporting empowerment, individualizing care</italic>, and maintaining ethical boundaries. Each of these will be described in turn.</p>
<sec id="section10-1077801212437137">
<title>Providing empathy</title>
<p>Survivors emphasized their strong desire to be treated with understanding and compassion when seeking help. They stressed the importance of being heard and treated with respect. They characterized this treatment using various terms, including “sympathy,” “empathy,” “understanding,” “encouraging,” “having a good attitude,” and “treating them as human beings.” When asked the one thing she would tell service providers, one survivor captured the sentiments of many participants when she said, “I would just tell them [service providers] don’t be judgmental, be understanding, and just listen.” Most offered high praise for services they had received through the local domestic violence agency whose staff they felt were trained to be “empathetic, not sympathetic.” One of the survivors contrasted the empathetic treatment that she experienced at the domestic violence agency to the treatment received from police who “make you feel like a criminal.” For these women, many of whom had been isolated by their abusers, this desire for basic human acknowledgment and connection was striking and at times dictated where survivors turned for resources. For example, one survivor described choosing to call the domestic violence hotline instead of 911 during an emergency because “it would be nice to talk to a person instead of a recording.”</p>
<p>Advocates also emphasized the importance of empathetic treatment for survivors. One advocate described a caller’s grateful response at the end of a hotline call:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[quoting survivor] “Your organization has been like the first one that has actually just listened to me and I appreciate that.” . . . it was also a good reminder for me in that there was really like some power in just holding that space for people and listening to them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Advocates were complimentary of the majority of domestic violence services, yet they also appreciated how difficult it was for domestic violence service providers to consistently provide empathetic care. In response to frustrated attempts to find shelter for survivors, one advocate exhorted service providers to be more empathetic of client situations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Please be a compassionate and active listener . . . if like that one message can be put out, the services will be improved greatly, you know, because it’s just about your attitude. Maybe your agency can’t provide accommodations, but you know, you can understand their difficult situation. There’s been times when [calling shelters on a survivor’s behalf] we don’t even finish our sentence [when we hear], “We don’t have space!” That’ll be the response. I mean, not even like, “Well, we don’t have room right now but let me give you another number.” “We don’t have space!” It’s just the tone, the attitude . . . and it’s burnout. I mean this job is very stressful emotionally, so I can understand.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most advocates, some of them former shelter workers themselves, acknowledged the stressful nature of shelter crisis work that they felt was even greater than their own because shelter services were delivered face to face:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Advocate 1:</speaker>
<p>I can say this, is that the burnout is a little bit more quicker because they [provide] direct services, and they deal with all these people every day, they deal with all these women every single day and so I can understand how they can be short sometimes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Advocate 2:</speaker>
<p>Our calls end.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Advocate 3:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, we can hang up.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Advocate 1:</speaker>
<p>We never see the person, we don’t have the connection. We can refer them to service, but we don’t have to make sure they get it, and take them somewhere or [provide] counseling sessions with them.</p>
</speech>
<p>As both survivors and advocates emphasized, survivors had been dehumanized, belittled, and demeaned in their relationships with abusers, making it critically important that service providers offer the human touch. In the rush to provide critical concrete services, it was easy to forget how healing and validating being listened to was for survivors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077801212437137">
<title>Individualizing care</title>
<p>Although survivors often needed significant resources, such as physical shelter and childcare, they also valued the small, but essential items that made life easier for their families. One survivor described some of the things shelter staff provided for her and her children, such as toys, hairbrush, and makeup during her stay. Because so many survivors had fled their homes, often without much planning, they had few of the things that they needed upon arriving at shelter. As one survivor stated, “I didn’t even think about the fact that I’d need a toothbrush. They gave me a toothbrush and I was like ‘Oh yeah, I need a toothbrush.’” Mothers also appreciated that the shelter was set up so that residents’ children could play with one another.</p>
<p>In general, survivors expressed appreciation that their needs, large and small, were taken seriously. Once in an environment where the families’ needs were met, these survivors felt they could then begin to make plans and entertain hope for the future. According to one survivor, “I needed to be allowed to rest and think about it.” When service providers attended to details, survivors felt cared for and able to focus on more foundational issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801212437137">
<title>Supporting empowerment</title>
<p>In addition to nonjudgmental acceptance, survivors found it helpful when service providers reinforced survivors’ rights and abilities to make choices for themselves. This type of support appeared critical for survivors as they attempted to restore a sense of self-efficacy after being denigrated in their relationships, sometimes for years:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you go somewhere and they make you feel like you’re dumb, or like, “What are you doing here in the first place?” then it makes you feel like, “Well I can’t do this, how am I gonna do this on my own if no one thinks I can do this on my own?” So it really changes your outlook on when you enter [the shelter] . . . [you think] “Well, I can get back into the step and get back into things,” and it’s helped a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another survivor described her work with her advocate as helping her to identify options and make a new plan for her life: “For me it was like a plan of action, getting back into where I needed to be . . . . That’s where I had to come back to, the reality that it’s all about me.” Advocates also described the importance of helping callers to cope successfully in difficult situations: “They’re [survivors] also looking for strategies. I had one woman talk to me today. She was like, ‘How do I get out of this?’ She was like, ‘I don’t even know where to begin. Where do I start?’” Safety planning was viewed as a process that was unique to individual survivors’ goals, situations, and resources. In addition, survivors appreciated when advocates and other service providers supported their longer-term coping strategies as well.</p>
<p>Survivors also expressed their preference for being given choices throughout the help-seeking process. One survivor felt that agencies should provide options even in terms of allowing the survivor to have choices around who to talk to on the hotline. For survivors, seeing choices engendered both empowerment and responsibility as they realized their futures were now largely in their own hands.</p>
<p>Survivors who reviewed the findings for this study also emphasized the importance of transparency of agency policies and decision making. Survivors wanted to know what services were available and how to access them. When services, such as supportive housing, were limited survivors needed to know how the agency made decisions about which clients would receive the services. Without this agency transparency, survivors felt their ability to make choices was constrained.</p>
<p>One advocate described the ways in which supporting survivor empowerment defined her helping role, even when this approach made survivors initially more uncomfortable. She recounted this conversation with a client:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m not here to tell you that you need to leave. I’m not here to judge you for what your relationship is. You have to decide what you want. You have to decide what’s important to you, and what kind of relationship it is. It’s just important for you to realize that the chances of certain things changing is low because it’s hard. It’s not about impossibility of change, it’s about what it takes to change.” And she didn’t like hearing that. She was really sad. I ended it with, “You know, this is your life. You have to decide, no one could tell you what to do.” Which made it, I think, more difficult for her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another advocate eloquently summarized the orientation of these advocates as “less of a social service . . . and more of a survivor-directed service.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077801212437137">
<title>Maintaining ethical boundaries</title>
<p>Largely because of the shame survivors experienced about their situations, confidentiality was very important to them. A survivor who disclosed abuse to a counselor at her children’s school reported, that “Things spilled out into the people that worked there, into the parents that were going there, and to me that’s just really embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Another survivor described how a couples’ counselor confused a professional relationship with a personal one and made friends with the survivor and her abuser, making that counselor ineffective in the eyes of the survivor. A third survivor agreed, making her own connection between professionalism and trust, and said, “You approach them [counselors] because you think they’re professionals. . . . But then it backfires and you don’t even know that it happened. . . .” Because their intimate relationships have been characterized by abuse and betrayal, survivors needed relationships with clear, appropriate boundaries and assurances of safety and confidentiality.</p>
<p>An advocate offered another cautionary tale of how the perception of a caller’s relationship with her therapist undermined her efforts to win custody of her son:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>During the custody dispute they didn’t accept her therapist’s diagnosis and her therapist’s word about how she was doing because she had been in therapy so long and so they argued that the therapist and the client had become friends over the years, and so it was no longer a clinical relationship, and her child had been taken away.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clear boundaries and confidentiality are central to all helping relationships. However, because survivors of IPV experience deception, betrayal, and emotional abuse as part of the violence, maintaining the therapeutic frame is doubly important.</p>

<sec id="section14-1077801212437137">
<title>Challenges to Providing High-Quality Care</title>
<p>Although survivors offered insights about challenges to quality services, their perspectives were often limited to their own situations. Advocates had a broader perspective drawn from their professional experiences with survivors and domestic violence service providers across the nation and over time. They identified several factors that seemed to interfere with quality services, including the following: <italic>inadequate organizational resources, staff burnout, lack of training</italic>, and <italic>poor integration with other community resources</italic>.</p>
<p>Advocates noted many shelters, especially rural shelters, operated with limited or inadequate funding and staff. Thus, staff and volunteers who delivered services were often placed in difficult and sometimes untenable situations as they made decisions about how to allocate client resources and respond to immediate client needs. One advocate described the dilemmas inherent in the service delivery scenario at such a shelter: “If there is the hotline at the shelter and there’s one advocate on duty and she’s running to the back to referee a fight and the phone is ringing. . . .” In addition, when service providers were placed in the position of having to ration scarce resources, it complicated their interactions with survivors. Shelter workers might prioritize services to survivors they deemed most at risk; however, in doing so they might marginalize and thus increase the risk of survivors not perceived to be in immediate danger:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Advocate 1:</speaker>
<p>Shelters have to take the most extreme cases, you know, the life-threatening [cases] and cases with just the physical violence. But so often times women say that the emotional and the verbal [abuse] is worse. You know, they’ll say, “Well, I wish he would just hit me and get it over with.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Advocate 2:</speaker>
<p>A lot of batterers seem to have become very canny about avoiding breaking the law.</p>
</speech>
<p>Advocates also noted that survivors desperate for shelter might present themselves in ways that increase the likelihood that they receive services. For example,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve also heard women, not exaggerate necessarily, but sort of talk about how horrible and awful their life is to try and . . . you know, thinking that I’ll be able to help them more if they tell me, you know, about ten horrible things that happened.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Advocates noted that domestic violence workers are often making decisions and providing services within this difficult context without adequate training or support and that this can easily result in burnout. Other advocates suggested that some service providers could benefit from “training in how to inter-relate to the survivors” or in providing culturally competent care for survivor populations across racial-ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, gender, and ability differences.</p>
<p>Services were also perceived as less effective when they were delivered in isolation from other community resources. One advocate argued that improving relationships and coordination between domestic violence and other community service providers improved the overall quality of care for survivors:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think that organizations have to work with each other. I think shelters have to work with the places that the women are employed at, if they are employed . . . they need to be aware of the hospitals and know nurses at the hospitals, and the nurses at the hospitals have to know about the shelter . . . they have to be aware of the multifaceted needs that they have.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Advocates noted that communities with more limited resources struggled even more in meeting the multiplicity of survivor needs.</p>
<p>Finally, advocates seemed aware of the luxuries of their positions working in a stably resourced and supportive work environment. Though diverse in many respects, advocates at this organization were for the most part better paid, younger, and more highly educated than their local domestic violence service provider peers. One advocate reflected on her biases as a direct service provider in an urban area. She recounted making a referral to a rural shelter and noted that the client information that she wanted to share was not relevant to her rural shelter counterpart who only wanted to know whether the survivor had been physically assaulted.</p>
<p>Despite their differences with other domestic violence service providers, hotline advocates identified with the stress and toll that crisis work takes on domestic violence service providers. One advocate reflected on the high turnover in hotline advocates in their organization:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean this job is very stressful emotionally, so I can understand at one point, but we need to somehow incorporate ways that people can de-stress, decompress, so we can continue this work. Because we have so much expertise here, but how many of us are going to be gone next year because we can’t handle stress anymore?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Advocates also described the helpfulness of a newly instituted wellness program that was designed to help staff cope with the stressful nature of their work:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Right now they’ve provided this wellness program for us which has been so wonderful, and everything she says I’m like a sponge, and I try to put it into practice in my own wellness every day with the callers. It’s awesome.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These advocates also seemed to benefit from seeing their work within the context of a larger movement against domestic violence. One advocate reflected upon what she learned at a statewide domestic violence conference:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’ve kind of moved to a social service model of providing services for victims of domestic violence rather than the grassroots model of listening to the victim, to them, as to what are their needs and how we can help provide those needs for them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this reflection, the advocate is talking about a return to basics in working with survivors—focusing on a relationship between the survivor and the service provider that provides respect and safety for the survivor to make her own choices about how to address the violence in her life.</p>

<sec id="section15-1077801212437137" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As domestic violence services have expanded, so has the community demand for service, increasing pressures on individual service providers, domestic violence agencies, and the battered women’s movement at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212437137">Schechter, 1982</xref>). Some domestic violence services and policies have unintended negative consequences on survivors, at times undermining the goals of empowerment and healing to which the domestic violence movement is unequivocally committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212437137">Goodman &amp; Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212437137">McDermott &amp; Garofalo, 2004</xref>). It is time to review and redefine the essential qualities of IPV services to meaningfully incorporate these definitions into programming, evaluation, and policy making.</p>
<p>Notably, both advocates and survivors concurred that the way that survivors were treated mattered as much, if not more, than whether service providers were actually able to provide concrete resources. These findings suggest that relational aspects of service delivery such as active listening, supportive presence, and empowerment are at times undervalued, particularly in IPV services where the fear of lethal violence and the provision of physical shelter is often such a priority. Our findings are congruent with both relational cultural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212437137">Miller &amp; Stiver, 1997</xref>) and trauma theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212437137">Herman, 1997</xref>), which view the relationship itself as the vehicle for healing from interpersonal trauma, such as battering. These theoretical frameworks are well aligned with the feminist philosophies of the battered women’s movement, and thus, can effectively guide and reinforce the development of IPV best practices. Renewing domestic violence advocates’ focus on facilitating empowering and empathetic relationships with survivors must be a priority regardless of other services rendered. As many funders are focusing on the delivery of evidence-based practices, service providers must take care not to implement these practices in a manner that undermines collaborative relationships in favor of prescribed techniques, skills, and knowledge. Program evaluation should incorporate measures of efficacy that take the nature of the relationships between survivors and advocates into account.</p>
<p>As service providers engage in more mutual and collaborative relationships with their survivor clients, they must also maintain ethical boundaries. Not only do such boundaries protect survivors, but clearly defining the helping role is important for service providers as well. Clear boundaries can help prevent service providers from slipping into the category of overinvolved friend, parental or authority figure, or rescuer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212437137">Pearlman &amp; Saakvitne, 1995</xref>). By understanding that survivors are fundamentally in charge of their own lives, some service providers may be freed from a false sense of responsibility for their clients’ safety and well-being.</p>
<p>In addition, efforts to enhance service quality should be approached in a strengths-based manner that addresses structural and systemic barriers. More important, hotline advocates identified barriers to quality care that included <italic>inadequate organizational resources, staff burnout, lack of training</italic>, and <italic>poor integration with other community resources</italic>. These barriers should be addressed at both an individual program and the wider policy level. Although coordinated community response, which promotes integration of community resources, has been emphasized as a priority by funders and policy makers throughout the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212437137">Shephard &amp; Pence, 1999</xref>), there has been far less focus on the other factors identified. Domestic violence advocates perform a difficult job and frequently do so with minimal resources, learning by trial and error. Crisis workers are even more vulnerable to becoming demoralized as they experience the unending requests for services as “unmeetable” (Rhodes, personal communication). Research has consistently shown that work stress among human service workers contributes to burnout and job turnover (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212437137">Barak, Nissly, &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>). However, service providers also bring strengths such as how they cope, personal motivation, and the experience of resolving their own traumas, which, when supported and encouraged in the workplace, also help them manage the stress and make them powerful allies for survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212437137">Bell, 2003</xref>). Increasing staffing levels and resources for staff training and development should be a priority for domestic violence agencies, state coalitions, and funders. Allowing domestic violence service providers at all levels of the organization to share in administrative and program decision making may provide protection from secondary traumatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212437137">Slattery &amp; Goodman, 2009</xref>) while simultaneously strengthening a commitment to underlying feminist organizational principles. Furthermore, creating a work environment that acknowledges the stress of working with survivors, provides trauma-specific education and training, adequate supervision and peer support, reasonable workloads, and opportunities for self-care can help mitigate some of the vicarious trauma that can affect service providers working with survivors of interpersonal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212437137">Bell, Kulkarni, &amp; Dalton, 2003</xref>). Decisions about service expansion must be weighed carefully, attending to the adequacy of resources for existing services.</p>
<p>As a group, survivors were more understanding when they were denied services due to a lack of resources than when they perceived themselves as being treated with disrespect or indifference. Hotline advocates connected “lack of resources” as contributing to shelter workers’ experiences of work stress and, in the worst cases, leading to poor treatment of survivors. Although survivors and service providers might coalesce around their shared interest in increasing resources for domestic violence services, understandably and ironically resource limitations can also create strong tensions between these groups. Some service providers explain the mismatches between survivors’ needs and available services, by critiquing individual survivors as unmotivated, inappropriate for services, or not having legitimate needs rather than critiquing the inadequacy or lack of flexibility of available services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437137">Davies et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212437137">Donnelly, Cook, Van Ausdale, &amp; Foley, 2005</xref>). Such attributions must be forcefully challenged and efforts redirected toward improving existing services through increased funding and reform. Furthermore, staff should be supported in venting their frustrations in appropriate ways and toward the appropriate source, rather than toward vulnerable survivors.</p>
<p>Domestic violence service providers struggle to balance access to crisis services with providing a broader array of services that allow women to escape violence long term. Often basic services such as crisis shelter and counseling are offered, whereas longer-term services, including transitional housing, transportation, and economic development, are much more difficult for survivors to access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212437137">Kulkarni et al., in press</xref>). Furthermore, survivors may not prioritize abuse above other concerns, such as children, connection with community, or financial security (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212437137">Lein, Jacquet, Lewis, Cole, &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212437137">Tolman &amp; Raphael, 2000</xref>). Domestic violence service providers must have a broad sense of their mission to address women’s needs in their totality, respecting individual survivors’ perceptions of their needs and preferred solutions.</p>
<p>These findings should be considered within the limitations of the study methods. Focus groups can quickly generate fairly nuanced perceptions of a phenomenon, but the method used does not allow for generalization of the study findings to all IPV survivors. The survivor participants in this study were clients of a large, well-funded domestic violence shelter, and so their perspectives about what constitutes high-quality services might necessarily be different from survivors who do not seek services, who are newly seeking services, or who were not able to access shelter services. Furthermore, although we actively recruited survivor participants with diverse experiences, members of some important groups such as gay, lesbian, and transgendered survivors, deaf survivors, and survivors with mobility impairments are not represented here. The addition of the perspectives of national hotline advocates, who serve a national sample of survivors, provides some additional information about the broad spectrum of survivor needs but does not guarantee that these findings represent the experiences of all IPV survivors.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the survivors and providers in our study suggest the need to return to basics in working with survivors of IPV. There is no “one size fits all” model for survivors, and according to the participants in our study, <italic>how</italic> they receive assistance is as important as <italic>what</italic> they receive. Service providers should focus on providing survivors with safety and choice in the context of a relationship with clear boundaries that is respectful, supportive, and emotionally connected. Such an orientation has implications for service delivery philosophy as well as for staff training. Providers should develop program delivery standards that articulate expectations around empathetic and empowering interactions with clients. Staff need regular training that supports skill development in the areas of ethical boundaries and self-care. Funders, especially governmental, should increase the focus on service quality and broaden the definition of client satisfaction to include not only satisfaction with the services provided but also the way the services were provided. Our findings suggest that specific qualities of how services are provided can have an impact in and of themselves. Funders should also recognize the value of, and provide support to, wellness programming such as employee assistance programs. State and national coalitions are uniquely positioned to provide training resources that are scarce at the local level.</p>
<p>This study adds to the growing interest in survivor-focused services by identifying key elements that survivors and frontline advocates themselves have associated with effective IPV services. Focus group participants emphasized the importance of providing IPV survivors with empathetic, empowering, and individualized care within the context of ethical relationships with service providers. The themes identified in this study—<italic>providing empathy, supporting empowerment, individualizing care</italic>, and <italic>maintaining ethical boundaries</italic>—all resonate strongly with recent literature calling for the reconceptualization of current IPV services and policies. Women-centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212437137">Davies et al., 1998</xref>), survivor-focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212437137">Goodman &amp; Epstein, 2009</xref>), and trauma-informed service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212437137">Elliott et al., 2005</xref>) articulates a framework that orients services toward goals more consistent with previous feminist activism. The voices of survivors and advocates in this study contribute additional support to this body of literature. Furthermore, framing themes in terms of the potential challenges articulated by the advocates opens up new avenues for strengthening IPV staff development, supervision, and assessment.</p>
