<abstract>
<p>A victimization experience may turn the world of a victim upside down. In the aftermath of the victimization incident, the reactions and help from others may have important effects on the recovery of the victim. The way victims experience and interpret their victimization and how they cope with it can be influenced by the reactions of others. However, before another person can help the victim, or before another person can make the victimization experience even worse due to his or her reaction to the victim, the victim has to tell this person about the victimization experience. This article focuses on the persons and agencies mid-adolescents turn to on becoming a victim. Based on a paper-and-pencil school survey in Ghent, Belgium among 557 14–16-year-old pupils, this study shows that mid-adolescent victims of theft, violence and extortion turn in the first instance to parents and peers. Concerning formal agencies, the results indicate that mid-adolescents are barely aware of the existence of assistance services and that they report victimization to the police only to a small degree.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As well as the financial, material and psychological consequences of becoming a victim, the nature and the circumstances of the incident, the perception of the victim and his or her personal characteristics, reactions and help from others may determine the recovery of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269758011432966">Ruback and Thompson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269758011432966">Spalek, 2006</xref>). Support and help from persons and agencies the victim comes into contact with are crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269758011432966">Kemshall and Pritchard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269758011432966">Shapland, 1988</xref>). However, the formal and informal reactions of others may not only support the recovery of the victim, but may also have a negative influence and make recovery more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269758011432966">Rosenbaum, 1987</xref>). The reactions, help and support of others may then be considered as an ‘environmental buffer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Kendall-Tackett, 2008</xref>: 85) or as a ‘moderator’ who intervenes between talking about the incident and the impact of the incident on the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269758011432966">Norris et al., 1997</xref>). However, before someone may help the victim or in the worst-case scenario may victimize the victim a second time, this person has to know about the victimization experience. So the first question is, ‘To whom do victims appeal?’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269758011432966">2</xref>
</sup> This article focuses on the people mid-adolescent victims turn to when they are victimized. First, the question is addressed as to whether mid-adolescent victims tell others about the incident. Secondly, if they do tell other people about their victimization experience, whom do they tell first and why? Attention is hereby especially paid to appealing to people from their own social network as there is not much known about this; research about help-seeking is foremost about formal help-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269758011432966">McCart et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, some reflections are made about the extent to which mid-adolescent victims know about the existence of help and support services. Finally, police reporting is discussed: do mid-adolescent victims of crime report their victimization to the police and why do they (not) report?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269758011432966">
<title>Theoretical backdrop and previous research</title>
<p>It is known from previous research that adolescents report little to the police, even less than adults do. Some authors speak about the underreporting of victimization of young people, compared to adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Ormrod, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Wolak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>). There can be many reasons why mid-adolescent victims do not report their victimization to the police, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al. (2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>) divide into definitional, jurisdictional, developmental, emotional/attitudinal and material factors. Definitional reasons are about the definition and perception of the incident and the question whether the incident is considered as a crime and something that may be of interest for the police. Jurisdictional reasons are about authority: youngsters are confronted with other authorities than the police as, for example, their school may deal with the incident. Developmental reasons are connected with the development of the youngster: adults may report the victimization incident instead of the adolescent or may advise them not to report. Examples of emotional or behavioural reasons are shame, fear of reprisal and concern about secondary victimization. Finally, there may be material reasons like the loss of time and money.</p>
<p>Next to the police – a component of the criminal justice system – victims can, if they so wish, turn to assistance services not related to the criminal justice system. However, where it concerns adolescent victims, little is known about their appeal to those services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269758011432966">Morgan and Zedner (1992</xref>: 145) state that there is a lot written about the extent of help and support given by agencies external to the criminal justice system for adult victims but <italic>‘</italic>conversely, discussion about the effects of crime on children, the types of help they need and the extent to which it is available has hitherto been comparatively meager’.</p>
<p>Next to the police and assistance services, the social network of the victim (parents, family, friends, teachers etc.) might also be important for the adolescent when he or she becomes victimized. In fact, as they stay close to the victim, their help and support can function as a ‘buffering support’: help and support when a person is confronted with a stressful incident, like victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269758011432966">Antonucci and Akiyama, 1994</xref>). Others speak about support and help from the social surrounding as <italic>‘</italic>a key protective factor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758011432966">Gore and Colton, 1991</xref>: 9) or ‘“a safety net” of support, love, and caring’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269758011432966">Cauce et al., 1994</xref>: 89). The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269758011432966">Morgan and Zedner (1992)</xref> shows that the majority of the young victims questioned first appeal to family and friends for emotional support instead of going to formal agencies. The victim obtained help and support from the family in about 75 percent of the cases they researched, and in half of the cases, the victim received support from neighbours and friends.</p>
<p>Next to parents, brothers and sisters may also still be a source of help and support when confronted with a stressful event like victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432966">Dunn, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, friendships become more stable and intimate during adolescence and thoughts and feelings are more deeply discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269758011432966">Berndt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758011432966">Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758011432966">Brown and Klute, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432966">Gottlieb, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758011432966">Leffert and Petersen, 1995</xref>). Next to friends, other peers (not considered as friends) may also act as a point of reference with an important influence on adolescents, as adolescents spend much more time with peers than with family, teachers or other adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758011432966">Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432966">Coleman and Hendry, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758011432966">Feldman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432966">Santrock, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>The present study</title>
<p>Childhood and adolescence are broad categories, characterized by several developmental stages, physically and intellectually as well as morally and emotionally. This also has an impact on the extent and the nature of victimization, the way the victim reacts to it as well as whether they tell someone about the incident or report it to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432966">Finkelhor, 1995</xref>). For this reason, it was decided to focus on a specific age group, rather than on minors in general. The age group of 14–16-year olds was chosen, first, because in-depth research about young and mid-adolescents is limited.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269758011432966">3</xref>
</sup> Second, previous research shows that this group is often victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758011432966">Deakin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269758011432966">Wood, 2005</xref>). Third, in general, youngsters from this age group already have strong self-consciousness and worldview, and they are working on independence and self-realization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758011432966">Bozhovich, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, during mid-adolescence youngsters can become more sceptical and cynical about laws and rules, and perceive legal actors, for example the police, as less just and legitimate than they did during pre-adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269758011432966">Adelson and Beall, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269758011432966">Fagan and Tyler, 2005</xref>). Compared to adults, youngsters also consider the police more as a threat to freedom and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269758011432966">Reisig and Correia, 1997</xref>), and this makes research, especially on police reporting behaviour, interesting.</p>
<p>Mid-adolescents, as well as younger adolescents, are not often the subjects of victimological research, in spite of their risk of becoming a victim of crime. One can say that the primary interest in criminology has been concerned with adolescents as (potential) delinquents rather than as victims. However, it is interesting to research victimization among adolescents as exploration and independence-seeking may increase vulnerability to risky behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432966">Kuther and Higgins-D’Allessandro, 2000</xref>). In fact, there are some studies about the prevalence of victimization among this age group (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758011432966">Armstrong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758011432966">Burssens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758011432966">Deakin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432966">Hartless et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269758011432966">MORI, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269758011432966">Smith et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269758011432966">Wood, 2005</xref>). The key question for the present study is to ask to whom mid-adolescent victims first turn and to what extent they report their victimization to the police, through comparing victims of violent victimization such as extortion and physical violence with victimization without confrontation with the offender, such as theft.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269758011432966">4</xref>
</sup> Based on the literature, the research started from the hypothesis that the mid-adolescent victim will first turn to persons from his/her own social network. Concerning the police, it is hypothesized that mid-adolescents who become victimized often do not go to the police. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that if the adolescent victim contacts the police, he or she will first talk about their victimization to someone from their social network.</p>
<p>Concerning formal help services, it is questioned as to what extent mid-adolescents know about the existence of help services. Although there may be other possibilities such as, for example, doctors or psychiatrists, the data on which this article is based allow reflection only on some help agencies for mid-adolescent victims (agencies directed at youngsters in general, agencies directed at victims in general, or agencies directed specifically at young victims).</p>
<sec id="section4-0269758011432966">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The survey was set up as an exploratory part of a doctoral study concerning the experiences and perceptions of mid-adolescent victims. The survey was created to gain some quantitative background information for the qualitative part, which will be focused on the meaning and perceptions of the adolescent victims as well as other persons that they could come into contact with in the aftermath of their victimization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269758011432966">5</xref>
</sup> On the one hand, the survey allows us to gain an idea of victimization risk among mid-adolescents and the profile of their perpetrator. The survey also makes it possible to obtain quantitative data about the people mid-adolescent victims turn to when they become victims of theft, extortion or physical violence.</p>
<p>Data were collected using a paper-and-pencil survey elaborated at school among mid-adolescents (14–16-years old) in Ghent, Belgium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0269758011432966">6</xref>
</sup> Holding surveys during school hours has an important advantage as many adolescents can be questioned at one place at one instant. Furthermore, a school survey involves greater anonymity as anonymous surveys cannot be linked to specific pupils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269758011432966">Heath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269758011432966">Kingery et al., 1998</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0269758011432966">7</xref>
</sup> To guarantee anonymity, envelopes were used. Despite the fact that computer controlled surveys are gaining popularity and have some advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432966">Billiet and Carton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758011432966">de Leeuw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269758011432966">Lucia et al., 2007</xref>), a classic paper-and-pencil survey was chosen for pragmatic reasons: computer classes are not always available and paper surveys are easier to be filled in at a convenient time for the school. In this way, I hoped for a higher response rate.</p>
<p>The survey took place in winter 2009. All schools in Ghent were asked to take part in the survey. After the first written contact, schools were phoned and written to again until a target sample of 2,000 second-grade pupils was reached. The selection of schools was a convenience sample: the schools that responded first were included in the survey. Given the higher victimization risk in metropolitan contexts for adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269758011432966">Snyder and Sickmund, 1999</xref>), priority was given to schools situated in the centre of Ghent. Furthermore, the type of education was taken into account, as previous research shows that prevalence of victimization may differ according to the type of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269758011432966">Smits, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432966">Vynckier et al., 2010</xref>). So-called ‘schools of art teaching’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0269758011432966">8</xref>
</sup> were over-sampled since they were less over-burdened by school surveys and consequently more willing to take part. Of the 35 schools in Ghent, only nine took part in the survey (25.7%).</p>
<p>After the sampling of schools was completed, active consent was sought from the parents and the adolescents. I analysed the non-response to the survey in two particular schools from which I had detailed information regarding the number of students, the number of students present at the moment of the survey, the number of students with parental consent and the number of students taking part in the survey. There were large differences between the prevalence of non-response due to parents’ refusal and students’ refusal. For these particular schools the occurrence of non-response due to lack of parental consent was 43.8%, whereas that due to the mid-adolescents was above five percent (4.8% due to absence and 0.7% due to lack of consent). The final sample consisted of 557 students in the second grade of the secondary compulsory education schooling system:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0269758011432966">9</xref>
</sup> 254 boys (46.4%) and 294 girls (53.6%); 51.5% (283) followed the third year and 48.5% the fourth year of the secondary compulsory schooling system. Concerning ethnic background, 16.5% of the sample had an immigrant background (at least one parent was born abroad).</p>
<p>The survey contained questions about the respondents’ knowledge of existing support services for (young) victims and the respondents’ own experiences with victimization through theft, robbery without injury, robbery with injury, vandalism, extortion and physical violence. Follow-up questions were added concerning the respondents’ last victimization experience of theft, extortion and physical violence since the key aim of the study was focused on (the comparison between) these kinds of victimization. Follow-up questions were to ascertain the following: the extent to which respondents perceived the incident as serious, whether they knew the perpetrator, whether they told someone about the incident, whether they felt that someone had listened to them, whether the incident was reported to the police, and whether the victim changed his or her behaviour due to the victimization experience. In addition, questions were asked about the age of the perpetrator, the number of perpetrators and the relationship of the victim to the perpetrator.</p>
<p>In this article, the results are discussed about the persons to whom mid-adolescent victims of theft, extortion and physical violence first turned as well as about the respondents’ knowledge of existing support services and whether and why they (did not) report their victimization.</p>
<p>Victimization questions were:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>theft: <italic>Was something stolen from you that you had left somewhere?</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>extortion: <italic>Were you forced by someone to hand over one of your possessions(e.g. mobile phone, GSM, MP3, iPod, cigarettes</italic> etc.)?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>physical violence: <italic>Were you beaten up or kicked so that you were seriously injured? </italic>(Fights within the family were not included.)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Concerning the persons to whom mid-adolescent victims of theft, extortion or physical violence first turned, the victims were asked whether they told someone about their victimization experience of theft, extortion or physical violence the last time they were victimized. If they did not, they were questioned as to why not; if they did, they were questioned as to whom they told first and why they told that person. The respondents could tick several reasons.</p>
<p>In relation to support and help services, the victims were not asked explicitly whether they appealed to help services or why they did or did not. However, because mid-adolescent victims can only appeal to those services if those services are known to them, the mid-adolescents were asked about their knowledge of the existence of some agencies (in Ghent) that offer support to minors, to victims and to young victims. The following agencies were included in the survey:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Centre for Student Coaching (CSC):</italic> The CSC is strongly linked to the school setting. Its prime task is curriculum advice but it also has a task in coaching pupils concerning health and psychological and social functioning.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Young People’s Advisory Centre (YPAC):</italic> This centre is part of the centre for general social work and offers free information, advice and help to young people from 12 to 25 years old about several things.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Children’s and Young People’s Telephone (CYT):</italic> Just like the YPAC, the CYT offers a free and anonymous service for minors via different channels (telephone, e-mail, chat and forum).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Centre for general social work, department ‘Fishing’ (CSW):</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0269758011432966">10</xref></sup> This centre is the Ghent victim support department to help adults, young people and children who have become a victim of crime, or were bystanders or are relatives of a victim of murder, suicide or a fatal road accident.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Children’s Rights Shop (CRS):</italic> This free service offers children and young people advice and information about questions and problems concerning their rights as well as legal assistance.</p>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>Some services are geographically limited (the different sub-departments of CSC are linked to specific schools, YPAC and Trifle have different departments spread around Flanders and the department CSW ‘Fishing’ is located in Ghent), whereas other services are not limited to a specific geographic area (the CYT and CRS).</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to police reporting, the adolescents were questioned as to whether they reported their victimization (of theft, extortion or physical violence) to the police and why (not). Again, respondents could choose from several reasons, which were selected based on previous research about police reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269758011432966">Federale Politie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432966">Goudriaan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269758011432966">van Dijk et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269758011432966">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269758011432966">van Kesteren et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Telling someone about being a victim of theft, extortion or violence</title>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0269758011432966">13</xref>
</sup> most victims of theft, extortion and physical violence told someone about their victimization experience. Victims of theft were most likely to inform others (92%) and victims of extortion the least likely (67%), with 77% of the victims of physical violence informing others. Victims of theft, extortion and physical violence were all most likely appeal to parents and peers (friends and classmates) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269758011432966">Table 1</xref>). Nonetheless, whilst victims of theft appealed more to parents than to friends or classmates (48% versus 34%), this was not the case for victims of extortion and physical violence. Those victimization experiences were more often told to peers: 54% told of their victimization experience of extortion first to a friend or classmate, compared to 29% to a parent, and 47% of the victims of physical violence told they had been kicked or beaten first to a friend or class mate versus 17% to a parent.</p>

<p>As previous research has shown that the prevalence of victimization may differ according to background characteristics such as gender, immigrant background and schooling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758011432966">Deakin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432966">Hartless et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432966">Hashima and Finkelhor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269758011432966">Smith et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432966">Vynckier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269758011432966">Wood, 2005</xref>), differences in appealing to someone and reporting behaviour were analysed by those characteristics. We found that the observation that parents and peers function as an important first buffer for mid-adolescent victims of theft, extortion and physical violence held except for gender, schooling system and immigrant background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269758011432966">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269758011432966">3</xref>). Significant differences in terms of to whom first reports were made were only found according to schooling system: although the numbers are rather small, youngsters who received an academic and technical education turned more in the first instance to their parents than to their colleagues in the professional and art teaching schooling systems.</p>

<p>Another interesting question is why mid-adolescent victims talk first to those persons. The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269758011432966">Table 4</xref> indicate the reasons: ‘because I just wanted to tell it’ and ‘because I thought I had to tell it’ occur relatively frequently in relation to speaking about a victimization experience of theft or extortion as well as physical violence first to parents or peers. It is also remarkable that 21% of victims of theft first told a peer in order to try to recover the stolen goods. In relation to telling a parent, victims of extortion and physical violence gave more emotional and attitudinal reasons like fear, looking for consolation, wanting the incident to stop, needing help, hoping that the perpetrator would be caught and punished and concern about revictimization.</p>

<p>However, some victims did not tell anyone about their victimization (8% of victims of theft, 23% of victims of physical violence and 33% of victims of extortion). Victims who did not tell anyone, did so mainly because they thought that the incident was their own fault (36% of victims of theft), because they did not consider the incident as serious (32% of victims of theft, 33% of victims of extortion and 28% of victims of physical violence) and because they thought they had to resolve it themselves (29% of victims of theft and 28% of victims of physical violence) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269758011432966">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Knowing about help services and looking for help</title>
<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269758011432966">Table 6</xref> we can see that, with the exception of the CYT and the CSC, the agencies mentioned are mostly little known by mid-adolescents: 23% knew about the YPAC, but only 3% CSW or ‘Fishing’, 15% the CRS and 14% Trifle. For victims who are not in need of help or support from those agencies, this is not a problem. However, this may be a problem if the victims are in need of help from agencies like these, but do not get this help only because they do not know about the service. Nearly all the respondents (95%) knew about the CSC, whilst 82% knew about CYT. These services could then function as important intermediaries for other services.</p>

<p>Why did mid-adolescent victims of theft, extortion and physical violence not tell the police (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0269758011432966">Table 11</xref>)?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0269758011432966">7</xref>
</sup> The most common reason for non-reporting was the seriousness of the crime: 38% of victims of theft, 40% of victims of extortion and 34% of victims of physical violence did not report the incident to the police because they did not consider the incident to be serious. Nevertheless, there are differences according to victimization type. Victims of theft said they were more likely not to report because the incident was their own fault (26% versus 8% of the victims of extortion and 6% of the victims of physical violence). Furthermore, shame was reported less by victims of theft as being a reason for not telling the theft to the police (1% versus 10% of the victims of extortion and physical violence). The idea that the police would not be able to do anything was given more by victims of theft (30%) and extortion (25%) than by victims of physical violence (13%). Not having enough information about the perpetrator was a relatively important reason for non-reporting by victims of theft (22%), whereas this was much less the case for victims of extortion (8%) and physical violence (3%).<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, the appeal of mid-adolescent victims to others – people in their own social network as well as people from more formal agencies – has been addressed. Despite the original aim to reach 2,000 mid-adolescents, the three levels of selection (school, parents and mid-adolescents) resulted in questioning 557 mid-adolescents. While the data presented in this article are from answers to several filter questions (for example: Have you been victimized? If you have been victimized, did you tell the police the last time you became a victim? If you did tell the police, why did you do that?), the numbers are sometimes rather small, which makes it difficult to claim general conclusions. Besides, it is important to bear in mind that victims may consciously withhold victim experiences and actions in response to this, that incidents and actions may not be remembered or may be misplaced in time and that the respondents may just lie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269758011432966">Koffman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269758011432966">Laub, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269758011432966">Skogan, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269758011432966">Sparks et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269758011432966">van Dijk, 1992</xref>). Other limitations of the study are related to the sampling method: school staff were important gatekeepers as the researcher was dependent on their (un)willingness to take part in the survey. As parental permission was needed, a second selection level was introduced. The (un)willingness of schools to take part as well as the (absence of) parental permission may have an impact on the results as staff of schools with higher crime and victimization rates may have been reluctant to take part, whereas pupils without parental permission may disproportionally become victims of crime.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0269758011432966">14</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, the results show some striking tendencies that are important to reflect upon and to study more deeply in future.</p>
<p>While a victimization experience is not a minor event, it is not surprising that the majority of victims of theft, extortion and physical violence tell others about it. As shown in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269758011432966">Morgan and Zedner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269758011432966">MORI, 2004</xref>) and as hypothesized above, mid-adolescent victims do not often tell the incident first to the police; they first turn to their own social network: to peers, as well as to parents. This study confirms the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung (1995)</xref> that victims of theft appeal more to their parents than to friends, whereas victims of physical violence and extortion turn more to friends. The most common reasons behind the decision to <italic>not</italic> tell anybody about the incident were not considering the incident as being serious, thinking the victimization was the victim’s fault and thinking that the victim had to resolve it him- or herself.</p>
<p>Concerning help services, the survey showed that mid-adolescents do not know about many agencies, not even when they become victims. Furthermore, in agreement with previous research and the idea of the under-reporting of victimization among minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Ormrod, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Wolak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269758011432966">MORI, 2004</xref>), mid-adolescents do not often report incidents of theft, extortion and physical violence. Just as in the survey of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung (1995)</xref>, theft is more likely to be reported to the police than are extortion and physical violence, but still only by one-sixth of mid-adolescent victims.</p>
<p>Concerning the reasons for not reporting a victimization to the police, the research shows that for all three victimization items the most likely reason for non-reporting was considering the incident as not serious. Next to the seriousness of the crime, it seems that the reasons for (not) reporting victimization of property crime (theft and extortion) are more, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al. (2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>) of a ‘definitional’ and ‘material’ nature: that is, on the one hand, the idea that the victims perceive the incident to be their own fault and the idea that the police would not be able to do something and the victim would not get the goods back by informing the police, are relatively frequently given as reasons for not reporting theft. However, it is important to note that the idea that the victim had to resolve it him- or herself – another definitional reason – is reported less by victims of theft than by victims of extortion and physical violence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0269758011432966">15</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, the most important reason to report victimization of theft or extortion is wanting the goods back. Lack of information about the perpetrator is also an important reason for not reporting theft to the police. When violence is used (physical violence or extortion), reporting behaviour is more directed by, on the one hand, what is often called sense of justice, the urge for restoration and justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758011432966">Felson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269758011432966">Mass-de Waal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758011432966">Wittebrood, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, it is directed by a request for protection and prevention, categorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al. (2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>) as within the emotional or behavioural reasons, whereas a hope that the offender would be caught and punished is most expressed by victims of physical violence and extortion followed by victims of theft. Wanting the incident to stop is especially reported by victims of extortion and violence and, to a lesser extent, by victims of theft.</p>
<p>As far as it concerns protection and prevention, the survey shows that one-third of the victims of extortion and physical violence say that they report a crime because of a concern about re-victimization. Other more emotional reasons like shame and fear of the offender are more cited by victims of extortion and physical violence, which may also suggest that those victims suffer more emotional consequences than victims of theft do, as is known from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269758011432966">Lamet and Wittebrood, 2009</xref>). Therefore, mid-adolescent victims first turn to adults and peers, who consequently play a key role. They rarely turn to the police and, if they do, their motivations are linked to the nature of the incident. When something is stolen or taken away by force, definitional and material reasons are important. When violence is used, retributive as well as protective and preventive motivations arise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269758011432966">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The fact that mid-adolescent victims first turn to parents and peers supports the idea that, next to peers, parent are still important towers of strength. Furthermore, this also means that it is important to sensitize the broader community about the occurrence and possible impact of victimization and services that can help victims. As first contact they can help the victim and, if necessary, inform them about help services or even accompany them to these services or to the police. If, however, they were to trivialize the victim or even blame him/her, they can make the victim’s recovery more difficult and prevent the victim from seeking formal help. Despite the results of previous research that suggests that young victims also tell school teachers about their victimization experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Dziuba-Leatherman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269758011432966">MORI, 2004</xref>), this survey shows that mid-adolescents inform teachers only rarely. However, this does not mean that teachers could not act as a ‘buffer'. On the contrary, as youngsters spend a large amount of time at school, teachers may play a key role, especially for adolescents in the professional and art teaching schooling systems, as they tend to appeal less to their parents.</p>
<p>According to the nature of the crime, mid-adolescent victims turn more to their parents (in the case of theft) or to their friends (victims of physical violence and extortion). Possibly, adolescents believe that thefts are more clearly considered as ‘wrong' by adults or the chance of reprisals from the perpetrator or being perceived as a ‘grass' may be considered less high in the cases of an anonymous theft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>). Concerning theft, it is striking that nearly one-third of the victims who first told their parents about the incident as well as nearly one-fifth of those who first told peers, did so because they wanted back their stolen goods. Telling parents might be about obtaining new items or claiming insurance. Telling peers yields the question whether mid-adolescent victims are looking for restorative solutions or whether they call in their friends to take justice into their own hands. The fact that some victims do not tell someone about the incident means that they will also not receive support if needed; blaming themselves can affect the victim’s recovery. The idea of resolving it oneself again contains the danger of taking the law into one’s own hands.</p>
<p>The fact that mid-adolescent victims do not know about help services might not seem to be a problem as the survey shows that only a minority of the victims of theft, extortion and physical violence were not listened to, or wanted someone to listen to them. Moreover, mid-adolescent victims might also use other outlets than talking about their victimization. However, though the help services should be blamed for the fact that there are still some mid-adolescent victims who wanted to be listened to but who did not find a listener, a whole social network might have failed or the victims themselves might have given up searching for help, for many reasons. These observations have to alert the victim services as to whether they are known by adolescents. They might have failed to reach those victims who need their help the most. The police are often seen as the first who come into contact with victims and may refer them to help services if necessary. However, as mid-adolescent victims do not often report to the police, the idea of the police as the middleman to help services for young victims does not hold.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0269758011432966">16</xref>
</sup> Therefore, it is time to think about the possibilities of making help and support services known as widely as possible and to keep them consumer-friendly and easily accessible, as well as sensitizing the public. Every victim that needs and wants help should find support somewhere. In addition to this, it would be interesting to research the mechanisms behind the fact that victims do not find their way to assistance. Is it more about not needing or not knowing the service or are there also other factors such as the perception of assistance among adolescents or the idea that they, out of independence, do not appeal to those services?</p>
<p>The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung (1995)</xref> shows that victims who inform friends about their victimization experience are less likely to tell parents or teachers. Further to the results based on this research, do these victims obtain enough help and support from their peers? Is it because of this support that they decide not to go to the police or other adults? Do these peers advise the victim against telling it to an adult or going to the police? The observation that victims who did not report are less likely to inform a parent or a guardian, which was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung (1995)</xref>, leads to the question as to whether victims who do not report their victimization to the police are also less likely to tell other adults due to their desire for independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Ormrod, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269758011432966">Loader, 1996</xref>) or whether parents who hear about victimization from their son or daughter encourage their victimized child to report the incident to the police. Therefore, the question about the key role of parents and peers in the decision to report to the police needs more research.</p>
<p>The observation that the most important reason for not reporting is that the offence is not seen as very serious is similar to previous research findings for both adult and young victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432966">Aye Maung, 1995</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432966">Hashima and Finkelhor, 1999</xref>). The question is whether the victim perceives the incident as not serious or whether the victim thinks that the police would not perceive it as serious.</p>
<p>The key question is, do we want to encourage mid-adolescent victims to report to the police? If so, differences in motivations according to the nature of the crime may be important to be borne in mind. In fact, as this study shows, few significant differences exist according to gender, immigrant background or education in the decision to tell someone, or a particular person, about the incident. It is not the victim but rather the incident and context of the victim that determine (not) reporting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Wolak (2003)</xref> found the characteristics of the perpetrator predicted whether the offences were recognized as a crime, which was strongly connected to reporting, and that the age of the perpetrator and the attitudes and advice of the others were associated with reporting. Finally, more research is needed to reveal victims’ decision processes in relation to telling others and reporting victimization, for other victimization types and among other or broader age groups. Furthermore, comparisons between countries may be interesting as schooling systems, police organization and victim services may differ.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the second question, as an appeal to others is influenced by the victim’s interpretation, convictions and the way the victim perceives him- or herself, referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432966">Finkelhor et al. (2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432966">2008</xref>) as the ‘recognition stage’, which may again be influenced by the perceptions and ideas of others. In this article, this mutual relation between, on the one hand, perceiving oneself as a victim (of crime) and, on the other hand, telling others about the victimization experience and the reactions of those concerning the victim’s experience, is not further elaborated.</p>

<p>Concerning the notion of ‘mid-adolescence’, one can state that adolescence can be divided into three subphases: preadolescence, mid-adolescence and late adolescence. As these phases are determined by physical, emotional, cognitive and social development, actual age can differ. As a consequence, these phases cannot be determined by age or school year and different authors use different ages. In this research ‘mid-adolescents’ are in fact adolescents in the second grade of the secondary compulsory system (age 14–16 years). When the term ‘minors’ or ‘minor’ victims is used, it refers to those younger than the age of 18.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758011432966">Finkelhor and Kendall-Tackett (2008)</xref> distinguish ‘pain-mediated’ from ‘meaning-mediated’ victimization types. Victimization due to theft belongs to the second category, whereas violent victimization may be localized in the first category (but note that it is argued that purely ‘pain-mediated’ victimization does not exist since victims of violence are also confronted with the fact of being subject to wrongdoing by another person, done on purpose). Victimization through incidents like robbery and extortion may be situated somewhere in between the two extremes since such incidents are committed against both the person and material goods.</p>

<p>However, some surveys could be linked to a specific respondent if the adolescent who had been victimized agreed that the researcher could contact him or her later for a face-to-face interview and, therefore, wrote down an email address or mobile number on a separate sheet that was added to the survey.</p>

<p>One explanation for the fact that the non-response was high due to lack of parental permission and low due to the adolescents may be that not all adolescents delivered the letters to their parents or brought them back to school after their parents signed them. This may have been disproportionately the case for adolescents who were not interested in participating. In addition, parents may have been protective of their children by not giving their active consent. It is important to note that, although we do not have information about background characteristics of the non-respondents, parental permission might lead to adolescents dropping out who disproportionally belong to a risk group, and in the case of a study of victims, disproportionally become a victim of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758011432966">Esbensen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269758011432966">Helweg-Larsen and Boving-Larsen, 2003</xref>).

<p>This observation is not that surprising as victims of theft are generally not confronted with the perpetrator and as a consequence do not know or do not know for sure – they may have suspicions – the identity of the perpetrator.</p>

<p>Research about the mechanisms behind these sources of non-response could give insights into the possible effects.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-0269758011432966">
<label>15.</label>
<p>This could be explained by the fact that, in the case of theft, the victim had no confrontation with the perpetrator, which means that it is more difficult to resolve it him- or herself as the perpetrator is often unknown.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-0269758011432966">

<p>This does not hold for victims in general as adult victims also do not often report. However, as reporting rates are even lower among minor victims, this is especially true for them.</p>
