<p>Scholarly works on <italic>competitiveness</italic> is at the heart of the longstanding rapidly evolving research in strategic management marked by its multidisciplinary contributions and quest for a distinct identity. <italic>Competitive Strategy</italic> edited by Catherine A. Maritan and Margaret A. Peteraf, by Edward Elgarin in their ‘Strategic Management’ series, is an outstanding book that unravels the kernel of the subject taking readers through a comprehensive and enriching scholarly journey. The primary aim of the book is to be a resource guide for strategic management researchers. A secondary goal is to introduce core texts in specialized courses on strategic management. The book achieves these goals quite admirably. Its central value lies in authors’ commanding framework that guides its exhaustive survey, its exquisite selection, its, sequencing and categorization of scholarly articles representative of the vast and growing population of research publications in this area. Among the contributors are well-known names. The authors, themselves scholars on the subject, have published noteworthy research in this domain. The depth of their subject knowledge is evident in their book’s introduction that judiciously carries the theme ‘competitive strategy’ seamlessly through various ‘levels of analysis’. Selecting seminal articles by renowned scholars from among a large number of scholarly works must have been an arduous undertaking, but their selection is able to capture the field’s depth and progress without compromising the consistency that underlies the process of evolution. Readers are introduced to the core debate in strategic management guided by their own critique of important articles that should help develop conviction in the unique identity of the emerging field. For this reason alone, the book is a valuable reference for doctoral students and others new to the study of competitiveness.</p>
<p>With the mandate of establishing its legitimacy, the extant literature on strategic management can be classified around several conceptual frameworks. The vast scope of economics, the intermediate focus of industrial organization and the firm specificity of strategic management, each from a different ‘level of analysis’ capture the theoretical diversity and empirical challenges pertinent at its own level. The articles in the book collectively introduce readers to ‘timeless’ discourses that time and again withstand the pressures of temporality to create milestones and meaningful points of divergence. Authors are to be commended for keeping their focus on firm-level competitiveness because many researchers have oscillated between the vast managerless realm of economic theory and the personcentric fixation of strategic leadership.</p>
<p>The subject of ‘competitive strategy’ is rooted in classical economics especially in its definition of a ‘perfect market’ where a large number of equal sized firms with smooth entry and exit compete perfectly as suppliers of commodity-like products for consumers in a perfectly segmented market. Diverse and growing realities, however make markets imperfect thus driving competition off equilibrium and making way for heterogeneous sized firms to be proactively engaged in the race for competitive advantage. Ideals of market in which product information is a public good are not achievable. From this economic context, strategic management evolved to explain (<italic>a</italic>) the heterogeneity in firm size and performance level within the same market and (<italic>b</italic>) the life-cycle of markets observed in their emergence, sustenance and disappearance. The heterogeneity and market dynamics both have been attributed to the diversity in firm-level discretion—as opposed to environmental determinism—that shapes a firm’s direction and longevity by creating competitive value from stable resources.</p>
<p>The book by Maritan and Peteraf traces the competitiveness of firms by reducing the level of analysis ranging from macro-economic (that is external to the firm) to dynamic capabilities (characteristics that are internal) as the environment and conditions of businesses change. The editors provide a brief history to introduce readers to the field. The book’s introduction that judiciously synthesizes the process of evolution in competetiveness research is a ‘must read’ even before embarking to read to the articles in the book. In the first volume of the book, a firm’s consideration of its economic, industrial and strategic group environment is emphasized. Rumelt’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0972262912460160">1991</xref>) empirical finding that posited significance of firm-level effect on performance paved the way for other researchers to examine performance implications of the phenomena at various levels—industry, strategic group and firm. In all, the firm-level effect established itself a winner <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> other levels. Hereon, the industry and strategic group level research appear to lose prominence making the firm-level effects the dominant interest of competitiveness scholars. Firms compete in their respective industries by moving along the learning curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0972262912460160">Lieberman, 1987</xref>), gain the first mover’s advantage, choose to join a cluster, position themselves within industry’s structure, adapt to environmental shifts (regulatory changes) or evolve alongside their heterogeneous market positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0972262912460160">Noda and Collis, 2001</xref>). Firms compete and collaborate with rival despite strategic or market overlap. ‘Game theory’ came in to model the behaviour of firms in a dyadic or group relations within the industry gaining credence as a research tool. Firms, as if in a game, create strategic deterrence to prevent imitation by their rivals. Moving on, research on ‘strategic groups’ long dwelt on the question of their very existence. The implication of strategic group membership on firm performance also seemed inconclusive. The interesting twist, however, occurred with the argument that strategic group identities are cognitive and socially constructed. Further, the research on organizational properties as the driver of strategic group configuration explained the grouping behaviour better than prior explanation or empirical support. In all, the scholarly articles of this volume collectively emphasize the independence of firm-level research. The discretionary personality of a firm seems to override the determinism implied in economics or industrial organization literature.</p>
<p>In the second volume of the book, strategic management scholars turn their attention to firm’s inner resources as the unit of analysis hypothesized to impact the competitive dynamics. The Resource-Based View (RBV) emerges as a robust theory to separate the umbilical cord from its mother discipline ‘economics’ and establish the identity of strategic management as a discipline with its independent theoretical base. From this point the literature asserts itself with a lot more conceptual clarity. In defining rent-generating re-sources, researchers introduce dimensions such as causal ambiguity, value, rarity, inimitability and insubstitutability. Paradoxically however, the same characteristics of a resource would be argues to be difficult to transfer within or without the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0972262912460160">Reed and DeFillippi, 1990</xref>) thus posing dilemma for a growing firm. ‘Appropriability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0972262912460160">Coff, 1997</xref>) is presented as a critical dimension of a firm’s resource that explains the variance in rental outcome and decouples performance gains from competitive advantage. The RBV gets even deeper by identifying newer dimensions of resource and incorporating contemporary theoretical extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912460160">Newbert, 2007</xref>), such as routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0972262912460160">Winter, 1995</xref>) and social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0972262912460160">Oliver, 1997</xref>). Subsequent research on RBV focuses on the process of acquisition, accumulation or development of a firm’s resource with the critical role of a firm’s strategic ability to recognize a resource’s value. Arguing that a firm’s resource has both internal and external dimensions, researchers posit that the tacit or complementary assets are non-tradable and hence are developed internally. Timeliness, speediness in decision-making and size of investment are each argued to impact a firm’s competitive position in the process of deployment and development of strategic resources. Another set of literature examines the evolution of capabilities from conditions at their birth to the journey along their life-cycle. Lastly, the literature discusses ‘dynamic capability’ as a firm’s capability to address ‘change’ externally and internally. The question whether firms develop these capabilities reactively or in anticipation of change is largely unaddressed. The recognition of ‘organizational learning’ as a critical input for building dynamic capabilities bridges an important theoretical gap. From this juncture, the methodological diversity and industry-specific studies started enriching this stream of research. Operationalizing the measures for this construct began to emerge in several collaborative research that places greater hope on this construct’s explanatory power for various heterogeneities observed in a world where ‘change seems to be the only constant’.</p>
<p>Whereas the book achieves the objective of taking its readers through a comprehensive scholarly journey on <italic>competitiveness</italic>, its topical focus on the flipside compromises on a few important linkages with other research domains which are intrinsically connected and complementary to the subject of competitiveness. Since interrelatedness is a pervasively accepted core attribute of strategic management area that stresses non-compartmentalization of its knowledge base, absence of connectors to other related domains can be argued as a significant limitation of the book. It is evident that journals in related fields of entrepreneurship and marketing are publishing empirical studies in which RBV is tested with increasing regularity. Such trends suggest that the scholarly community has recognized the RBV as an important cross-functional theory. Hence readers may need to link the articles in this book with concepts in other research streams. Global strategy, network or relational dimension, and the strategic process view are each intricately linked to competitive strategy as reflected in various arguments and empirical evidence. Firms use their web of external relationships to enhance their competitiveness, and multinationality of a firm has been argued by researchers as a significant determinant of its competitiveness. In the discourse on ‘market versus hierarchy’, specifically the comparison between ‘transaction cost economics (TCE)’ and the ‘evolutionary’ perspectives in the seminal work by Kogut and Zander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0972262912460160">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0972262912460160">2003</xref>) on the theory of multinationals, a firm competes with its resources and capabilities within the international realities of businesses and markets. Other important linkages include ‘generic competitive strategies’, ‘strategic intent’ and ‘leadership’, ‘innovation &amp; entrepreneurship’, and ‘strategy process’ literature on emergent strategy that can each enrich a reader’s understanding of firms’ competitiveness. Mintzberg’s rather strong critique of the design school brings in the concept of a learning organization that may reconcile gaps and bring wholesomeness.</p>
<p>The methodology for selecting scholarly publications for the book as described in the introduction piece by the authors is generally robust. Using citation analysis to determine the eminence and novelty of research in the area is a commendable attempt to balance subjective expertise of authors with objective criteria and is largely consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912460160">Newbert’s (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0972262912460160">David and Han’s (2004)</xref> methodology and is an improvement over <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912460160">Barney and Arikan’s (2001)</xref>. The sample seems comprehensive in nature; however, because the authors draw their sample significantly based on self-knowledge of the literature, it is possible that they have inadvertently omitted other worthy articles by their own admission. The nature of authors’ framing and sampling technique might have resulted in the selection of articles based on their unconscious dispositions, the consequence of which is a potentially bias sample that does not accurately represent the population from which it was drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912460160">Kerlinger and Lee, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912460160">Newbert, 2007</xref>). With this limitation in mind, I suggest a small list of research articles as supplementary reading for the intended audience. The list contains articles which serve as important milestones in the history of ‘competitive strategy’ research carrying concepts which are either subsumed in chosen articles or eliminated by choice.</p>
<p>A few supplementary readings are from respective practitioners’ journals by authors who made monumental contribution to the field of ‘competitive strategy’ and hence their non-exclusion lacks any convincing basis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912460160">Prahalad and Hamel (1990)</xref> and Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912460160">Porter (1985)</xref> each fulfil this criteria. As such a widespread appreciation of the RBV did not start until the article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912460160">Prahalad and Hamel (1990)</xref> in HBR that argued that the critical task of management was to create radical new products enabled by the exploitative nature of the firm’s core competences. The counter argument for non-inclusion of articles from practitioners’ journals may be that published scholarly articles have an edge over practitioners’ journal due to the rigorous peer-review process, but it does not seem to be a good reason for excluding the contribution of key authors just because they published in practitioner’s journal. It is essential for research students to know their original work of such seminal authors. Another set of supplementary readings is proposed to fill gaps in the recorded history of literature in the book. The first scholar to recognize the importance of resources to a firm’s competitive position was Edith Penrose (Buckley and Casson, 1959) who argued for a firm ‘consisting of a collection of productive resources’. Rubin was another early scholar to conceptualize firms as resource bundles prior to the origins of the RBV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0972262912460160">Wernerfelt (1984)</xref> first formalized the theory in rather abstract manner but did not gain immediate support from the academic audience until, as mentioned earlier, the widespread appreciation of the RBV that arose from the article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912460160">Prahalad and Hamel (1990)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0972262912460160">Barney (1991)</xref> formalized the then fragmented resource-based literature into a comprehensive and testable theoretical framework. The list expands to address a growing interest in the body of literature that examines the effect of alliance networking on the competitive advantage of a firm. Here I propose including the works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0972262912460160">Kale and Singh (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0972262912460160">Goerzen (2007)</xref> as supplements. A groundbreaking research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0972262912460160">Goerzen (2007)</xref> takes alliance networking as an input for dynamic capability development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0972262912460160">Kale and Singh (2007)</xref> also examined a firm’s dynamic capability to innovative in a disruptive way. Further, in classical RBV literature, the rent-seeking behaviour of a firm through exploitation of a resource has been discussed at length but the exploitation and exploration equation in developing new resources can be explored further. A recent article on this sub-topic has been included in the list to better understand the creation of complementary resources through open-sourcing, appropriating resources through social networking and development of new resources through social capital. Lastly, a set of empirical articles have been added to the list to let the readers assess the overall empirical conclusiveness on key topics. The actual level of support of RBV as a dominant theory is still unclear marked by a conspicuous absence of survey or meta-analysis type empirical articles. A few well-cited important empirical papers, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912460160">Barney and Arikan (2001)</xref> and recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912460160">Newbert (2007)</xref>, are among publications suggested for supplementary reading. Empirical works that indicate different theoretical approaches such as resource heterogeneity approach, organizing approach, conceptual-level approach and dynamic capability approach to test RBV have been included in the list.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is a valuable work for the scholars seeking a broad overview of the core concepts on competitive strategy. It provides a solid foundation for this topical domain upon which the next generation of research can build. Though its strengths far outweigh limitations, one lingering disappointment of a survey book such as this is that there is very little in the way of new insights, frameworks or fundamentally different ways of looking at old issues. Further, to provoke the best future research on competitive strategy, which is an intended aim of the book, the authors could have been more provocative in their introductory chapter. The authors, however, following a rigorous process have put together a resourceful book that can serve as a lead reference and provide a valuable service to researchers who wish to pursue their research interests on the topic.</p>
