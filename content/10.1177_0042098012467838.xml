<p>Just like its namesake, this book is a highly enjoyable and easy read that is perfectly pitched at its target audience and, despite his admission in the introduction, Troy certainly does not write like an academic struggling to communicate his work to a wider readership. Indeed, were it not for his central thesis, the book could be read as an interesting urban travelogue for those of us for whom the journey is just as important as the destination.</p>
<p>That central thesis is that urban areas with lower ‘urban metabolisms’ (i.e. more sustainable urban environments) are better for people and are more economically productive, as well as being better for the environment, and this is carefully woven through the text without ever sounding polemical. As a result, those new to the ideas should find themselves nudged towards agreement rather than battered over the head with the big stick of how bad things are and what will happen if and when we fail to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>Many sections of the book will have an immediate resonance with anyone who lives, or has lived, in the US; however, I suspect that those readers with little more than a nodding acquaintance with the country will resort to the Internet for some of the cultural references. This in itself is no bad thing, but in places it does highlight the difference in perspective that Troy is able to offer on parts of the US he knows well (particularly Los Angeles, which is used well as a recurring case study), compared with the non-US cities that are invariably used as counterpoints to the problems he presents.</p>
<p>For readers in the US, and particularly any decision-makers who pick up a copy (and they should), this treatment works as a brilliant dissection of all that is wrong with their planning systems and how far behind they have left the US compared with other parts of the world, particularly Europe. However, to a European reader, this leads to a tendency to portray the usual suspects in the world of low-impact urban developments as slightly other-worldly panaceas. It is no surprise that Hammarby Sjolstadt features heavily—and I will return to this.</p>
<p>Aside from its warmth and quality of writing, the great strengths of this book are the different ways in which Troy covers the main subject areas. Planning is obviously a common theme throughout, the discussion of which leads us seamlessly from infrastructure through to buildings via energy, water, waste and transport, and, despite some very detailed technical discussions, the narrative never jars. Troy’s way of teaching is to set the scene and let the relevant facts seep in rather than deluge the reader with numbers and, whilst there are plenty of photos, there is not one single figure or table in the entire book.</p>
<p>Where Troy deviates from this is his treatment specifically of energy generation, with discussions of this presented as standalone sections between each chapter. Whilst these are useful summaries that are consistently pessimistic to suggest Troy has no strong views on this highly contested area (although their ordering might reflect his preferences), I did come away wanting more of an opinion here. The reason for this is partly that decarbonising our energy supply is so fundamental an element of reducing the environmental impact of urban areas that it is difficult not to form an opinion, but also that the nature and distribution of our future energy generation mix will be interdependent with determining what future urban environments will look like. So, given his excellent coverage of other infrastructure, I really wanted him to give some insights into how we should go about integrating low carbon energy infrastructure to transform ‘problem’ cities.</p>
<p>This takes us back to Hammarby, which of course had its infrastructure at its heart right from the beginning, and there cannot be many planners who, in an ideal world, would not be more than happy if they could reproduce it. Although Troy makes it clear that sustainable urban environments do not all have to look like downtown Stockholm, there is a distinctly Northern European flavour to the examples to which he devotes more time. However, this predominant contrasting of North America with Northern Europe highlights the only thing I think is really missing from the book, their peoples.</p>
<p>By the simple virtue of being a state-led project built on state-owned land, Hammarby will be an anathema to many planners in the US today, but it has really succeeded because of the people who wanted it and who were engaged with its development outside the formal decision-making processes. Those people were and are mostly Swedish and, although Hammarby was a Swedish solution to a Swedish problem, it was also a response to the collective desire of the people, and particularly the people of Stockholm, to make that solution a sustainable one. So whilst Troy seems to be asking why the US is unable to develop its own Hammarbys in keeping with its culture and traditions, and is rightly quick to point the finger at those in power, he seems to skirt the question of how those in power came to be there and act the way they did in the first place. The real question to me is not only would the average American of today buy into the idea of a Hammarby draped in the Stars and Stripes, but also would they buy into the fundamental concepts of sustainability that underpinned it? Furthermore, could such Hammarbys even be developed without advancing state control to a degree that would face fierce resistance from sections of the electorate?</p>
<p>In fairness, Troy’s understanding of these wider differences and the quality of the urban environments they create is woven into his thesis both explicitly and implicitly by omission (Masdar barely gets a mention and not a word on Dongtan), and maybe the book will be read more sympathetically by having not gone there. Troy clearly recognises that the solutions to the US’s problems will ultimately come from its people and, if things really are this bad in that world across the pond that he describes so engagingly, then we desperately need more of its planners to come around to his way of thinking. So if the aim of this book was to provide planners in the US with a firm but gentle push in the right direction, then it has clearly achieved that goal, but more importantly the accessibility of his writing should guarantee that his ideas will inform and empower a much wider audience.</p>
<p>For that reason alone we need more books like this.</p>
