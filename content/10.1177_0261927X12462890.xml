<p><italic>Examining Education, Media, and Dialogue Under Occupation—The Case of Palestine and Israel</italic>, an edited volume of Nasser, Berlin, and Wong, should be required reading for anyone wishing to better understand the roots of the seemingly intractable conflict between Palestinians and Israelis and wanting to know more about efforts being made toward resolution. The 14 chapters provide accounts and analysis of the realities of life under occupation for Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Territories, within and across three contexts: education, media, and dialogue. The framework of the book exposes the harsh conditions under which Palestinians live and analyzes the enactment of oppressive policies of governing institutions; examines the direct and indirect transmission of ideologies of occupation, oppression, and discrimination, particularly through the educational system; and reveals the reactions of those living under occupation. A fourth strand of the framework, resolution, is detailed in studies of dialogue programs that have been established to address life under occupation and ease the conflict between the two groups.</p>
<p>The chapters, written by Israeli, Palestinian, and other scholars who have lived and worked in the area, are compelling in their candor. They give voice to the Palestinian side of the conflict, one the authors say has been too long marginalized or completely silenced. The editors’ and authors’ primary goal is to bring awareness to the mechanisms of oppression used by the Israelis against the Palestinians. “Awareness of where occupation is rooted,” claim the editors in the introduction, “can provide support to its undoing.” (p. xxiv) Paradoxically, they claim, the mechanisms that lead to oppression and occupation can be the very same mechanisms that can lead to change.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the particulars of the history of the area and the Palestinian–Israeli conflict, the introduction and several of the chapters outline brief histories of major events that have led to the current situations. Obviously, no summary of histories, however inclusive and cogent, can cover the extreme complexity, extent, and depth of the long years of conflict between these two groups and this book wisely does not try. Instead, the authors examine everyday interactions between Palestinians and Israelis, making sure to carefully set the context for each of the situations and groups examined. Also included, although unusual in an edited text, is mention of the chapter authors’ engagement in a proactive use of dialogue during the writing of the book. They read each other’s research and modeled their dialogue process for readers by making reference to one another’s research in their own. In this way, they allowed a dialogue of various issues and perspectives to begin. Brief summaries of the three sections of the book highlight the important issues of the dialogue put forth.</p>
<p>In part I, an examination of various aspects of the educational system, the authors propose that education is a mechanism for change and betterment that must be promoted by communities even throughout the difficulties of occupation. According to Shakhshir, the educational system for Palestinians, from public schools through university programs, has managed to develop and bring positive results even though it operates “under siege” (p. 8). Harsh conditions resulting from the occupation that include “collective punishment, incarceration of students and teachers and frequent closures” (p. 5), along with the walling off of communities, and even deaths of school children and teachers in wars and other skirmishes, seriously affect the ability of schools to carry out educational programming. However, working to overcome such harsh conditions has led to an increased valuing of education and the claim by Shakhshir and many Palestinians that it has become “the only available alternative to survive” (p. 3, referencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12462890">Hallaj, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12462890">Shaath, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12462890">Tahir, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12462890">Yusuf, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, in the second and third chapters, the authors reinforce the existence and depth of the difficulties of Palestinian life by describing the unstable and often dangerous situations that they encountered in attempting to do research. Deeb and Weinstein and Wong and Nasser realized that local realities, including safety from the violence of war, stability of programming, and unrestricted living conditions, affect any attempts at conducting research and/or instituting new programming. Wong and Nasser emphasize the need to approach educational research not from a dominant Western perspective but from a nondominant insider approach that makes visible the ways the oppressive legacy and remnants of a colonialist past still greatly affect the lives of Palestinians.</p>
<p>Two additional chapters in this section examine the power of language in creating possibilities for either emancipation or oppression within life under occupation. Schlam-Salman and Bekerman concluded that use of English, because it moves students beyond the Hebrew–Arabic binary, can to some extent emancipate students from stereotyping “the other”—Palestinians and other Arabs. However, Israeli education’s emphasis on the creation of a strong, homogenous Israeli–Jewish state and culture greatly lessens, if not obliterates, the possibility of an emancipating language bringing about any real change. Part of the reason for this may be found in Peled-Elhanan’s research on the widespread and negative stereotyping of Palestinians in Israeli schoolbooks. Continued use of such textbooks in the school system subconsciously indoctrinates Israeli students against Palestinians and leads them into the world harboring negative misconceptions of Palestinians and supporting the dominant Israeli political agenda and the Hebrew language. Peled-Elhanan’s comment at the end of her chapter that “this education is far from encouraging peace and coexistence” (p. 92) brings greater understanding to Shakhshir’s points about the importance of education and its use as a means of survival for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Part II includes four chapters on media covering the Palestinian–Israeli situation. These chapters reveal overt acts of oppression and suppression of the Palestinians and document the difficulties they encounter in getting true representations of their lives under occupation into the media. The research shows that news reports, print media, TV, films, pop culture, and Internet sources present images of Palestinians’ lives that are largely erroneous, stereotypical, negative, and prejudiced. Such representation creates what Ayish calls a “double indignity” (p. 99) for Palestinians by making them invisible through their exclusion or by not being differentiated from other Arab groups and simultaneously making them highly visible through negative presentations of them as terrorists or otherwise associated with violence. The plight of the Palestinians is made worse and their story made harder to tell because of the history of Jewish people in Europe and the world. Atawneh refers to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12462890">Said’s (1978)</xref> work on orientalism when he states that the Palestinians have become the “victims of the victims” (p. 111). Ayish’s comment that that Palestinians are routinely underrepresented, selectively presented, and stereotypically presented aptly summarizes the problem of media representation of Palestinians.</p>
<p>The critical discourse analysis (CDA) used in Atawneh’s analysis of the language of Palestinian and Israeli leaders in the media and El-Bilawi’s examination of the news coverage during the war on Gaza in 2008 uncovers further media bias in news reporting. It shows the ways in which word choice, verbal depictions, factual information, and political ideologies can constitute hate speech and promote the dominant positioning and ideologies of powerful countries, namely, Israel and the United States. Berlin compared several media outlets’ coverage of a single story. From that study he laments that the media don’t take the opportunity to engage in freedom of the press and to be independent of government and other powerful regimes. Instead the media fall prey to, or exist because of, the powerful and routinely echo their ideologies in reporting. As a result, the media spin stories in ways that can recreate and sometimes even create by their reporting dominant ideologies that unduly influence public opinions.</p>
<p>For each of the media research projects presented in this section of the book, there are many similar projects that could be done with similar results. Recognition of bias and political influence from the media at the manipulation of the powerful are not new or surprising concepts, but specific attention to and truth telling about the Palestinian dilemma is a trend that Palestinians and their supporters hope takes hold. These chapters on media raise questions and seek answers about how to deconstruct the misinformation that has been given to the public for decades and impart a reasonable and accurate understanding of and empathy for the Palestinian perspective.</p>
<p>The last section of the book examines dialogue programs between Israeli and Palestinian groups, showing the difficulties and complexities of trying to promote equality and peace between Israelis and Palestinians when conditions of the occupation exist. The descriptions of the dialogue programs provided in the chapters can be seen as a microcosm of the Palestinian–Israeli situation. Despite the good intentions and knowledge of the directors of the dialogue programs, many of the programs were conducted through processes that actually recreated the inequality of the conditions that exist for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. The Israeli dialogue directors reasoned that, for a long time, they were unable to examine the real outcomes of their dialogues because of a strong need for them to stay in control of the methodology.</p>
<p>The chapter by Zak expands on difficulties experienced by dialogue programs because of the designs and processes used to conduct the dialogues. The programs tended to use a Western approach that encourages empathetic interpersonal and group relationships on a microlevel rather than operating from a Palestinian desired macrolevel that examines power relations within the greater historical, cultural, and political situations caused by the creation of Israel and Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands. The Western microlevel approach has been quite successful when used between groups that have relatively equal power but proved too limiting for the serious issues and the numerous imbalances in power between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>The example of the Bereaved Families Forum in the chapter by Silberstein also emphasizes the difficulties that microlevel dialogues create for less powerful groups. Israeli family members were able to empathize on a personal level with Palestinian families’ pain and suffering over the loss of their children, but at the same time were not able or willing to acknowledge the hierarchical relationships between the two groups, nor discuss the ramifications of the differences in power and privilege between them.</p>
<p>The analysis by Kent, Sibii, and Napoleone of the second Dialogue under Occupation Conference (DUO II), which was held in East Jerusalem, showed that mistakes in judgment and expression can occur, even with the best of intentions and extensive knowledge of the situation. Shortly before the start of the DUO II conference, a carelessly worded email about checkpoints to get into East Jerusalem was sent out by one of the conference planners. The email caused misunderstandings and tensions between planners and participants. The subsequent exchange of emails in response to the first message seemed to dismiss the difficulties that might be encountered by Palestinians attempting to travel into East Jerusalem and, further, to reject any attempts to object to such messaging. The series of emails called into question the goals of the conference as well as the positioning and attitudes of the conference planners and some of the participants.</p>
<p>Quite amazingly and to the credit of the personnel of the dialogue programs highlighted in these chapters, they were able, each in their own ways, to recognize and acknowledge the hegemony inherent in their dialogue approaches and facilitation processes and have taken steps to change them. Kent et al. claim that for dialogue practices to be effective, those involved must recognize the positioning and power of all the groups and then find ways to collaboratively change historically dominant meanings and habitual trajectories. Silberstein also suggests the creation of a counterdiscourse that allows for open discussion but also rejects and disrupts the dominant discourses of Israel against the Palestinians. Halabi’s chapter on a postcolonial approach proposes radical changes to attitudes toward the initiation of dialogues and the processes used within them. She puts forth the idea of a challenging and direct negotiation approach to dialogue rather than the typical group dynamics, microlevel approach. The negotiation approach first suggested by Palestinians and developed out of their needs and frustrations with past dialogues would expose the harsh conditions under which they live and subsequently lead to the desired changes.</p>
<p>In the summary chapter, Wong, Nasser, and Berlin (p. 233) invoke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12462890">Freire’s (1970)</xref> notion of praxis, a concept inclusive of action (practice) and reflection, as a way to conclude this book-long dialogue created and enacted by the authors of the chapters. Their praxis within their respective disciplines, programs, and professional activities led them to do the research and create the dialogue within the book that brings increased awareness to and reflection on the daily struggles of the Palestinian people in the contexts of education, media, and dialogue. By doing so, they have begun to uncover the roots of the occupation and identify places where change can begin and ultimately may lead to the undoing of the occupation. Wong and Nasser’s comment about their experiences offers a unique insight for all of us, particularly those with outsider status, to consider when engaging in research of a group or participating in an intergroup dialogue. They found “that the ‘other’ was ourselves. ‘They’ are ‘us’” (p. 46). With the stage thus set, it is now left to readers of the book to join and continue the dialogue.</p>
