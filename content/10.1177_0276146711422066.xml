<abstract>
<p>The degree to which the impact of schooling on real per capita household consumption expenditure (rpce) depends on the intensity of local labor market activity was estimated and changes in that relationship during a substantial part of Vietnam’s transition period (1993–2004 were documented). Key variables in the analysis are the years of schooling attained by the best-educated member of each household, an index of labor market activity at the commune level, and the interaction between the two. As schooling is likely to be endogenous, average educational attainment of others in the same age, gender, and commune cohort was used as an instrumental variable (IV). The estimated impact of educational attainment on rpce is economically substantial, statistically significant, increasing over time, and is powerfully enhanced by increasing labor market activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Education enables individuals and households to enjoy higher material standards of living and enhances the subjective quality of life. Education is also essential for long-run economic growth and advances in human development. The link between education and economic growth in the Asian tiger economies was famously documented in <italic>The East Asian Miracle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422066">World Bank 1993</xref>); more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711422066">Lee and Francisco (2010)</xref> have documented advances in educational attainments of economies in emerging Asia over the past four decades. However, they note that educational attainment in Vietnam remains low.</p>
<p>An incentive for acquisition of education is higher earnings—high enough to compensate families for the opportunity costs of investing in their children’s educations. When we think of the relationship between earnings and education we may envision a deep and sophisticated labor market mediating demand for and supply of skills acquired through education. However, labor markets in developing countries are less sophisticated than those we observe in more advanced economies.</p>
<p>The objective of undertaking a market-oriented transition is to secure the economic efficiencies that markets can deliver. A well-functioning labor market matches members of the labor force with jobs that require their skills much more efficiently than a command economy was ever able to do. Market returns to education, skill, and ability provide an incentive to acquire additional education and skills. However, the transition from a command economy to a well-functioning market economy is not instant. As the labor market evolves, we expect returns to education, skill, and ability to evolve as well. However, the degree to which labor market development enhances the impact of education on labor market returns in developing countries has received little attention in the literature; most studies focus on labor market institutions and aggregate outcomes like aggregate unemployment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146711422066">Lehmann and Muravyev 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Vietnam’s <italic>Doi Moi</italic> transition began in the late 1980s. <italic>Doi Moi</italic> is often translated as “renovation”; it suggests deep, fundamental changes. The <italic>Doi Moi</italic> transition provides an ideal experiment for examining the impact of labor market development on labor market returns to education. Labor market activity has grown steadily during the transition period and high-quality data from a series of household surveys are available. Estimates based on surveys of 1993, 1998, 2002, and 2004, indicate that the payoff to schooling in Vietnam is positive, statistically significant, and powerfully enhanced by increasing labor market activity. Between 1993 and 2004, the payoff to schooling more than doubled in areas with high levels of market activity.</p>
<p>Vietnam has long cultivated a strong appreciation for education; acquisition of education is much respected. During the transition period, Vietnam adopted several policies to promote educational attainment. The first was the Law on Compulsory Education of August 12, 1991. According to the target set by this law, by 2000 all children of appropriate age in big cities, industrial zones, and rural areas should have completed compulsory secondary education; this target was largely achieved by 1998. The Education Law of 1998 restructured the education and diploma systems, strengthened the public school system, encouraged establishment of private and semiprivate schools, and encouraged alternative forms of education such as distance learning. The law also increased the state budget for education and sought to mobilize grants, loans, and other forms of external support. In 2000, the Ministry of Education and Training set two targets for 2010: all primary school-age children should complete compulsory primary education and all children of appropriate age should complete compulsory lower-secondary education.</p>
<p>The Education Law of 2005 sought social equity in educational opportunities through the school system and other learning opportunities. Special emphasis was given to opportunities for beneficiaries of social policy programs aimed at the poor and other disadvantaged groups. One special point of the law is that students are required to pay only one school fee and one entrance fee; no other fees are permitted.</p>
<p>A very large share of Vietnam’s adult population is economically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711422066">Khanh et al. 2001</xref>). Most workers participate in the nonstate sector, which consists mainly of households engaged in agricultural activities and small nonfarm enterprises. These activities rely on basic technologies and little capital, so the idea that education has substantial returns may seem surprising. While employment increased by about 4.9 million from 2005 through 2009 (the latest year for which data are available), only about 0.5 million of these new workers were in the foreign-invested sector, 0.4 million were in agriculture, and none were in the state sector. Most new employment was in household nonagricultural activities. The proportion of employment located in urban areas increased from 24 percent to 26 percent. While our study exploits data only through 2004, it is still relevant because the broad structure of employment has not substantially changed.</p>
<p>The most important institutional elements of <italic>Doi Moi</italic> for the nonstate sector labor market were the decollectivization of agriculture and legalization of private economic activity at the inception of the transition process. As we document later in the article, the share of workers who work for wages or salaries outside the household is below 50 percent in most communes. For most workers in the Vietnamese labor force, institutions such as term contracts, the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and retirement plans simply do not exist.</p>
<p>The literature contains several examples of work relating education to wages, incomes, per capita household expenditure, and other outcomes for Vietnam. For example, Minh (1999) reports ordinary least squares estimates of an equation relating per capita household expenditure to education of the household head and other variables; the coefficient on household head’s education is 0.04 and it is statistically significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711422066">Deichmann et al. (2001)</xref> relate per capita household expenditure for 1993 and 1998 to a variety of variables and conclude that returns to education in Vietnam increased between 1993 and 1998. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711422066">Kinh et al. (2001)</xref> report that for 1993 and 1998, an additional year of schooling for the household head slightly decreased the probability that a household would fall into the bottom quintile of the per capita expenditure distribution and slightly increased the probability that a household would fall into the top quintile. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711422066">Doan and Gibson (2010)</xref> report earnings equations estimated for 1998, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008. They document a rapid increase in the impact on earnings of an incremental year of schooling (from 3.8 percent in 1998 to 10.5 percent in 2008); yet, the highest impacts they report are just at the average of approximately 10.7–10.9 percent reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146711422066">Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004)</xref> for low- and middle-income countries. Doan and Gibson did control for potential selection bias due to individuals selecting into the labor market, but they did not control for potential endogeneity of schooling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711422066">Arcand, D’Hombres, and Gyselinck (2004)</xref> estimated earnings equations for Vietnam exploiting instruments made available by the panel data nature of the 1993 and 1998 household surveys; they report impacts ranging from 5 percent to 7 percent, nearly double other estimates for the period. The estimates in this article are high compared to those cited above. This is due to the focus on the best-educated household member and recognition of the role played by labor market activity.</p>
<p>The article has five additional sections which discuss the data, patterns in the data, the econometric model and estimation, the results, and conclusions.</p>

<title>Data and Key Variables</title>
<p>“Data from the 1993, 1998 2002, and 2004 Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys (VHLSS) provide the empirical foundation of this article; cover 4,800, 6,000, 75,000, and 45,000 households, respectively. These extensive surveys cover many aspects of household and community life in Vietnam, including the educational attainments and earnings of individuals belonging to the households and detailed accounts of household consumption.</p>
<p>Real per capita household consumption expenditure (rpce) is a common measure of household welfare in empirical development economics. In many contexts, consumption is more reliably reported than income; it is also less subject to crop cycle fluctuations. The consumption measure we use is the sum of monetary expenditures on consumption, the value of household agricultural production consumed by the household, and the imputed rental value of housing occupied by the household. The consumption data have been adjusted for spatial and temporal price changes and are given in constant 1998 Vietnamese dong (VND). The survey questionnaires, documentation, and data are available from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711422066">World Bank (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>It is common in micro-empirical studies based on household surveys to relate variables of interest to the household head’s schooling. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711422066">Jolliffe (2002)</xref> points out, the person identified as household head for completing a survey may not be the primary household decision maker, may not be employed, and may not be the best-educated person in the household. The schooling attainment of the best-educated working-age adult in the household was used as the education variable in the models described in this article. The survey questionnaires were somewhat inconsistent from year to year in the way questions about educational attainment—years of schooling and degrees earned—were framed. To achieve consistency in the measure of schooling across survey years, years of education from zero through twelve were tabulated then years were added according to degrees earned: one year for junior college or certain vocational training, two years for a junior college degree, four years for a bachelor’s degree, six years for a master’s degree, and eight years for a doctorate. The survey questionnaires sometimes distinguished between “candidate” or “subdoctor” and doctorates; the former refer to degrees earned through advanced coursework without completing a dissertation.</p>
<p>In most households, one individual had achieved the highest level of schooling, but in many cases, there were ties. Ties were resolved by rank ordering individuals as follows. If the household head was among those tied for most schooling, then the household head was selected as the household representative; otherwise if the spouse of the household head was among those tied, the spouse of the household head became the household representative. This strategy was continued, checking next for oldest working-age household members, then for oldest males among those tied for oldest. These checks resolved almost all ties; the remaining ties were broken by checking for male then female children of the household head who were also working-age adults. In some cases, the most-educated working member of the household was still in school. This was the case for 7.2 percent of households in 2004 and 2002; 6.2 percent in 1998 and 1.3 percent in 1993. This raises the possibility of endogeneity due to joint determination of household expenditures and education. However, the results are very robust to dropping observations for which the most-educated member of the household is still in school.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146711422066">Table 1</xref>
 shows schooling attainments for various groups in 1993, 1998, 2002, and 2004 (panel A shows attainments for working-age adults and panel B shows attainments for children at ages eleven, fifteen, and eighteen). As expected, urban people acquired more education than rural people and ethnic minorities have experienced disadvantages in terms of schooling. More detailed tabulations show that children’s educational attainment increases on average as they grow older, so higher percentages of children do ultimately complete the given grades, but some complete them behind schedule. The general trend documented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146711422066">Table 1</xref> is that educational attainment has improved steadily in Vietnam over the period covered by the data.</p>

<title>Patterns in the Data</title>
<p>The evolution of the bivariate relationship between log(rpce) and schooling from 1993 to 2004 is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146711422066">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711422066">2</xref>

, which display nonlinear regression curves fitted by kernel regressions. The variable on the horizontal axis is the number of years of schooling completed by the best-educated member of the household; the variable on the vertical axis is the logarithm of real per-capita household consumption expenditure, log(rpce). All the figures are directly comparable because the dependent variable is in constant 1998 VND. Note that log(rpce) = 7.0 corresponds to annual real per-capita expenditure of approximately 1,097,000 VND; log(rpce) = 8.0 corresponds to annual real per-capita expenditure of approximately 2,980,000 VND; log(rpce) = 9.0 corresponds to approximately 8,103,000 VND. Using the average exchange rate for 1998, these amounts are $83, $225, and $611, respectively.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146711422066">Figure 1</xref>, households are grouped by years of potential job market experience (age - years of schooling - 6) acquired by the best-educated household member. The most prominent feature of the figure is the strong positive correlation between log(rpce) and schooling and the possible degree effects indicated by upward jumps that appear at higher schooling levels. Degree effects are discussed in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711422066">Flores-Lagunes and Light (2009)</xref>, but they are not investigated here because the numbers of degrees earned by individuals in the data sets are relatively few.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711422066">Figure 2</xref> shows the relationship between log(rpce) and educational attainment of the best-educated household member for households grouped according to the intensity of labor market activity the best-educated household member faces. In each panel, the groups are characterized by: (1) labor market activity less than or equal to the 25th percentile; (2) labor market activity in the interquartile range; and (3) labor market activity greater than or equal to the 75th percentile. Again, the bivariate relationship between schooling and log(rpce) appears to be quite strong. The most interesting aspects of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711422066">Figure 2</xref> are the strong upward shift of the relationship between log(rpce) and schooling that occurs with increasing labor market activity and the fact that the impact of education on log(rpce) increases over time (the curves become steeper over time). The apparent degree effects are strongest where the labor market activity is highest.</p>
<p>The bivariate relationships described in the previous paragraphs are affected by a variety of variables that are correlated with schooling of the best-educated household member and that are also determinants of log(rpce). Examples of such variables include the number of children in the household, the age of the best-educated person, and the ethnicity of the household. To isolate the impacts of schooling, labor market experience, and labor market activity on log(rpce) requires a multiple regression approach to control for individual, household, and location characteristics and to correct for potential endogeneity. Sources of potential endogeneity are described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0276146711422066">
<title>The Model and Estimation</title>
<p>The impact of schooling on log(rpce) is estimated by regressing log(rpce) on three key variables while controlling for a variety of individual, household, and community characteristics. The key explanatory variables are the schooling attainment of the working-age household member with the most schooling, an index of labor market activity at the commune level, and the interaction between schooling and labor market activity. Estimating the relationship between schooling and real per capita household expenditure is challenging mainly because variables like ability, talent, or achievement motivation are correlated with expenditure and with schooling, yet, they cannot be directly controlled for in regressions because they are unobservable. Omitting these variables makes schooling endogenous in the regression; this is sometimes referred to as the “third-variable problem.” Fortunately, our data sets are large enough to support construction of a suitable instrumental variable (IV) to overcome endogeneity in the estimation; this variable is discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>In our model, <italic>y</italic> (log(rpce)) is a linear function of years of schooling completed by the best-educated household member (<italic>S</italic>), the degree of labor market activity in this individual’s commune (<italic>m</italic>), the interaction between schooling and labor market activity (<italic>S</italic> × <italic>m</italic>), and a set of exogenous control variables (<italic>Z</italic>):<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0276146711422066">

<p>The main estimation challenge is the potential endogeneity of <italic>S</italic>, and of <italic>m</italic> × <italic>S</italic>, due to omitted variables (such as ability) that are correlated with <italic>S</italic> and with the dependent variable. The conventional solution to endogeneity is IVs estimation using instruments that are correlated with the endogenous regressor (schooling in this case) but uncorrelated with the omitted unobservable (e.g., ability). The instrument we constructed (<italic>S</italic>
<sup>IV</sup>) is the average schooling of each individual’s cohort defined by age group, gender, and commune. It is likely that schooling attainments of individuals in a given cohort will all be affected by availability of schooling and social norms in their communities, and so schooling and the IV will be positively correlated. However, the average education of others in one’s cohort will not be related to one’s own ability. It might be argued that the correlation between an individual’s schooling and the average schooling in the cohort could be weakened by migration. Nonetheless, the instrument is clearly relevant; the asymptotic <italic>z</italic>-ratios for the IVs’ coefficients in the first-stage regressions and the corresponding <italic>p</italic> values are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0276146711422066">Table 4</xref>

The regression samples for 2002 and 2004 are smaller than the full sample sizes because in those years, only subsets of households were given the detailed questionnaires required to support construction of the rpce variable. The first triplet of columns in each table presents results for a conventional 2SLS regression to estimate the coefficient on years of schooling without including the labor market activity index. The coefficient on schooling is positive and statistically significant in every year; the coefficient trends sharply upward over time. A natural interpretation of this upward trend is that the impact of schooling on log(rpce) has increased during the transition period.</p>

<p>The second triplet of columns in each table presents results for regressions that contain both education of the best-educated household member and the labor market activity index. The coefficients on education are positive and statistically significant in each year and they still display an upward trend, but they are somewhat smaller than they were in the first set of regressions. The coefficients on labor market activity are positive but they only become statistically significant in 2002 and 2004; in those years, the statistical significance is very high. These results indicate that the increase in the impact of schooling has been accompanied by the positive effect of increased labor market activity. The magnitude of the effect for an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of market activity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0276146711422066">Table 3</xref>) in 2004 can be calculated with the help of equation (6) setting β<sub>3</sub> = 0: it is about 6 percent.</p>
<p>The last set of regressions includes education of the household member with the most schooling, the labor market activity index, and the interaction between the two. Coefficients on all three variables are statistically significant in every year; the coefficient on the interaction term more than doubles over the time period. The effects of schooling and labor market activity are not given only by their coefficients: they are given by Equations (3) and (4). Calculations based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0276146711422066">Equation 3</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0276146711422066">Table 9</xref>; the two right-hand columns show percentage increases in household welfare due to an incremental year of schooling for the best-educated household member. These effects are substantially stronger at higher levels of market activity.</p>

<p>An alternative way to display the impact of schooling for various levels of labor market activity (holding other variables constant) is to compute the percentage increase in household expenditure (relative to no schooling) at various levels of schooling attainment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0276146711422066">Table 10</xref>
 shows representative calculations based on equation (5). This presentation is informative because it shows the very powerful effects of accumulating higher levels of schooling. Each cell shows the predicted percentage increase in real per capita household expenditure for schooling levels in column 1 relative to no schooling. Columns 2–13 display the percentage increases for the first quartile, median, and third quartile values of labor market activity in the four survey years. Reading down each column, the cumulative impact of schooling years is seen to be very large, even for labor market activity at the first quartile. Moving from left to right within each year, the impact of labor market activity on schooling’s effect can be seen; moving left to right across years, we see the combined effects of the larger coefficient on the interaction term and the gradual increase in labor market activity can be seen. While the impact of schooling on household expenditure in Vietnam has always been positive and large, it has grown sharply larger over time, mediated by an increase in labor market activity.</p>

<p>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impact of schooling on household consumption expenditure is enhanced by the degree of labor market activity in the households’ locations. More activity may be associated with deeper and more vibrant labor markets that support greater degrees of specialization, hence higher earning potential for workers with higher levels of schooling.</p>
<p>The negative coefficient on the labor market activity index variable requires some discussion. First, recall that the marginal effect of market activity on log(rpce) is not given by the coefficient on <italic>m</italic>, but by equation (5); thus, the sign of the effect depends on the amount of schooling attained by the best-educated household member (<italic>S</italic>). We can develop a clear picture of the role labor market activity plays by using equation (6) to calculate the change in log(rpce) predicted for given changes in <italic>m</italic>, at various levels of <italic>S</italic>, holding all else constant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0276146711422066">Table 11</xref>
 summarizes these calculations. For high levels of schooling, an increase in labor market intensity produces an increase in household consumption expenditure. This may reflect the capacity of a more active labor market to produce better matches between well-educated workers and jobs that reward schooling attainment. This same capacity will match poorly educated workers with jobs appropriate to their schooling levels. Thus, workers with low levels of schooling will find their rewards to schooling lower in more active labor markets.</p>

<p>It is of interest to examine the coefficients on several control variables. In particular, notice that the coefficient on gender of the best-educated household member is negative and statistically insignificant for 1993 and 1998. For 2002, the coefficient is positive but insignificant; and for 2004, the effect on household welfare of having its best-educated member a male is reflected in a decrease in rpce of about 1.8 percent. This contrasts with common findings of male-oriented advantages in Vietnam. The coefficient on the indicator for minority status was negative each year but was statistically significant only in 1993 and 2002. The magnitude of that coefficient for 2004 is sharply lower than for the earlier years; the penalty associated with minority status in 2004 was a reduction of approximately 2.1 percent in rpce.</p>
<p>The effect of the nature of the work undertaken by the best-educated household member is captured by the coefficients of the indicators for working outside the household or working for a household enterprise. Many individuals engage in more than one job; these indicators pertain to the activity in which the individuals spent the most time during the survey year. The base case is working in the household’s agricultural activities. Relative to the base case, households where the best-educated member works for a household nonagricultural enterprise fare well; those whose best-educated members work outside the household fare less well, controlling for all other variables (including schooling and labor market activity). Among the remaining control variables, the coefficients are almost all of the expected sign and highly statistically significant.</p>
<p>Discussion in the previous paragraphs focuses on the impact of particular variables, controlling for all other variables. It is likely, however, that the control variables are themselves correlated with the regressors of interest. The next few figures show predicted levels of rpce for increasing levels of schooling attainment of the best-educated household member, for three subsets of the data, holding all control variables constant at their subset means. The first subset contains all observations for which the labor market activity index is no greater than its 25th percentile; the second subset contains all observations for which the labor market activity index is at least as great as the 25th percentile but not greater than the 75th percentile; the third subset contains observations for which the labor market activity index is at least as great as the 75th percentile. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0276146711422066">Figure 3</xref>
 shows predictions for household welfare in 1993, 1998, 2002, and 2004, for three levels of labor market activity, and schooling attainment levels from zero to sixteen years. Clearly, the impact of schooling has increased over time and with increasing market activity.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article presents a model of real per capita consumption expenditure determination at the household level for Vietnam during its early to middle transition period. The contribution of the article lies in the key explanatory variables used: schooling attainment of the most-educated person in the household, an index of labor market activity in the household’s commune, and the interaction between those two variables. The results demonstrate that the impact of schooling on real household per capita consumption expenditure is economically substantial, increases over time, and is powerfully enhanced by increasing labor market activity.</p>
<p>The effect of the best-educated household member being male was statistically insignificant until 2004, at which point it became statistically significant and negative, but not very large. In addition, the penalty associated with minority status diminished sharply between 1993 and 2004. Finally, households in which the best-educated household members work in household-based nonagricultural activities fare better than those in which the best-educated members work in agriculture or outside of the household.</p>
<p>Several potentially fruitful avenues for future research are evident. First, the impact of an individual’s education on per capita consumption expenditure for the entire household is mediated by many individual and household characteristics. Extending the analysis to individual earnings or wages would be straightforward. Second, the proportion of workers working for salary or wage is the simplest index of labor market activity. It seems worthwhile to explore alternative measures that could reflect the degree of sophistication that characterizes labor markets in different locations. Finally, it seems likely that most highly educated individuals are absorbed into the labor markets of major urban areas such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Dummy variables were used to control for location, but the impact of schooling on wages in these areas may be different from the rest of the country; future work will explore whether the labor markets for the large urban areas should be treated entirely separately.</p>
