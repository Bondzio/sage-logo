<sec id="section1-0363546512472042">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common and potentially disabling and frequently prompt surgical reconstruction. The utilization of ACL reconstruction among ACL-injured patients has not been examined rigorously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512472042">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>This study reports the 3-year cumulative incidence of ACL reconstruction among adults with ACL injury and compares demographic and clinical characteristics of ACL-injured patients who do and do not go on to undergo ACL reconstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512472042">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512472042">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A tertiary health care system patient data repository was used to identify patients diagnosed with an ACL injury between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2007. Follow-up data were obtained to determine how many patients with ACL injury underwent ACL reconstruction within 3 years of ACL injury diagnosis. Stratified analyses were used to examine incidence rates separately by sex, age, race, primary language, socioeconomic status (SES), and health insurance status. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to examine the association of patient characteristics with utilization of ACL reconstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512472042">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were 2304 patients, with a mean age of 47 years, diagnosed with an ACL injury between 2001 and 2007. The 3-year cumulative incidence of ACL reconstruction after ACL injury diagnosis was 22.6% (95% CI, 20.9%-24.3%). Eighty-six percent of patients undergoing reconstruction did so within 6 months of injury diagnosis, while 94% underwent reconstruction within 1 year. In multivariable models, several patient features were independently associated with a higher adjusted odds of undergoing ACL reconstruction, including male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7), younger age (aOR per decade, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-2.0), white race (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.94-1.9), higher SES (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.04-1.8 for high vs low SES; aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.8 for medium vs low SES), and private health insurance versus self-pay (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.04-3.5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512472042">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Less than a quarter of patients with a diagnosed ACL injury underwent ACL reconstruction in the 3 years after diagnosis. The odds of having surgery were higher for men, whites, younger patients, patients with higher SES, and patients with private health insurance.</p>

<body>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a frequent source of disability and health resource utilization. Incidence rates for ACL injury are difficult to assess because not all people with an ACL injury seek medical care. Estimates reach up to 250,000 injuries per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472042">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has been shown to be a successful and cost-effective treatment for ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472042">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472042">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472042">9</xref></sup> According to national data, there were approximately 125,000 ACL reconstructions performed in the United States (US) in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472042">7</xref></sup> While the number of persons undergoing ACL reconstruction appears to be increasing annually,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472042">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472042">10</xref></sup> the proportion of ACL-injured patients who undergo ACL reconstruction has not been examined rigorously.</p>
<p>Our study objectives were to determine the frequency of ACL reconstruction among those with an ACL injury diagnosis and to identify patient characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of ACL reconstruction. We sought to identify subgroups less likely to utilize ACL reconstruction.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512472042">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study took place at an urban tertiary academic medical center. Approximately 98,000 patients are cared for by primary care practices annually at affiliated health care centers in both community- and hospital-based clinics. Approximately 59,000 patients are seen annually in the emergency department. The Department of Orthopedic Surgery consists of more than 40 physicians at 4 locations. The hospital is a 780-bed adult medical center located in a racially and socioeconomically diverse urban neighborhood. In addition to the main hospital, the center has a distributed campus that includes a 120-bed community hospital and several neighborhood health centers located throughout the city. There is also a large satellite center in a more suburban area. The hospital is part of an integrated health care system. Our sample consists of adults only because our medical center does not provide care for the pediatric population. The study was approved by the institution’s Human Research Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512472042">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>Data were obtained from the institution’s Research Patient Data Repository (RPDR), a clinical data registry that gathers medical record data from the health care system. The RPDR contains information on patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and inpatient and outpatient encounters. An online query tool allows users to create complex queries and, with proper Institutional Review Board approval, to obtain detailed de-identified patient-level data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512472042">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We queried the RPDR for all patients diagnosed with an ACL injury (International Classification of Diseases, version 9 [ICD-9] 844.2, “Sprain of cruciate ligament of knee”) at the institution between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2007. We requested detailed patient data for this cohort on diagnoses and procedures through January 1, 2011, ensuring that each patient had 3 years of follow-up. If a patient had more than 1 diagnosed ACL injury, we selected the earliest diagnosis date. We included patients with any diagnosis of ACL injury and in a sensitivity analysis included only those patients for whom ACL injury was the principal diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512472042">
<title>Defining Primary Outcome</title>
<p>Cases of ACL reconstruction were determined by searching the procedures database for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 29888 (“Arthroscopically aided anterior cruciate ligament repair/augmentation or reconstruction”). Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction before ACL injury diagnosis and patients with more than 1 ACL reconstruction were excluded from the analysis. Time to ACL reconstruction was calculated as time from first documentation of the ACL injury at the institution to time of ACL reconstruction.</p>
<p>In a secondary analysis, we also included patients with ICD-9 81.45 (“Other repair of the cruciate ligaments”) and CPT 27409 (“Repair, primary, torn ligament and/or capsule, knee; collateral and cruciate ligaments”). These codes are usually reserved for complex ligamentous injuries but can also be used for ACL reconstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546512472042">
<title>Demographic and Clinical Variables</title>
<p>Demographic data (sex, age, race/ethnicity, primary language, health insurance) were provided by the RPDR. Patients were grouped into 6 age strata: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+ years. Race was categorized as white, nonwhite, and unknown. Primary language was categorized as English, Spanish, and other. Primary health insurance was grouped into 5 categories: private insurance, Medicare, free care (eg, Welfare, Medicaid), self-pay, and other. We obtained data from the 2000 US Census<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472042">15</xref></sup> and used the zip code of each patient’s residence, provided by the RPDR, to obtain ecological information on socioeconomic status (SES). For each zip code, we assessed the percentage of nonwhite, percentage of foreign born, percentage of not completing high school, percentage of below poverty, and median income. For each of these sociodemographic indicators, we first created 4-level categorical variables based on quartiles. To account for multidimensionality of sociodemographic status, we created an index of sociodemographic deprivation by summing the 5 indicators. We divided the risk score into thirds based on tertiles to classify patients into low, medium, or high SES neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472042">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546512472042">
<title>Validation</title>
<p>We reviewed the electronic medical records of 100 randomly selected patients to validate the diagnoses and procedures reported in the RPDR. Of the 100 randomly selected patients, 83 ACL injuries (83.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 74.2%-89.8%) and all 25 ACL surgical reconstructions (100%; 95% CI, 86.3%-100%) were confirmed. Electronic medical record review identified an additional 4 ACL surgeries that were not reported in the RPDR, suggesting a sensitivity of ACL surgical reconstruction of 25 of 29 (86.2%; 95% CI, 68.3%-96.1%). Of the 83 patients with ACL injury confirmed, 87% had this diagnosis made by an orthopaedic surgeon.</p>
<p>The Brigham and Women’s Hospital Department of Orthopedic Surgery provided us a list of all ACL reconstructions performed between 2007 and 2010. We compared the department list of ACL reconstructions to the data provided by the RPDR. The RPDR was inclusive of all 71 patients who had ACL reconstruction surgery between 2007 and 2010 as documented by the department.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546512472042">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We defined the cumulative incidence of ACL reconstruction as the proportion of ACL-injured patients who underwent ACL reconstruction within 3 years of the initial documentation of ACL injury. In addition to deriving the overall ACL reconstruction incidence rates, we present stratified rates by sex, age, race, primary language, SES, and health insurance status.</p>
<p>We built multivariable logistic regression models to identify independent predictors of ACL reconstruction among those with ACL injury. All covariates were statistically significantly related to ACL reconstruction in a bivariate analysis; therefore, we included all covariates in the initial multivariable model. We then used likelihood ratio statistics and odds ratios to determine the final model. We hypothesized that the association between ACL reconstruction and sex may depend on race and age and that the association between ACL reconstruction and race may depend on age. We tested these hypotheses by including interaction terms in our multivariable logistic models. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate the cumulative rate of ACL reconstruction in the 3 years after injury diagnosis and to compare the unadjusted rates of ACL reconstruction by sex. All analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section16-0363546512472042">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The RPDR query returned 2370 patients diagnosed with an ACL injury at the institution between 2001 and 2007. Of these, 48 had a previous ACL reconstruction, and an additional 18 had more than 1 reconstruction. Because laterality could not be established from the RPDR, these patients were removed from the analysis, leaving 2304 patients. The cohort was 47% female and 53% male, and the mean ± standard deviation age was 47.1 ± 13.9 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472042">Table 1</xref>). Ten percent of the cohort was 20-29 years of age at the time of ACL injury, 22% was 30-39 years, 27% was 40-49 years, 21% was 50-59 years, 13% was 60-69 years, and 6.5% was 70 years or older. Sixty-four percent of the cohort was white, 17% was nonwhite, and race was unknown for 19% of the cohort. Ninety-four percent of the cohort listed English as the primary language, 3% listed Spanish, and 2% listed another language. The majority of patients had private health insurance (75%), followed by free care (9%), Medicare (8%), self-pay (4%), and other (4%).</p>

<p>Patients with English as their primary language were the most likely to undergo reconstruction (23%), followed by patients speaking a language other than English or Spanish (16%), while Spanish-speaking patients were the least likely to undergo reconstruction (8%) (<italic>P</italic> = .003). Because English speakers had a comparable risk of ACL reconstruction compared with patients speaking a language other than English or Spanish, we collapsed the English and other language groups into a single group and focused our comparison on Spanish versus non-Spanish speakers in the multivariable models. Patients in high and medium SES neighborhoods had a similar likelihood of reconstruction, while those in low SES neighborhoods were the least likely to undergo reconstruction, although this difference was not statistically significant (24% high SES, 24% medium SES, 20% low SES; <italic>P</italic> = .06). Patients with private (26.7%) and other (27.6%) insurance were the most likely to undergo reconstruction, followed by those self-paying (16.9%) and with free care (14.5%). Patients using Medicare as the primary form of health insurance were the least likely to undergo reconstruction (7.7%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Stratified Analysis and Multivariable Models</title>
<p>Zip code–based SES level, language, race, and insurance status were highly associated with each other (χ<sup>2</sup> <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001); thus, we used likelihood ratio statistics and odds ratios to determine the relative importance of each predictor in order to create a more parsimonious model. After adjustment, language was dropped from the model. After dropping language from the model, all remaining predictors were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). This model had the optimal likelihood ratio statistic and was the model chosen by forward, backward, and stepwise selection. The final model included sex, race, SES, insurance status, and age group (as a continuous variable). Male patients had 1.4-fold greater adjusted odds of reconstruction compared with female patients (95% CI, 1.1-1.7); whites had 1.4 times the adjusted odds of reconstruction compared with nonwhites (95% CI, 0.95-1.9) and a similar odds of reconstruction compared with those with unknown race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62-1.1). There was a linear trend with age group: each decrease in decade of age was associated with 1.8 times the adjusted odds of reconstruction (95% CI, 1.7-2.0). Patients in the high (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.04-1.8) and medium (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.8) SES groups had higher adjusted odds of reconstruction compared with patients in the lowest SES group. Finally, compared with patients self-paying, patients with private insurance had 1.9-fold greater adjusted odds of reconstruction (95% CI, 1.04-3.5), patients with other insurance had 1.7-fold greater adjusted odds (95% CI, 0.8-3.8), and patients with Medicare had 1.6-fold greater adjusted odds (95% CI, 0.66-3.7). The odds of undergoing reconstruction were similar for patients with free care compared with self-pay (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.53-2.3).</p>
<p>Stratified analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512472042">Figure 1</xref>) show that among patients younger than 29 years, ACL-injured female patients are more likely to undergo reconstruction than ACL-injured male patients, whereas among ACL-injured patients 30-60 years old, male patients are more likely to undergo surgery. However, these differences in sex effect across age groups were not statistically significant in a formal test for interaction. The trend for whites to be more likely to undergo reconstruction than nonwhites held across all age groups. Among nonwhites, female patients were much less likely than male patients to undergo reconstruction (10.6% vs 21.4%), while among whites, the difference was less pronounced, with 19.8% of female patients undergoing reconstruction versus 26.2% of male patients. The formal test for interaction was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .20). The Kaplan-Meier curves show that the probability of reconstruction is higher for male patients than for female patients at all time points (log-rank <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512472042">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>We repeated the analysis including only patients whose principal diagnosis was ACL tear (ICD-9 81.45). Of the 2304 patients identified in our sample, 1703 (73.9%) had ACL tear as the principal diagnosis. The remaining 601 patients had ACL tear as a secondary diagnosis. Other principal diagnoses included tear of medial cartilage or meniscus (ICD-9 83.60; n = 176), pain in the joint involving the lower leg (ICD-9 719.46; n = 94), and tear of lateral cartilage or meniscus (ICD-9 83.61; n = 81). Of 1703 patients, 455 underwent ACL reconstruction at the institution within 3 years of ACL injury diagnosis, for a 3-year cumulative incidence of 26.7% (95% CI, 24.6%-28.9%).</p>
<p>We repeated the analysis again including the additional procedure codes (ICD-9 81.45 and CPT 27409) that may be used for complex ligament injuries, such as ACL tear. This identified 2262 patients with an ACL injury that met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 618 underwent ACL reconstruction at the institution within 3 years of the ACL injury, for a 3-year cumulative incidence of 27.3% (95% CI, 25.5%-29.2%). While codes 81.45 and 27409 were more likely to be used in older patients, the associations between potential covariates and reconstruction were the same as reported above.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used a patient data repository available to researchers to identify patients with an ACL injury and evaluated the rate of ACL reconstruction among these ACL-injured patients. The 3-year cumulative incidence of ACL reconstruction among ACL-injured patients was 22.6% (95% CI, 20.9%-24.3%). We found that ACL reconstruction rates varied by age, sex, race, SES, and insurance status: men were more likely to have an ACL injury reconstructed than women, whites were more likely than nonwhites, younger people were more likely to undergo ACL reconstruction, patients of higher SES were more likely to undergo ACL reconstruction, and patients with private insurance were more likely to undergo ACL reconstruction.</p>
<p>Our study provides age-, sex-, and race-stratified risks of ACL reconstruction among patients with ACL injury, potentially permitting the calculation of injury rates from data on surgical rates. In fact, the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (NSAS) provides a comprehensive overview of ambulatory surgical procedures performed in the US, including ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472042">13</xref></sup> Thus, our data could be combined with NSAS data to estimate ACL injury rates from ACL reconstruction rates.</p>
<p>Few studies have examined the rate of ACL reconstruction among those with ACL injury. One study reported a cumulative incidence of ACL reconstruction within 6 weeks of index hospitalization of 58%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472042">2</xref></sup> The study found unadjusted differences in reconstruction rates by age group and by race, but not by sex. Because the goal of the study was to evaluate rates of reinjury, adjusted and stratified analyses for rates of ACL reconstruction were not provided. In addition, the cohort comprised active-duty US Army personnel and was predominately male (91%) and young (90% younger than 40 years). All patients had full access to health care, limiting the generalizability. Many other studies have evaluated the risk of ACL injury by demographic variables, although most sample relatively young, healthy populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472042">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472042">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472042">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472042">12</xref></sup> For example, a study of students at West Point found little difference in the individual risk of an ACL tear between men and women during their 4-year college career.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472042">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent national community-based study in Sweden found surgical rates similar to the rates presented in our study. In the Swedish study, 47.7% of injured patients 21-30 years of age underwent reconstruction compared with 45.3% in our cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472042">14</xref></sup> The proportion undergoing reconstruction decreased with each decade of age in a similar manner: the reconstruction rate was 34.3% in patients 31-40 years old, 21.4% in those 41-50 years old, and 6.6% in those older than 50 years. The overall surgical rate was higher, 36.4% compared with 22.6% in our cohort, although this study included patients younger than 20 years, and therefore, a higher overall rate is to be expected.</p>
<p>We found that only 45% of patients 20-29 years old with an ACL injury underwent reconstruction within 3 years of initial diagnosis. This may be an underestimate because patients diagnosed with an injury at the institution could undergo ACL reconstruction elsewhere; however, it is remarkably close to the estimate from the Swedish cohort presented above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472042">14</xref></sup> In addition, we found that sex, race, SES, and health insurance status affect the rate of ACL reconstruction. These effects persisted in the adjusted analysis, suggesting that access to care could be an obstacle for patients of lower SES or without health insurance.</p>
<p>Results of this study should be interpreted in the context of the study design. As noted, the RPDR only identified ACL reconstructions at the institution; therefore, patients diagnosed at the institution and undergoing surgery at a different institution were misclassified as not having ACL reconstruction. Because the study was done in a major referral center, losses to other centers are likely uncommon; they would result in underestimation of the rates of surgery. Also, the RPDR query did not provide information on the severity of the ACL injury or whether the injury was isolated or a complex ligamentous injury. These may be important factors in the decision to undergo surgery. In addition, the RPDR did not provide information on laterality. Patients may have had an ACL tear reported in one knee and ACL reconstruction in the other knee. We excluded patients who underwent ACL reconstruction before an ACL tear and patients with more than 1 ACL reconstruction. In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis including these 66 patients, and the results were similar to those of the parent analysis. Because this was not a population-based study, we were not able to directly estimate the rate of ACL injury.</p>
<p>Our sample consists of adults only because our medical center does not provide care for the pediatric population. Thus, these data cannot be extrapolated to the younger (&lt;20 year old) population, and the overall reconstruction rate of 22.6% is generalizable only to a population with a similar age distribution. Much of the literature on ACL injury and reconstruction focuses on the younger population; however, the majority of ACL-injured patients are indeed adults; thus, our study fills an important niche by focusing on the adult population. A recent national community-based study performed in Sweden found similar age-stratified surgical rates to ours, supporting the validity of our findings. We reweighted the rates provided by the Swedish cohort using the age distribution of our population and found the age-weighted rate to be 20.8% in the Swedish cohort, which is comparable with our finding of 22.6%.</p>
<p>Based on the results of our validation study and sensitivity analysis, we may be somewhat underestimating our overall rate of surgical conversion. Using the results of the validation exercise, we conclude that by adjusting for potential underestimation by 28.4%, the corrected incidence rate would be 31.5%. We acknowledge that this is a limitation in our study; however, any study utilizing an administrative database is likely to suffer from the same limitations. In addition, our findings were remarkably close to those from Nordenvall et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472042">14</xref></sup> Given the data available to us, we present the most accurate 3-year cumulative incidence of ACL reconstruction to date, and we urge further research in the area.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the 3-year cumulative incidence rates of ACL reconstruction among those with a diagnosed ACL injury. In this study, 22.6% of patients with an ACL injury underwent reconstruction within 3 years of injury diagnosis. Patient characteristics were associated with the utilization of ACL reconstruction after ACL injury: the odds of having an injury reconstructed surgically were lower for women, nonwhites, patients in lower SES neighborhoods, patients with free care or no health insurance, and older patients, even after adjusting for other covariates. Future studies are needed to better understand why certain patients are less likely to utilize ACL reconstruction and to ensure that all patients are given all the information necessary to make an informed decision about surgery.</p>
