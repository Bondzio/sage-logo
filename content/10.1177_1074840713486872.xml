<title>Origin of Family Nursing in Japan</title>
<p>The term <italic>family nursing</italic> first came to be known in Japan in 1993 when Chiba University and the University of Tokyo both started offering courses in family nursing.</p>
<p>Although the family nursing curriculum at Chiba University was endowed for 5 years, Professor Kazuko Suzuki (who, since retiring from Tokai University as a professor, is currently running her research institute) and Hiroko Watanabe (who is currently directing the Family Care Research Institute) vigorously wrote textbooks and held an international symposium during this 5-year period, in an effort to popularize family nursing research throughout Japan. The symposium invited Professor Wright and Associate Professor Bell from the University of Calgary, and its participants included Professor Michiko Moriyama among others. These were truly the days in which family nursing was being introduced to Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the University of Tokyo was steadily building a foundation for family nursing by hosting an official course taught by Professor Chieko Sugishita. Back then, Kazuko Ishigaki (currently the president of Ishikawa Prefectural Nursing University) was an associate professor and Naohiro Hohashi (presently a professor at Kobe University) was an assistant instructor. This course later had Noriko Yamamoto (presently a professor at University of Tokyo), Nami Kobayashi (presently a professor at Kitasato University), and others as its graduates.</p>

<title>Overview of the Japanese Association for Research in Family Nursing (JARFN)</title>
<p>On October 1, 1994, the Japanese Association for Research in Family Nursing (JARFN) was founded with Professor Sugishita as its chief founder. Its 26 founders included those involved in Chiba University and the University of Tokyo as well as Professor Sayumi Nojima (currently the vice president of the University of Kochi), who published the only translated book in Japan on family nursing at the time, written by Dr. Marilyn Friedman.</p>
<p>The association’s establishment manifesto states,<disp-quote>
<p>The major mission of this association is to widely develop, at hospitals, care facilities, and sites of home care, effective methods of nursing within the framework that has family as its unit. Such nursing methods should cover not just people with a health problem in all the stages of life, but also care activities to maintain and promote health ranging from rehabilitation to terminal care. This development should be based on factual knowledge of human physiological functions and solid understanding of the functions of a family.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This manifesto advocated the inclusion of interdisciplinary fields of research related to families.</p>
<p>The foundation of this academic association provided Japan’s family nursing research with a foothold, enabling the research to progress steadily. During the several years following the founding of JARFN, the focus of many researchers was on learning the discipline, which was already well developed in North America, while at the same time developing Japan’s own research capacity in family nursing. The Family Nursing Externship at the University of Calgary was an opportunity to foster such efforts, with many Japanese academics participating in this intensive learning experience annually by organizing tours which began in 1997. Administrative Director Sugishita of JARFN, members of the Family Nursing Research Unit of the University of Tokyo, which the director was in charge of, and the directors of JARFN played crucial roles in advertising and heading these tours.</p>
<p>JARFN, originally launched with approximately 100 members, exceeded 1,000 members by 2005 and still kept growing. The association reviewed its role in providing activities as an academic society in consideration with the membership growth around 2002, launching a Future Planning Committee as a result (chaired by Kazuko Ishigaki with members including Sayumi Nojima, Kazuko Suzuki, Keiko Murata, and Reiko Hara). Approximately half a year later, the committee submitted a report in December 2002, with proposals that included ways to enhance the association’s committee activities, improve its board of directors, and streamline its operation.</p>
<p>In response to this move, the then Educational Promotion Committee, under the direction of its chairperson, Reiko Hara, held seminars focused on practical examples of family nursing at several places in Japan to help launch regional groups of family nursing researchers. This effort proved to be very productive, supporting the establishment of regional-based family nursing societies. These activities developed and expanded further to cover two fields today, research and education.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the association’s Editing Committee began to issue the association’s journal three times a year. The current focus of the journal, which mainly covered special feature articles in the beginning, is on the publication of academic papers.</p>
<p>Today, in addition to all the committee activities based on the future vision set out by the Future Planning Committee, the following new activities are emerging in JARFN: international exchange activities and stimulating innovation in family nursing.</p>
<sec id="section3-1074840713486872">
<title>International Exchange Activities</title>
<p>Ever since its beginning, JARFN has placed international exchanges as a pillar of its activities. The aforementioned Family Nursing Externship at the Family Nursing Unit of the University of Calgary, arranged by then Administrative Director Sugishita originally began as a tour aided by an interpreter in 1997. The number of participants from Japan, along with those from Canada, was extremely high. The Externship continued for several years following this pattern. These tours eventually led to Dr. Bell’s lecture at the association’s 5th academic assembly in Japan 1998 and to Dr. Wright’s at the 7th assembly in 2000. In 2004, moreover, the 11th assembly invited Dr. Hanson from the United States and the 13th assembly once again invited Dr. Wright.</p>
<p>Calling for participation in the International Family Nursing Conferences (IFNC) has been an integral part of JARFN’s activities. A large number of JARFN members attended the IFNC4 (November 1997, Valdivia, Chile), the IFNC5 (July 2000, Chicago, United States), the IFNC6 (scheduled in Botswana but cancelled due to the political unrest in the country), the IFNC7 (June 2005, Victoria, Canada), and the IFNC8 (June 2007, Bangkok, Thailand), giving an impression to the world that Japan is enthusiastic about family nursing.</p>
<p>At the IFNC7, two members of JARFN were commended by the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic>, among other researchers from around the world, for their contribution to the spread and the development of family nursing. The two were Professor Chieko Sugishita, who was then director of JARFN and serving at Mie Prefectural College of Nursing (deceased in March 2007) and Professor Michiko Moriyama, who was also the director of JARFN and serving at Hiroshima University. Also at IFNC8, a ceremony in memory of Professor Sugishita was held before all the conference participants from around the world.</p>
<p>Thanks to all these efforts, the 11th International Family Nursing Conference was chosen to be held in Japan in June 2011. This was achieved with the leadership of Professor Naohiro Hohashi, the chairperson of International Fellowship Committee, with the assistance of other members, such as Professor Nami Kobayashi and Dr. Akiko Araki.</p>

<sec id="section4-1074840713486872">
<title>Stimulating Innovation in Family Nursing</title>
<p>Former Administrative Director Sugishita had, from the beginning of JARFN, emphasized the importance of nursing researchers to join the Science Council of Japan as members in order for nursing to be a recognized and respected academic discipline. To realize this, she engaged in numerous activities as a JARFN administrative director with wide perspectives, including the launch of Japan Association of Nursing Academies. Responding to these ambitious efforts of Professor Sugishita, JARFN created a position in charge of policy issues within the association, a measure ahead of the times. This measure proved to be fruitful in the face of changes in Japan’s social conditions, such as the rapid increase in the numbers of nursing-related universities and academic societies. In 2005, nursing research experts became members of the Science Council of Japan. Following this, Sayumi Nojima and Kazuko Ishigaki became collaborative members of the science council, currently engaging in discussions to improve the quality and status of nursing and expand its roles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the social trend in Japan was calling for evidence of nursing effectiveness to authorize payments for nursing and medical services related to nursing. JARFN thus developed a strategic research project with a committee chaired by Professor Noriko Yamamoto. Before discussing the evidence, the committee first clarified the core concepts held by leaders in family nursing in Japan since the definition of family nursing was unclear. At an academic assembly in 2009, the participants had an opportunity to engage in heated discussion about family nursing, mediated by Professor Noriko Yamamoto. More discussions have followed since, stimulating academic debate in a positive manner. Then, in the nursing circles, another hot topic emerged—innovations in nursing. In addition to the discussions held in 2009, JARFN planned and held a symposium on innovations in family nursing in 2010. There, the presentations by Professor Naohiro Hohashi, Professor Nami Kobayashi, and Mr. Takashi Fujino, a clinical nurse specialist in family nursing, gave audiences a fresh impression, winning the attention of many. In the academic assembly of 2011, JARFN plans to have another symposium related to this issue, named “Introducing Advanced Nursing in Primary Care.”</p>

<title>Other Developments</title>
<sec id="section6-1074840713486872">
<title>Individual efforts to disseminate family nursing among practitioners</title>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning, Hiroko Watanabe, who conducted her research for 5 years in the first family nursing course at Chiba University, launched her own research institute after retiring from the university. Up to the present day, she has been actively promoting the Watanabe style family nursing. Simultaneously, she has been enthusiastic in spreading family nursing in Japan, as an administrator of JARFN.</p>
<p>Yet another notable person is Professor Nami Kobayashi who, while working as a faculty member at a university, has been hosting seminars on Family Systems Care with nursing professionals from neighboring regions to improve the practice of family nursing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1074840713486872">
<title>Education of family nursing Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs)</title>
<p>In Japan, CNS education began more than a decade ago. The nation’s first courses in family nursing CNS were provided by then Kochi Women’s University (reorganized into the University of Kochi as of April 2011) and Tokai University. The former was headed by Professor Sayumi Nojima, and the latter by Professor Kazuko Suzuki. Later, Aichi Prefectural University (Professor Keiko Yamaguchi) and Kobe University (Professor Naohiro Hohashi) launched a similar course. Osaka Prefecture University is the fifth university to offer a CNS course in family nursing. Today, Japan has 21 certified nurses specializing in Family Support.</p>
