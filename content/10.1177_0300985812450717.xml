It has been isolated from surface soils, decaying vegetation, pasture herbage, silage, sewage sludge, feces, and rivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812450717">5</xref></sup></p><p>Among domestic animals, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection is most common in ruminants, which are often infected via ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs (eg, silage). Infection often manifests as encephalitis and associated neurologic disease, because the bacterium invades the oral mucosa and travels retrograde to the brain via the trigeminal nerve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812450717">5</xref></sup> Intrauterine infection leads to ruminant abortion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812450717">7</xref></sup> or neonatal sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812450717">5</xref></sup> Infected small ruminants, such as sheep, can develop suppurative abomasitis and enteritis or serve as asymptomatic carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812450717">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812450717">9</xref></sup></p><p>Listeriosis is rarely reported in horses. In Icelandic horses with diarrhea and gastroenteritis, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection was most often attributed to contaminated feed, including silage. The organism was isolated from feces and tissues of fatal equine cases; however, gross and histologic lesions were not described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812450717">4</xref></sup> In the current report, the clinical course, necropsy, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings, as well as microbiological characterization, indicated concurrent infection of an adult horse with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium, and cyathostomes.</p><sec id="section1-0300985812450717"><title>History</title><p>Fresh and formalin-fixed large intestine and colic lymph nodes were received from a dead 15-year-old American Quarter horse mare from northwestern Georgia. One horse had died on the premises during the spring or summer of each of the 3 previous years. All 4 horses had had similar clinical signs, including lethargy, weight loss, and profuse watery diarrhea, followed by death within 1 week of the onset of illness. The current case was the first horse from the farm to receive postmortem diagnostic evaluation. The horse had lost over 136 kg in body weight and was euthanized because of poor response to a 10-day course of metronidazole treatment. Horses were dewormed 3 to 4 times a year. The 12 horses on the farm shared the same pasture, which had previously been used for beef cattle.</p><p>At necropsy, performed immediately after euthanasia, the horse was in poor nutritional condition. Other salient gross findings were limited to the cecum and all colonic segments. The serosal, mucosal, and cut surfaces of the large intestine and colic lymph nodes had numerous, 5- to 20-mm-diameter, pale gray/tan nodules, with a yellow/tan exudate on cut section. Intestinal mucosa was diffusely and irregularly thickened, with widely scattered, shallow ulcers.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0300985812450717"><title>Diagnostic Methods</title><p>Tissue samples were fixed in neutral-buffered, 10% formalin solution. Trimmed tissues were routinely processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at approximately 5 μm. All tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE); some sections were also stained with Lillie Twort Gram’s stain and Ziehl-Nielsen acid-fast stain.</p><p>The DNA was extracted from large intestinal mucosal scrapings using an UltraClean fecal extraction kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, California) and amplified using traditional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures for the detection of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> <italic>subsp</italic> <italic>enterica</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812450717">2</xref></sup> <italic>Yersinia spp</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985812450717">8</xref></sup> <italic>Listeria spp</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812450717">6</xref> </sup>and<italic> L. monocytogenes.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812450717">1</xref> </sup>Bacterial culture was performed on intestinal contents and on a colonic mural nodule. The samples were plated on blood, MacConkey, and phenyl alcohol blood agars (Remel, Lenexa, Kansas) and incubated overnight at 37°C. β-Hemolytic colonies were isolated and further characterized by Gram staining and biochemical reactions using BBL Crystal GP (BD, Sparks, Maryland).</p><p>Immunohistochemistry for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was performed. Briefly, paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned at approximately 4 μm, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. The antibody was a highly purified, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated, rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody that recognizes <italic>Listeria</italic> whole cells (L2650-09A; US Biological, Swampscott, Massachusetts). The optimal dilution of the anti-<italic>Listeria</italic> antibody was determined as 1:100 with an incubation time of 45 minutes by titration on positive control tissue sections. The anti-<italic>Listeria</italic> antibody was diluted using Dako Antibody Diluent (S0809; Dako, Carpinteria, California). Antigen retrieval consisted of Proteinase K (S3020; Dako) treatment for 5 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide (H312-500; Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, New Jersey). All other blocking was completed with Power Block (HK085-5 K; Biogenex, San Ramon, California). Brain from a <italic>Listeria</italic>-infected goat was used as a positive tissue control. Purified rabbit immunoglobulins supplied as a ready-to-use reagent replaced the anti-<italic>Listeria</italic> antibody as a negative antibody control (NC495; Biocare Medical, Concord, California). A section of normal equine intestine was used as negative tissue control. The MACH 1–HRP polymer detection system (M1U539; Biocare Medical), followed by the betazoid 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen kit (BDB2004; Biocare Medical), was applied for visualization of <italic>Listeria</italic> <italic>sp</italic> antigen. The tissue sections were counterstained with Gill’s II hematoxylin and bluing; dehydrated in alcohol levels of 70%, 95%, and 100%; cleared in xylene; and mounted with xylene-based mounting medium.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0300985812450717"><title>Results</title><p>Histologic lesions included granulomatous typhlocolitis, lymphangitis, and colic lymphadenitis. The colon and cecum had widely scattered nodules of epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, centered about foci of liquefactive necrosis with many neutrophils and cellular debris. The nodules extended from the multifocally denuded mucosal surfaces through the submucosa and serosa. Where the nodules extended into the mesentery, they were usually arranged around dilated, focally disrupted lymphatic vessels and extended into the cortex and medulla of regional lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812450717">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812450717">3</xref>). Within most of the densely cellular nodules (including those in the submucosa and lymph nodes), macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and neutrophils contained many clusters of Gram-positive, non-acid-fast coccobacilli that were immunohistochemically positive for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812450717">Fig. 4</xref>). A few nodules of epithelioid macrophages were arranged around nematodes embedded in the mucosa or, less commonly, in the submucosa. The nematodes had an annulated cuticle, a thin hypodermis, somatic musculature, and pseudocoelom; a single layer of epithelial cells with multiple nuclei lined the intestine, which had a distinct brush border.</p><fig id="fig1-0300985812450717" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Colon; horse.

However, the presence of numerous intracellular, Gram-positive coccobacilli that were immunohistochemically positive for <italic>Listeria spp</italic> within the lesions supports <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> as the main cause of disease. Epidemiologic factors that may have contributed to the development of enteric listeriosis on this farm include a 4-year history of sporadic seasonal, watery diarrhea, previous use of the pasture for a beef cattle operation, location (northwest Georgia), age of the horse (15 years), and lack of antibiotic treatment response.</p><p>The thickened intestinal walls, mucosal nodularity, and enlarged lymph nodes are consistent with an infiltrative disease process, such as alimentary lymphoma or proliferative typhlocolitis, the latter of which is often associated with various granulomatous diseases, including chronic salmonellosis, cyathostomiasis, mycobacteriosis, and yersiniosis. Less likely entities in the differential diagnosis included fungal or algal infections. Alimentary lymphoma was ruled out based on histologic findings. Likewise, mycobacteriosis and yersiniosis were excluded on the basis of histochemistry and microbiologic results, including PCR tests. Although cyathostomes were detected histologically in the mucosa and submucosa, the numbers were few, and the nematodes were not associated with the lymphangitis or lymphadenitis.</p><p>Infection with <italic>Listeria</italic> <italic>spp</italic> has been documented in many species, but listeriosis, sometimes with associated neurologic disease or abortions, is most common in domestic ruminants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812450717">5</xref></sup> Infection with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in horses is rarely documented. Coinfection with<italic> Salmonella </italic>and small strongyles in the present horse probably contributed to infection with <italic>Listeria</italic> and to the development of the granulomatous typhlocolitis. Although the chronology of infections in this case is unknown, <italic>S. enterica </italic>and cyathostome infections could have shifted the immune response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection to a cell-mediated (granulomatous) reaction in contrast to the suppurative abomasitis and enteritis described in sheep with gastrointestinal listeriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812450717">3</xref></sup></p><p>The source of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> that potentially led to severe diarrhea in multiple horses over a 4-year period on the present farm remains undetermined, but possibilities include environmental contamination by wildlife reservoirs or the previously housed beef cattle, or contaminated feed. The route of infection in the current horse was probably via ingestion. It is possible that long-term persistence of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in the environment, originating from the previous cattle on the pasture, is a potential source of infection for horses, as well as other animals on the farm.</p><p>In summary, although uncommon, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is a potential cause of granulomatous typhlocolitis in horses. Diagnostic tools, such as immunohistochemistry, Gram’s and other bacterial stains, and PCR tests, in addition to bacterial culture, were used in the present case to aid in determination of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> as the major cause of enteric disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Ms Paula Bartlett, Ms Ingrid Fernandez, and Ms Sarah Bates are commended for
