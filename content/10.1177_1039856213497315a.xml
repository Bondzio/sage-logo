<p>With a newly elected Board in place since May, this is an exciting time for the College. In the days after Congress the first Board meeting was held in Sydney, where the new Board Directors confirmed as a priority the need to consolidate and strengthen the College’s relationships with both members and external stakeholders. Under the new governance arrangements, the General Council was replaced by the Board as the College’s overarching governing body, supported by its constituent committees and the Members’ Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Six constituent committees, each chaired by a Director of the Board, will provide advice and recommendations directly to the Board. As well as the Chair and elected Fellows, committees include representation from key internal stakeholders such as Overseas Trained Psychiatrists, Early Career Psychiatrists and the Private Practitioner Network, as well as consumer and carer groups, recognising their valuable perspective.</p>
<p>Each Director has been assigned a portfolio which involves chairing the relevant Committee, and reporting to the Board on the progress of its responsibilities. From an operational perspective, this will enable a greater synchronicity between the Board and its constituent committees.</p>
<p>The <bold>Audit Committee</bold>, chaired by President Elect Professor Malcolm Hopwood, is a new committee which is responsible for monitoring and reviewing overall audit policy and for identifying and reporting on any associated financial risks. I will be working closely with this committee and therefore any operational enquiries can be directed to me, in the first instance.</p>
<p>The <bold>Corporate Governance and Risk Committee</bold>, chaired by Associate Professor Victor Storm, develops and evaluates the College’s governance framework, principles and processes. It is also responsible for identifying and overseeing any risks associated with any College committees in accordance with the College’s Risk Management Policy. Operationally, it is supported by the Manager of the Office of the President and the Chief Executive Officer, Ms Louise Hain.</p>
<p>The <bold>Education Committee</bold> (replacing the Board of Education), chaired by Dr Margaret Aimer, is currently under review as part of regular College evaluation processes. It oversees the Training Program, and advises the Board on admission to Fellowship and the awarding of Advanced Training Certificates. It also identifies appropriate measures for the assessment of specialist international medical graduates and their pathway to Fellowship, and formulates advisory policy, programs and procedures for continuing medical education. It is supported by the Education and Training department which is led by General Manager, Ms Elaine Halley.</p>
<p>The <bold>Finance Committee</bold>, chaired by Dr David Alcorn, provides advice to the Board on outcomes and policies relating to statutory and contractual accountability and oversees the financial management of the College, including reviewing the annual budget. This work will be well supported by the Senior Manager, Financial Services.</p>
<p>A new committee, the <bold>Membership Engagement Committee</bold>, chaired by Dr Kym Jenkins, oversees activities aimed at meeting the College’s strategic objective of enhancing the value of College membership. The committee will meet quarterly and will work closely with the Membership and Communications staff of the College, headed by Senior Manager, Membership Services, Mr Jon Cullum.</p>
<p>The <bold>Practice and Partnerships Committee</bold> (replacing the Board of Practice and Partnerships) chaired by Dr Peter Jenkins remains an important driver of the College’s policy and advocacy agenda. Its role is to support psychiatric work through the development of clinical standards and evidence-based practice and to sustain important relationships with community groups including carers, consumers and families, other professional mental health groups, government, policy makers and funding bodies. The Committee also has carriage of the committees responding to indigenous issues in Australia and New Zealand. It is supported by the Practice, Policy and Projects department led by General Manager, Dr Anne Ellison.</p>
<p>The <bold>Members’ Advisory Council</bold> will play an important role in providing advice and informing the Board about members’ views and priorities. It is chaired by Professor Mal Hopwood and supported at an operational level by General Manager, Dr Mirco Kabat. Its membership includes representation from all Branches and the New Zealand National Committee, Faculties and Sections internal stakeholders and community representatives.</p>
<p>This committee structure has been designed to complement the priorities of the Board and the administrative operations of the College. Comments from members about the implementation are welcome via <email>governance@ranzcp.org</email>. Feedback will be reviewed and considered in the ongoing development of College governance.</p>
<p>This year, has been a landmark year in the life of the College. Congress was a great success; personally I would like to congratulate and thank everyone involved for their work and commitment. I would also like to thank General Council for their work over recent years. With 50 years as a College now behind us, it is pleasing to see the College moving forward as a community of specialist psychiatrists and trainees, and to focus on the challenges and opportunities facing psychiatry as a profession.</p>
