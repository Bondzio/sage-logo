<abstract>
<p>We write to report two rare cases of retinal vasculitis following administration of vaccinations. Both patients received recent vaccinations (within 4 weeks and 2 months respectively) and presented with unilateral visual loss due to retinal arteriolar vasculitis. Investigations did not reveal any other causes of vasculitis. The first patient's ocular inflammation settled following periocular steroid injection, whereas the second patient required the additional use of oral corticosteroid. Both patients had improved vision following treatment. Vaccinations can cause an autoimmune reaction. Systemic vasculitis has previously been described, whereas ocular vasculitic involvement is also possible but extremely rare. When seeing a patient with visual loss due to retinal vasculitis of unknown aetiology, a history of any recent vaccinations should be elicited.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0036933013482660" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 63-year-old gentleman was presented to the eye casualty department in December 2009 with a purple shadow appearing in his right vision, 4 weeks after receiving a swine influenza vaccination (Pandemrix 0.5 mL) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482660">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0036933013482660">2</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0036933013482660" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Colour fundus photograph of right eye.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0036933013482660-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<fig id="fig2-0036933013482660" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Fundus fluorescein angiography of right eye.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0036933013482660-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>His Snellen visual acuities were 6/4 bilaterally. Examination showed normal anterior segments. Dilated fundoscopy showed cotton wool spots and splinter haemorrhages around the optic nerve of the right eye with no signs of intraocular inflammation.</p>
<p>He returned 1 month later with arteriolar vasculitis in the peripapillary region with venous sparing, and no signs of retinitis or vitritis. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed early leakage and patchy hyperfluorescence in the arteriolar vessels in-keeping with arteriolar vasculitis. He was given 40 mg of subtenons triamcinolone on January 2010. His vasculitis has resolved and is currently inactive.</p>
<p>A different 63-year-old gentleman was presented to the eye casualty department in August 2010 with a 3-week history of right blurring of vision, 2 months after receiving vaccinations for diphtheria, tetanus and polio (Revaxis 0.5 mL) and for hepatitis A and typhoid (Viatim 1 mL) in May 2010 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0036933013482660">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0036933013482660">4</xref>).
<fig id="fig3-0036933013482660" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Colour fundus photograph of right eye.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0036933013482660-fig3.tif"/>

</fig></p>
<p>His Snellen visual acuities were 6/18 in the right eye and 6/5 in the left eye. There was evidence of reduced right optic nerve function, with a right RAPD, red desaturation and slight field defect.</p>
<p>Dilated fundoscopy showed unilateral right optic disc swelling with preretinal haemorrhage and submacular fluid. There was no evidence of intraocular inflammation.</p>
<p>FFA showed irregularity and sheathing of inferior retinal artery and proximal branches in keeping with arteriolar vasculitis. He showed no signs of systemic vascular disease.</p>
<p>He was treated with 40 mg of subtenons triamcinolone in September 2010. However, there was little clinical improvement initially, therefore he was commenced on a reducing dose of oral prednisolone, starting at 30 mg od.</p>
<p>As of June 2011 he has an improved visual acuity of 6/9 in the right eye, residual right optic disc atrophy and slightly reduced right visual field.</p>
<p>In both cases, all other causes for vasculitis were excluded by investigations. No infections, malignancy, autoimmune or rheumatic diseases were found.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0036933013482660" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Whilst minor and localised side effects are common following vaccinations, few cases of systemic vasculitis have been described. Several case reports suggest an association between vaccination and the development or exacerbation of chronic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482660">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482660"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482660">3</xref></sup> Ocular vasculitic involvement is therefore also a potential adverse effect. There have been no such other known cases published so far.</p>
<p>FFA is useful in confirming the diagnosis of arteriolar involvement. In such cases of retinal vasculitis, early administration of periocular and systemic steroid is important in reducing potentially irreversible visual loss due to papillitis and macular oedema.</p>
<p>With the increasing use of vaccinations, especially with seasonal influenza vaccines, it is extremely important to recognise this area of potential adverse effect since retinal vasculitis can cause complete blindness if left untreated.</p>
<p>Therefore when faced with a patient presenting with loss of vision and is subsequently found to have retinal vasculitis of unknown aetiology, eliciting a detailed past medical history including any history of recent vaccinations should be enquired, since these could rarely trigger an autoimmune reaction.</p>
