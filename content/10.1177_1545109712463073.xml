<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Retrospective chart review of 4 multidrug-resistant pediatric patients on DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimens. Viral load, CD4 count, adherence by pill count, and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage prior to and after switch to DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimen were assessed. Antiretroviral therapy history, duration of virologic failure, and time to viral suppression were also noted. Genotypic resistance assays reviewed for mutations present prior to switch.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs, long-term survival for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in resource-limited settings has become the rule, including for children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545109712463073">1</xref>
</sup> Yet, as cohorts’ experience with ART grows, treatment failure is becoming more common,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545109712463073">2</xref>
</sup> including failure on regimens containing ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), the mainstay for protease inhibitor (PI) therapy in Africa.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1545109712463073">3</xref>
</sup> LPV/r is part of standard second-line ART after failure on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-containing first-line regimen in a growing number of African countries, including Botswana where standard second-line ART includes Abacavir (ABC) or Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + LPV/r [4]. In addition, LPV/r-containing regimens are now recommended as first-line ART for infants and young children with previous nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) exposure via prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) strategies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1545109712463073">4</xref>
</sup> Indeed, recent data suggest that LPV/r-containing first-line regimens may be preferable for all infants and young children, regardless of NNRTI exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545109712463073">5</xref>
</sup> In Botswana, when these patients experience virological failure there is currently no standard second-line ART. A genotypic resistance assay is performed, and clinicians advised to consult a Ministry of Health-designated HIV Specialist in determining subsequent ART.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1545109712463073">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Botswana has one of the world’s highest HIV prevalence rates, estimated at 25.0% among adults aged 15 to 49 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545109712463073">6</xref>
</sup> Although there are a disproportionately large number of HIV-infected children (as many as 16 000 aged 0-14 years),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545109712463073">6</xref>
</sup> the Botswana national ART program has achieved success in delivering ART to &gt;90% of those in need, including over 10 000 children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1545109712463073">7</xref>
</sup> Botswana national ART guidelines follow World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations of first-line ART with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 1 NNRTI for children without previous NNRTI exposure, and 2 NRTIs and 1 PI for those with previous NNRTI exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545109712463073">8</xref>
</sup> In addition, LPV/r is part of the standard second-line ART for children in Botswana.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545109712463073">8</xref>
</sup> Genotypic resistance assays are available for those failing second-line ART and are used in developing subsequent treatment options; there is no standard national “third-line” or salvage ART regimen. Although uncommon, the number of children failing LPV/r-containing second-line regimens due to genotypically denoted LPV/r-resistance has increased in the recent years.</p>
<p>When children in Africa fail LPV/r-containing regimens, subsequent options are limited, and in many cases, inadequate. Recently, Botswana has made available raltegravir (RAL) and darunavir (DRV, boosted with mono-formulated ritonavir: DRV/r) for use by designated pediatric specialists in the treatment of children failing second-line ART with genotypically denoted LPV/r-resistance. Although DRV/r and RAL are both approved for use in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1545109712463073">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1545109712463073">10</xref>
</sup> and have shown clinical efficacy and good tolerability in children<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1545109712463073">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545109712463073"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1545109712463073">13</xref>
</sup>, data from resource-limited settings are scarce, and there is no currently published data from the routine clinical use of DRV/r and/or RAL in African children. Our study provides the first African data on outcomes in HIV-infected children and adolescents treated in a routine clinical setting with DRV/r and/or RAL after failure of LPV/r-based ART due to LPV/r resistance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1545109712463073" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Opened in 2003, the Botswana-Baylor Children’s Clinical Centre of Excellence (COE) is Botswana’s largest pediatric ART clinic with &gt;2000 HIV-infected children in care, of whom more than 1800 receive ART.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1545109712463073">14</xref>
</sup> Of these, approximately 400 patients are on LPV/r-containing second-line or salvage regimens, of which roughly 75% have achieved viral suppression (&lt; 400 copies/mL at last viral load assay). Complicated patients, including those failing second-line and salvage ART, are managed by a multidisciplinary team that has developed a framework for the use of advanced ART regimens in multidrug-resistant patients. In Botswana’s national ART program, use of DRV/r and/or RAL in children and adolescents is a decision made by a pediatric HIV expert on a case-by-case basis, as mandated by the Botswana Ministry of Health.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545109712463073">8</xref>
</sup> Criteria for approval include persistent virologic failure in the presence of good adherence and documented substantial genotypic LPV/r resistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545109712463073">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this study, a retrospective chart review of the 4 multidrug-resistant patients currently on DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimens at the COE was performed. Viral load (VL), CD4 count, adherence by pill count, and WHO clinical stage at the clinic visit prior to and at the most current visit (9-24 months) after switch to DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimen were assessed. In addition, ART history, duration of virologic failure—defined in Botswana National Treatment Guidelines as 2 or more sequential VL &gt;400 copies/mL<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545109712463073">8</xref>
</sup>—and time to viral suppression after switch were noted. Genotypic resistance testing was performed by HIV-1 ViroSeq Genotypic System (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) at the Botswana-Harvard HIV Reference Laboratory; assays were reviewed for NRTI-, NNRTI-, and PI-associated mutations prior to switch. Assays were reviewed for NRTI-, NNRTI-, and PI-associated mutations prior to switch. Drug resistance mutations were defined using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1545109712463073">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545109712463073">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1545109712463073">17</xref>
</sup> Also, LPV/r resistance may develop more easily in infants and young children,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1545109712463073">3</xref>
</sup> making management of LPV/r-resistant HIV a growing concern in our setting and similar settings where pediatric cohorts are accumulating experience on ART, and particularly where early adherence to ART may be challenging. Options for management of ART failure with LPV/r resistance are few—second-line regimens containing an NNRTI are often not durably potent, given most HIV-infected children, especially in southern Africa, have been previously exposed to an NNRTI, and continued use of LPV/r has not shown long-term durability when LPV/r resistance is present, as further resistance mutations accumulate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1545109712463073">15</xref>
</sup> Without any other options, adding ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (SQV/r) or another PI to LPV/r has been tried in our and other similar settings in the past; yet this approach carries a high pill burden, is poorly tolerable to many patients, and increases the risk of PI toxicity and side effects.</p>
<p>Previously reported protease genotype data obtained over several years from our treatment cohort who have failed PI-containing regimens indicate DRV/r remains an option even after failure of sequential unboosted PIs with a variety of major PI mutations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1545109712463073">17</xref>
</sup> and the same has been observed in other settings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1545109712463073">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545109712463073">16</xref>
</sup> Hence, DRV/r and RAL represent very potential choices for salvage ART in children and adolescents who have failed LPV/r and have high-grade PI resistance. Studies of DRV/r in treatment-experienced children and adolescents have yielded evidence of safety, tolerability, and potency in younger populations in resource-rich settings,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1545109712463073">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545109712463073">12</xref>
</sup> where DRV/r has been widely recommended as salvage therapy for children and adolescents older than 3 years with high degrees of treatment experience and antiretroviral (ARV) resistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545109712463073">12</xref>
</sup> Likewise, RAL has been evaluated in treatment-experienced pediatric populations in clinical trials in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings, showing potency, durability, and safety and is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for children aged 2 years and older.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1545109712463073">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1545109712463073">13</xref>
</sup> Both DRV/r and RAL in combination have been studied (along with etravirine [ETR]) in treatment-experienced adolescents to good success.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1545109712463073">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although our experience reported here involves a small number of patients, sustained virologic suppression has been achieved in patients previously experiencing persistent viremia with complete adherence to current ART line; immunologic indices improved or were stable at nonimmunosuppressed levels; and no intolerance or toxicity was noted, in all patients to date, including when high levels of resistance to PIs are present, including LPV/r. </p>
<p>Like most patients in southern Africa with LPV/r resistance, patients 1, 2, and 4 have a history of unboosted PI use prior to receiving LPV/r—in each of their cases nelfinavir (NFV) had been previously used as part of the second-line ART under older Botswana national guidelines. Patient 3’s LPV resistance developed without prior unboosted PI use, after approximately 3 years of documented persistent poor adherence to LPV/r and saquinavir/ritonovir (SQV/r).</p>
<p>Most patients in our setting who have failed first- and second-line ART have considerable NRTI mutations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1545109712463073">14</xref>
</sup> making the construction of durable NRTI backbones challenging; patients 1, 2, and 3 fit this profile, and we opt to use RAL along with DRV/r in such cases. Patient 4’s genotype while on zidovudine–lamivudine-LPV/r (AZT-3TC-LPV/r), however, demonstrated no NRTI mutations other than M184V, allowing us to hold RAL, with its low genetic barrier to resistance, for future treatment options, and swap DRV/r for LPV/r with a tenofovir–emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) backbone standard in Botswana for the patient’s age group.</p>
<p>The success seen in our Botswana pediatric cohort is congruent with the adult cohorts in resource-rich settings, where there is considerable experience with DRV/r and RAL, including patients who failed LPV/r, and considerable evidence of efficacy of these ARV drugs toward clinical, immunologic, and virologic end points in such cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1545109712463073">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pediatric data such as ours from routine clinical use of DRV/r and/or RAL in any setting, resource-rich or resource-limited, are scanty, and we are not aware of previously published reports from sub-Saharan Africa. Yet the success seen in our cohort is compared with non-trial data from resource-rich settings. In a French cohort 11 of 12 heavily treatment-experienced adolescents achieved viral suppression (&lt;400 copies/mL) with a regimen of DRV/r and RAL and ETR.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1545109712463073">18</xref>
</sup> Similarly, in a recently reported Spanish cohort of 19 children and adolescents (mean age 16 years) failing conventional ART of a variety of backbones, the addition of RAL resulted in viral suppression in 17 children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1545109712463073">20</xref>
</sup> As in our population, in both of these cohorts viral suppression was sustained, substantial immunologic improvement was noted in most patients, and no substantial DRV or RAL intolerance or toxicity was noted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1545109712463073">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Given the mounting evidence of the utility and safety of DRV/r, RAL, and other newer ARV options in children, appropriately there have been calls for expanded ART options for children in resource-limited settings failing LPV/r-based second-line ART,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545109712463073">5</xref>
</sup> for whom only few if any options currently exist. Specifically, DRV/r and RAL have been recommended for evaluation in such populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545109712463073">5</xref>
</sup> Our data provide evidence that, when made available, DRV/r and RAL present viable options for salvage therapy in most African children and adolescents with LPV/r and other multidrug resistance.</p>
<p>Although further monitoring of our population and prospective evaluation of larger numbers of patients are necessary for more robust conclusions to be drawn, broader access to these and other salvage therapies for HIV-infected youth in the developing world merits exploration. Despite best efforts in assuring adherence and other psychosocial supports which reduce the likelihood of ART failure, the number of children and adolescents requiring approaches beyond standard second-line ART will only grow with time, heightening the urgency of an emerging area of concern in the global pediatric HIV response. Investments will be required, as most settings in Africa currently lack the readily available VL monitoring and resistance genotyping available in Botswana and South Africa, upon which more sophisticated approaches to salvage ART such as described here depend.</p>
