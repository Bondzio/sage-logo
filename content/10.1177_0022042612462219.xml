<abstract>
<p>Offenders with a substance abuse diagnosis are often ordered to participate in treatment. However, little is known about how offenders perceive this mandate or how the criminal justice system should be involved. The procedural justice orientation suggests that offenders who view the mandate as legitimate and useful will be more likely to comply. In-depth interviews with probationers and parolees are analyzed to explore this issue. Overall, offenders held conflicting opinions about the mandate to attend treatment. Although offenders disliked being ordered to complete drug treatment, they understood the benefit of attending as a part of their reintegration and sobriety. Offenders felt their supervising officers were fair, but their role in drug treatment was to ensure program completion. This study adds to the literature by providing insight into offender perceptions of mandated treatment and the dimensions of the offender–officer relationship. Implications for procedural justice, future research, and policy are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many criminal offenders struggle with substance abuse. According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612462219">NCASA; 2010</xref>), approximately 70% to 85% of offenders in the United States have violated drug laws, were intoxicated at time of offense, committed the offense to support a drug habit, or have a history of drug addiction. To address the prevalence of substance abusing offenders, the criminal justice system often mandates treatment as a condition of probation or parole in efforts to reduce recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462219">Brecht, Anglin, &amp; Jung-Chi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612462219">Chavaria, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612462219">Farabee, Prendergast, &amp; Anglin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612462219">Inciardi &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612462219">Maxwell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612462219">Prendergast, Greenwell, Farabee, &amp; Hser, 2009</xref>). The criminal justice system accounts for 37% of all substance abuse treatment admissions making treatment a common component of community supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612462219">Hiller, Knight, Broome, &amp; Simpson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612462219">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMSHA], 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been considerable debate about the efficacy of mandated treatment. Researchers within the field of criminal justice link legal mandates to the rehabilitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612462219">Taxman, 1998</xref>), while psychological perspectives emphasize the importance of participation voluntariness. Although at odds, the debate has spurred little research on the perceptions of offenders who are given this mandate. The majority of research in this area has been evaluation of treatment programming and survey-based assessments of treatment outcomes, mainly program completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612462219">Anglin &amp; Maugh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462219">Brecht et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612462219">Hepburn &amp; Harvey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462219">Hiller, Knight, Leukefeld, &amp; Simpson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612462219">Olson, Rozhon, &amp; Powers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612462219">Salmon &amp; Salmon, 1983</xref>). Because the primary outcome measure is the successful completion of treatment, prior research has overlooked other dimensions of offender success such as continued sobriety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612462219">Anglin &amp; Maugh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462219">Brecht et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612462219">Hepburn &amp; Harvey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462219">Hiller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612462219">Olson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612462219">Salmon &amp; Salmon, 1983</xref>). The ways in which offenders perceive and internalize mandated drug treatment may provide insight into dimensions of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462219">Brecht et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612462219">Knight, Hiller, Broome, &amp; Simpson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612462219">Longshore, Prendergast, &amp; Farabee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612462219">Polcin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Integrating treatment philosophies with criminal justice is challenging. The procedural justice framework may be useful to reconciling the mandated treatment debate. Procedural justice asserts that individuals will comply with legal rules if they feel there is value and utility in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). In the mandated treatment setting, the legitimacy and usefulness of criminal justice agents in the treatment process may improve retention of treatment objectives for offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). The present study examines offender perceptions of mandated treatment within the procedural justice framework to explore offender perspectives of mandated treatment in the criminal justice system. The study examines offender perceptions of the mandate, the role of the probation or parole officer (PO) in the treatment setting, and the overall relationship with the probation or parole officer. The use of in-depth interviews provides a nuanced and detailed illustration of probationer and parolee experiences in mandated treatment. Most qualitative studies of substance-abusing offenders have focused on prison samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612462219">Gideon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612462219">Goodrum, Staton, Leukefeld, Webster, &amp; Purvis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612462219">Raney, Magaletta, &amp; Hubbert, 2005</xref>) and drug courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612462219">Hepburn &amp; Harvey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612462219">Whiteacre, 2007</xref>); however, offenders on traditional community supervision have been overlooked.</p>

<title>Mandated Treatment and Procedural Justice</title>
<p>Mandated treatment has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612462219">Inciardi, 1988</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612462219">1</xref></sup> Beginning with civil commitment of drug offenders in the early 20th century, the approach has evolved into present day practices of ordering drug offenders into prison-based therapeutic communities, community-based substance abuse treatment programs, and drug courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612462219">Marlowe, 2003</xref>). Many criminal justice agents view the use of mandates as a method of rehabilitation, but the inherent psychological juxtapositions in treatment motivation have been heavily debated in the substance abuse literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612462219">Maxwell, 2000</xref>). Mental health professionals argue that the coercive nature of mandated treatment is incompatible with the fundamental philosophy which emphasizes an intrinsic motivation to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612462219">Farabee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612462219">N. S. Miller &amp; Flaherty, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612462219">Prendergast et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612462219">Sia, Dansereau, &amp; Czuchry, 2000</xref>). Offenders who are mandated to treatment are seen as lacking in this motivation because they have not elected to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612462219">Farabee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612462219">Sia et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the treatment motivation debate, evaluation research suggests that mandated substance abuse programming can work. Studies show that individuals mandated into drug treatment programs perform as well, if not better, than those in treatment of their own volition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462219">Brecht et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612462219">Chavaria, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612462219">De Leon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612462219">Hiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612462219">Marlowe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612462219">D. Young &amp; Belenko, 2002</xref>). The most consistent finding of mandated treatment is that those legally ordered to participate in substance abuse programs stay in the programs longer and therefore have greater exposure to treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612462219">Broner, Maryl, &amp; Landsbery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612462219">Hiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612462219">Hubbard et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612462219">Knight et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612462219">Raney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612462219">Simpson, Joe, &amp; Brown, 1997</xref>). A review of 11 mandated treatment studies showed 45% of those ordered into programs reported more successful treatment completion than voluntary treatment entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612462219">Farabee et al., 1998</xref>). Offenders who are mandated into treatment see reductions in subsequent drug use and criminal activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462219">Brecht et al.’s (1993)</xref> study showed a 25% reduction in criminal activity of those who were ordered into treatment, as well as a 45% reduction in substance abuse.</p>
<p>Although it is apparent that legal coercion is a clear reason for offenders to enter into treatment, it is less clear how external motivation impacts the internalization of treatment objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612462219">Cosden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462219">Hiller et al., 2002</xref>). Procedural justice is one theoretical orientation that may shed light on how offenders internalize these mandates. Procedural justice suggests that people will comply with legal rules and directives if they feel there is value and utility in the directives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). Procedural justice has multiple dimensions, including consistency, neutrality, and motive-based trust (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612462219">Henderson, Wells, Maguire, &amp; Gray, 2010</xref>). People view the criminal justice system and its agents as fair if their authority is exerted in a reasonable, consistent, and trustworthy manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612462219">Henderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). Opinions about justice are shaped more by the process and the trust in officials themselves, than by the actual decisions or directives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022042612462219">Tyler &amp; Huo, 2002</xref>). Most prior research in procedural justice emphasizes interactions with police, courts, and prisons. Research on drug courts has shown that offenders perceive the drug courts as fair, but how this improves outcomes for offenders has not been conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612462219">Gottfredson, Kearley, Najaka, &amp; Rocha, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612462219">D. Young &amp; Belenko, 2002</xref>). Extending this concept to mandated treatment setting, the degree to which people will fully engage likely depends on how much choice they believe they have in following directives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612462219">Prendergast et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A hallmark of mandated treatment is the use of legal sanctions to gain compliance. The use of legal sanctioning, such as technical violations, is a strong external motivation to attend treatment and eventually persuades offenders in seeing its benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612462219">Applegate, Smith, Sitren, &amp; Springer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612462219">Chavaria, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022042612462219">Wexler, Lipton, &amp; Johnson, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612462219">Maxwell (2000)</xref> examined offender perceptions of sanctions and found that a greater perceived threat of sanction resulted in a longer stay in treatment programming. Other evidence suggests that knowing that there are real consequences for behavior can motivate offenders to comply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612462219">Smith, Applegate, Sitren, &amp; Springer, 2009</xref>). A negative result of sanctioning, however, is that offenders may lack trust in treatment providers for fear of punishment, and thus treatment may be counterproductive by eliciting feelings of resentment and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612462219">Marlowe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612462219">Martin, Garske, &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). The quality of the therapeutic relationship is an important predictor of successful treatment outcomes, and procedural justice would suggest that building trust, legitimacy, and fairness will improve these overall outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022042612462219">
<title>The Role of Officers in Treatment Settings</title>
<p>The increased use of substance abuse treatment by criminal justice agencies suggests treatment staff and officers should share treatment objectives and rehabilitative goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612462219">Prendergast, Anglin, &amp; Wellisch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612462219">Steiner, 2004</xref>). Officers believe they should play an equal part in treatment and supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612462219">Duffee &amp; Carlson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612462219">Herie, Cunningham, &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612462219">Sigler &amp; McGraw, 1984</xref>). More specifically, officers feel they should play a substantive role in the identification of substance abuse problems, treatment planning, and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612462219">Blevins, Morton, &amp; McCabe, 1996</xref>). Criminal justice agencies have been slow to unify these objectives, and as a result, little empirical attention has been paid to the offender–officer relationship in this setting.</p>
<p>Prior research on the officer–offender relationship has typically focused on the officer perspective, but a select set of studies has examined offender perceptions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612462219">Allen (1985</xref>, p. 70) found that the majority of probationers felt the purpose of supervision was rehabilitation, but the officer’s main job was to “keep tabs” on the probationer. More recent research suggests that offenders perceive supervision officers as “responsible for controlling and coercing” offenders into abiding by conditions of supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612462219">Smith et al., 2009</xref>, p. 242). Control and coercion through directives and mandates legitimize the officer’s authoritative role, but can simultaneously inhibit trust and the quality of the relationship. In a survey of probationers in Florida, Springer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612462219">Applegate, Smith, and Sitren (2009)</xref> found probationers respected their officers and felt they were fair, but most probationers felt the most important role of their officer was to administer sanctions. Other research suggests that sanctions, threats, and program visits by officers reinforced the perception of POs as law enforcement agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022042612462219">M. S. Young, Fluellen, &amp; Belenko, 2004</xref>). Procedural fairness by the officer and the quality of the offender–officer relationship may be essential to positive outlooks on legal rules and the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612462219">Rottman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612462219">Taxman and Thanner (2003)</xref> observed that when offenders feel the actions of the probation or parole officer are fair, they were less likely accrue subsequent arrests or violations.</p>
<p>The majority of the literature suggests that offenders focus on the law enforcement role of the criminal justice system. Even though POs expect to take part in substance abuse treatment, there is little evidence suggesting that offenders see this as part of their job. To that end, the limits of procedural justice in the mandated treatment setting remain unexplored. This current study presents a unique opportunity to explore dimensions of mandated treatment and the offender–officer relationship from the perspective of the offender. To date, much of the empirical literature has been produced from quantitative data sets, but qualitative data can provide insight into offender lived experiences, expectations, and perceptions of the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022042612462219">Wild, Roberts, &amp; Cooper, 2002</xref>). Thus, three domains are explored through qualitative analysis: (a) offender perceptions of mandated treatment, (b) the role of their supervising officer in this treatment, and (c) qualities of the offender–officer relationship.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The present study emerged from a larger research project on drug use, crime, and challenges of reentry for substance abusing offenders. Data for this study are drawn from in-depth interviews with 36 male probationers and parolees attending court or parole board–mandated treatment. Interviews were completed between February and April 2010. Offenders attended substance abuse treatment at the Horizons Foundation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612462219">2</xref></sup> an outpatient, community-based alcohol and drug treatment facility in a Midwestern city.</p>
<sec id="section5-0022042612462219">
<title>Program Profile</title>
<p>The Horizons Foundation serves both state and federal offenders in a variety of contexts, including pretrial treatment, postconviction treatment, and voluntary admissions. In the present study, offenders were under state supervision for various offenses at the time of the interview and were attending treatment as part of their postconviction supervision. Half of the interviewees were probationers participating in a program called Enterprise for Community Improvement (ECI) and half were parolees participating in a program titled Out and Clear (OC). The ECI program is intended to preempt prison for offenders who display noncompliant or criminal behaviors while on probation supervision. To qualify for the ECI program, probationers must have admitted to current use of drugs or had a positive drug test. Failure to successfully complete ECI could lead to additional violations or, ultimately, to probation revocation. At the time of the study, ECI served approximately 125 offenders. Offenders in the OC program were participating in the program as a component of aftercare following substance abuse treatment that was completed while incarcerated in prison. All the offenders in this sample were on parole following some period of incarceration where they had also completed short-term or long-term substance abuse treatment prior to release. OC offenders had self-identified or been assessed as having a substance abuse problem at the time of incarceration. Failure to successfully complete OC would result in additional conditions of parole or revocation of parole. At the time of the study, OC served approximately 300 offenders.</p>
<p>Both ECI and OC offenders attended the same group counseling and education sessions at least once a week at the Horizons Foundation facility. Group counseling included approximately 20 offenders and a counselor. Group education surrounded topics such as sex education, job searching, and financial planning. As a component of the treatment program, offenders were drug tested on a weekly basis. Treatment lasted approximately 6 months and applied the same substance abuse treatment modality. All offenders met with their PO weekly. A unique feature of ECI and OC is that POs were part of the “treatment team” and collaborated with personnel, therapists, and case managers to address specific concerns and needs of each offender. In some instances, officers were also responsible for initial substance abuse treatment assessments and treatment and additional resource referrals, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.</p>

<p>Prior to data collection, a group of trained researchers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612462219">3</xref></sup> provided an introductory presentation outlining the research objectives and procedures to the offenders attending treatment at Horizons Foundation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022042612462219">4</xref></sup> Each week, at the end of group counseling or group education sessions, one or two researchers presented (with the help of counselors and administrators) the purpose of the research and asked for volunteers. If there were more volunteers than interviewers available, random selection was used. Most commonly, only enough offenders volunteered to match the number of researchers present. Interviews were conducted in private offices at the treatment facility and lasted approximately 90 min. Interviewers began with a description of the interview then assured offenders confidentiality and completed an informed consent form. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed, at which time pseudonyms were applied.</p>
<p>A semistructured interview guide with open-ended questions and probes was used. Semistructured interviews allow for not only consistent questions across interviews but also the opportunity for participants to fully express themselves without the bias of leading questions. Interviews began with the collection of demographic data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612462219">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022042612462219">5</xref></sup> All participants were male, and the majority was African American. The average age of participants was 32.4. Most offenders did not complete high school, and most offenders were not working at the time of the interview. More than half of the offenders were living on their own or with family while in treatment. Many of the offenders had children, with an average of 2.6 children per offender. Nineteen of the offenders reported presently being in a romantic relationship.</p>

<p>The interview guide covered a range of topics, including counseling, drug initiation, and relapse. The present study focuses on offender perceptions about mandated treatment, the role of the officer in treatment, and the offender–officer relationship in the mandated treatment setting. These domains included questions such as “How is your relationship with your PO?” “Does your PO treat you with respect?” “What role does your PO play in your treatment?” and “What do you think about having to come to treatment as a condition of your probation/parole?” Considerable probing within these domains provided more detail. Although data from this study do not produce generalizable results, qualitative research methods are useful for examining social processes and the meanings people ascribe to their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612462219">J. Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0022042612462219">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All interview data pertaining to perceptions of mandated treatment and the role and relationship with the PO were compiled into a single data set in word processing software. Domain analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612462219">Spradley, 1979</xref>) and an open-coding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612462219">Silverman, 2006</xref>) were applied to glean themes from within the data. An initial reading of the data consisted of identifying word and phrase patterns that supported the domains of interest. Subsequent readings of the interviews produced additional themes that further clarified offender perceptions within these domains. To improve the consistency of findings, two researchers in addition to the author independently reviewed a selection of transcripts and compared themes. Researchers also compared statements within and across interviews to enhance the rigor of the analytic techniques by demonstrating patterns and divergent themes. Differences between probationers (ECI) and parolees (OC) were considered throughout the analysis. Though differences between the ECI and OC groups emerged relative to some topics in the interview guide, there were no clear differences in the distribution of statements surrounding perceptions of mandated treatment and the role and relationship of the probation and parole officer. It is acknowledged that differences in life circumstances, criminal and incarceration histories, and depth of substance abuse problems might exist, but the findings here suggest there are no substantive differences in the experiences of offenders in the treatment program relative to domains of interest, with the exception of parolee’s opinion that they should not have to receive aftercare programming. This difference will be explored further in the article. Besides this single theme, the probationers and parolees are treated as one sample, and the offender’s program affiliation (ECI or OC) is indicated throughout. The illustrations provided typify the most common patterns in the offender’s accounts, and quotes are left intact to preserve the integrity and context of the offenders’ statements.</p>

<title>Offenders Perceptions of Mandated Treatment</title>
<sec id="section10-0022042612462219">
<title>Conflicting opinions</title>
<p>The offenders in this sample reported conflicting opinions about mandated treatment. More than half (53%) of the offenders did not like being ordered into treatment but understood its utility. For Gary (OC), being ordered to go to treatment kept him from getting into additional trouble, even though he disliked attending. When asked how he felt about being required to come to Horizons, Gary stated, “I don’t like it, but I think it’s beneficial by keeping me out of trouble, by keeping me away from drugs.” Jerome (ECI) stated, “I think it sucks, [but] you know blessings come in different ways, and this, I need it, I mean, like, I wasn’t going to do it myself.” Sean (OC) agreed, stating, “At first I was like ‘this is bullshit,’ you know what I’m saying? And now I’m getting to understand it ‘cause I been stepping up on the ladder and they really trying to help you.” Sean’s statement is an example of how external motivation translated into internal motivation because he was experiencing success.</p>
<p>Likewise, four other offenders acknowledged the importance of internal motivation when participating in treatment. Phillip (OC) felt offenders should be able to choose whether to come to treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>A person should have their own choice. You know what I’m saying? To go or not, you know? ‘Cause, when you force somebody to do it, they don’t really want to do it. And that’s, you know what I’m saying, is what it is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Larry (ECI) felt being forced treatment was good for him, he had a different opinion about other offenders:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’ll help them more if they come in openly. Instead of being rebellious, like, “I don’t wanna go there, I’m not going there, I ain’t gonna do that,” and have to end up being forced to come here. I feel like they are in denial and they really don’t wanna admit to their drug use.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022042612462219">
<title>Treatment is helpful</title>
<p>Despite feeling conflicted about being mandated to treatment, 38% (14) of offenders noted the therapeutic benefits of being required to attend. Anton (OC) stated, “Yeah, it’s helpful, it’s helpful a lot.” Kenny (ECI) stated, “I guess it’s good because I know, I know completing this program I will be clean.” Terrance (ECI) implied that if the treatment was not required, he might still be using drugs: “I actually don’t have a problem with it [attending treatment], you know? Like I say, ‘cause it help me out. If it wasn’t no requirement, no telling what I be doing.” James’s (OC) perspective was that he was directly involved in the requirement to attend treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>It feeled [sic] good because I know I played a part in it, so I don’t feel that it’s a requirement, I’m the one who did this to myself, so I don’t think this a requirement, it’s something I needed and I need to continue it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though he was not there voluntarily, Orlando (OC) reported that he benefited from attending treatment at Horizons:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the first two weeks I was kinda confused and scared you know, what was goin’ on, but after that I just it took a weight on me, ‘cause a lot of times, you sit and listen to those guys, and then you gotta say something. Then you think about how their events in their life, their past and all that, everybody opens in there. Every time you’re in group counseling, everyone’s gotta share. You walk outta there and it’s like you leave the bad part of you there and you’re taking the good part with ya, and it gives you something to stay focused on. This, to me it’s like a motivation, right, like keeps me wanting to keep going and trying harder just so I can get to aftercare. And that I can accomplish the things I need to do . . . I don’t think I’d probably be sober today. I think that I’d probably be sitting worse than where I am, back with the other stuff cause I’d probably pick up that habit again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Orlando recognizes that if he were not forced to go, then he would likely experience a relapse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022042612462219">
<title>Postincarceration treatment</title>
<p>One difference that emerged between ECI and OC offenders was the perspective on attending treatment as a component of aftercare. Aftercare is unique to OC offenders because they have already completed treatment while in prison. Half (nine) of OC offenders discussed their frustration about attending aftercare. Maurice (OC) typified the parolee’s perspective about aftercare. He also recognized the necessity of drug treatment because of the nature of addiction, but could not see why he needed to attend aftercare:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I don’t know, man. It’s kinda, I guess, to a certain extent, we need it, you know? We addicts. But, when I first got out of jail, I was like, ‘Ok, I’m out, so all I gotta do now is report to my PO, and then he tells me about this and it’s like, “I got this bit four months of treatment [while in prison], now I gotta go and do some more—this is crazy!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maurice discussed how at first he was resistant, but then “got used to it.” Maurice complied with the treatment directive to make things easier, implying that the motivation for him to attend treatment was to avoid more legal trouble, such as a violation. Maurice states, “I mean, once you get in and involved and get used to it, instead of fighting against it, you know, and just going with it, it makes it easier.”</p>
<p>Some parolees saw aftercare as a hindrance to reintegration. Patrick (OC) felt that having to complete aftercare added more stress to his reintegration from prison:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just did six month treatment in the institution. For me to come out for this to be aftercare, I feel I don’t need it. Cause I’m through six months of it. It’s just adding on. This is more stressful to me. I’ve been through six month of treatment, and then got to come to aftercare treatment to complete this program here. It’s just a waste, as far as I’m concerned. I don’t, but, don’t get me wrong. Horizons is good help for individuals, but, as far as I’m concerned, I don’t need it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nelson (OC) suggests that if he knew he would have to participate in outpatient treatment upon release, he would have rather served his entire prison sentence than do additional treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel that if . . . they going to send me to Horizons, after I left a treatment, and they gonna tell me that in the beginning, I wouldn’t have took no treatment, I would have take my time, know what I’m saying? ‘Cause I figured if I’ve completed my treatment already then why do I gotta come out and get right back into treatment?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, offenders saw being forced to come to treatment as frustrating and motivating at the same time. It is apparent from the offender statements that they understand the logic of requiring substance abusers to attend treatment as a part of probation or parole, but do not always feel they are in need of services. In the case of half the parolees, participating in aftercare was frustrating because they had already completed treatment while incarcerated. The additional mandate did not make sense to them, and therefore the legitimacy of being ordered to complete treatment was compromised.</p>

<title>The Role of the Officer in Mandated Treatment</title>
<sec id="section14-0022042612462219">
<title>No part in treatment</title>
<p>An important component for understanding success in treatment is offender perceptions about the professionals who are part of the treatment program, though most research has emphasized counselors, not POs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612462219">Duffee &amp; Carlson, 1996</xref>). To explore the role of officers in the treatment program, offenders were asked about their perception of the officer’s duties. Of the study sample, 22% indicated their officer had no role in their substance abuse treatment. For example, when asked what role his officer played in his treatment program, Reggie (ECI) stated, “She has no part, she’s just a PO.” Carter (ECI) said the same, “They’re really not—your counselors are the ones involved.”</p>
<p>The most common description of the PO role in treatment was one of enforcement. A majority of offenders (67%) indicated that officer’s role was to check attendance and conduct random drug tests. Bobby (OC) stated, “She have to make sure that I complete, to go through this class . . . ” Maurice (OC) stated, “He checks in with my counselor to make sure I’m dropping clean and I’m showing up to my classes and stuff like that. So, he keeps a daily tab on me.” Kenny’s (ECI) view about his officer’s role in treatment was adversarial. Kenny stated, “She mainly be on me about Horizons. That’s her biggest concern with me is to do Horizons. Well, and get a job. Yeah, she just be on me . . . she make sure I’m going and staying clean.” His description that she “mainly be on me” suggests he felt his officer is nagging him about completing treatment. The theme of “being on me” (a phrase expressed by 14% of the sample) suggests some frustration among offenders, which could hinder a positive relationship with their officer. This pattern of statements also reinforces the officer’s primary function of enforcement.</p>
<p>Offenders made a clear distinction between the roles of PO and substance abuse treatment counselor. Sean (ECI) said, “They don’t get involved in your treatment, that’s you and your counselor’s business.” Even when officers communicated with treatment staff, offenders continued to feel that the officer role in the drug treatment setting was enforcement oriented. Tyler (OC) felt his officer had no role in the treatment program, but did acknowledge his officer kept in contact with this counselor. However, this contact was to make sure the offender was doing what he supposed to, and not necessarily for therapeutic gain:
<disp-quote>
<p>See, my parole officer and my counselor are like two different, you know, areas of people. So, if I have a personal problem I would go to my counselor. A parole officer is just far as more for the state and reporting, for my parole obligations. It’s like two different categories. I mean, it’s just like they’re obligated to make sure I’m coming and reporting but basically that’s it, they don’t do anything as far as my counseling sessions, that’s my counselor, but my counselor and my parole officer, they do stay in touch and talk to each other.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022042612462219">
<title>Violations</title>
<p>Concern over violations was a theme that emerged in the analysis. Approximately half of the offenders (47%) reported that the threat of violation influenced their participation in the treatment program. Phillip (OC) considered his officer part of the treatment program because she had sanctions that motivated him to attend. The officer’s threats were an influence on his participation in the program: “Well she . . . the roll call. She the one say do or don’t. You know what I’m saying? ‘Cause if I don’t she got somewhere for me.” Phillip implies that if he does not comply, then he will incur a violation, which could result in being returned to prison. Tyler (OC) stated, “Well, it [violations] motivates me to come, whether I participate or not, if I want help, it’s on me, but I am expected to come, so I guess it does.” Curtis <bold>(</bold>ECI) agreed that avoiding violations was a motivating factor for participation in treatment, and recognized his officer would know immediately if he violated his conditions: “You get a violation. You thinking what’s gonna happen to you? It’s, it’s just something about them violations.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022042612462219">
<title>Positive role in treatment</title>
<p>Despite the enforcement role, about one third of offenders (31%) felt positively about their officer in some ways. Officers who asked questions about how treatment was going were perceived as caring about the offender’s well-being. Ronald (ECI) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean she like she’ll call up here, just to make sure I’m here. And she, you know what I’m saying, comes sometime, and she, when I go see her, she ask me what I learnt [sic] in class, “did you like that?” so I guess she playin’ a role.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>William, a probationer, also felt the show of concern was helpful to his treatment, saying, “he ask me and stuff, when they gonna move me up and stuff ‘cause he hear I’m doin’ good and everything.” Larry (ECI) felt his officer was invested in his success in the program. Though he did not indicate a specific therapeutic benefit, his officer’s concern for his well-being was important:
<disp-quote>
<p>She involved with my recovery and, that’s one of the most important things that they involve theyself with because they don’t wanna see you do bad. You know, they job is to make sure you doin’ better, you are progressin’, you know, and you are able to live, maintain and live a sober and clean life, as well as, how should I put this, um, a noncriminal life. Yeah, they wanna make sure you productive in those areas.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Frank’s (OC) perspective highlights how the PO being involved in the treatment program might improve it. Frank stated, “I think for other people, yeah, if they PO [was] here they might participate more, give it a little more effort.”</p>
<p>Most offenders were skeptical of their officer’s ability to provide therapeutic services and saw them strictly as caseworkers and law enforcement. Offenders in this sample felt that their officer’s role in regard to substance abuse treatment was to enforce attendance and completion and deliver sanctions in response to subsequent drug use or noncompliance. Offenders detailed the importance of violations as a motivating factor for attending treatment, as well as a factor in legitimizing officer authority.</p>

<sec id="section17-0022042612462219">
<title>The Offender–Officer Relationship</title>
<sec id="section18-0022042612462219">
<title>“We Cool . . .”</title>
<p>Similar to their conflicting views about mandatory treatment, a majority of offenders (53%) had conflicting perspectives about the relationship with their probation or parole officer. Some offenders felt that while they had a good relationship with their officer, the officer’s role as an authority figure and the threat of sanctions seemed to hinder trust. A common description of the relationship was that it was “cool.” Barry (OC) stated, “He cool, know what I’m saying? He cool. I don’t mess with authority figures like that for real.” Darnell (OC) shared this view, stating, “I guess [we] cool ‘cause I try not to give him no problems, try to give him no violations, no trouble and stuff.” Offenders were tolerating the relationship with the officer and trying to avoid getting into trouble. Curtis’ (ECI) statement also reflects this feeling, though he recognizes that his own actions may have caused his officer to react to him in negative ways. Regardless of his justification, the conflict results in a tempered relationship. Curtis said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a nice relationship, but it’s like, she hard to trust because she want me to do everything for her. But like if I mess up one time, you know, ain’t nobody perfect. She wanna take it out. Threaten you to lock you up. Or anything. Or threaten you on house arrest. But other than that, overall, she cool. She nice to talk to. You know, you can go and talk to her about your problems and she’ll give good feedback. So I think, me personally, my relationship is like 75% good, 25% percent bad. 75% good. It’s on you though. It’s on you to make them choices. To mess up and to make your PO that way towards you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most offenders expressed they were only doing what they needed to in order to complete supervision, which suggest a lack of focus on rehabilitation. Phillip (OC) described the relationship with his officer:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s cool, it’s so-so. I ain’t gonna say we cool as . . . but we all right. We get past what we supposed to get past. I don’t think nobody gonna say they cool with their officer. And nobody like . . . ya know what I’m saying. Doing, ya know, to get off this stuff, ya know. That’s all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Phillip saw the authoritative nature of his probation officer as prohibitive of a positive relationship with her. Although he thought the <italic>relationship</italic> with his officer was “cool,” he did not feel as though he and his officer were “cool” (i.e., they were friends), indicating he recognized the relationship was a compulsory one.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022042612462219">
<title>Positive (Fairness)</title>
<p>Although some offenders described a tenuous relationship with their probation officer, a majority (53%) suggested the relationship was also positive. Terrance (ECI) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Love him . . . cause, um, we sit down and talk about, you know, problems I have and stuff like that . . . In other words, he uh, whatever, anything I basically talk him about and stuff, he got a solution for.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another offender felt the relationship was good because he and his officer discussed topics other than probation. Sean (ECI) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Oh yeah, we have discussions, it don’t always be about my papers, it be about how I’m doing, know what I’m saying? You know, I ask how she doing, I been with her for almost two or three years, she got a understanding of me and I understand her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sean felt that because his officer displayed concern for him over the course of his probation that their relationship was more understanding. When asked how his relationship is with his PO, Harris (OC) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s wonderful. I love her, because she stays on, she stays on me, and she keeps a positive attitude, she has a, she shows me that she has a lot of, um, what’s the word, um, she has big, big expectations for me, and it helps to see it someone cares a lot for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Central to the concept of procedural justice is the idea that offenders will cooperate with officers when they are perceived as fair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). Approximately one third (31%) of offenders felt their officers were fair in dealing with them while in the treatment program. Neal (ECI) stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I mean, being honest, she got a job to do, and I’m pretty sure she ain’t gonna get fired from her job to make me happy so, I mean she do her part, and if I mess up, it on me. She a fair lady.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Zack (ECI) stated, “She’s pretty fair, she seems like she’s you know no nonsense, you know what I’m saying.” When Reggie (ECI) knew he would test positive for drugs (“dirty”), he told his officer in advance:

<p>I’m gonna be honest with my PO, you know? Like about a lot of things you gotta do for like your home planning and where you staying and stuff, like I just changed a home plan, and knew that not telling can get me in trouble, like not even get me in trouble, but a violation can be in trouble, you know, so I just let him know, “Man . . . I’m dirty,” I’m gonna let him know “I can’t drop today, you know, you can drop me, but I’m letting you know I’m dirty.” I’m not gonna play no games, for this my life, you know what I’m saying? So if I’m playing with anyone it’s gonna be myself, ‘cause he is going to do his shit by the books, you know?</p>

<p>Offenders felt that their officers were respectful because they followed the law but felt they were fair when they provided leniency in response to bad behavior. Victor (ECI) indicated his relationship with his officer was good because she was lenient with him when he made mistakes, and this was one way he perceived her as fair:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have my parole officer, she is, she is very cool, sometimes, you know, she can get, you know, she can get really lenient, try to play by the book. I am [a] convicted felon, and you know, I don’t ask too much leeway, but I feel that I should be have some type of leeway, you know, my parole officer is a kind of parole officer, she’s by the book, she is respectful. But, if you ask for some type of leeway, she will give you a leeway. She is very fair.</p>

<title>Negative (Stereotyping)</title>
<p>Positive statements about POs were juxtaposed by the feelings of distrust and negativity held by the other offenders (31%). A hindrance to a trusting relationship between the offender and officer was the offender’s sense that they were stereotyped by their PO. An important component of procedural justice is that a person feels like their value and social status is affirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>). However, when offenders stated they felt stereotyped, this may have compromised their trust in procedural fairness displayed by officers. Several offenders (seven) felt that their officer stereotyped them as “typical” offenders because the officer sees the same kinds of offenders every day. Andrew (OC) said,
<disp-quote>
<p>She treat me with respect, but she still look down on me just cause all the people she go through and talk to, you know what I’m saying? They look at you like the next person that they think is a low-life too, you know what I’m saying? They really do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Neal (ECI) felt his officer thought he was lying to her about things going on in his life because of all the other offenders she see, but then admits it may have to do with his actions (testing positive for drugs or “dropping dirty”):
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know how long she been a PO but for her being a PO the amount of years she been a PO and the bullshit she done heard, she probably feel like I’m on some bullcrap or I’m lying to her or something, know what I mean. So, I guess it’s a trust thing and by me dropping dirty and not coming to class, and stuff, like I should, of course she’ll probably not believe half the stuff I say, ‘cause I’m not doing the right things so.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A positive relationship with the PO can be disrupted if the offender demonstrates a history of criminal behavior, sometimes along with continued criminal or deviant behavior, which affirms some of the stereotypes displayed by the officers in this sample. Frank (OC) felt he was typecast as an “average” offender. Frank felt that because he was African American and had a prior felony conviction, he was stereotyped and labeled before his officer got to know him. Frank further indicated that because his officer typecast him as a drug dealer, it damaged their relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had a probation officer before and me and her pretty much didn’t get along, she was a different race than me, I felt like I was prejudged by my appearances, you know what I’m saying, and she didn’t get a chance really to look at my ethnic background, or the things I was doing . . . I had to explain to her I’m not just the average criminal, you know, this just my first felony ever . . . I guess you would say I look like the typical drug dealer and I guess that’s how I was classified to her as and that’s the way the relationship started, so it was pretty messed up.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some offenders felt stereotyped because the officer acted as if he or she had “seen it all,” indicating the present offender was no different than other offenders, or that the offender’s situation was not unique. Reggie (ECI) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>You see things like when they don’t want to hear stuff, they feel like they seen it all, you know, so they might be close minded to your situation at the time, you know, because they feel like they heard it, you know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eric (ECI) felt his officer understood some things, but the nature of the job made it difficult to understand other things. When asked whether his probation officer understands where he is coming from, Eric stated “in some ways she do, but in some ways she don’t, ‘cause you know some of these officers, they be so tired ‘cause they got to do the stuff day after day after day after day . . . ” Another offender explained why the officer might see most offenders the same way. Zack (ECI) felt it was his responsibility to show the officer he was not like the other offenders:
<disp-quote>
<p>I understand that they have a lot of offenders, and heard this been through that, it’s up to the individual to show the PO that you know it’s not like, you know, the previous one that they probably had know what I’m saying? So I can’t judge her or how she comes to me or think I am because they see it every day?</p>

<sec id="section21-0022042612462219">
<title>Communication</title>
<p>The relationship between the officer and the offenders was also characterized by the way the officer communicated with them, and 22% (eight) of offenders specifically discussed communication patterns with their officer. Terrance (ECI) stated the relationship with the officer was dictated “by the way they talk, you know? In general how they talk to you. Everything that come out they mouth is either trying to benefit me or help me, you know, get through in life.” Phillip (OC) agreed that the way his officer treated him was critical to the nature of their relationship. The way in which the officer spoke to the offender was essential to developing a respectful and compliant relationship. Phillip said, “For one, how a person speak to you . . . only way you can be disrespected . . . is a person cursing you out or something like that.” Officers who were “rude and loud” were viewed as disrespectful, and these offenders tended not to trust their officer and viewed them as combative. Franklin (OC) felt the way his officer talked to offenders might explain why offenders absconded while under her supervision. Franklin stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>She just gets loud with people. But I think that’s just how she is. Put it this way, I don’t know how many POs are there, but, my PO has got more people run or abscond than any other PO in that building. She’s just kinda rude and loud with some people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, officers who spoke respectfully and kindly to offenders were viewed more favorably. Bobby (OC) stated, “I just feel she’s very understanding, I feel she understands where I’m coming from, that’s basically, ‘cause she knows how to talk to me . . . ” Neal (ECI) agreed,
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, she greet me when I come in, she treats me like a human being, basically, that’s respect to me. She don’t get loud with me, or call me out my name, or yell at me or nothin’, we just sit down and talk, that’s basically it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Offender–officer relationships were characterized by a dichotomy of respect and reservation. Themes surrounding the dimensions of this respect or reservation emerged in how POs stereotype offenders. Responses from the offenders suggest that a respectful relationship between the offender and the officer is supported by the perception that officers are fair in dealing with offender issues, as well as the way in which officers communicated with offenders. In particular, the way in which officers spoke to offenders seemed to impact the perceptions about respect, while fairness was demonstrated through leniency. In contrast, most offenders had difficulty trusting their officer because of the authoritative nature of the relationship.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study explores offender perceptions of mandated treatment, the role of probation and parole officers in the treatment setting, and the offender–officer relationship. Interviews with probationers and parolees in a mandated drug treatment program and qualitative analysis provide nuanced data on these domains, which have been underexplored in the literature. A procedural justice orientation allows examination of offender perceptions and whether they are consistent with the aims of mandated treatment. Findings suggest that while offenders do not like having to attend treatment, they see benefits for their reentry and acknowledge that some offenders need treatment. Offenders gave rich characterizations of positive and negative relationships with officers, with the most consistent finding being the lack of officer role in the treatment process.</p>
<p>This sample of offenders struggled with the conflicting ideas about needing treatment, being forced into treatment, and having criminal justice sanctions (namely, violations) as motivators. Although most offenders felt they did not need treatment, they derived some benefits and saw it as important for other offenders. This finding is consistent with the procedural justice element of legitimacy. Offenders saw the delivery of the mandate as legitimate and justified even though they were frustrated with being required to attend themselves. One unique theme emerged between the ECI (probationers) and OC (parolees) groups. Parolees expressed frustration with having to go through treatment again because they had already completed similar programming while incarcerated. For parolees, the legitimacy of the treatment mandate was compromised. Although aftercare treatment is important to maintaining sobriety, these offenders felt it was burdensome for their reintegration into society. This result suggests that some parolees were not taking an active role in the therapeutic process, implying the treatment motivation is purely external. Offenders who feel they do not need treatment may not successfully complete the treatment program, may see deleterious effects from the frustration over attending, or incur sanctions from noncompliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612462219">Hepburn &amp; Harvey, 2007</xref>). However, research has shown that levels and types of motivation are important for offender success in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462219">Hiller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612462219">Marshall &amp; Hser, 2002</xref>). The literature supports the use of legal coercion as a viable motivator in substance abuse treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612462219">Chavaria, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612462219">N. S. Miller &amp; Flaherty, 2000</xref>), and the present findings seem to support this, at least in part. Most offenders expressed that they were participating in treatment to avoid receiving a violation (external motivation), but some offenders discussed the importance of wanting to change on their own (internal motivation).</p>
<p>External motivation was also characterized by the officer’s role in the treatment program. Offenders in this sample felt they had no role in the treatment, other than enforcement. More than half of the offenders felt the officer’s role was adversarial, where the officer was simply “checking up” on attendance, and the motivation for abstaining from substance use was avoiding sanctions. Some offenders felt their officer was always “on their back” or constantly nagging them (“she just be on me”) to successfully complete treatment. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612462219">Allen’s (1985)</xref> finding that offenders perceived their officers as always keeping tabs on them. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612462219">Springer et al. (2009)</xref> found 97% of offenders felt it was their officer’s job to stay on top of their case. What the present findings add are some underlying dimensions of this characterization. It seems the offenders in the present study did not like being monitored while in treatment, but understood it was the officer’s job to do so. Consequently, this is the only role offenders see their officer having in their treatment program. Therefore, the assertion that officers should have an equal responsibility for enforcement of supervision conditions and therapeutic involvement is not supported because the offenders did not view their officer as involved in their rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612462219">Duffee &amp; Carlson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612462219">Hepburn &amp; Harvey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612462219">Prendergast et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings also contextualize the offender–officer relationship in the mandated treatment setting. The sometimes-adversarial relationship with officers makes mandated treatment less rehabilitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612462219">Applegate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612462219">Sitren &amp; Applegate, 2006</xref>). The quality of the relationship with the officer appeared to have also influenced the offender’s viewpoints on respect and fairness. Offenders who felt their officers talked to them respectfully and did not stereotype them as the average offender had more favorable views of the relationship. Conversely, some offenders indicated that stereotyping and a volatile communication style hindered trust, and in one case led to absconding.</p>
<p>Although violations served as an external motivation to attend treatment, many offenders perceived the sanctions available to officers legitimized their authority. Offenders viewed their officers as fair when the officer showed leniency in issuing violations, or offered a compromise in some of the offender’s supervision conditions. It appears that offenders are motivated to avoid violations, but when the officer does not assign one, as if “giving another chance,” this engendered trust. Procedural justice arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612462219">Tyler, 2003</xref>) would support that while offenders agreed with the presence of the sanctions and mandates to complete treatment, they also observed fairness in the discretion used when deciding whether or not to issue a violation.</p>
<p>Although the present research contributes the literature on offender perspectives in the criminal justice system, the findings should be considered with some limitations in mind. First, the study consists of adult males ordered to participate in drug treatment in an urban area as a condition of their probation or parole. Also, the majority of offenders were African American, thereby limiting the generalizability. Future research with more diverse samples and in varied settings is warranted. The cumulative effect of being on supervision and in a mandated treatment setting may suggest a unique set of beliefs and perceptions that are limited to this specific population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022042612462219">Zimring, 1993</xref>). Comparative samples between mandated offenders and those voluntarily entering treatment might present further insight into the offender–officer relationship. Another limitation might be prior and present treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612462219">Raney et al., 2005</xref>). It is unknown how long offenders had been attending treatment or whether they had done other treatment in the community prior to ECI or OC, so it is possible that prior experiences or their time at Horizons might influence their perspectives. Sampling strategies also reduce the generalizability of the study. For example, participants who were absent or had dropped out of the program could not be captured. It is possible that offenders who were not included in this data set have different perspectives about their treatment, supervision, and supervising officer. Furthermore, this examination does not assess the effectiveness or efficacy of the Horizons program, so conclusions about success or failure cannot be made.</p>
<p>In light of these limitations, the present findings can inform future research and policies for substance abusing offenders. First, many offenders in this sample indicated they were externally motivated to participate in treatment through conditions or violations, but offenders with a desire to achieve sobriety are more likely to be successful completing treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022042612462219">Walker, Cole, &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>). Both internal and external motivations may influence perceptions of procedural justice for offenders ordered to complete treatment. To enhance internal motivation, treatment readiness program might be implemented prior to entering the program. Studies of programs preparing offenders for treatment have shown increased chances of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612462219">Longshore &amp; Teruya, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612462219">Sia et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612462219">Sia et al. (2000)</xref> found that offenders who participated in a readiness training program (consisting of four 2-hr classes) rated treatment and treatment providers more positively than those not in readiness training. Many of the offenders in this study did not see why they had to attend treatment themselves, but did see the importance of requiring others to go. This finding suggests individuals may not be aware of the scope of their own substance abuse problems, and treatment readiness classes may enhance their levels of internal motivation, as well as improve the quality of relationships with treatment and corrections personnel.</p>
<p>This study also suggests there is room for growth in terms of how the probation and parole officer is utilized, especially with offenders in substance abuse treatment. Offenders felt that officers were not serving as part of the therapeutic treatment team. Because a positive therapeutic relationship with treatment providers is linked with treatment success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612462219">Prendergast et al., 1995</xref>), it seems logical to then expand the role of the officer in treatment settings. Officers could provide more support by being more engaged in the therapeutic process, providing assessments, counseling, and use supportive supervision methods such as motivational interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612462219">Allen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612462219">McMurran &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612462219">Prendergast et al., 1995</xref>). Motivational interviewing is an approach that emphasizes problem recognition and problem solving on the part of the offender to encourage internal motivation to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612462219">McMurran &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>). Motivational interviewing by POs may enhance the desire of offenders to change and improve retention in treatment, as well as engender trust perceptions of fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612462219">McMurran &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>). This method might be particularly important for the Horizons program, because POs are already involved in program.</p>
<p>The finding regarding violations as an external motivation to attend treatment also supports the use of graduated sanction programs that are endorsed by some researchers and used in drug courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612462219">Marlowe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612462219">Steiner, 2004</xref>). Graduated sanctions, which range from low-level “punishments” such as community service to incarceration, may support the substance abuse treatment program objectives by accommodating relapse and other challenges associated with sobriety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612462219">Steiner, 2004</xref>). Graduated sanctioning for substance abusers allows the PO to collaborate with counselors and caseworkers and develop more meaningful ways to address problems in the offender’s recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612462219">Steiner, 2004</xref>). Parolees in this sample clearly demonstrated a lack of agreement with having to participate in aftercare, indicating some important therapeutic connections may be missing for offenders. Recent findings suggest only half of parolees complete aftercare programming despite its mandatory nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612462219">Olson et al., 2009</xref>). Coordinated efforts between prison staff, the community PO, and resources in the community may increase the likelihood that aftercare is effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612462219">Olson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the officer role from the perspective of the PO will be important in expanding upon the domains in the present study. The perspectives of officers in the mandated treatment setting would add to the greater understanding of the offender–officer relationship in the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612462219">Herie et al., 2000</xref>). Understanding the complexities of treatment motivations, sanctioning, and the ever-expanding role of probation and parole officers in the treatment setting will better enable the criminal justice system to use community treatment interventions effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612462219">Farabee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612462219">Inciardi &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>). Future research on offender perceptions of the probation, parole, and treatment processes will provide benefits to policy makers and help achieve correctional goals. Most research in this area has been conducted on program evaluation and focused on recidivism outcomes, and what may be necessary is additional exploration of what dimensions of these programs and policies are being well received by the target populations.</p>

<p>The definition of mandated treatment has been inconsistently defined and conceptualized in the literature. Phrases such as <italic>coercion, mandated treatment, legally coerced, legal pressure</italic>, and <italic>compulsory treatment</italic> have often been used interchangeably, even though the terms might represent different motivations or reasons for participation in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612462219">De Leon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612462219">Prendergast, Farabee, Cartier, &amp; Henkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612462219">Prendergast, Greenwell, Farabee, &amp; Hser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022042612462219">D.

The term <italic>legal coercion</italic> should not be conceptualized as a binary measure, but rather, one that is continuous and contains numerous dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612462219">Longshore, Prendergast, &amp; Farabee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612462219">Polcin, 2001</xref>). Coercion itself is not a clearly defined process and concept within the literature, so the present study will describe the nature of involvement in the treatment program by using the term <italic>mandated treatment</italic> because it best describes the circumstances by which the offender is participating in the treatment program, and implies nothing about the motivations or nonlegal reasons why one is in treatment. Although this study will not reconcile the definitive differences in this field, the findings could inform a more consistent conceptualization.</p></fn>
