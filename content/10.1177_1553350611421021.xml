<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Technologies currently being developed to facilitate single-incision and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures have led to a number of innovations for general surgical applications. While some surgeons are using and adapting current flexible endoscopes to be used in NOTES, many engineers are also developing completely new systems to overcome some of the limitations of the current technology, for instance, the difficulties of the tip position control, instrument triangulation, and ergonomics. A key challenge in the design process is the requirement to fit the necessary structural, actuation, imaging, and lighting components within the restricted cross-sectional area available. This is particularly relevant in emerging articulated robotic technologies where the limited actuation torque available introduces additional restrictions on the flexibility and mass of components being used. One aspect of this process that has thus far been overlooked is the opportunity of using alternative light sources that can relieve some of the design constraints resulting from the use of fiber bundle light delivery cables, such as high stiffness, large bend radius, and large cross-sectional area. In this article, a number of different light sources are demonstrated and their advantages and disadvantages discussed in the context of single-access and NOTES instruments.</p>
<p>The first generation of NOTES procedures was performed with flexible endoscopes that were designed to be used within the gastrointestinal tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611421021">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611421021"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611421021">3</xref></sup> These included a bundle of optical fibers for guiding the light along the curved paths introduced by the endoscope and were designed to be attached to a xenon light source. This basic principle of endoscopic light delivery has not changed in approximately 50 years and results in a number of limitations that may prove critical for NOTES. For instance, the xenon lamps used consist of an extended source that emits light from a large area and in all directions. Collection optics are then required to couple this light into the fiber cable by reflecting light traveling in nonaxial directions or traveling away from the fiber bundle. The ability to focus this light is limited (focal spots are typically 5-10 mm diameter), and the limited acceptance angle of the fibers (typically 25°) provides a further restriction. The efficiency is even further reduced by the limited “fill factor” of the bundle, since (<italic>a</italic>) the fibers are packed in a hexagonal pattern resulting in gaps between the circular fibers and (<italic>b</italic>) each individual fiber only guides light in its core, not the surrounding cladding.</p>
<p>In the case of gastrointestinal endoscopy, where the typical working distances are only a few centimeters, the bundle size of 15 French provides enough illumination light to record adequate images, either using a miniature camera at the tip or by transmitting the images through a fiber image guide for detection by eye or a camera outside the patient. However, when these endoscopes are used for NOTES, the working distances may be significantly larger and more similar to a laparoscopic approach (10 cm), and the images may appear darker and less clear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611421021">4</xref></sup> In laparoscopy, the light intensity is increased by using a larger diameter bundle. Unfortunately, this approach is difficult in NOTES instruments due to the sharp bend radii required for providing access to the surgical site or due to the limited space available for illumination optics within the instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611421021">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611421021"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611421021">7</xref></sup> It has also been observed that the tip of the endoscope may reach high temperatures after extended use, and the end of the light cable may also heat up significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611421021">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article tests a number of possible approaches that may overcome some of these limitations. White light emitting diode (LED) technology has been demonstrated as a potentially useful source for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by mounting the LED at the tip of the endoscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611421021">9</xref></sup> In these devices, the electrical current is efficiently converted into light through the combination of holes and electrons in a semiconductor, and white light may either be produced by using 3 devices with different bandgaps to produce red, green, and blue light or by coating a blue laser diode with a phosphor that generates broadband green and red light. The output luminance of newly developed devices is rapidly increasing, and the output power may also be improved by increasing the size of the emitter area, although removing the excess heat via conduction still remains a problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611421021">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611421021">10</xref></sup> LEDs have recently been incorporated into commercial small video endoscopes such as the type used for ureteroscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611421021">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another promising technology is the violet laser diode together with a phosphor to convert the light into the visible range. A prototype device was recently demonstrated to have some advantages in MIS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611421021">12</xref></sup> This consisted of a blue-violet laser diode (445 nm, 500 mW), which was coupled into a multimode optical fiber (600 µm core diameter) and connected to a stainless steel probe tip made up of 1000 µm core optical fiber and silicone-encapsulated yellow phosphor. Due to the combination of the phosphorescent yellow light and the blue excitation light, the total output appeared white, and close to daylight in a chromaticity analysis. Furthermore, the scattering effect of the phosphor provided a beam that was much broader (emitting into a cone of large solid angle) in comparison with the conventional laparoscope lamps. It was also found that the laser-pumped source provided sharper shadows in the field of view, which could be used as additional information for the surgeon, for example, in depth perception.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611421021">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611421021">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>A supercontinuum fiber laser has also been previously used in a robotic endoscope system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611421021">5</xref></sup> This demonstrated the potential of a white light fiber-laser illumination source, as it could be efficiently coupled into a multimode 200 µm core optical fiber, making it suitable for a small-footprint articulated robotic device. In addition, with the aid of dispersive and filtration optics, the light source could be switched between white light and fluorescence imaging, thus expanding the diagnostic applications of the device by making use of its broad output spectrum.</p>
<p>In this article, the characteristics of 5 different light sources or delivery methods are investigated for use in single-access surgery procedures. These consist of (<italic>a</italic>) a 300 Watt xenon lamp with a large (5 mm) diameter fiber bundle (light cable for laparoscope), (<italic>b</italic>) a 300 Watt xenon lamp with a 7 Fr (2.3 mm) diameter fiber bundle (light cable for ureteroscope), (<italic>c</italic>) a blue laser and phosphor source, (<italic>d</italic>) an LED ureteroscope tested due to its small size, and (<italic>e</italic>) a supercontinuum fiber laser source. For each source, the output luminance, spectrum, beam profile, and the visual impression at various working distances are evaluated in addition to the compatibility of each system with a custom-built robotic endoscope (<italic>(i-Snake™</italic>).</p>

<title>Light Sources</title>
<p>Three of the light sources tested were “off-the-shelf” products, including the xenon large light cable, 7 Fr ureter light probe (both Karl Storz, GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) and the LED source (Invisio DUR-D ureteroscope, Gyrus ACMI, Southborough, MA). The xenon source was an arc lamp (Xenon 300) that produces white light by ionizing xenon gas in an evacuated chamber with a high-voltage electrical supply. The LEDs used in the ureteroscope were phosphor-based devices that produce blue light, which is downconverted to green and red through phosphorescence. The fourth source was a blue laser/phosphor prototype device (Microwhite, Nichia Corporation, Tokushima, Japan) and was designed and constructed on the principles outlined elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611421021">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final light source was a custom-built fiber probe (400 µm core) that was designed for use with a supercontinuum laser (SC400, Fianium Ltd, Southampton, UK). Its output spectrum extended well into the infrared (1.7 µm), but it was fitted with a reflection-based filter that cut off light above 800 nm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fianium.com">http://www.fianium.com</ext-link>). To remove the effects of speckle and produce a broad output beam from the collimated laser input, a diffusing element was built for the distal end of the probe. Aluminum oxide particles were used as scatterers, which were suspended in a high-viscosity, transparent, UV-curing epoxy (Norland 63, Thorlabs Ltd, Cambridgeshire, UK). Homogeneity of the final mixture was ensured by placing it in an ultrasound bath. The optical fiber was housed within a protective outer jacket (1 mm inner diameter, 2 mm outer diameter), which extended approximately 20 mm beyond the end of the fiber at one end. The resulting lumen was then filled with the diffusing mixture, and the epoxy was cured by exposing it to UV light. The excess diffuser material was removed from the tip using a hot knife so that the end face of the fiber was approximately 2 mm from the end of the diffuser. Coupling of the laser light into the fiber was achieved using a high numerical aperture (<italic>NA</italic>) aspheric lens.</p>
<p>The xenon lamp with large light cable (coupled into a laparoscope where appropriate) was tested as the gold standard, and the 4 other sources were selected for their small cross-sectional area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350611421021">
<title>Quantitative Evaluation</title>
<p>The output power was recorded using a broadband thermopile power meter (Fieldmax II with PM10 sensor, Coherent, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) placed in front of the light source at a fixed distance of 10 mm. This type of sensor uses the principle that heat absorbed by certain materials will generate a temporary potential difference. This makes the sensor relatively wavelength-independent, with a flat response over a large range (190-11 000 nm, ie, the whole of the visible as well as near UV and near to mid infrared; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coherent.com">http://www.coherent.com</ext-link>). Therefore, with the broadband sources tested in this article, the reading from the sensor will represent an accurate integration of power without the need for spectral correction.</p>
<p>The spectrum of each light source was measured using a spectrometer (HR4000, Ocean Optics, Inc, Dunedin, FL), with the detector’s wavelength-dependent sensitivity corrected for using a calibrated light source (LS-1Cal, Ocean Optics, Inc). These data were then used to express the brightness of each source in terms of radiance (measured radiometric units), which is observer independent and based on absolute measurements of power and illuminated area. To make a true quantitative comparison of the brightness of each source, however, the absolute measurement of radiance must be adjusted to account for the sensitivity of the human eye. To illustrate this point, consider two 5 mW laser pointers, one red and one green, incident on a white screen. Even though the light power is the same for both, the green one will appear much brighter due to the higher sensitivity of the human eye in the green region (500-600 nm) of the spectrum. The radiance power measurements were therefore adjusted to record the luminance (measured in photometric units). The color or degree of “whiteness” was also calculated by computing the chromaticity coordinates (<italic>x, y</italic>), based on the strength of the emitted radiation in comparison with the sensitivity of the “standard observer” in the CIE 1931 color space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611421021">15</xref></sup> Spectral radiance at a particular wavelength (<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><sub>λ</sub>) was calculated according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1553350611421021">Equation (1)</xref>:</p>

<p>The units of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>V</italic></sub> are expressed as candelas per unit area (cd mm<sup>−2</sup>).</p>
<p>Depending on the application, a light source for a surgical endoscope may be required to illuminate a narrow lumen (such as the ureter) or a large area inside the abdomen (several cm<sup>2</sup>), and it is desirable that the illumination is as even as possible in most applications. Images of the light distribution of each source on a plain piece of paper perpendicular to the propagation direction were recorded with a color CCD camera (DCU223C, Thorlabs, Inc) for working distances of 10 to 100 mm in steps of 10 mm. The intensity profiles were calculated by measuring the overall pixel intensity (across the red, green, and blue color planes) along a cross section of the illuminated screen through the point of maximum brightness in the center. Each profile was fitted using a double Gaussian curve, from which the full-width at half-maximum (<italic>FWHM</italic>) was calculated. This provided a measure of how “broad” each type of illumination was in comparison with the others and how likely each was to generate points of sharp brightness changes or saturation in the field of view. For comparison, the large light cable was coupled to a 12 mm diameter rigid endoscope (Trinocular Endoscope, Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA), which, like all rigid endoscopes, contains a fiber optic bundle packed within the shaft to carry light to the distal tip.</p>

<title>Qualitative Evaluation</title>
<p>A series of images of an abdominal endoscopy simulator were acquired with each light source to provide an initial impression of their performance in a clinically realistic scenario. The images were acquired using a miniature 1.8 mm diameter camera (IntroSpicio 115, Medigus Ltd, Omer, Israel) that forms part of a prototype 12.5 mm diameter articulated surgical robot (<italic>i-Snake</italic>) that has been designed for NOTES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611421021">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611421021">17</xref></sup> The simulator consisted of visually realistic organs molded from a combination of silicone and latex, placed within a modified laparoscopic training simulator according to anatomical position. The various structures were colored using standard acrylic-based paints mixed into the liquid latex before molding to present a realistic intraperitoneal cavity that has been validated in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611421021">18</xref></sup> Each light source was incorporated one at a time into one of the robot’s two 3 mm biopsy channels for testing. In the cases where the light source was too large for incorporation within the robot, the source was attached to the outer casing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611421021">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The simulator was then shifted away from the robot tip in steps of 25 mm so that images were acquired at working distances of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611421021">Figure 2</xref>). A group of 14 surgeons (aged 31-42 years) were given a digital copy of the images described above and asked to assess them. The group included 2 surgical consultants with extensive experience in laparoscopy and flexible endoscopy as well as 3 surgical trainees experienced in the NOTES technique within the porcine model. The remainder of the group was composed of general surgical registrars of variable experience. Each clinician was given a short questionnaire with the images and asked to determine the following: (<italic>a</italic>) The brightest source at long working distances. (<italic>b</italic>) The maximum working distance for each source at which features could be detected on the tissue surface. (<italic>c</italic>) The rank order of the sources for overall brightness. (<italic>d</italic>) Which sources were potentially suitable for large cavity illumination based on a comparison with the laparoscopic source.

However, once the large light cable was plugged into a rigid endoscope, the overall brightness fell by almost a half due to coupling losses at the input. The supercontinuum was the second strongest source when averaged across the visible range. The Nichia Microwhite showed a large peak at the laser emission wavelength of 445 nm, but in the phosphorescent region (500-600 nm) the signal was much lower. Since the Gyrus Dur-D uses white LEDs (phosphor-based) as the light source, its emission spectrum also showed a peak in the blue (460 nm) and a 100 nm <italic>FWHM</italic> peak centered on 550 nm. However, its brightness was significantly smaller in this range when compared with the Nichia.</p>

Thirteen out of 14 surgeons ranked the Karl Storz large light cable as the brightest overall, with the same 13 surgeons ranking the Fianium Supercontinuum second. However, on average over the full range of working distances, all the surgeons felt as confident identifying the tissue features with the supercontinuum as with the large light cable. Finally, all the surgeons questioned agreed that based on a comparison with a “gold standard” illuminator for large cavities (Karl Storz large light cable), the supercontinuum probe was potentially of use for illuminating similar image fields. The other sources were deemed unsuitable for this purpose. The xenon ureter light probe was consistently ranked third, while the Nichia Microwhite and Gyrus Dur-D sources rated as weakest with surgeons only confident of identifying features at distances of 50 mm and 25 mm from the simulated tissue, respectively. The absolute values of these working distances are dependent on the optical properties of the tissue however, as discussed below.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current standard light source for laparoscopic procedures is the xenon lamp, which transports light via a large diameter light cable. This provides the bright “flood illumination” necessary for the surgeon to operate on a relatively large area where a wide field of view is necessary for navigation and monitoring the health of tissue in the periphery of the main target area. When used with the large light cable, the xenon source was the brightest source tested due to its large cross-sectional area and corresponding light-carrying capacity. The relatively narrow <italic>FWHM</italic> of its intensity profile is governed by the numerical aperture (<italic>NA</italic>) of the constituent fibers in the bundle, which defines the conical space that light spreads into on exit from the fibers. In the rigid endoscope the intensity profile was much broader as the fibers have a larger <italic>NA</italic> and illuminate a larger area. However, as highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350611421021">Table 2</xref>, to transport the required intensity of light, a large, heavy optical fiber bundle must be used, which immediately limits its usefulness beyond the relatively large working space of the multiport access laparoscopic regime. In addition, the flexibility of a large fiber bundle is limited and may be unsuitable for NOTES.</p>
<p>The smaller Karl Storz ureter probe offers a solution to some of the problems associated with xenon illumination. It is small enough to be considered for use in the restricted space of the single-access setup and is significantly lighter and more flexible. However, as with all incoherent white light sources, the efficiency with which it can be coupled into the optical fibers is low and as a result of the smaller cross-sectional area of its end face, the amount of light transmitted is reduced. This is immediately evident from the quantitative measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611421021">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611421021">B</xref>. It is also worth noting that although the flexibility of the ureter light probe is greater than that of the larger version, it still offers relatively high mechanical impedance when placed within the articulated robotic device. This subsequently limits the achievable robot motion when using its embedded micromotors. While it is possible to produce more flexible “unfused” fiber bundles where the fibers are loose, this requires a larger diameter cable.</p>
<p>The LEDs employed by the Gyrus Dur-D ureteroscope consume a tiny fraction of the power that the xenon lamp uses and are easier to couple into optical fibers (although still with much lower efficiency than a coherent source). This type of light source may be packaged into a small footprint instrument and retain the capability for sharp bend radii (a requirement of urology). The intensity profile is broader than that of the Karl Storz light cables, possibly due to the use of large <italic>NA</italic> fibers. However, the output luminance (0.4 cd mm<sup>−2</sup>) is insignificant in comparison with the xenon-based or supercontinuum sources. Tip mounting of LEDs has previously been investigated but provided insufficient optical power for surgery and led to heating of the tip of the endoscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611421021">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Nichia Microwhite laser/phosphor source represents an improvement on the LED-based source as it uses a blue laser that operates at low power and can easily be efficiently coupled into a multimode fiber. Since only a single optical fiber is required, its flexibility far outstrips both xenon and LED sources, which all use multiple fibers. The scattering of light by the phosphorescent particles in the tip results in a broad profile beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611421021">Figure 5</xref>) that provides even illumination across the field of view. However, the major drawback of the design is that the generation of yellow light at the tip is inefficient and a large amount of energy is lost as heat. As with the xenon ureter light cable, this limits the usefulness of the device to short working ranges associated with narrow lumen work and urology as it lacks the necessary brightness for work at larger distances (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350611421021">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The supercontinuum fiber probe has the advantage of being a laser source, which can be efficiently coupled into a single multimode fiber, making it as light and flexible as the Nichia Microwhite. Since the laser emits white light and the tip is purely scattering, there is no loss of energy or significant heating of the probe. The isotropic scattering of the aluminum oxide particles in the diffusing tip effectively provides a source of spherical waves. In fact, the light was scattered over such a large area that attempts to fit the Gaussian curve at working distances above 80 mm resulted in fitting errors and corresponding noise in the calculation of <italic>FWHM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611421021">Figure 5B</xref>). It produced a beam that has the broadest profile of all the sources tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350611421021">Figure 5B</xref>) and luminance (22.6 cd mm<sup>−2</sup>) that is comparable to the xenon large light cable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611421021">Figure 2</xref>), making it potentially a general purpose source for single access surgery.</p>
<p>The subjective evaluation by clinicians of images from the abdominal simulator was in agreement with the objective measurements, with the Karl Storz large light cable and Fianium Supercontinuum sources ranked most suitable for single-access surgery. The reflectance of the painted silicone/latex surface of the simulator was measured using a reflectance standard (Spectralon, Labsphere, Inc, North Sutton, NH) and had an average value of 0.81 in the red region of the spectrum. Reflectance of real tissue measured in vivo can be between just 0.1 and 0.5 in the same spectral region, based on previous measurements of the colon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611421021">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611421021">20</xref></sup> but will vary depending on tissue type and the quantity of blood in the field of view. It should therefore be noted that the working distances quoted in the simulator tests are intended only to allow a qualitative comparison of the light sources, and the limits when viewing real tissue may be much shorter. Further in vivo testing is needed to fully characterize the performance of the prototype light source and its working distance limits.</p>
<p>Following from the discussion above, it becomes clear that for single-access surgery, the most suitable sources are the Karl Storz large light cable and the supercontinuum fiber probe when considering brightness and overall quality of illumination. The supercontinuum also represents an attractive alternative with regard to cost. Despite its relatively high purchase price (~$60 000), it has a long lifetime and low running cost when compared with the xenon source, which involves an initial outlay in the region of $8000 and regular replacement of bulbs (approximately $1500 each). The supercontinuum is relatively new technology, and the price is likely to reduce considerably over the coming years as the systems mature or are produced in larger quantities. These lasers will be highly reliable due to the use of laser diodes and integrated optical fibers.</p>
<p>Although the Fianium Supercontinuum is a pulsed laser source, it can be made to be safe enough for use in surgery. First, multiple scattering in the probe tip reduces the spatial coherence of the beam, eliminating the possibility of a potentially damaging focused spot of high power on the tissue. Second, the power levels used are below those required for nonlinear effects such as thermal lensing, photodissociation, and third harmonic generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611421021">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350611421021"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350611421021">23</xref></sup> Future versions of this probe will see further improvements in its usability, including an extra filtering step at the laser output to remove the higher energy infrared (700-800 nm) radiation from the beam.</p>
<p>As a final evaluation we have acquired images in vivo of the abdominal cavity of a pig during a robotic-assisted NOTES procedure (conducted under UK home office approved license PPL 80/2297) using the Karl Storz xenon and Fianium Supercontinuum light sources. In this procedure, the xenon light was coupled into a laparoscope (used to monitor robot performance), which was positioned approximately 5 to 7 cm from the tissue surface, while the supercontinuum probe was positioned in the instrument channel of the flexible robot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611421021">16</xref></sup> The images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1553350611421021">Figure 6</xref> and show that the supercontinuum is comparable in terms of color. The tissue in the background (in front of the robot tip) is illuminated to a similar brightness and the robot’s movement was uninhibited due to the flexibility of the fiber.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The traditional xenon lamp remains the gold standard for large area illumination in laparoscopic procedures and was the brightest source tested when used with the large light cable alone. However, the bulky and inflexible nature of the light cable means that it is less well suited for incorporation into flexible devices designed for single-access surgery, including NOTES. It has been shown that a customized fiber probe carrying white light from a supercontinuum laser is a potential alternative for this type of surgery. The illumination is comparable with the xenon source, yet the fiber probe is neat and flexible enough to be incorporated into a NOTES device. Furthermore, it offers the potential to be used as part of a multimodal system for dual white light and spectroscopic imaging by incorporating wavelength-selection optics (commonly used with broadband lasers) to the proximal end. The supercontinuum also offers the potential to be an extremely versatile device as it is capable of illuminating from very short working distances (due to its broad beam profile) to the long range requirements of NOTES and abdominal procedures. The other sources tested have shown advantages in cost and power consumption but are all limited to shorter working distances.</p>
<p>Future work will concentrate on maximizing the light output of the supercontinuum probe by adjusting the scatterer content of the diffuser and shaping the beam profile so that the illuminated area is matched to the field of view of the camera. In addition, in vivo task-based trials of the probe will be used to characterize its performance.</p>
