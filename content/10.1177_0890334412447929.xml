<p>In this issue, RoundTable reaches out to international Baby-Friendly leadership to report on where various nations stand in 2012 with regard to the Baby-Friendly Initiative.</p>
<sec id="section1-0890334412447929">
<title>How many Baby-Friendly hospitals do you have in your nation, and what proportion of all maternity hospitals is this?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Grguric:</speaker>
<p>In 2009, 44,577 infants were born in Croatia. Overall, 21/31, or 68% of maternity wards in Croatia are Baby-Friendly.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wen:</speaker>
<p>There are no certified Baby-Friendly hospitals, but the Health Promotion Board has successfully engaged 5 maternity hospitals, accounting for 80% of the births in Singapore, to pledge toward achieving BFHI certification. We anticipate that the first 2 will be accredited in 2012.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kylberg:</speaker>
<p>This is quite a complicated question for Sweden! The BFHI was launched in Sweden in 1992, and between 1993 and 1996, all hospitals were assessed and certified as Baby-Friendly. Between 1999-2004, 33/52 hospitals were re-evaluated and certified as Baby-Friendly. Breastfeeding-friendly care is the norm in Sweden, and although some hospitals did not recertify, they did not officially lose certification, either, so it is generally stated that 100% of hospitals are Baby-Friendly. Breastfeeding initiation is 98%–99%. Since 2004, the BFHI has not been officially on the agenda of the Swedish National Institute of Public Health.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ashmore:</speaker>
<p>In the United Kingdom, accreditation is staged, with each stage externally assessed. Hospitals work from Certificate of Commitment (action planning) to Stage 1 (policies, guidelines, implementation methods), to Stage 2 (staff education), and then to Stage 3 (care of pregnant women, mothers, and babies). Overall, 78% of the United Kingdom’s 307 maternity hospitals have achieved at least 1 award: 70 (23%) have full accreditation, 59 (19%) have achieved Stage 2, 75 (24%) Stage 1 and 36 (12%) have a Certificate of Commitment.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MacEnroe:</speaker>
<p>The US and its Territories have approximately 3250 facilities with registered maternity beds; of these, roughly 4% are designated as Baby-Friendly. This is a small percentage, but right now there is growing interest in the BFHI, and 350 facilities are officially working toward designation. New funding opportunities recently made available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will likely bring more than 100 additional facilities into the process.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412447929">
<title>Has the Baby-Friendly initiative expanded beyond the maternity hospital setting in your nation, and if so, what other Baby-Friendly initiatives do you have ongoing?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Ashmore:</speaker>
<p>We have a Community and a University Baby-Friendly Initiative. Twenty two <italic>(8%)</italic> of the United Kingdom’s 275 community trusts have full accreditation, 37 (13%) have achieved Stage 2, 74 (27%) Stage 1, and 53 (19%) a Certificate of Commitment. Sixty-seven percent of community trusts have achieved at least 1 award. We have started accrediting midwifery and health visiting degrees in universities as follows: Certificate of Commitment (action planning), Stage 1 (curriculum and supporting material), Stage 2 (students’ knowledge and skills). Thus far, among universities that offer a midwifery qualification, 10/55 (18%) universities have full accreditation, 3 (5%) have achieved Stage 1, and 20 (36%) a Certificate of Commitment. Fifty-nine percent of universities that offer a midwifery qualification have achieved at least 1 award. Two programs offering health visiting degrees have full awards.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Grguric:</speaker>
<p>Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiave activities and support are being expanded to the postnatal primary health care pediatric offices, inpatient pediatric hospital departments, and the local community. The “Breastfeeding- Friendly primary health care pediatric office” program is a Croatian model of breastfeeding-friendly pediatric offices within the primary health care system. Instruments for self-assessment and external assessment of primary health care offices as breastfeeding-friendly centers for children have been developed; a national assessment team has been trained and is conducting assessments. In 2011, 8 pediatric offices were certified. We have also implemented a “Child-friendly hospital pediatric department” in inpatient pediatric hospital departments. The goal of this action is the promotion and applied humanization of hospital treatment of children. One of the required criteria for certification is for the hospital to implement BFHI standards. Twenty-six of Croatia’s 36 children’s inpatient hospital departments have this certification. Finally, we implemented a “Child-Friendly cities” program over the past decade, and 1 of the required criteria for a city to receive this award is to have a Baby-Friendly maternity ward/hospital. There were 34 “Child-Friendly cities” in Croatia by December 2011.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MacEnroe:</speaker>
<p>At the present time, Baby-Friendly USA is strategically maintaining its focus on birthing facilities.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kylberg:</speaker>
<p>When the BFHI was still actively on the national agenda, it was expanded to cover entire communities. Between 1999-2004, 8/21 regions in Sweden were assessed and certified as practicing Baby-Friendly continuity of care—providing breastfeeding-friendly care from the prenatal period through delivery, postpartum, and pediatric care.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wen:</speaker>
<p>Currently, the Baby-Friendly initiative is being implemented only in hospitals, but there are plans to engage the community in helping to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding for healthy mothers and babies.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412447929">
<title>How is Baby-Friendly administrated in your nation?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>MacEnroe:</speaker>
<p>The BFHI is administered by Baby-Friendly USA, Inc. (BFUSA) a not-for-profit organization governed by a board of directors that was incorporated in 1997 specifically for the purpose of implementing the initiative in the United States. Baby-Friendly assessments of birthing facilities are conducted by credentialed maternity care experts who have a contractual relationship with BFUSA. The assessors conduct a prescribed set of activities while on-site at birthing facilities and consolidate their findings into a report. The report is then blinded and sent to an external review board—a volunteer board of credentialed maternal child health experts—which makes the recommendation as to whether or not the Baby-Friendly designation should be conferred.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ashmore:</speaker>
<p>We are administered by UNICEF UK working on a cost recovery basis, which means that the Initiative must raise all the funds it spends and so be cost neutral to UNICEF UK. We achieve this goal by charging for our assessments, training courses, and materials.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wen:</speaker>
<p>The BFHI is jointly administered by the government (Health Promotion Board [HPB]) and a professional voluntary welfare organization (Association for Breastfeeding Advocacy Singapore [ABAS]). Over the past 2 years, HPB worked with ABAS to ensure that the BFHI criteria are consistent with the local culture so that they can be easily integrated into a maternity ward’s workflow and still remain meaningful. We have also built capacity of hospital staff by providing education, training, and international expert consultations and have been working with both hospitals and voluntary welfare organizations to provide support to mothers after discharge. The HPB and ABAS have developed a local pool of WHO-trained assessors who will conduct the BFHI assessment once hospitals are ready.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kylberg:</speaker>
<p>The BFHI was launched in 1992 by the National Board of Health and Welfare. From 1997-2003 the Swedish National Institute of Public Health took over the responsibility, however, they gave it up in 2004 and decided that from then each region would take on responsibility for BFHI. However, this has not really been the case. Since 2009 we have a National Breastfeeding Committee, attached to the National Board of Food Administration, which meets annually. This committee has proposed to the National Board of Food Administration, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Swedish National Institute of Public Health to reactivate the BFHI. The volunteer national breastfeeding network (AMNIS/AMningsNätverket I Sverige), has also called on the health minister with similar demands, but so far nothing has happened.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Grguric:</speaker>
<p>Since 2006 the program has been coordinated by UNICEF Office for Croatia and the Croatia Ministry of health. Nongovernmental organizations are also included as members of the BFHI national assessment team.</p>

<title>What were the greatest achievement(s) for the Baby-Friendly Initiative in your nation since the Initiative launched?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Kylberg:</speaker>
<p>We think it was a great achievement that all Swedish hospitals were certified as Baby-Friendly at the very start of the initiative.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wen:</speaker>
<p>In the past, formula companies donated free infant formula to hospitals. In line with the WHO code, changes have been made to the Sale of Infant Foods Ethics Committee Singapore (SIFECS) Code of Ethics. Effective January 1 2012, all hospitals in Singapore have to purchase infant formula.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ashmore:</speaker>
<p>Prior to the launch of the Baby-Friendly Initiative, very few health professionals in the United Kingdom received any meaningful training in breastfeeding and there was little acknowledgment that such training was even necessary. UNICEF UK has trained over 35,000 health professionals to Baby-Friendly standards and provided train-the-trainer education and materials to 800 breastfeeding trainers, who in turn have trained many thousands of staff. We have also provided training and support to lecturers so that they can better prepare the next generation of health professionals. This mass “bottom-up” approach helped create a much greater understanding of breastfeeding in the health service, which in turn has influenced policy and practice, and so real improvements in care for breastfeeding mothers are now being made. The UK breastfeeding initiation rate has risen from 62% to 81% over this time. Our other achievement is the influence of government policy, which, after many years of lobbying by UNICEF UK and others in the voluntary sector, is now much more likely to include meaningful support for breastfeeding in its policies.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Grguric:</speaker>
<p>Our greatest achievements are: (1) our progress with rooming-in, given that 20 years ago, all maternity wards in Croatia separated mothers and infants after birth; (2) at discharge, 95% of mothers are breastfeeding; and (3) the latest data on exclusive breastfeeding published by the Croatian Public Health Institute show an increase of 15% in exclusive breastfeeding at 0-2 months (from 51.3% in 2007 to 66.3% in 2010) and a 13.5% increase in exclusive breastfeeding after 3 months (from 32.4% in 2007 to 45.9% in 2010 ), which we credit to the impact of the BFHI.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MacEnroe:</speaker>
<p>By far, the greatest achievement of the BFHI in the United States is the recent growth in the number of participating hospitals. The executive level of the US government has called on birthing facilities to implement the BFHI. The CDC targeted funding to improve maternity care practices, and state and local level governments and not-for-profit organizations answered the call by securing funding, offering technical assistance, and bringing hospitals together in forums geared to assist them with designing strategies for implementing the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. BFUSA has responded by developing strategies to offer information to broader audiences in a more efficient manner. In 2010, BFUSA rolled out the 4-D Pathway to Baby-Friendly Designation and now has over 300 participating facilities. The 4 phases are Discovery, Development, Dissemination, and Designation. Each phase provides the facility with a series of guidance and planning tools. Feedback from facilities about the 4-D Pathway has been extremely positive.</p>

<title>What have been the biggest challenges to establishment of the Baby-Friendly Initiative in your nation?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Grguric</speaker>
<p>The biggest challenge is a strong baby formula industry.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ashmore:</speaker>
<p>The UK has had 1 of the most entrenched bottle feeding cultures in the world, with several generations of the population predominantly bottle fed. There is a common attitude in the United Kingdom that breastfeeding is merely a lifestyle choice and that it would be wrong to “make women feel guilty” by encouraging breastfeeding. Moving policy makers and managers, who are part of this culture, toward a place where they are willing to commit the necessary resources to the implementation of the Baby-Friendly Initiative has been, and continues to be, our biggest challenge.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kylberg:</speaker>
<p>There were very few initial challenges. However, when the initiative was active, there was a lot of training happening all over Sweden and people were encouraged and motivated to ensure a “baby-friendly” environment. Without a national authority behind you, it is not easy to maintain the work. It is possible that some hospitals give formula during the first 24 hours without medical reasons. Currently, training for health staff to keep up their breastfeeding knowledge is minimal. The BFHI is “perishable,” wherever you are in the world—and there is no guarantee for how it looks like 1, 2, or 3 years after certification. That said, we do have initiation of 98%–99%.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MacEnroe:</speaker>
<p>BFUSA sees challenge and opportunity as one and the same. With every difficulty that has been encountered, a new possibility for overcoming it has emerged. An early challenge was obtaining recognition of the importance of the initiative in the United States. This challenge is being overcome through the publication of evidence pointing to the effectiveness of the initiative and through collaboration with key partners. As more recognized and respected figures call upon facilities to implement the initiative, hospital participation increases. Another key challenge is to ensure that all players have access to accurate and consistent information about the initiative. Technology has offered a significant opportunity to address this challenge through publication of key documents on our Web site and through participation in webinars. Finally, resources are always a big challenge for all of the players. Hospitals have multiple priorities tugging at their limited staff and dollars. To assist with this challenge, both public and private funders have been offering grants to help hospitals defray costs for such things as staff training, patient education materials, and designation fees.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wen:</speaker>
<p>The biggest challenge has revolved around making changes to operating procedures in hospitals (eg, skin-to-skin for the first hour and rooming-in) and educating staff and patients on the need for such changes. However, with strong support from the senior management of various hospitals, skin-to-skin contact and rooming-in are now being offered at most of the 5 hospitals that have pledged to become Baby-Friendly.</p>
</speech>

<sec id="section6-0890334412447929">
<title>What is next for the Baby-Friendly Initiative in your nation?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Ashmore:</speaker>
<p>Baby-Friendly standards are the minimum acceptable level of care a mother should expect from health care services. In the United Kingdom, 78% of hospitals and 67% of community trusts have achieved these standards or are making significant progress toward them. Our next step is to start building on their achievements by supporting the development of standards that go beyond basic Baby-Friendly. We aim to address the United Kingdom’s poor breastfeeding continuation rates, provide better support to mothers who do not breastfeed in order to achieve the best outcomes possible for their babies, and to encourage health service innovation in infant feeding. In terms of reaccreditation, UK facilities undergo a full external reassessment of all the standards 2 years after the initial accreditation and at increasing intervals thereafter. It is not unknown for facilities to lose accreditation if standards are not maintained. Similarly, each stage has a time limit by which the next stage must be achieved, and failure to do so results in the loss of the current award.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Grguric:</speaker>
<p>Our next goal is expanding the program toward a “Mother-friendly hospital initiative.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MacEnroe:</speaker>
<p>We are focusing our attention on using technology to more effectively and efficiently designate facilities. We will increase Web site functionality, allowing hospitals and other interested parties to download tools and forms via portals; increase telecommunications and desk-top connectivity for training and user groups; and develop a new business solution to track breastfeeding outcomes and measures.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wen:</speaker>
<p>To have all maternity hospitals certified under the BFHI. We will also extend Baby-Friendly initiatives into workplaces and other public areas (eg, shopping malls) by working with them to have policies and facilities that support breastfeeding mothers (eg, pink rooms). Lastly, we will work with local community groups to increase the support available to mothers (eg, through support groups, workshops, and personal consultations).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kylberg:</speaker>
<p>We would like to revitalize the BFHI in Sweden. Also, we are actively participating in the working group from the Nordic countries and Quebec to complete the nationalexpansion of the BFHI to neonatal units.</p>
