This paper analyzes how the spread of headscarves and Islamic dress since the 1970s undermined it as a signal of piety, which is a valuable yet hidden characteristic in many social interactions.

<body>
<p>In recent decades, the diversity of women’s Islamic dress in many parts of the Middle East has increased. After the widespread resurgence in the popularity of the headscarf in the 1970s and 1980s, some women but not others escalated (for lack of a better term) from the basic ‘Islamic dress’ (<italic>al-ziyy al-Islami</italic>) and adopted increasingly conservative and austere clothing styles, such as full-length dresses in earth tones, gloves, tight-fitting headscarves and, in some cases, face-covering veils.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043463112440683">1</xref></sup> Some women began to justify all behaviors in religious terms and demanded public spaces to practice and study their religion. Diverse styles of Islamic dress and lifestyle now coexist in many places: Muslim women wearing tunics and colorful headscarves that leave their faces uncovered live near women wearing muted ankle-length dresses and face-covering veils. What explains this diversity and escalation in the conservativeness of Islamic dress and behavior?</p>
<p>This paper uses signaling theory to argue that pious Muslim women have adopted these increasingly conservative clothing styles and behaviors to differentiate themselves from less pious women who began to dress conservatively for a wide variety of reasons. Individuals consider and value others’ piety in many social interactions, such as the marriage market. Piety, however, is a hidden personal characteristic. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, nationalist reformers associated the headscarf with backwardness and some state bureaucracies deterred women from covering. Since only truly pious women and families were willing to bear the social stigma or forgo state benefits, wearing a headscarf reliably transmitted private information about a woman’s piety. Islamic clothing styles during this period were neither strict nor overly conservative. They did not need to be: a headscarf was sufficient to distinguish a pious woman from a less pious one. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, millions of less pious women adopted the headscarf for a myriad of economic, political, and social reasons. For some, the headscarf was a sign of protest. For others, it offered protection from harassment. Islamists encouraged women to cover and provided selective incentives to those who did. Soon, people could no longer distinguish a pious woman from a less pious woman simply on whether or not she wore a headscarf, which meant pious women had to find other ways to credibly convey their piety. Fundamentalist uniforms evolved. Pious women tightened their headscarves and wore only black, white, or muted earth tones. Some covered their faces with a veil. Pious women increasingly used Islamic traditions to justify all behaviors and engaged in time-intensive expressions of their religious devotion. Pietistic social movements emerged as women demanded public spaces to study and practice religion. Compared to earlier decades, pious Muslim women must now act in more ‘fundamentalist’ ways to reliably demonstrate their piety. Although perhaps most prevalent in the Arab world, a similar pattern can be found in many Muslim societies.</p>
<p>Numerous scholars have examined ‘re-veiling’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043463112440683">2</xref></sup> and found that Muslim women adopted headscarves and basic Islamic dress in recent decades for a wide variety of economic, political, and social reasons. This literature, however, focuses on the spread of the headscarf and simple Islamic dress in the 1970s and 1980s and either ignores the subsequent escalation in the conservativeness and strictness of Islamic dress and behaviors or lumps it in with discussions of the headscarf, often under the misleading label of ‘veil.’ As millions of previously uncovered Muslim women adopted headscarves, why did already covered women in the same communities resort to more conservative clothes and veils, adopt additional social restrictions, increasingly espouse fundamentalist discourses, and begin to demand public spaces for women in mosques?</p>
<p>Observers often attribute the spread of face veils and the most conservative behaviors to the spread of Salafism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043463112440683">3</xref></sup> In contrast, this paper accounts for changes in and the increased diversity of what is considered proper Islamic dress by analyzing the ability of Muslim women to transmit information about themselves to others through the wearing of such clothes. I argue that pious Muslim women adopted more conservative clothes and behaviors to differentiate themselves after less pious Muslim women begin to dress like them. The spread of fundamentalism or Salafi behaviors and attitudes, therefore, does not necessarily imply a shift in piety, ideological changes in society, or rising support for political Islam. Women’s clothing and fundamentalist behaviors could be inaccurate proxies for support for Islamist political movements.</p>
<p>This paper proceeds as follows. The first section explains why piety is a valued attribute in social interactions, such as the marriage market, where pious women benefit if they can credibly reveal this hidden characteristic. The process is characterized as a signaling game, with both separating and pooling equilibria occurring under particular conditions. The second section describes how the resurgent popularity of the Islamic headscarf and clothing in the 1970s and 1980s undermined these clothes as a credible signal of piety. Changes in incentives to wear headscarves for less pious women resulted in both pious and less pious women wearing headscarves. The following section accounts for the subsequent escalation of Islamic dress, explaining how pious women now adopt higher-cost signals to convey private information about their type to uninformed observers. Clothes again distinguish pious women from less pious women, but pious women now wear more conservative clothes than previously necessary. Observable implications of the theory are discussed. The final section concludes with additional implications of the argument, such as how attempts to legislate or impose Islamic norms may devalue them by undermining individuals’ incentives to adopt those norms in the first place.</p>

<title>The marriage market as an example of why piety matters</title>
<p>Finding a suitable spouse is an important social transaction in Muslim societies where marriage is expected and considered a religious obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463112440683">Hoodfar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112440683">Singerman, 1995</xref>). Establishing a household often marks entry into adulthood. In Egypt, for example, families are intimately involved in finding and selecting marriage partners because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463112440683">Hoodfar (1997</xref>: 56) states, ‘marriage is viewed not as a partnership between individuals but rather as an alliance between two families’. Finally, marriage can be extremely expensive, and the groom’s family traditionally bears the costs. Using data from household expenditure surveys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043463112440683">Singerman and Ibrahim (2001</xref>: 92) estimate the average cost of marriage in Egypt in the late 1990s was US$5,957 (LE20,194), which was four and a half times larger than GNP per capita (US$1,290).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043463112440683">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some, but certainly not all, Muslim men and families prefer pious women over less pious women as marriage partners. They expect pious women to have good moral character and exhibit propriety before and after marriage, which safeguards a family’s reputation. Families might be even more eager to identify a woman’s piety if they believe that pre-marital sexual activity is increasing. Families also might expect pious women to be more likely to raise virtuous children. Generally, Muslims might consider pious Muslims trustworthy and honest, important characteristics in a partner for most social interactions. Many Muslims also assume marriages to pious women are less likely to end in divorce than marriages to less pious women, a growing concern as both divorce rates and marriage costs rise. Pious Muslim women might be more likely than less pious women to accept significant restraints on a woman’s right to divorce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1043463112440683">5</xref></sup> Pious women might be less likely to seek ‘no-fault’ divorces, considered a loophole around Islamic law, and families might believe that pious wives make husbands less likely to seek divorce.</p>
<p>Significant ethnographic data support the assertion that families highly value female piety on the marriage market. Men and families often say a potential wife should be ‘a clever homemaker and a good mother’, of high moral character, and from a good family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463112440683">Hoodfar, 1997</xref>: 57; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112440683">Singerman, 1995</xref>: 77). Ethnographies emphasize the ideals of feminine modesty and honor. Some families, of course, also inherently value piety itself.</p>
<p>A family’s reputation is often associated with female members’ behavior and affects access to informal networks that provide a wide range of goods and services critical to survival. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112440683">Singerman (1995)</xref> describes how residents of Cairo’s popular quarters rely on reciprocal informal networks of kin and neighbors to secure employment, obtain subsidized goods and services, and access informal savings and rotating credit networks. Rotating credit associations, in particular, are a critical financial resource for poor and lower middle class families.</p>
<p>Reputation affects access to social networks because ‘an important characteristic of the reciprocal flow of goods and services is that it presupposes continuity beyond a single transaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463112440683">Hoodfar, 1997</xref>: 218). Families constantly monitor and judge other families’ morality and propriety, particularly in the highly public marriage market and engagement process. Engagements in the Middle East can be long, and they occasionally end as information about the families is revealed. Information costs for evaluating reputation are often high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112440683">Singerman (1995</xref>: 85) describes,<disp-quote>
<p>long after families have publicly announced the engagement of their children, the moral behavior of the couple and his or her family is constantly evaluated and monitored until the marriage finally occurs. To this end, the family expects its members to act as private investigators.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kin marriages remain popular in some locales partly because families have better information about relatives than they do about strangers. Kin marriages are lower in both information and financial costs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1043463112440683">6</xref></sup> Although the discussion here focuses on the marriage market, the theory should apply more broadly since some people prefer to interact with pious individuals in a wide range of social situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043463112440683">
<title>Piety as a hidden characteristic</title>
<p>In the language of game theory, piety is a hidden characteristic that is not directly observable. A woman knows her own piety. Potential suitors, however, only have a pre-existing belief about the distribution of pious women in the community, not ex-ante information about any individual woman’s piety. This information asymmetry is particularly acute where interaction between unrelated men and women is socially constrained. In such communities, gossip networks and reputation maintenance are even more valuable. As long as a sufficient number of men and their families prefer pious wives over less pious ones, unmarried pious women benefit if they can reliably transmit information about their piety to suitors. This is difficult, however, since less pious women might want to misrepresent their level of piety. How can uninformed men trust information in the absence of a mechanism to authenticate?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1043463112440683">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biologists and economists have analyzed similar interactions characterized by asymmetric information, with informed individuals on one side of the market and uninformed individuals on the other. Signaling models demonstrate how, under conditions of incomplete information, informed parties can gain a market advantage if they can reliably convey their private information to uninformed parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1043463112440683">8</xref></sup> My central argument rests on a claim that, under certain conditions, wearing clothing associated with Islamic precepts can emerge as a solution to this asymmetric information problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1043463112440683">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>An action credibly transmits information about a characteristic if individuals with that characteristic face a sufficiently lower cost of doing that action than individuals without it. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043463112440683">Spence’s (1973)</xref> foundational model of job market signaling, for example, education levels emerge as a credible signal of ability because low-ability workers expend more effort to acquire education than high-ability workers do, therefore requiring higher wages in compensation. This holds even if education does not increase workers’ productivity. Credible signals often consume resources, and some individuals are more willing or able to pay those costs for reasons associated with the characteristic that is valuable to signal.</p>

<title>Headscarves as reliable signals of piety until the 1970s</title>
<p>Late 19th and early 20th century colonial authorities and nationalist reformers in the Middle East associated the headscarf and Islamic dress with backwardness and anti-modernization. In 1923, Huda Shaarawi famously removed her veil in a Cairo train station after returning from an international feminist conference in Rome, a seminal moment in early 20th century Egyptian and Arab feminism. Reformers in the 1920s and 1930s increasingly attacked traditional female dress as a symbol of oppressive traditions. Although these feminists initially impacted mostly upper class women, their activities and writings influenced broad discourses and public attitudes on the headscarf, veil, and Islamic dress. Marxist and other secular groups pressured female members to remove head coverings and encouraged their abolition in wider society.</p>
<p>Some governments, including Republican Turkey and briefly Iran, banned headscarves. Throughout the 1930s and until his ouster in 1941, Reza Shah led an anti-headscarf offensive, believing that a nation had to look Western in order to be modern. Wearing the Iranian chador became a criminal offense in 1936, and police tore headscarves off women in the streets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1043463112440683">10</xref></sup> Ministries refused to employ or teach covered women. Although formal bans were rare in the Arab world, reformers depicted the headscarf as emblematic of a traditional mindset that retards national development. In most Middle Eastern states, headscarves were widely associated with backwardness and anti-nationalist sentiment by the 1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1043463112440683">11</xref></sup> Bureaucracies in the Arab republics considered covered women as backward, uneducated, and unsophisticated. Wearing a headscarf could be occupationally and socially limiting for both the woman and her husband. A covered woman might have found it difficult to find a suitable job. A man working for the state might have been embarrassed to be seen in public with a covered wife. Over time, fewer women covered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043463112440683">Fernea (2002</xref>: 151) claims that until recently, ‘Walking on the streets of Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Jordan, and Egypt, a visitor would find a veiled [wearing <italic>hijab</italic>] woman the exception rather than the rule’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1043463112440683">12</xref></sup> What differentiated those ‘exceptional’ covered women from the uncovered others?</p>
<p>Only pious women were willing to bear the social stigma and legal costs of wearing headscarves under such conditions. Their piety provided psychological benefit for fulfilling what they saw as a religious obligation, even at the cost of social ridicule and poor treatment from state bureaucracies. Some pious women may have perceived themselves as preservers of Islamic tradition and values in the face of secular modernism and nationalism. Social and state sanctioning was insufficient to induce truly pious women to abandon the headscarf, but less pious women were more susceptible to such pressures and went uncovered.</p>
<p>In game theoretic terms, a separating equilibrium existed. By wearing different clothes, pious women and less pious women sent different signals, allowing men to reliably identify their piety. Headscarves and Islamic clothing are a credible signal of piety when pious women have a sufficiently lower cost for wearing them than less pious women have for wearing them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1043463112440683">13</xref></sup> Under such conditions, concealing reveals.</p>
<p>Despite the same Quranic justifications<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1043463112440683">14</xref></sup> and traditions of the Prophet Muhammad, Muslims in different locales have long held different notions of proper Islamic dress, which can change over time. Analyzing dress as signals of piety might account for such variation: communities coordinate on styles of Islamic dress to signal piety in response to differences within each community in the marginal costs of wearing Islamic dress for pious women and less pious women.</p>

<title>How ‘re-veiling’ undermined the piety of the <italic>hijab</italic></title>
<p>The resurgent popularity of headscarves and basic Islamic dress in the 1970s and 1980s undermined their credibility as a signal of piety because many less pious women adopted basic Islamic dress for a wide variety of reasons. Some women adopted such clothes to minimize harassment and to appease family members when working outside the home. Others adopted them as a sign of protest or fashion. Islamists encouraged women to cover and provided selective incentives to those who did so.</p>
<sec id="section6-1043463112440683">
<title>‘Re-veiling’</title>
<p>Millions of women in the Middle East adopted the headscarf in the 1970s and 1980s in what has become known as the ‘re-veiling’ phenomenon. Few studies based on systematic data exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043463112440683">Hessini, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043463112440683">Williams, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463112440683">Zuhur, 1992</xref>), but the widespread resurgence of the headscarf and Islamic dress throughout the Muslim world is a widely acknowledged stylized fact. At the beginning of Macleod’s ethnographic study of lower middle class Cairene women in 1983, about one-third covered. By 1988, she found that ‘about three-quarters of the female workers of this study had adopted some version of Islamic dress. The higab in some form seems to be approaching the norm for these women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod, 1991</xref>: 105).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1043463112440683">15</xref></sup> Of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463112440683">Zuhur’s (1992)</xref> 50 Cairene interviewees in 1988, 25 wore the headscarf and six wore veils. The percentage of Muslim women wearing headscarves and Islamic dress increased in almost all Middle Eastern urban areas in this period, except for the few places where it was already the norm or required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043463112440683">
<title>Explaining re-veiling – socioeconomic factors and harassment</title>
<p>Most of the considerable literature on the ‘re-veiling’ phenomenon concludes that previously uncovered Muslim women who adopted headscarves and simple Islamic dress did so chiefly for economic, political, and social reasons instead of religious ones. Many authors link socioeconomic changes in Arab societies to the voluntary adoption of such dress. As lower class and lower middle class women increasingly entered the formal workforce, they often adopted Islamic dress to appease male family members concerned about their interaction with men in the workplace, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod (1991)</xref> memorably described as ‘accommodating protest’. The use of Islamic dress to minimize harassment from unrelated men and facilitate access in the male-dominated public sphere is a common theme in ethnographies, indigenous films, and documentaries. Since men fear social (and divine!) sanctioning if they harass a pious Muslim woman, less pious women working outside the house might mimic the dress of pious ones in an attempt to minimize harassment. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that harassment of women in headscarves and simple Islamic dress has increased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1043463112440683">16</xref></sup> The signaling approach accounts for this – harassers now know that many covered women are not really pious and are therefore more willing to verbally harass, approach, or grope women wearing headscarves (but not women with face veils). If harassers thought piety was increasing in society and all covered women were pious, they should not be more willing to hassle covered women.</p>
<p>Some observers see the adoption of Islamic dress as a response by lower middle class women to diminished family resources. Islamic clothing can reduce the cost of attire for working women because they do not need outfits for each workday or spend as much time and money on hair products. Instead, they can wear clean, inexpensive, casual clothes underneath the same over-garment; only family members see the clothing underneath.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043463112440683">
<title>Explaining re-veiling – protest</title>
<p>Headscarves and Islamic dress also became forms of protest against globalization, the perceived hegemony of Western cultural values, the spread of materialism, the commodification of women’s bodies, existing Arab regimes, and pan-Arab secular nationalism (especially after Israel’s military victory in 1967 and Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel in 1979). Headscarves became associated with popular support for anti-colonial and revolutionary movements, such as in Iran, Algeria, and the Palestinian Intifadahs (on Algeria, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043463112440683">Fanon, 1965</xref>: 61–62). In pre-Revolution Iran, <italic>‘</italic>wearing a chador symbolized that a woman was anti-Shah, anti-imperialism, anti-corruption, anti-moral decadence and against capitalism’s exploitation of the “modern consumer woman”. Secular women donned the chador in street demonstrations to show their anti-Shah solidarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043463112440683">Bullock, 1999</xref>: 151). During the first Palestinian Intifadah, ‘the veil became a patriotic obligation, a uniform proclaiming that its wearer supported the Intifada’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043463112440683">Bucaille, 2004</xref>: 23.) Other scholars view students’ adoption of the veil as a form of generational assertiveness and protest against their parents’ lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043463112440683">El Guindi, 1999</xref>). Popular preachers, such as Amr Khalid of Egypt, describe the headscarf as a form of cultural authenticity. For many, the headscarf and Islamic dress came to be seen as a form of protection for individuals, society, and the Muslim community as a whole. Negative connotations and social stigmas associated with wearing a headscarf declined considerably after 1967. Most state bureaucracies gradually reduced or eliminated penalties for women in headscarves either because public opinion forced them to allow more conservative dress or as a deliberate state strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043463112440683">
<title>Explaining re-veiling – selective incentives from Islamist movements</title>
<p>Islamist organizations and movements commonly offered women incentives – both positive and negative – to adopt headscarves and Islamic dress. The Muslim Brothers in Egypt and elsewhere, for example, operated buses for women dressed in what they consider appropriate attire. Islamist student groups reserved desired seats in university lecture halls for covered women, regardless of their affiliation with the group. Adopting Islamic dress makes it easier for a woman to continue her education and increase family income when Islamist societies and organizations subsidize education, employment, and healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112440683">Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043463112440683">Sullivan, 1994</xref>). Jordanians, for example, widely assume that Islamic hospitals and clinics only provide jobs and healthcare to covered women (author’s interviews in Jordan 2004–2005; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463112440683">Clark, 2004</xref>). Although Islamist groups hope to inculcate a wide range of Islamic morals and behaviors, they may economize information-gathering by conditioning the provision of goods and services for a family on how its women dress. Less pious women clearly garner greater selective benefits now than in previous decades if they cover.</p>
<p>Members of Islamist movements sometimes pressure women in their families and neighborhoods to wear basic Islamic dress. They, of course, have also convinced some women that wearing Islamic dress is a religious obligation that should not be ignored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043463112440683">El Guindi (1999)</xref> has argued that women in the Islamist movement use a standardized form of Islamic dress to mark themselves as members.</p>

<title>Explaining re-veiling – intimidation by Islamic states and Islamists</title>
<p>In a few places, vice and virtue squads intimidated women into covering their hair and adopting Islamic dress. Iranian women were required to wear headscarves and Islamic dress soon after the 1979 Islamic revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1043463112440683">17</xref></sup> <italic>Komitahs</italic> enforced a standardized ‘correct’ form of Islamic dress through public scolding, beatings, and imprisonment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1043463112440683">18</xref></sup> Graffiti in Tehran still states ‘death to the improperly veiled woman’ and ‘the improperly veiled woman is a stain on the Islamic Republic of Iran and must be eliminated immediately’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043463112440683">Shirazi, 2001</xref>: 107–108). A particular image or style of Islamic dress is often enforced. The Iranian government’s Agency for the Fight Against Social Corruption/Agency for Public Education issues posters showing the proper ‘pattern of Islamic <italic>hijab</italic>’, dictating type of covering, color (preferably black, dark blue, brown, or dark gray), shoes (mandatory low heels), and acceptable tightness of clothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043463112440683">Shirazi, 2001</xref>: 105–106). The Taliban in Afghanistan forced women to wear full-face and body veils. Saudi Arabia has long required women to cover, and the government empowers ‘religious police’ to enforce such laws.</p>
<p>Some Islamists used physical intimidation to force women to adhere to Islamic dress, justifying their behavior with the frequent Quranic obligation to ‘command right and forbid wrong’ and claiming that uncovered women harm public morality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043463112440683">Bucaille (2004</xref>: 23) describes how vigilantes forced women to cover in Gaza during the first Intifadah:<disp-quote>
<p>before long, any woman walking bareheaded in the streets of Gaza was liable to be insulted or stoned. Brutal intimidation quickly persuaded those few who resisted that they would have to obey the laws laid down by militant gunmen, who had no political training or experience but retained a monopoly on physical coercion. [Consequently,] only a few committed women in Gaza, one year into the intifada, continued not to wear a headscarf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043463112440683">Hammami, 1990</xref>: 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some women in Gaza would don a headscarf and over-garment to travel between places, but remove them when in a place where unknown people would not threaten them. In post-Saddam Iraq, Islamist militias coerced women in many Arab-majority areas to adopt headscarves and conservative clothing. In late 2003, a prominent local Islamist militia in Basra hung signs around the city stating that ‘a woman who reveals one strand of hair is from the family of Yazid’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1043463112440683">19</xref></sup> Many Basrawi women who had never previously worn a headscarf adopted it after being harassed by vigilante enforcers of ‘Islamic’ morals or hearing accounts of attacks on uncovered women.</p>
<p>Intimidation by vigilantes or state enforcement should lead most uncovered women to adopt the minimal level of Islamic dress needed to avoid harassment, which is often a basic headscarf and loose-fitting clothing. Being forced to cover, however, cannot explain why women would adopt more conservative clothing styles than necessary, such as the face veil.</p>

<title>Explaining re-veiling – fashion</title>
<p>Once a sufficient number of women in a community adopted headscarves and Islamic dress, a fashion ‘tip’ often occurred. One of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod’s (1991</xref>: 112–113) respondents, explaining the rapid spread of the headscarf in Egypt, expressed this idea,<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know why fashions change in this way, no one knows why; one day everyone wears dresses and even pants. I even wore a bathing suit when I went to the beach at Alexandria one time. Then, suddenly we are all wearing this on our hair!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This view is common. About 60% of Macleod’s 58 respondents say they simply did not know why female clothing had changed, but that they are participating in the movement to cover, whatever its fundamental causes. Many women adopted the headscarf simply because so many other women had; 56% of them directly associated the <italic>hijab</italic> with dictates of fashion. One stated, ‘Since everyone is becoming muhaggaba, it has become the thing to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod, 1991</xref>: 112). When everyone wears the headscarf, no one wants to stand out by not wearing it. Islamic fashion shows are now common in Arab cities and broadcast on satellite television. Boutiques sell fashionable <italic>hijabs</italic> and Islamic clothes.</p>

<sec id="section12-1043463112440683">
<title>Explaining re-veiling – mimicry</title>
<p>Some less pious women might deliberately mimic being pious, either to minimize harassment or get a good husband. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod (1991</xref>: 110) found that, <italic>‘</italic>Non-veiling women sometimes commented that women wearing the higab were especially religious, but they just as often claimed that the muhaggaba just wanted to be considered religious, although she was really no different from everyone else’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1043463112440683">20</xref></sup> Women whose reputations had been sullied by dating or gossip might be reborn socially if they adopt a headscarf. Many women believe that relatively rich and desirable bachelors returning from working in Saudi Arabia or the Gulf prefer covered women after living in conservative environments.</p>
<p>The existing literature overwhelmingly concludes that the spread of the headscarf and Islamic dress resulted from utilitarian considerations, not newly-discovered piety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1043463112440683">21</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod (1991</xref>: 110) found that,<disp-quote>
<p>only a very small percentage of these veiling [adopting a <italic>hijab</italic>] women seem to be actually turning to religion in a genuine way; women who read the Qur’an on their own, attend meetings for women at their local mosques, pray daily the prescribed five times, or concern themselves with fulfilling their other religious duties remain a tiny minority.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When newly covered women are asked why they have not become more observant, despite access to religious knowledge, ‘they reply that they are too busy, too involved with their duties at home and at work, or even that they are just not interested’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463112440683">Macleod, 1991</xref>: 110). Only a small number of the newly covered women interviewed by Macleod discussed the headscarf as a religious form of dress, a demonstration of true piety.</p>

<title>How ‘re-veiling’ undermined the piety of the hijab</title>
<p>Women in some places adopted Islamic dress as a form of protest; others did so under familial pressure. Islamist movements encouraged or ‘bribed’ some women into adopting the headscarf. Elsewhere, women were intimidated into covering. The stigma of wearing a headscarf largely disappeared, and state bureaucracies tolerated more conservative dress. In general, these diverse economic, political, and social factors led many less pious women to adopt headscarves and Islamic dress in the 1970s and 1980s. These factors, one way or another, decreased the costs of wearing such clothes, raised the costs of not doing so, or provided benefits for doing so. The difference between the marginal costs of wearing a headscarf for pious women versus less pious women decreased. In the language of game theory, a pooling equilibrium occurred, in which both pious and a sufficiently large number of less pious women wore headscarves and Islamic dress. Observers could no longer reliably infer a woman’s piety from her clothing.</p>
<p>The devaluation of the <italic>hijab</italic> as a signal of piety changed the way Muslims talk about the headscarf. Many Muslims, both young and old, lament that ‘the <italic>hijab</italic> has lost its meaning’. The Arabic word for a woman wearing a headscarf, <italic>muhajjaba</italic>, no longer connotes piety and modesty like it did a few decades ago. Arabs today are more likely to use the word <italic>multazima</italic> (literally, ‘committed’) to refer to a pious woman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1043463112440683">22</xref></sup> A <italic>muhajjaba</italic> is not necessarily <italic>multazima</italic>. Pious women and Islamist literature increasingly emphasize that what really matters is what is inside a woman’s heart, not if her hair is covered (Bullock, 2004: 77–78; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood, 2004</xref>: 31). Hajja Nur, one of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood’s (2004</xref>: 50–51) interviewees, states,<disp-quote>
<p>what we have to do is to educate Muslim women that it is not enough to wear the veil [headscarf], but that the veil must also lead us to behave in a truly modest manner in our daily lives, a challenge that far exceeds the simple act of donning the veil.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Young unmarried men now commonly say that headscarves tell them nothing about a woman’s piety. As the headscarf came to symbolize many different things, it lost its definite association with piety. A woman now wears the <italic>hijab</italic> for a number of reasons; its social meaning is ambiguous.</p>

<title>Escalation in clothing as a search for costlier signals</title>
<p>The spread of the headscarf and simple Islamic dress among less pious women in the 1970s and 1980s undermined their usefulness as a signal of piety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1043463112440683">23</xref></sup> Pious and less pious women wore similar clothes, making it impossible for men to distinguish between them based solely on clothing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1043463112440683">24</xref></sup> However, pious women still face strong market incentives to transmit information about their piety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1043463112440683">25</xref></sup> Many adopted higher-cost signals – such as stringent clothing restrictions, full-face veils (<italic>niqab</italic>), and costly public expressions of piety – leading to a new distinction in clothing styles across types.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1043463112440683">26</xref></sup> Men can once again distinguish pious women from less pious women by clothes and outward displays, but the costs to pious women of making credible signals are now higher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1043463112440683">27</xref></sup> The average age of marriage has increased in almost all Arab countries since the mid-1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043463112440683">Rashad and Osman, 2003</xref>). Although economic and demographic changes, especially the difficulty of saving to establish a household, seem to be the most important factors in explaining this delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463112440683">Hoodfar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112440683">Singerman, 1995</xref>), the theory developed here suggests that an increase in search costs associated with identifying suitable spouses may contribute to the rising age of marriage.</p>
<sec id="section15-1043463112440683">
<title>Pious women respond</title>
<p>As headscarves proliferated among less pious women, pious women initially altered how they wore headscarves. They began to advocate stringent ways of tying and wearing the headscarf, often to minimize the likelihood of any hair showing. Complete covering of the neck became common. A distinction arose between ‘good <italic>hijab</italic>’ and ‘bad <italic>hijab’</italic>. Consistent with the observable implications of the theory, the criteria for ‘good <italic>hijab</italic>’ are stricter than what was common a few decades ago. Changes in how to wear <italic>hijab</italic> were insufficient, however, since less pious women seeking to mimic pious women could easily and cheaply copy these styles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1043463112440683">28</xref></sup> These innovations in clothing styles can be thought of as pious women searching for styles unpalatable to less pious women.</p>
<p>Pious women moved to wearing plain and longer headscarves tightly around their neck and head. These headscarves often reach far down the back. Many wear a slightly visible skullcap under the <italic>hijab</italic> to demonstrate how critical it is to them not to show any hair, even inadvertently. The <italic>khimar</italic>, a long piece of cloth that drapes over a woman’s torso and arms, has surprisingly become popular among pious Cairene women. Less pious women are less willing than pious women to adopt the <italic>khimar</italic> because of its rural associations, the restrictions it places on movements (especially of a woman’s arms), and the perspiration it causes in hot weather. Previously considered the dress of newly urbanized peasants, the <italic>khimar</italic> appears to be increasingly common across social classes in Cairo.</p>
<p>Some pious women have adopted a full-face veil, or <italic>niqab</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1043463112440683">29</xref></sup> These are almost always a black or white cloth that covers a woman’s face. A slit often, but not always, reveals her eyes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood (2004</xref>: 43) interviewed a number of Egyptian <italic>munaqqabat</italic> and found,<disp-quote>
<p>Women who wear the niqab understood their practice to accord with a strict interpretation of Islamic edicts on female modesty, and often see themselves as more virtuous than women who wear the khimar (the veil that covers the head and torso) or the hijab (headscarf).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The social costs of wearing a <italic>niqab</italic> in most countries remain high such that only pious women bear them. Shopkeepers might consider <italic>munaqqabat</italic> a nuisance if their presence deters other shoppers or interactions with male employees are awkward. Many government institutions ban or informally punish <italic>munaqqabat</italic>. Getting a permit or driver’s license, for example, might require extra time-consuming security checks. A 1994 Egyptian Ministry of Education regulation prohibits students wearing the <italic>niqab</italic> from attending university.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1043463112440683">30</xref></sup> Some private institutions also punish <italic>munaqqabat</italic>; the American University in Cairo banned them from its campus and library in 2000. The Egyptian government justifies the <italic>niqab</italic> ban for security reasons and to prevent cheating on exams. Social stigmas are still attached to wearing <italic>niqab</italic>; some gossip that unattractive women adopt the full-face veil to hide their ugliness. A new form of veiling is the <italic>boushiya</italic>, which typically consists of a see-through layer or two of cloth draped over the head and face. A recent survey of Middle Eastern face veils states that, <italic>‘</italic>this type of face veil is a twentieth century development, typical in the first place for urban Arab circles. As a face veil it is a unique type, not known among traditional forms elsewhere in the Islamic world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043463112440683">Vogelsang-Eastwood and Vogelsang, 2008</xref>: 222).</p>
<p>The signaling argument yields a number of observable implications that future anthropological studies might evaluate: (1) Uncovered women (presumably less pious) should only adopt <italic>hijab</italic>, not <italic>niqab</italic>; (2) The spread of the <italic>hijab</italic> in a community should precede the spread of the <italic>niqab</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1043463112440683">31</xref></sup> (3) Unmarried women should be more likely to adopt <italic>niqab</italic> than married women. Confidence in the theory, or at least its relevance for the marriage market, would be weakened if women were more likely to adopt the <italic>niqab</italic> after marriage than before it; (4) Women should see their marriage prospects improve after adopting the <italic>niqab</italic>; <italic>munaqqabat</italic> should not remain unmarried for long. The signaling theory of piety cannot account for women who adopt face veils and ever more austere clothing styles after marriage; another explanation is necessary to account for those individuals.</p>
<p>In addition to face veils, pious women have adopted other clothing restrictions to credibly signal their piety. A virtual uniform for pious women has evolved that includes an ankle-length over-garment called a <italic>jelbab</italic>. In the early 1980s, Rugh describes the ‘standard fundamentalist’ dress style as flowing ‘from the shoulder to the ankle, usually in one somber color, concealing the outlines of the figure as completely as possible. The head covering surrounds the face like a nun’s cowl and falls loosely to the shoulder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043463112440683">1984</xref>: 230).</p>
<p>When less pious women also adopted <italic>jelbab</italic> (perhaps to limit clothing costs or mimic pious women), pious women limited themselves to drab colors, such as black, brown, dark blue, and dark green. Further restrictions include plain shoes and long sleeves that conceal wrists. Some women now wear gloves. The unwillingness of less pious women to adopt these increasingly stringent restrictions makes them credible signals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1043463112440683">32</xref></sup> Unlike a few decades ago, it is now common to see local women on university campuses in the Levant or North Africa dressed head-to-toe in black without an inch of skin showing. These styles are not traditional to those areas.</p>
<p>Escalations in clothing restrictions and increasing stringency can be seen as attempts by pious women to find styles that less pious women will find too burdensome to emulate. Once this threshold is reached, pious women should not seek further clothing restrictions. Clothing styles should stabilize over time, and some intermediate styles should die out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1043463112440683">33</xref></sup> The escalation in the strictness of head coverings and dress resembles runaway evolutionary processes studied by biologists, such as peacocks’ tails, and applied by sociologists to social patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043463112440683">Boyd and Richerson, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Even in officially secular Turkey, the headscarf and Islamic dress spread to such an extent that pious women resorted to a particular style of covering and an accompanying lifestyle after 1983 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043463112440683">Göle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043463112440683">White, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043463112440683">2005</xref>). Called <italic>tesettur</italic>, this style consists of an oversized headscarf with matching tailored coat or suit. But, unlike other countries where drab colors prevail, <italic>tesettur</italic> colors, patterns, and styles ‘respond to tastes in fashion and are continually transformed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043463112440683">White, 2005</xref>: 124). Pious women in Turkey do not need to adopt as many restrictions as pious women in other countries because the headscarf has not spread as extensively in Turkey as it has elsewhere.</p>
<p>Post-revolution Tunisia will likely offer a test of the theory. Law Number 108 of 1981 banned Tunisian women from wearing <italic>niqab</italic> or <italic>hijab</italic> inside state-run bodies, including schools. Until 2011, <italic>niqabs</italic> were unnecessary to credibly signal piety in Tunisia and consequently were extremely rare; pious women could signal their piety by wearing a simple <italic>hijab</italic>. If bans on <italic>hijab</italic> are lifted or unenforced, as Islamist and many civil society groups propose, the signaling approach suggests that many less pious Tunisian women would adopt the <italic>hijab</italic>. Already covered Tunisian women would then soon respond by adopting more conservative clothes, and the <italic>niqab</italic> would become common among (and only among) Tunisian women who covered before the changes.</p>
<p>The frequency of conservative dress in any area should reflect the distribution of piety and level of demand for identifying pious women. Since those vary across places, the spatial distribution of conservative dress should vary. Muslim societies should only converge on similar distributions if those factors were the same across space.</p>

<sec id="section16-1043463112440683">
<title>Do Islamists encourage the niqab?</title>
<p>Three alternative explanations for the rise of the <italic>niqab</italic> imply that its adoption is independent from the spread of the <italic>hijab</italic>. Many journalists mistakenly believe that Islamist movements encourage the spread of the <italic>niqab</italic>. Although political Islamists provide selective incentives for women to adopt headscarves and encourage women to adopt the headscarf and simple Islamic dress, they rarely advocate face veils. The Muslim Brothers and other mainstream Islamist movements, for example, are deeply committed to spreading the <italic>hijab</italic> but are internally divided on the <italic>niqab</italic>. Most contemporary Islamic scholars believe that wearing a <italic>hijab</italic> is a religious obligation but that the <italic>niqab</italic> is not, although some say the <italic>niqab</italic> is recommended on precautionary grounds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1043463112440683">34</xref></sup> A group of Islamic scholars from al-Azhar University in Egypt summarized the mainstream view in 2008 when they declared that the headscarf is required but that the <italic>niqab</italic> is a custom and not a form of worship (<italic>al-niqab ‘ada wa-laysa ‘ibada</italic>). Most knowledgeable political Islamists might say that wearing the headscarf is obligatory (<italic>wajib</italic> or <italic>fard</italic>) but the <italic>niqab</italic> is recommended (<italic>mustahabb</italic> or <italic>sunnah</italic>). Most leaders of the Muslim Brothers do not advocate for the face veil. For example, Ishaq Farhan, the founding Secretary-General of the Jordanian Islamic Action Front Party, encouraged <italic>munaqqabat</italic> students to rethink their position when he was President of the Islamist-oriented al-Zarqa Private University.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1043463112440683">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many critics of the <italic>niqab</italic> attribute its spread to the purported spread of ‘Wahhabi’ or Salafi schools of thought via satellite television and the return of unmarried men who worked in the oil-rich Gulf. Exposure to preaching and propaganda from Saudi Arabia, it is claimed, changes Muslims’ views on Islam and makes them more ‘fundamentalist’. Some women and families have probably adopted the <italic>niqab</italic> and more conservative behaviors after being exposed to Salafi outreach, but there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons to question how much this can explain. This supposed preference change after visiting Saudi Arabia has not been empirically demonstrated. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463112440683">Clingingsmith et al. (2009)</xref> find that participation in Hajj, and the associated exposure to Wahhabi Saudi Arabia, leads Pakistanis to adopt more favorable attitudes towards women’s equality.</p>
<p>The signaling argument developed here implies that pious Muslim women turn to fundamentalist justifications for the <italic>niqab</italic> after they need to find new ways to demonstrate their piety. Engaging in Salafi discourse and lessons is often time-consuming and tedious; it typically entails study of debates and traditions from Islamic history on how to conduct oneself on a daily basis (e.g., how to brush one’s teeth; how to enter a bathroom). Public expressions of piety might be increasingly ‘political’ if such expressions help pious women distinguish themselves from less pious women. Spending hours listening to tedious religious-political sermons might be more costly for less pious women.</p>
<p>Finally, not all Salafis demand women cover their face. Many prominent Salafi scholars agree with the mainstream view that the headscarf is obligatory while the face veil is recommended. For example, the late Sheikh Mohammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, one of the most influential Salafi scholars and teachers of the 20th century, believed Islam allows the display of a woman’s face and hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043463112440683">Al-Albani, 2002</xref>). Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, more likely to be associated with Muslim Brothers than Salafis, advocates the same position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043463112440683">Al-Qaradawi, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>If <italic>munaqqabat</italic> actively encourage other women to adopt the <italic>niqab</italic>, our confidence in the signaling theory should decrease. Such behavior suggests <italic>munaqqabat</italic> do not view less pious women wearing <italic>niqab</italic> as a challenge to what the <italic>niqab</italic> means. If they thought it was a religious obligation, they should encourage all women (including less pious women) to adopt it. Anecdotal evidence from newspapers and Arabic blogs suggests that <italic>munaqqabat</italic> see the <italic>niqab</italic> as precautionary and recommended, not required.</p>
<p>Time-series data, if available, would help assess various explanations for the spread of the <italic>niqab</italic>. Confidence in the signaling theory explanation would increase if <italic>niqabs</italic> only proliferate in a country after many previously uncovered women adopt <italic>hijab</italic>. It should be unrelated to Wahhabi or Salafist funding of mosques and Islamic institutions in a country, unless those institutions provide benefits to women who wear <italic>hijabs</italic>. Furthermore, the timing of the <italic>niqab</italic>’s spread should be independent across countries, controlling for factors that lead uncovered women to adopt <italic>hijab</italic>. Changes in one marriage market should not affect other marriage markets. If the boundaries of ‘marriage markets’ were identifiable, variation between cities, neighborhoods, or tribes could be examined. Finally, the influx of tens of thousands of unmarried covered Iraqi Shiite women to Jordan and Syria since 2004 should not induce already covered Sunni women in those countries to adopt more conservative styles, since marriages between Iraqi Shiite women and Jordanian or Syrian Sunni men are uncommon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1043463112440683">
<title>The rise of non-clothing signals of piety</title>
<p>Pious women have also adopted non-clothing restrictions and behaviors to demonstrate their piety. Many minimize ornamentation, refuse to pluck eyebrows, and forgo makeup. Religion supposedly justifies such restrictions. Many pious women refuse to wear fingernail polish, claiming that polish impedes the obligatory ritual washing before prayers. These behaviors spread among pious women after less pious women began to cover.</p>
<p>A large international market for religious clothing and beauty products has emerged. The conspicuous consumption of goods explicitly permissible (<italic>halal</italic>) under Islamic law, such as beauty products and understated jewelry, might demonstrate an individual’s piety. The expansion of the supply of such products, however, reduced their cost. When the cost of a <italic>halal</italic> product is sufficiently low or close to that of its non-<italic>halal</italic> alternative, less pious women will begin to consume it. The <italic>halal</italic> product’s usefulness as a credible signal of piety should disappear. Islamic literature – cassette sermons, pamphlets, and books – rapidly expanded in recent years due to technological change and opening economies. Displaying religious paraphernalia and playing Quranic recitation no longer sufficiently signals piety because the monetary and social costs are low.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1043463112440683">36</xref></sup> Islamic ‘self-help’ books, such as <italic>Don’t Be Sad</italic> (<italic>la tahazan</italic>), can be bestsellers. The spread of explicitly Islamic products tells us more about changes in economic openness than it does about changes in ideology or piety.</p>
<p>Instead, pious women rely on time-consuming demonstrations of knowledge and public behaviors to demonstrate piety. If behaviors and knowledge cost time instead of money, less pious individuals are less likely to adopt them or successfully mimic. Pious women, for example, study and emulate the ‘proper’ Islamic way of doing almost everything. Classes and pamphlets outline ‘the’ Islamic way to dress, interact with others, marry, engage in intercourse, raise children, breastfeed, cook, wash, etc. Pious women’s reliance on public expressions of Islamic behavior to signal piety contributes to the increasing popularity of scriptural and time-intensive Salafism, at the expense of Sufism and other strains of Sunni Islam.</p>
<p>‘Fundamentalist’ discourses on proper Islamic modesty have rapidly spread in the Arab world. Many pious women refuse to shake unrelated men’s hands, and sometimes refuse to make eye contact or speak to them unless necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1043463112440683">37</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463112440683">Singerman (1995</xref>: 80) relates the story of a young man looking for a wife who approached the family of an unmarried woman in his building because ‘her upbringing had been very strict [and he] had never seen her despite living in the same building for years’.

<title>Women’s mosque movements as public expressions of piety</title>
<p>Pious women now engage in new activities to publicly demonstrate their piety. Since the late 1970s, women in a number of Middle Eastern cities have called for a public space in mosques to pray and study religion. This was a new development, and it quickly spread. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood (2004</xref>: 2) states <italic>‘</italic>The burgeoning of this movement marks the first time in Egyptian history that such a large number of women have held public meetings in mosques to teach one another Islamic doctrine’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood (2004</xref>: 3–4) found,<disp-quote>
<p>By the time I began my fieldwork in 1995 [in Cairo], this movement had become so popular that there were hardly any neighborhoods in this city of 11 million inhabitants that did not offer some form of religious lessons for women.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The phenomenon is not limited to Egypt. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043463112440683">Nageeb (2004</xref>: 176) quotes a migrant Sudanese returning to his country: <italic>‘</italic>Women’s attendance at mosques is a new phenomenon. Mosques were always for men. Now you see young and old women coming in and out of the mosque at different times of the day’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1043463112440683">38</xref></sup> As in Mahmood’s Cairo, Nageeb found that most Sudanese women’s religious groups were residentially based and focused on Quranic study and discussions of Islamic approaches to social issues. Spending time studying in local mosques (where reputations can be created and maintained) is a costly way to publicly demonstrate piety that is difficult to mimic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood (2004</xref>: 31) says,<disp-quote>
<p>In comparison with other currents within the Islamic Revival, the mosque movement is unique in the extraordinary degree of pedagogical emphasis it places on outward markers of religiosity – ritual practices, styles of comporting oneself, dress, and so on. The participants in the mosque movement regard these practices as the necessary and ineluctable means for realizing the form of religiosity they are cultivating. For the mosque participants, it is the various movements of the body that comprise the material substance of the ethical domain.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These mosque circles often set local standards for behaviors that demonstrate piety and which Islamic sources should be used to justify those behaviors. This reduces search costs for pious women by generating common knowledge; they know what to do to be seen by others as pious. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463112440683">Mahmood (2004</xref>: 47–48) states,<disp-quote>
<p>The piety activities seek to imbue each of the various spheres of contemporary life with a regulative sensibility that takes its cue from the Islamic theological corpus rather than from modern secular elites. In this sense, the mosque movement’s goal is to introduce a common set of shared norms or standards by which one is to judge one’s own conduct, whether in the context of employment, education, domestic life, or other social activities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Anthropologists have studied similar women’s mosque movements in other countries, such as Lebanon and Syria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043463112440683">Böttcher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043463112440683">Deeb, 2006</xref>). Future ethnographies might reveal the ratio of married to unmarried women participating in mosque movements. Confidence in the signaling approach would increase if unmarried women were found to be more likely to participate than married women, who still might participate to demonstrate piety for access to social networks.</p>
<p>We should expect women to look for these non-clothing signals, such as making donations or attending pietistic meetings, if bundling up in clothes is either insufficiently onerous for less pious women or particularly onerous for both pious and less pious women. In the former case, less pious women could mimic such styles so pious women will search for behaviors that less pious women will not engage in. In the latter case, pious women, if they have the ability to make such choices, will avoid the overly onerous clothes and similarly seek non-clothing signals. This counter-intuitively implies that female mosque movements and the most conservative clothing styles (e.g., <italic>niqabs</italic>, head-to-toe covering) are substitutes instead of complements.</p>
<p>Like all clothes, Islamic clothing can signal wealth, regional origin, and class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043463112440683">Rugh, 1986</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1043463112440683">39</xref></sup> The initial ‘re-veiling’ movement of the 1970s and 1980s did not undermine this additional function of dress; wealthy women purchase designer headscarves and tailored <italic>jelbabs</italic>. Clothing can signal any combination of piety and wealth. Women in Saudi Arabia, for example, signal wealth in numerous ways (e.g. embroidery, shoes, purses), despite requirements to wear <italic>abayas</italic> and <italic>niqabs</italic>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper presents a strategic, micro-level account for the observed rise of fundamentalist behaviors and attitudes and the increasing diversity of Islamic dress. Existing literature on ‘re-veiling’ rarely differentiates between types of Islamic covering. The theoretical innovation in this paper links the rise of the <italic>niqab</italic> to the spread of the <italic>hijab</italic>. I assume that the signaling benefits that an individual accrues from wearing clothes depend on the characteristics of others wearing those same clothes. Individuals’ clothing choices are interdependent. The meaning of Islamic dress is not fixed. Changes in the costs and benefits of wearing Islamic dress in the 1970s undermined the established role of headscarves and Islamic clothing as a signal of a Muslim woman’s piety. In recent decades, pious women responded by adopting costlier ‘fundamentalist’ styles of clothing, attitudes, and behaviors in order to reliably demonstrate their piety to individuals looking for pious partners.</p>
<p>The spread of fundamentalist behavior and rhetoric is often interpreted as ideological change, fed by Salafist (including Wahhabi) proselytizing. Clothing and behavioral changes by women are interpreted as female participation in a broader Islamic revival. In authoritarian countries such as Syria, journalists and observers often use women’s clothing and behaviors as proxies for support for Islamist movements. The signaling approach suggests they are noisy proxies that can lead to an overestimation of Islamists’ grassroots support.</p>
<p>When discussing Islamism, scholars tend to focus on groups, society, or the state as actors. Individual agency is too often ignored. Why does the adoption of Islamist behaviors and activities make sense for individuals as individuals, instead of assumed members of a group or movement? This paper offers an explanation. The apparent rise of religious extremism does not necessarily imply ideological change or even a change in underlying levels of piety. Extremist behaviors can be triggered by changes in the behavior of others, since the social value of expressions of piety depends on the actions of others and individuals’ beliefs about the characteristics of those others.</p>
<p>The argument also suggests how Islamists’ attempts to induce Islamic behaviors can counter-productively undermine individuals’ incentives to adopt those behaviors in the first place. Many political Islamists, from Indonesia to Iraq to Morocco, call for the establishment of Islamic law (<italic>shari’a</italic>) as a codified and discrete set of laws, instead of its traditional role as a continuing discursive process relatively free from state interference. The inherent importance of Islamic law for guiding individuals’ behavior, ironically, might decrease if Islamists succeed in imposing it. It might lead individuals to abandon ‘proper’ Islamic behaviors for other ones. When vigilantes forced women in Gaza to wear the headscarf during the first <italic>Intifadah</italic>, pious women quickly adopted stricter clothes such as, <italic>‘</italic>long, plain, tailored overcoats, known as shari’a dress, which have no real precedents in indigenous Palestinian dress’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043463112440683">Hammami, 1990</xref>: 25). Finally, Islamists’ imposition of Islamic behaviors can generate avenues for women to credibly signal their opposition to those behaviors. Many Iranian women, for example, challenge headscarf and modesty laws by gradually exposing ever more hair under flimsy headscarves and wearing tight tunics and short trousers. In Iran today, less concealing reveals. The signaling approach suggests pious women would benefit from the toleration of ‘down-veiling’ and limited uncovering by less pious women. The imposition of conservative clothing styles can negatively affect women already wearing those styles by changing the social meaning of those styles. Freedom of dress benefits pious women by making it easier for them to demonstrate their piety to others. Thus, Islamists who enforce conservative clothing harm pious Muslim women.</p>

<p>In this paper, ‘headscarf’ refers to cloth that covers all or most of a woman’s hair but leaves her face uncovered. In Arabic, this is generically called a <italic>hijab</italic>. A woman who wears a headscarf is a <italic>muhajjaba</italic>. ‘Veil’ exclusively refers here to styles that cover a woman’s hair, neck, and all or most of her face (her eyes may or may not be covered). In Arabic, this is generically called a <italic>niqab</italic>, although there are dozens of words for specific styles.

<p>The term ‘re-veiling’, widely used in the existing literature, is misleading for two reasons. First, the vast majority of women adopting the headscarf during this period never wore it previously. The prefix refers to societies’ resumption of a tradition after an absence of several generations. Second, the term ‘veil’ is vague and used inconsistently in the literature. Ethnographies show that when previously uncovered women cover, they usually adopt a <italic>hijab</italic>, or headscarf, not a <italic>niqab</italic>, or face-covering veil.</p></fn>

<p>Dates varied by country. Many upper class urban women began to abandon the headscarf in a few states in the 1920s and 1930s.

Abandonment of the headscarf may have become widespread later in the socialist states of Syria and Iraq.

<p>The word <italic>hijab</italic> does not refer in the Quran to a headscarf, which is a 20th century meaning for the word. Quranic scholars focus on a reference to a curtain in 33:53, widely interpreted as a commandment for women to cover. It states, ‘And when you [believers] ask his [the Prophet Muhammed’s] wives for any objects, ask them from behind a curtain [<italic>hijab</italic>, sometimes translated here as ‘screen’]; that is cleaner for your hearts and theirs’. Although the commandment refers to the wives of the Prophet, overwhelming scholarly consensus is that it is meant to apply to all women. The Quran also demands modesty for both men and women; 24:30–31 states,<disp-quote>
<p>Say to the believers, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts; that is purer for them. God is aware of the things they work. And say to the believing women, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts, and reveal not adornment save such as it outward; and let them cast their veils over their bosoms, and not reveal their adornment save to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands’ fathers, or their sons ...</p>

<p>This is not the only way that a signal of piety could be undermined. Undertaking a mission at age 19 is a signal of piety for American members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

<p>Signaling on the part of pious women is not the only possible solution to the information asymmetry identified in this paper. If currently credible signaling costs decrease for less pious women, men may screen for piety. The key distinction between signaling and screening games is which market actor moves first: the informed individual (signaling) or the uninformed individual (screening). In such a case, men seeking pious women would need to design different ‘contracts’ or offers, allowing women with private information about their type to simply choose from among offers. A credible demand by a man that a future wife remain inside the home, for example, might be one possible screening device <italic>if</italic> pious women were sufficiently more willing to accept this demand than less pious women were. An increase in such ‘screening’ strategies by men, particularly in locales where less pious women cover, would be consistent with the theory.</p></fn>

<p>If piety is a continuous variable, some moderately pious women who would have been able to credibly signal their piety in previous decades likely will not adopt the more conservative clothing styles and behaviors necessary to convey piety and will be seen as similar to less pious women on the marriage market.

This observation is consistent with the argument if it reflects less pious women’s adjustment. When truly pious women find credible (i.e., sufficiently costly) signals, less pious women seeking to mimic them should abandon restrictions they adopted that are now insufficient to signal piety.
