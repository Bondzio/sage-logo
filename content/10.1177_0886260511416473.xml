<abstract>
<p>Studies suggest that stalking victimization may have a serious mental health impact. The present article investigates gender differences in mental health and possible mediating effects of stalking victimization in a community sample. The study includes a postal survey of 665 German community residents on the experience of stalking and various mental health indicators. In a majority of mental health scales, women score poorer than men, and a higher percentage of women fulfill criteria for a current mental disorder and used psychotropic medication. However, effects of gender decrease to a nonsignificant level when stalking victimization is entered into the respective models. Furthermore, associations of stalking victimization with poor mental health, psychosocial functioning, and use of medication are largely comparable across gender.</p>

<p>Epidemiological studies on the prevalence of stalking are scarce and so far confined to countries from Western Europe, the United States, and Australia. These studies suggest that about 7%-19% of women and 2%-10% of men are being stalked at least once in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416473">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416473">Basile, Swahn, Chen, &amp; Saltzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416473">Budd &amp; Mattinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing, Kuehner, &amp; Gass, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511416473">Purcell, Pathé, &amp; Mullen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260511416473">Stieger, Burger, &amp; Schild, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511416473">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260511416473">Walby &amp; Allen, 2004</xref>). A recent survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416473">Baum, Catalano, Rand, and Rose (2009)</xref>, representing the largest population-based study on stalking to date (<italic>N</italic> = 65,000), reports that during a 12-month period, 2% of the female and 0.7% of the male U.S. residents aged 18 or older were victims of stalking. Mental health correlates of stalking victimization, mainly assessed retrospectively by victims’ subjective responses to the experience of stalking, include a broad range of complaints, such as increased fear, nervousness, headaches, sleep and appetite disturbances, and depressive symptoms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260511416473">Sheridan, Blaauw, &amp; Davies, 2003</xref>). Others have found a high proportion of stalking victims to display significant levels of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (55%-60%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511416473">Kamphuis &amp; Engelkamp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511416473">Pathé &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>) and general symptom levels indicating the presence of a diagnosable psychiatric disorder (78%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511416473">Blaauw, Winkel, Arensman, Sheridan, &amp; Freeve, 2002</xref>). However, most of these studies surveyed selected victim samples, recruited by mental health clinics, victim services, and other self-referrals, so that conclusions regarding the mental health impact of stalking in the general population may not be easily drawn.</p>
<p>Only few studies have employed standardized symptom assessments to compare stalking victims and nonvictims from population-based samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511416473">Davis, Coker, &amp; Sanderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416473">Kuehner, Gass, &amp; Dressing, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511416473">Purcell, Pathé, &amp; Mullen, 2005</xref>). According to these studies, lifetime victims of stalking were more likely to report depression and psychotropic drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511416473">Davis et al., 2002</xref>) and high levels of mental health symptoms indicating psychiatric caseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511416473">Purcell et al., 2005</xref>) than nonvictims.</p>
<p>The Mannheim Stalking Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416473">Kuehner et al., 2007</xref>) is the first community-based study on stalking prevalence and mental health impact of stalking victimization in Germany. It is also the first community study on stalking worldwide that used a structured assessment for diagnosing the most frequent mental disorders according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511416473">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). This study revealed poorer current psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>) and higher prevalence rates of mental disorders and comorbid mental disorders according to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> in lifetime victims of stalking as compared to nonvictims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416473">Kuehner et al., 2007</xref>). Rates of several specific disorders were increased, with the most robust associations identified for major depression and panic disorder. Furthermore, a higher percentage of victims reported current use of psychotropic medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416473">Kuehner et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show consistent gender disparities in the prevalence of major mental disorders in the community, with higher rates of anxiety, depressive, and somatoform disorders and more frequent use of psychotropic drugs in women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416473">Alonso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416473">Barbui &amp; Percudani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511416473">Jacobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511416473">Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Robert, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511416473">Kuehner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0886260511416473">Wittchen &amp; Jacobi, 2005</xref>). Different explanations for the gender difference in mental health have been proposed, ranging from biological to personality and psychosocial theories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511416473">Kuehner, 2003</xref>). Gender-role-oriented views emphasize the impact of certain stress factors to which women are more exposed to than men in many cultures, such as role strain, interpersonal violence, and lack of power (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0886260511416473">Watts &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>). For example, women are at greater risk of particular forms of violence than men, including family violence, and sexual assault and harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511416473">Murray &amp; Powell, 2009</xref>). A number of studies have directly looked at the role of psychosocial stressors related to the female gender role as possible mediators in the relationship between gender and mental health. In this context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511416473">Cutler and Nolen-Hoeksema (1991)</xref> showed that 35% of the gender difference in depression rates may be attributed to childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Other studies have identified inequity in social roles and role load as relevant explaining factors for the higher prevalence rates of depression in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511416473">Maier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260511416473">Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, &amp; Grayson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260511416473">Seedat et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416473">Cortina and Pimlott-Kubiak (2006)</xref> demonstrated that sexual violence history mediated the association between gender and PTSD symptom severity in a large sample of victims of partner aggression.</p>
<p>In concordance with previous population-based studies from Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416473">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416473">Basile et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416473">Budd &amp; Mattinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511416473">Purcell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260511416473">Stieger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511416473">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260511416473">Walby &amp; Allen, 2004</xref>), the Mannheim study revealed a much higher risk for women to fulfill criteria for lifetime stalking victimization (17.3%) than for men (3.7%, Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.5, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.8-10.9; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>). In the present article, we want to investigate possible gender differences in mental health outcomes and whether stalking victimization would mediate possible links between gender and mental health in the Mannheim study. A psychosocial stressor such as stalking may be regarded as a mediator if it is unequally distributed across gender and affects the closeness of the association between gender and mental health. To demonstrate such a mediator effect, the following conditions should be fulfilled (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416473">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511416473">Kraemer, Stice, Kazdin, Offord, &amp; Kupfer, 2001</xref>): (a) Gender predicts mental health outcome, (b) gender predicts stalking victimization, (c) stalking victimization predicts mental health outcome, and (d) the effect of gender on mental health outcome diminishes or disappears when stalking victimization is entered into the respective model. In the present study, we hypothesize that the effect of gender on mental health will at least be partly mediated by stalking victimization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether the strength of possible associations between stalking victimization and mental health would be different in men and women. It has been proposed that women are at greater risk for developing common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder due to their increased psychological vulnerability toward psychosocial stressors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511416473">Becker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511416473">Breslau, Chilcoat, Kessler, Peterson, &amp; Lucia, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511416473">Mazure &amp; Maciejewski, 2003</xref>), whereas others have questioned this assumption. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511416473">Pimlott-Kubiak and Cortina (2003)</xref> identified no significant interaction of gender and exposure to interpersonal aggression on mental health outcomes in a large population-based sample of 16,000 individuals and concluded that their findings argue against theories of female victims’ greater psychological vulnerability toward pathological outcomes. Therefore, we will also investigate whether men and women differ in their extent of mental health problems in response to stalking. We hypothesize that the closeness of associations between stalking victimization and mental health outcomes will be similar across gender.</p>
<p>To summarize, aims of the present study are (a) to assess effects of female gender on several mental health aspects in the Mannheim study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416473">Kuehner et al., 2007</xref>), (b) to assess possible mediator effects of stalking victimization on the associations between gender and mental health, and (c) to assess whether the relationships between lifetime stalking victimization and mental health outcomes would be different in men and women.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>General methods of the Mannheim stalking study are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>). In brief, a postal survey was sent to a stratified random sample of 1,000 men and 1,000 women aged between 18 and 65 years living in Mannheim, a German city of 330,000 inhabitants (<italic>N</italic> = 174,275 in the age range of 18 to 65 at the time of the survey, according to the annual statistics of the city of Mannheim). Sampling frame was the local residents’ register of Mannheim, which includes the addresses of all registered citizens and of which the stratified sample was chosen by a computerized random procedure. Since this study aimed at investigating a community-based epidemiological sample, no further inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied.</p>
<p>Each person received a package by mail that contained a letter explaining the purpose of the study along with study questionnaires and a prepaid return envelope. Packages were returned anonymously. Fifteen persons could not be contacted because they had moved to an unknown address. Of the remaining, 679 (34.2%) persons responded. Four questionnaires were excluded because they contained obvious false claims of victimization due to psychotic symptoms, indicated by respective handwritten amendments on the questionnaires. Ten questionnaires lacked information about the gender of the respondent, leaving 665 valid questionnaires available for the present analyses. Mean age of this sample was 42.5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.3), and more women than men completed the survey (<italic>n</italic> = 392; 58.9% of the responders were female). The age distribution of the sample was nearly identical to that of the population where it was drawn from, with a maximal deviance of only 3.3% in the youngest age group (18-27 years; Mannheim population: 20.5% [35,726/174,275], present sample: 17.2% [114/665]).</p>

<sec id="section3-0886260511416473">
<title>Instruments and Stalking Definition</title>
<p>The survey included questions on demographic variables and a 51-item self-report stalking questionnaire assessing the experience of harassing intrusions. The stalking questionnaire was adapted from an instrument developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260511416473">Voss and Hoffmann (2002)</xref>. A list of 18 items asked about possible intrusive behaviors, such as unwanted communication by letter, fax, or e-mail, pursuing, loitering nearby, invading one’s home, property damage, or sending unsolicited goods. Respondents who indicated any incidence of harassment were asked to answer additional questions relating to the stalking incidence, for example, on the nature, duration, and frequency of the intrusions, and their relationship with the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Our stalking definition restricted the presence of stalking to more than one episode of harassment that had to be present over a minimum of 2 weeks, involved more than one form of intrusive behavior, and provoked at least some fear. This definition followed criteria of stalking victimization used in international stalking research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511416473">Pathé &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>). Lifetime incidence was calculated as the percentage of participants who had experienced stalking according to the above-mentioned criteria at any time during their lives. In all, 78 participants (11.6% of 675) fulfilled the lifetime criteria of stalking victims (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416473">Dressing et al., 2005</xref>). In this epidemiological survey, we did not consider other types of traumas that participants may have experienced, such as childhood abuse or domestic violence.</p>
<p>Current <italic>psychiatric morbidity</italic> was assessed in all study participants by the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511416473">Spitzer, Kroenke, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>; German version—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511416473">Loewe, Spitzer, Zipfel, &amp; Herzog, 2001</xref>), a questionnaire specifically developed for use in primary care and other nonpsychiatric settings. Algorithms are provided for common mental disorders according to DSM-IV at threshold and subthreshold syndrome levels (somatoform disorder syndrome, major depressive syndrome, other depressive syndromes, panic syndrome, other anxiety syndromes, eating disorder syndromes, and probable alcohol abuse or dependence). Diagnosis-specific symptom scales allow quantitative severity assessments of somatoform, depressive, anxiety, alcohol-related symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. In the present study, these quantitative symptom scales were used as syndrome-specific mental health outcomes, together with a single item asking about perceived psychological impairment due to mental health problems (Likert-type scale, 0 = not at all impaired, 1 = slightly impaired, 2 = moderately impaired, 3 = extremely impaired). We further included a binary variable indicating whether the criteria for at least one current DSM-IV mental disorder according to the PHQ were fulfilled (0 = no, 1 = yes), and a question on current use of psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression, or other stress-related symptoms (0 = no, 1 = yes). The PHQ has been evaluated extensively in a large number of studies. It has shown good reliability and criterion and construct validity and is recommended as a psychometrically sound and efficient diagnostic instrument in both clinical and epidemiological settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511416473">Spitzer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511416473">Loewe, Kroenke, Herzog, &amp; Grafe, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511416473">Loewe et al., 2004b</xref>). In the present sample, internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alpha) of the PHQ symptom scales were as follows: depressive symptoms (9 items) α = .88, anxiety symptoms (22 items) α = .81, somatic symptoms (13 items) α = .76, alcohol-related symptoms (5 items) α = .57, stress burden (10 items) α = .76. Due to its low internal consistency, we excluded the quantitative alcohol-related symptom scale from further analyses.</p>
<p>Participants were also asked to complete the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416473">Bech, 2004</xref>). The WHO-5 is a psychometrically sound short self-report scale for measuring current <italic>psychological well-being</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416473">Bech, 2004</xref>). It consists of five items assessing positive mood, vitality, and general interest over the past 2 weeks. The WHO-5 has proved a good screening instrument for depression in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511416473">Henkel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511416473">Loewe et al., 2004b</xref>). In the present sample, the internal consistency of the WHO-5 amounted to α = .90.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Simple group comparisons of binary variables were performed using Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> statistics, simple group comparisons of continuous variables with t tests. In the total sample, an overall multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to assess global gender differences in symptom scores. Dependent measures were the WHO-5 psychological well-being score and the depression, anxiety, somatoform, and current stress exposure scores derived from the PHQ. Separate one-factorial analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed on associations of gender (Analysis 1) and victim status (Analysis 2) with individual quantitative PHQ symptom scores and with the PHQ impairment score. In a third series of analyses, we included gender, victim status, and their interaction, to assess their associations with symptom—and impairment scores when considered jointly. Hierarchical logistic regressions with gender and victim status as predictors were similarly performed in case of binary dependent variables (PHQ diagnosis, current use of psychotropic medication). Due to small cell sizes and to avoid multiple testing, we did not compare groups on individual PHQ diagnoses but on an aggregated level indicating presence of any current PHQ diagnosis (0 = no, 1 = yes). Since victims were significantly younger than nonvictims (M = 38.8, SD = 11.8 vs. M = 42.9, SD = 13.5), t(104.9) = 2.06, p = .04, we adjusted for age in all victim-related analyses.</p>
<p>In this context, a cautionary note has to be added about the small sample of male victims in the present study (n = 10, see below). For example, when using t tests or univariate analysis of variance (ANOVAs), the present sample size allows only large effects (d = 0.80) to be detected with adequate error probability (p &lt; .05, one tailed) and marginal statistical power (1 – ß = .75). To interpret the data adequately, it is therefore particularly important to account for the actual amplitude or effect size of group differences identified in the respective analyses.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 15.</p>

<p>A substantially higher proportion of women claimed to have been subjected to repeated harassment at some point during their life that met our stalking criteria listed above. In total, 68 women and 10 men fulfilled the criteria for lifetime victimization of stalking. Female victims were younger than male victims, whereas their education levels were comparable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416473">Table 1</xref>). In the majority of cases in both male and female victims, the stalker was personally known by the victim. Women were nearly exclusively stalked by a man. In contrast, more than 50% of the men were stalked by a female perpetrator. Only one male victim was stalked by his ex-partner, and the respective proportion in the female victim sample amounted to one third. About a third of both male and female victims had been physically attacked by the stalker. Substantially more female than male victims had been sexually harassed or assaulted. However, due to the small sample of male victims, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Finally, 10% of male victims and 22.1% of female victims had reported an offence to the police, and 20.0% of male and 28.1% of female victims sought professional help in response to mental health problems connected with stalking victimization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416473">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the first set of analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416473">Table 3</xref>, Analysis 1), gender was included as the only predictor. In these analyses, gender significantly predicted all dependent measures (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In the second set of analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416473">Table 3</xref>, Analysis 2), stalking victimization history (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) instead of gender was entered into the respective analyses. Victim status was a powerful predictor for all criterion measures. In the third set of analyses, gender, stalking victimization history, and their interaction were entered into the respective models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416473">Table 3</xref>, Analysis 3). In these analyses, gender lost its power to significantly predict any of the assessed symptom and impairment scores. By contrast, victimization history continued to predict highly significant current general well-being (WHO-5), depressive, somatoform, anxiety, and other stress-related symptoms as well as psychosocial impairment.</p>
<p>With one exception, the interactions of gender and victimization history did not significantly predict symptom and impairment scales (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416473">Table 3</xref>, Analysis 3, last row). In other words, the associations of victimization history with mental health symptoms and associated impairment were very similar for men and women. This was true for general well-being scores, somatoform, anxiety, and stress-related symptoms and for impairment of psychosocial functioning. In addition, we compared the subsample of male and female victims by ANCOVAs (covariate age) on these scales directly to be able to identify possible meaningful effect sizes that would have missed statistical significance due to the small sample of male victims. These analyses revealed negligible effects (eta<sup>2</sup>or η<sup>2</sup>) of gender on the respective outcomes in the victim sample (WHO-5: η<sup>2</sup> = 0.001, somatoform symptoms: η<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, anxiety scores: η<sup>2</sup> = 0.004, stress-related symptoms: η<sup>2</sup> = 0.001, impairment scores: η<sup>2</sup> = 0.004).</p>
<p>Post hoc ANCOVA analyses on the significant Gender X Victim Status interaction on the depression subscale of the PHQ revealed that male and female victims reported similar levels of depressive symptoms (male victims: <italic>M</italic> = 10.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.40; female victims: <italic>M</italic> = 7.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.25) <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 0.76, n.s., η<sup>2</sup> = 0.018). In contrast, female nonvictims (<italic>M</italic> = 4.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.98) reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than male nonvictims (<italic>M</italic> = 3.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.93) <italic>F</italic>(1, 570) = 4.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, though the effect size of this difference was negligible (η<sup>2</sup> = 0.008).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined associations of gender, stalking victimization, and mental health outcomes within the context of a population-based survey. For the assessment of mental health problems, we used standardized instruments that allowed to assess quantitative symptom and impairment levels as well as psychiatric caseness status of respondents according to DSM-IV and use of psychotropic medication.</p>
<p>In this community sample, women reported higher levels of depressive, anxiety, somatic, and stress-related symptoms and a more severe global impairment of psychosocial functioning due to mental health problems. We also identified a higher-point prevalence of any mental disorder and a more frequent use of psychotropic medication in women. Higher rates of anxiety, depressive, and somatoform disorders and a higher use of psychotropic medicine in women are consistently found in community studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416473">Alonso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416473">Barbui &amp; Percudani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511416473">Jacobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511416473">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511416473">Kuehner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0886260511416473">Wittchen &amp; Jacobi, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Deleterious health consequences of interpersonal violence are well documented by controlled research in various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416473">Campbell, 2002</xref>). According to a number of studies, particularly depression and posttraumatic stress disorders are the most prevalent mental health sequelae (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511416473">Golding, 1999</xref>). In parallel, a growing number of stalking studies report associations between lifetime stalking victimization (not restricted to partner stalking) and current mental health (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511416473">Kuehner et al., 2007</xref>). However, none of these studies has investigated a possible link between stalking victimization and gender differences in mental health indicators. To clarify such a possible connection was one of the main aims of the present study.</p>
<p>In the Mannheim study, the lifetime prevalence of stalking victimization was much higher in women (17.3%) as compared to men (3.7%). These data correspond closely to results from larger population-based surveys reporting stalking lifetime prevalence rates of 7% to 19% in women and 2% to 10% in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416473">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416473">Basile et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416473">Budd &amp; Mattinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511416473">Purcell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511416473">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260511416473">Walby &amp; Allen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, it should be noted again that population-based studies on stalking have so far exclusively been conducted in Western countries. Studies from non-Western countries and cross-cultural stalking research would be important to identify whether stalking is a global phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260511416473">Sheridan et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, cultural differences probably affect perception and disclosure of stalking experiences. Possible effects of ethnic variables on stalking prevalence rates have been studied in the large U.S. surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416473">Baum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511416473">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511416473">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). For example, Tjaden and Thoennes found that the stalking risk varied for women of different racial and ethnic minorities, whereas there was no difference in stalking prevalence among men of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. In this survey, Asian and Pacific Islander women were at lowest, and American Indian/Alaska Native women were at highest risk. The authors note that traditional Asian values emphasizing close family ties may have led to an underreporting of stalking in Asian women, whereas the high rates among Native American women coincide with their overall higher risk of violence. In a reanalysis of these survey data, Dietz and Martin showed that Black female stalking victims were less likely to report fear in response to the stalking compared to White female victims and concluded that Black women may fail to experience stalking as a threat because of their less protected life circumstances in general. In consequence, these women may less often report their experiences to law enforcement, which may foster an undercount of crimes against Black women, in addition to offering them less protection and support. These examples indicate that estimates of stalking prevalence and respective gender-related differences appear to be substantially affected by specific ethnic and sociocultural norms. These issues have mainly been neglected in stalking research to date.</p>
<p>In the present study, we sought to elucidate whether the experience of stalking victimization could contribute to the explanation of the association between gender and mental health in our community sample. In fact, stalking victimization clearly affected the relationship between gender and several mental health–related aspects. When entered into the respective models, victim status showed significant associations with all mental health outcomes, whereas the respective effect of gender decreased to a nonsignificant level. Therefore, we confirmed our hypothesis that stalking victimization would mediate the relationship between gender and mental health outcomes. In this context, stalking can be regarded as a behavior that is related to male and female gender roles, often as a part of a larger pattern of interpersonal aggression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511416473">Murray &amp; Powell, 2009</xref>). For example, it has been shown that victims, police, and lawyers sometimes hesitate to label stalking as criminal because the tactics of stalkers match the normative script for heterosexual courtship, requiring gender performances that facilitate men’s ability to monitor, pursue, and entrap women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416473">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511416473">Dunn, 2002</xref>). Others have described stalking as an example of gender asymmetry in control-motivated instrumental violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260511416473">Stark, 2007</xref>), and it has been proposed that particularly those cultural values emphasizing male control and female subordination, together with familial solidarity, may encourage men to stalk women in dating and intimate relationships as a way of maintaining control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511416473">Morewitz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, our study revealed that the mental health impact of stalking victimization was largely comparable for men and women. Thus, our data do not indicate that women were generally more psychologically vulnerable toward this kind of harassment than men. These results correspond with findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511416473">Davis et al. (2002)</xref> from the large National Violence Against Women survey who also found that negative health consequences of being stalked were similar for men and women. In the present study, the only significant interaction of gender and victim status on mental health outcomes was identified for depressive symptoms. Here, it was shown that though male and female victims reported similar depression levels, depression scores were higher among female nonvictims as compared to their male counterparts. Thus, it may be concluded that though victimization history failed to completely explain the higher depression levels in the female subsample, depression levels were comparably elevated in male and female stalking victims. These findings again coincide with results by Davis and colleagues who reported similar patterns of associations of stalking victimization with depressive symptoms, development of a chronic mental illness, and various forms of drug use in men and women.</p>
<p>To summarize, our data confirmed high prevalence rates of stalking in the community, with women having a much higher probability to become a victim of stalking at any time during their lives than men. Stalking victimization was clearly associated with poor long-term mental health outcomes. More women fulfilled lifetime criteria for stalking victims than men, and this aspect explained substantial parts of their higher symptom levels and more frequent use of psychotropic medication.</p>
<p>Our study clearly indicates that stalking victimization is related to poor long-term psychological health. Although a causal effect of stalking victimization on mental health cannot be firmly demonstrated within the context of a cross-sectional study, distinct predictive effects have been reported from longitudinal studies on other risk factors related to victimization, such as childhood sexual abuse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511416473">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260511416473">Weiss, Longhurst, &amp; Mazure, 1999</xref>), bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416473">Arseneault, Bowes, &amp; Shakoor, 2009</xref>), or interpersonal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416473">Campbell, 2002</xref>). Similarly, possible mechanisms that might explain the impact of stalking victimization on mental health have so far not been systematically investigated. Such processes may involve both physiological changes and cognitive distortions in response to the traumatic experience. For example, stalking victims may develop chronic hyper- or hypo-activation of the biological stress system and/or unfavorable cognitive schemes associated with low self-esteem, self-devaluation, and feelings of helplessness. These consequences, in turn, are established risk factors for the development of mental disorders. We conclude that due to its high prevalence and association with poor mental health stalking should be regarded as a major public health issue. As a consequence, there is an obvious need for victim-oriented psychosocial interventions that should particularly aim at preventing chronification of mental health problems associated with stalking victimization, and this appears true for both male and female victims. We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416473">Kuehner &amp; Weiss, 2005</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511416473">Mechanic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511416473">Mullen, Pathé, &amp; Purcell, 2000</xref>) have previously described possible treatment strategies with stalking victims. In general, all psychological interventions that have proven successful in the treatment of stress-related disorders may be suitable, though the specific situation of victims has to be considered. Victims are frequently exposed to a variable and/or chronic course of psychic stressors related to the stalking experience. Confrontative strategies, for example, which are very helpful in the treatment of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders, are contraindicated when the stalking is currently ongoing. Here, supportive strategies, psychoeducation, risk assessment, crisis management, and initiation of contacts with other relevant services are of central importance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511416473">Mechanic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511416473">Mullen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260511416473">Pathé, Mullen, &amp; Purcell, 2001</xref>). In addition, psychotherapy should aim at reducing burdensome symptoms, inappropriate avoidance behavior, guilt feelings, and other dysfunctional cognitions and at helping the victim to develop strategies to increase feelings of self-confidence and mastery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511416473">Kuehner &amp; Weiss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511416473">Mechanic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511416473">Mullen et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. A weakness shared with previous epidemiological studies is that larger surveys can employ only rather simplistic measures for a complex phenomenon such as stalking. More comprehensive surveys, particularly those using face-to-face or telephone interviews may afford the opportunity to screen more carefully, to ask probing questions, and to check ambiguous responses more detailed. Another important limitation is the study’s low response rate of less than 40%. Low response rates in stalking surveys may lead to an overestimation of prevalence if victims are more motivated to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260511416473">Sheridan et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, victims may experience such a survey as more intrusive than nonvictims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511416473">Pathé &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>), resulting in an underestimation of prevalence. Although such systematic errors cannot be ruled out completely, the prevalence rate of stalking identified in our study matches very closely to those reported from other countries using similar stalking definitions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416473">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416473">Basile et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416473">Budd &amp; Mattinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511416473">Purcell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511416473">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260511416473">Walby &amp; Allen, 2004</xref>), making it rather unlikely that a larger sampling bias has seriously affected our findings. Nevertheless, the low response rate represents a significant flaw of this study.</p>
<p>Connected herewith, the male victim sample in this study was very small. This problem may have prevented us to identify possible differences between men and women. In fact, the statistical power to detect gender-related differences in our victim subsample was unsatisfactorily low. Although we could demonstrate that the nonsignificant differences regarding mental health indicators in male and female victims were accompanied by negligible absolute effect sizes, larger-scale representative community-based studies are urgently needed to validate these findings. Larger studies would also allow a more in-depth evaluation of possible gender-related differences in relevant covariates, such as the relationship between stalker and victim, and the type, severity, and duration of stalking behaviors, for which the present victim sample was clearly too small.</p>
<p>A further important limitation is that due to the nonexperimental, cross-sectional design of our study we could not establish a clear causal pathway between gender, stalking victimization, and mental health. In their discussion of conceptual definitions of risk factors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511416473">Kraemer et al. (2001)</xref> refer to the mediator model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416473">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260511416473">Rothman and Greenland (1998)</xref>, where a mediator (e.g., stalking victimization) is a variable that explains how and why another variable (e.g., gender) affects the outcome (e.g., mental health). The authors conclude that “although the ideal posits causal association between the constructs, we cannot infer causality from observation of association in a sample, particularly when using nonexperimental data. We can usually only say that what we observe is consistent with what we would expect to see if a causal path leading from A to B to O (outcome) were in force” (p. 852). In the present study, we have proposed that due to gender role-related aspects, women are at higher risk for becoming stalking victims and that their higher victimization risk may at least in part explain the poorer mental health of women in our community sample. However, in contrast to the obvious temporal precedence of gender over victimization, a temporal linkage among stalking victimization and mental health cannot be firmly established within the framework of a cross-sectional study. For example, it could be argued that even if the stalking experience is dated in the past and mental health is assessed in the present, this does still not prove that stalking causes mental illness. Since common mental disorders tend to be chronic or recurring, illness-related situational factors or behaviors may contrariwise have posed the victim at higher risk for being stalked. Studies have shown that mental disorders predispose to a variety of adverse outcomes, including victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511416473">Cuevas, Finkelhor, Ormrod, &amp; Turner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511416473">Teplin, McClelland, Abram, &amp; Weiner, 2005</xref>). Another possibility could be that mental health problems and stalking victimization are interrelated and linked in a vicious circle. To clearly disentangle whether stalking victimization is a cause, consequence, or correlate of impaired mental health, large-scale longitudinal studies with follow-ups in initially nonaffected individuals are required that would allow to directly assess predictive net effects of stalking victimization on future mental health outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, though we have restricted our survey to the assessment of stalking experiences, stalking is frequently part of a larger pattern of physical and psychological abuse in relationships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511416473">Davis &amp; Frieze, 2000</xref>), and it may also be important to identify both unique effects of stalking victimization on mental health and those shared with other forms of relational aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511416473">Mechanic, Weaver, &amp; Resick, 2008</xref>). In this context, further individual and psychosocial risk and protective factors that possibly mediate the association between stalking victimization and mental health, such as personality traits, coping styles, and social support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511416473">Johnson &amp; Kercher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511416473">Kamphuis, Emmelkamp, &amp; Bartak, 2003</xref>), should be included to better understand the associations between stalking victimization and mental health in men and women.</p>
