<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813a"><title>Peter Anderson, <italic>The Francoist Military Trials: Terror and Complicity, 1939–1945</italic>, Routledge: Abingdon, 2009; 219 pp., 9 illus.; 9780415800068, £80.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Since the Law of Historical Memory was passed by the Spanish Parliament in October 2007 there has been renewed interest among historians in the practices of prosecution and repression conducted during the early years of Franco’s dictatorship. Anderson’s book is a welcome addition to this trend, focusing on the military trials between 1939 and 1945, which many consider the darkest years of Franco’s rule.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating account of how tensions within a community exacerbated Franco’s ‘juridical monstrosity’ in the immediate post-war period, particularly in the Andalusian district of Pozoblanco, where his primary research his based. Anderson convincingly argues that rather than being an additional element in the construction of the authoritarian state, the military trials constituted an essential pillar which sustained and strengthened dictatorial rule in Spain from the very outset. Military trials were not isolated from daily life in post-war Spain. On the contrary, this study demonstrates that the proceedings fed upon the resentment and complicity of the local community. The repressive tool manufactured by Francoist elements found the acquiescence and co-operation of wide sectors of society without which, the author claims, the repressive arm of the dictatorial state would have not been as effective or sustained for such a long period. He illustrates his claims with vividly portrayed and richly described incidents and trials taking place in Pozoblanco in the early 1940s. Research findings in Pozoblanco lead Anderson to establish the broad social origins of those taking part in the denunciations, questioning traditional arguments made by some historians regarding the moderating role played by old-guard conservatives during the trials (96). Rather than a superstructure imposed from above, he maintains, the military trials were a repressive process driven from below: ‘in many ways, the military courts became a parade ground for civilians … and so became a forum for the exercise [sic] consent as well as coercion’ (107). Far from declining in the late 1940s, Anderson concludes, the repressive practices incorporated into the juridical system were perpetuated in the Tribunals of Political Responsibility and the Special Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism. Rather than easing the pressure on political enemies, the new tribunals presented new opportunities for social coercion and denunciation.</p>
<p>Some of the claims of the book seem, perhaps, a bit far-fetched. The book opens with a rather simplified version of the mounting social divisions leading to the Spanish Civil War. This version appears to be rather selective and does not adequately reflect the complexity of feelings, anxieties and social tensions which are so carefully examined in the third part of the book. Right-wing forces are portrayed as being principally responsible for the radicalization of Spanish politics in the 1920s and 1930s, a period which several historians have described perhaps more aptly by taking also into account crucial shortcomings within the left-wing forces, which are mostly overlooked here (the incident of Casas Viejas, for example, is not mentioned). Similarly, rather than a ‘crucial worm’s eye view of the post-war Francoist repression around the country’, the book provides a more modest, although equally interesting, example of the terrifying logic of judicial repression at a municipal level in southern rural areas in Spain, where primary research in the Pozoblanco district proves to be enormously valuable. There does not seem to be enough evidence, however, to imply that practices in Pozoblanco were commonplace in other parts of Spain or that this evidence is sufficient to allow comparison with national trends in other countries. The author’s claims – namely, that practices in this district strongly suggest a similar and applicable <italic>modus operandi </italic>in the rest of Spain – tend to simplify to some extent the multi-dimensional nature of repression in post-war Spain, particularly between northern and southern rural areas and also urban and rural environments. The use of the evidence of Pozoblanco to make international comparisons (between Francoist and Nazi German practices, for example) remains problematic for the same reasons. The book’s real contribution to scholarship lies in contributing to a number of detailed studies that have focused on a province-specific aspect of Franco’s early dictatorship.</p>
<p>Anderson’s book will be useful for those who want to know more about repression practices conducted in Andalucía in the early times of Franco’s dictatorship. His detailed exploration of the social complicities that lay behind the military trials will also offer important clues to understanding why coming to terms with the past in Spain continues to prove so difficult.</p>
