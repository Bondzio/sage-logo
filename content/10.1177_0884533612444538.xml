<p>Product (drug) shortages have had a significant impact on the healthcare system, particularly on patients and clinicians. This has been especially true with patients requiring parenteral nutrition (PN). The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) has dealt with PN product shortages in the past on behalf of its members and their patients. However, the shortage severity and duration have made dealing with the PN product shortages in 2010–2012 extremely challenging.</p>

<p>Product (drug) shortages have had a significant impact on the healthcare system, particularly on patients and clinicians. This is demonstrated in responses from a survey conducted by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) in June 2011. One clinician noted potassium issues: “The most recent problem has been the inability to obtain potassium phosphate and potassium acetate. We have had to purchase potassium phosphate from a compounding company at 18 times the cost, been unable to replace phosphorus levels and have had to use potassium chloride even for patients with elevated chloride levels.” A home parenteral nutrition (PN) consumer with advanced mitochondrial disease who requires extraordinarily high doses of magnesium states, “If my blood level of magnesium gets too low, I will suffer seizures, cardiac events and eventually cardiac arrest. I will die . . . having a complicated, multi-systemic disease means that I rely on numerous medications and medical products for survival. This makes me much more vulnerable to recalls and shortages than the average person. I have become aware of just how far reaching this drug shortage crisis is. I have also become aware of new depths of my own fragility. My health is precarious in ways that I hadn’t before realized. Now, there is little security in the fact that I live with a life-threatening disease, in America. There are people dying because of drug shortages . . . in America.” Patients and healthcare providers alike are concerned and wonder why and how long these shortages will persist. The purpose of this article is to</p>

<title>Overview of Drug Shortages</title>
<p>Historically, a healthcare professional would only occasionally be affected by a drug shortage and would periodically need to modify their practices with select patients until the normal supply was resumed. This has changed dramatically. Drug shortages have affected every drug product category, including chemotherapeutic, antimicrobial, and gastrointestinal agents. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 178 new drug shortages for 2010. The majority (132) of those involved sterile injectable drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444538">1</xref></sup> In 2011, this increasing trend continued, especially for older sterile injectable drugs. The University of Utah Drug Shortage Information Service reported 267 new shortages identified in 2011 (E. Fox, personal communication, January 2012). In June 2011, the American Hospital Association (AHA) survey of hospital chief executive officers reported 99.5% of hospitals experienced 1 or more drug shortages in the last 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444538">2</xref></sup> Also reported was that 82% of hospitals have had delayed treatment, and more than half were not always able to provide patients with recommended treatments. In another recent study, the costs of drug shortages in time and labor were estimated at $216 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444538">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many drug products have been affected, but nearly all PN products have been affected by the shortage. This is of utmost concern to A.S.P.E.N. members and other healthcare practitioners caring for patients requiring PN. Since the summer of 2010, a considerable amount of A.S.P.E.N. staff and volunteer time and resources have been spent in responding to the shortages listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612444538">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The causes of drug shortages are multifactorial and best explained by the pharmaceutical supply chain provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612444538">Figure 1</xref>. The major players involved with this chain are the suppliers of raw materials, the manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, health system (including practitioner), and patient (often referred as the beneficiary). Health system formularies and group purchasing practices affect the price a manufacturer will receive for its drug product and tend to lower corporate profit margins. As noted by President Obama, while signing the executive order on drug shortages, “just 5 hospital groups purchase nearly 90% of needed medicines and only 7 companies manufacture the vast majority of supply.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444538">4</xref></sup> Significant outside forces are the payors (pharmacy benefit managers) and regulators such as the FDA. Also from a negative perspective (especially financially, as noted in the A.S.P.E.N. clinician’s comments earlier) is the “gray” market or wholesalers who purchase drugs at volume or from sources outside the usual pharmaceutical supply chain and sell them at significantly higher prices than usual health system contracts.</p>

<p>The most notable reasons for drug shortages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612444538">Table 2</xref>) affecting PN are manufacturing issues, discontinuation of product, problem with supply of raw materials for product, and a limited capacity to meet growing demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444538">1</xref></sup> Manufacturers often use production lines for multiple products or have areas (ie, chemotherapy) for specific drugs to be made. As a consequence, quality issues in the production line often affect many products. Manufacturers must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are monitored by their own quality control and regulated by the FDA. A quality problem with production is a serious matter and could lead to discontinuation of drug manufacturing on that line until the process can be brought in to compliance. Unfortunately, when this occurs in a sector of the pharmaceutical market that has consolidated (only a few manufacturers produce drugs in the area, such as PN), the other manufacturers are not able in a timely manner to ramp up their production to meet the national supply. A supply chain issue occurs when there is a decrease in drug supply related to “just-in-time” inventory practices. Most health institutions have adopted this method of inventory and cost control arranging with wholesalers to store their drug supplies, thereby limiting their own response to drug shortages since their supplies are quickly depleted. This reliance on the wholesaler to “ration” a depleted drug supply leads healthcare institutions to hoard product or consider sources outside the usual supply chain. Drug manufacturers also use the just-in-time inventories so they have limited inventory to distribute if supply or product line issues arise with a drug. Another consequence of a consolidated market of PN products is when a manufacturer decides to discontinue a low-margin product and to move out of that line of business. In some situations, this may leave only 1 manufacturer for the product involved— predisposing to a drug shortage.</p>

<title>Collaboration</title>
<p>In response to A.S.P.E.N. surveys, respondents made it clear to staff and volunteer leaders that communication of accurate and timely information about a drug shortage is a priority. To this end, it was very important to develop key relationships with other stakeholders in the drug shortage crisis. The collaboration between the groups presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612444538">Figure 2</xref> has been important to A.S.P.E.N.’s continued response to drug shortages. The manufacturer provides reasons for the shortage as well as an estimated (difficult in establishing an accurate timeline) time for the product to return to the market. A.S.P.E.N. experts serve as a resource to the manufacturer related to appropriate product use (such as repackaging into smaller volumes to conserve supply) during a shortage. A.S.P.E.N. experts make recommendations for constraining the PN product supply, working with the manufacturer and the American Society for Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), together publicizing this information.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0884533612444538-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>The ASHP has been an important partner with A.S.P.E.N. Information on product shortages is shared with the ASHP, which has its own drug shortage section and website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ashp.org/DrugShortages/Current/">http://www.ashp.org/DrugShortages/Current/</ext-link>). The website reports on current shortages and how to report shortages that will be investigated.</p>
<p>The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ismp.org">www.ismp.org</ext-link>) has worked diligently with A.S.P.E.N. when safety issues related to PN products occur. It provides a mechanism to report errors and collaborate with A.S.P.E.N. in developing recommendations for safe practices that result from their investigations of harmful PN events.</p>
<p>Finally, A.S.P.E.N has had a frequent and continual dialogue with the FDA concerning product shortages. The FDA is responsible for safe drug and product use in the United States. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/default.htm</ext-link>) is responsible for the Drug Shortage Program (DSP; <email>drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov</email>). The DSP addresses potential or actual shortages of drugs that have significant impact on public health. Key to this dialogue has been timely information on how the shortages have affected patients and clinicians. The FDA uses the definition of <italic>medically necessary products</italic> (“any drug product that is used to treat or prevent a serious disease or medical condition for which there is no other adequately available product that is judged by medical staff to be an appropriate substitute”) as criteria for taking action on a product in short supply. It is this area where A.S.P.E.N. staff, volunteer leaders, and members have the most influence. Information from guidelines, standards, and educational texts are used to educate clinicians at the FDA on the proper role and use of PN products. But most important, the information from clinicians about the type of patients seriously affected by the shortage as well as the impact on health systems has greatly assisted A.S.P.E.N. in linking the shortages to real-life situations and accentuated the real or potential safety issues created by PN product shortages. The actions the FDA may take once a product is deemed “medically necessary” is to request other manufacturers of the product to ramp up production to meet the national needs, review products in quarantine, and devise ways that they may be released for use (ie, release product with particulate matter with the requirement that it be filtered). The FDA can request a manufacturer to resume making a product it had discontinued. Finally, the FDA may look into the importation of the product from outside the United States.</p>

<title>PN Product Shortages: Evolution of the A.S.P.E.N. Strategy</title>
<sec id="section4-0884533612444538">
<title>History of PN Product Shortages</title>
<p>Product shortages are not a new problem for A.S.P.E.N. The most notable shortage handled by A.S.P.E.N. has been multivitamins. During periods of inadequate supply, the omission of vitamins from PN has resulted in patients developing deficiencies, several of which have led to serious morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444538">5</xref></sup> During the first multivitamin shortage in the 1980s, the president of A.S.P.E.N. sent a letter to the members notifying them of the shortage and alerting them to the potential for thiamine deficiency. It was not until the mid-1990s when another multivitamin shortage occurred. At that time, a task force was created and charged with the task of making recommendations on how to manage the shortage. These recommendations were disseminated to other professional societies and healthcare practitioners as well as A.S.P.E.N. members. At that time, A.S.P.E.N. was instrumental in working with the FDA and other groups to import a multivitamin product from Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444538">6</xref></sup> Subsequently, frequent multivitamin product shortages pulled the task force back to work on recommendations. This was difficult to coordinate and was not very timely. As a result, in 2007, A.S.P.E.N. leaders decided that recommendations for managing adult and pediatric multivitamin shortages needed to be formalized and posted permanently on the A.S.P.E.N. website. These recommendations are periodically reviewed and updated. This same process was used for PN shortages that have occurred over the past year with the recommendations on electrolytes, which were published in the <italic>Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612444538">7</xref></sup> Last, it has become apparent that the drug shortages are not going to be resolved quickly and may very well be a permanent problem, which A.S.P.E.N. needs to continually address. As such, a subcommittee of the Clinical Practice Committee was created to specifically deal with PN product shortages. This history is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0884533612444538">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<p>The reasons for PN product shortages are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533612444538">Table 3</xref>. Having only a few manufacturers of PN products has been a consistent reason for product shortages throughout A.S.P.E.N.’s history. Manufacturing issues have also plagued PN product availability with an occasional issue with the raw material supply. Another problem is that PN products are a low-profit margin and require complex manufacturing processes that are easily targeted by manufacturers to discontinue the product line.</p>

<title>PN Product Shortage Impact on Patient Safety</title>
<p>In response to clinician and professional society concerns, the ISMP conducted a survey of its newsletters’ readers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444538">8</xref></sup> Respondents reported several issues with safe drug use. An increasing volume of critically important medications was in short supply. This led to the use of less desirable (poorer efficacy and/or worse safety profile) unfamiliar alternatives predisposing to worse or adverse patient outcomes. Errors or worse outcomes were reported due to the absence or delay in treatments directly related to drug shortages. Thirty-five percent of respondents reported errors in the categories of near misses (error occurred but did not reach the patient), 25% reported that they reached the patient but did not cause harm, and 20% reported they had observed a harmful event due to drug shortages. Because of the voluntary nature of reporting errors, it is believed this reflects a conservative estimate of the actual rate of errors that have occurred. A key issue reported by the respondents was the lack of advanced warning and preparation for a drug shortage and the precious clinical hours that were reallocated to time-consuming activities required to manage shortages.</p>
<p>The complexity of PN formulations predisposes patients to many real or potential safety issues when products are not available (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533612444538">Table 4</xref>). The worst possible outcome was reported in spring of 2011 when 9 patients (19 were infected) died from <italic>Serratia</italic> infections linked to a contaminated amino acids product manufactured by an infusion pharmacy because commercial amino acids were in short supply.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444538">9</xref></sup> In addition to the complications outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533612444538">Table 4</xref>, infectious problems are likely when venous catheters are used more frequently for electrolyte replacements.

<title>A.S.P.E.N.’s Response to Current Product Shortages</title>
<p>The approach to fat emulsion and amino acids shortages in 2010 was similar for A.S.P.E.N. as that outlined for multivitamin shortages. A task force was already working on alternative intravenous (IV) fat emulsions of which select members were quickly able to provide recommendations for constraining the IV fat emulsion (IVFE) supply (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nutritioncare.org/Professional_Resources/Guidelines_and_Standards/Guidelines_and_Standards_Library_Features/">http://www.nutritioncare.org/Professional_Resources/Guidelines_and_Standards/Guidelines_and_Standards_Library_Features/</ext-link>). Later in the summer of 2010, a task force was created to deal with a short amino acids supply (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nutritioncare.org/Index.aspx?id=5646">http://nutritioncare.org/Index.aspx?id=5646</ext-link>). A particular concern with this product shortage was the potential for patients not to receive PN when indicated and the reality that this would result in a period of starvation for that individual.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, as more shortages became known and as they continued to persist, the Shortage Subcommittee of the Clinical Practice Committee was formed. This subcommittee consisted of professionals representing pediatric and adult patient care as well as hospital and home (or alternate care) environments. Their charge is to develop a rapid response to PN product shortages with recommendations posted on the A.S.P.E.N. website or published in A.S.P.E.N. journals after Clinical Practice Committee and Board of Directors review and approval (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0884533612444538">Table 5</xref>). Having these recommendations available in this manner allows A.S.P.E.N. to provide timely, accurate recommendations for conserving a product in short supply and alternatives to IV nutrient therapy. Important to PN product shortages is that during periods of constrained supply, the use of doses that do not meet nutrition needs or of oral nutrition products that may not have adequate absorption in this patient population predisposes patients to nutrition deficiencies. Therefore, recommendations, especially for electrolytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444538">6</xref></sup> and trace elements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612444538">11</xref></sup> include parameters for increased monitoring and recommendations for treatment of a deficiency.</p>

<sec id="section7-0884533612444538">
<title>A.S.P.E.N. Partnerships</title>
<p>A.S.P.E.N. has made a significant commitment to providing accurate, timely, and comprehensive advice about PN product shortages. Publishing these recommendations on the A.S.P.E.N. website and in journals as well as sharing them with organizational partners in this endeavor—ASHP, ISMP, FDA, and our members—is a new venture in disseminating the expert advice of A.S.P.E.N. volunteers. It is realized that continual communication is needed by all of the collaborators involved with PN product shortages. The current priority is to work with the FDA on requests to (1) investigate the national patient supply and demand for IV electrolyte and trace element injections in the United States, (2) determine if measures can be taken to increase the supply and distribution of these critical products, and (3) consider importation of internationally produced IV electrolyte and trace element injections for temporary approval in the United States and in this process consider therapeutic equivalence the same as generic equivalence for electrolytes that provide the proper component (ie, phosphorus) but are a different salt than is currently available in the United States.</p>

<title>Drug Shortage Legislation</title>
<p>On January 31, 2012, U.S. Representatives John Carney (D-DE) and Larry Bucshon (R-IN) introduced the Drug Shortage Prevention Act to address the scarcity of certain pharmaceutical drugs—and those specific to PN—in the marketplace. The new legislation (HR 3839), which A.S.P.E.N. endorses, mandates expedited review of drugs vulnerable to shortage to prevent shortages in the first place and requires the FDA to a use more refined regulatory process that addresses manufacturing problems without instigating drug shortages.</p>
<p>As noted by President Obama’s October 2011 executive order, the legislature must act quickly on the legislation introduced by Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota and Senator Casey from Pennsylvania. The Preserving Access to Life Saving Medications Act of 2011 (S 296) addresses drug shortages, requiring manufacturers to notify the FDA about manufacturing problems or when a drug product will be discontinued. The FDA definition of “medically necessary” is also revised in this bill. The House companion bill (HR 2245), introduced by Representative DeGette of Colorado, amends the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to provide the FDA with improved capacity to prevent drug shortages. A manufacturer of a drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) and marketed in interstate commerce shall notify the secretary of a discontinuance or interruption in the manufacture of such drug. This transitions a voluntary process to one that is mandatory with established time limits. A.S.P.E.N. members and constituents are encouraged to contact their legislators to express support for these bills.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Despite the time-intensive and continued support of the collaborators in the drug shortage crisis, it is not likely PN product shortages will be resolved soon. However, important aspects of the process to deal with drug shortages have been gleaned and a strategy put in place to effectively deal with issues that the short supply of products has on all participants in the drug supply chain.</p>
<p>The drug shortage crisis is a threat to the safest pharmaceutical supply chain in the world and has affected the access to and quality of PN therapy in the U.S. health system. A.S.P.E.N. has worked diligently in developing a collaboration of healthcare professionals, societies, and regulatory bodies as well as manufacturers to avoid major problems in the care of patients requiring PN. The focus has been on providing timely and accurate information about a product shortage and disseminating that information via the A.S.P.E.N website and/or journals as well as to other professional societies, regulatory agencies, and manufacturers of PN products.</p>
<p>Clinicians can and must do their part to put a face on the issues created by PN product shortages. Communication is key, and errors and issues must be reported. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0884533612444538">Table 5</xref> for website resources and reporting mechanisms.</p>
