<p>This innovative and thought-provoking book is a mature reflection upon a profound and perennial question for contemporary expositors of sacred scripture: how to bridge the gap between biblical exegesis and its application for the faith community. Andrews frames his work as a ‘self-conscious dialogue between contemporary theology and Augustine’ (p. 1) and attempts to allow Augustine’s voice to be heard ‘from the outside’ in such dialogue. In considering what exactly Augustine has said, Andrews draws our attention to his hermeneutical treatise <italic>De doctrina christiana</italic>. Fittingly, chapter one surveys its history and context while wading into scholarly interpretations regarding its scope and nature. The first part of the treatise, Books one to three, was written early on in Augustine’s episcopate (396/7) and deals primarily with the way of understanding scripture (<italic>modus inveniendi</italic>). Yet, Andrews argues, it is integrally united to Part two, Book four, composed in 426/7 and concerning rhetoric, the way of presenting (<italic>modus proferendi</italic>) what has been understood. What has been learnt from scripture, in other words, is to be shared. Andrews, following Karla Pollmann, further insists that <italic>De doctrina</italic> is not simply a manual for clergy, or more broadly, for cultivating a Christian culture—but a hermeneutical work that includes a turn to rhetoric. In short, it concerns ‘the interpretation and communication of scripture <italic>in the context of the church’</italic> (italics in original, p. 39).</p>
<p>Having sketched the history and context of <italic>De doctrina</italic>, Andrews turns to its contents in chapter two. Book one considers the <italic>res</italic> or the ‘what’ of scripture. The <italic>signa</italic>, discussed in Books two and three, point to the <italic>res</italic> of scripture. Determining whether the <italic>signa</italic> are literal or figurative (Book three) leads to Augustine offering his <italic>caritas</italic> criterion. A periciope failing to lead to the double love of God and neighbour when read literally is to be understood figuratively. To do this a ‘grasp of the whole (the <italic>regula fidei</italic>) and a grasp of how one relates to God and neighbour (the <italic>regula dilectionis</italic>)’ are needed (p. 58). Book four, building upon the works of Cicero and Tyconius, is a natural conclusion, says Andrews, since one reads scripture in order to ‘turn back to the church and deliver that understanding’ (p. 62).</p>
<p>Chapter three, ‘Theological Hermeneutics,’ considers what <italic>De doctrina</italic> says about the nature of theological hermeneutics as a discipline. Here Andrews develops an innovative and insightful schema: categorizing hermeneutics in temporal terms (<italic>a priori</italic> or <italic>a posteriori</italic>) rather than in spatial terms (general or local). The move serves to capture <italic>when</italic> hermeneutical theory is used. An <italic>a priori</italic> approach, for instance, develops a theory of interpretation <italic>prior</italic> to the act of interpretation. <italic>A posteriori</italic>, on the other hand, begins with the tradition of biblical interpretation within the Church and only <italic>after</italic> a problem with interpretation arises, does the theologian appeal to a rule of interpretation. The scepticism engendered by Schleiermacher, who declared ‘misunderstanding results as a matter of course,’ has meant that the discipline of hermeneutics in the modern era has relied primarily on <italic>a priori</italic> hermeneutics, given the assumption that misreading is common and existing tradition potentially untrustworthy (p. 72). In contrast, general and local hermeneutical concerns are engaged by Augustine, but are subordinated to practice. That is to say, the bishop of Hippo embeds philosophical ideas, like <italic>res</italic> and <italic>signa</italic>, into his theology, thus ‘making philosophy a field to be plucked, not a master to serve’ (p. 112). Anthropologically, the act of interpretation serves not so much to give new knowledge, but ‘corrects sin and moves the person closer in love to God and neighbour’ (p. 113).</p>
<p>Building upon this temporal schema, Andrews fleshes out the communitarian aspect of Augustine’s treatise in chapter four, ‘Community, Hermeneutics, Rhetoric.’ Augustine’s <italic>a posteriori</italic> hermeneutic presupposes a specific community, and as such can more readily ‘hold together the two-part act of interpretation: understanding the biblical text and delivering that understanding to a certain group of people’ (p. 156). Misunderstanding of the text can occur, but for Augustine, rules of interpretation ‘are more like helpful mid-flight correctives’ not prior constraints on the process of understanding itself (p. 158). The <italic>regula fidei</italic> and the <italic>regula dilectionis</italic> thus structure his reading with their focus on the true faith and correct living.</p>
<p>In chapter five, ‘<italic>De doctrina christiana</italic> and the Theological Interpretation of Scripture,’ Andrews furthers the dialogue between Augustine and scholarship by considering the new movement of theological exegesis. He homes in on the work of Stephen Fowl, a contemporary scholar who also places emphasis on the bi-directional relationship between community and scripture. Both Augustine and Fowl, for instance, construe scripture in functional terms, espouse the value of virtue in the community, and uphold the authority of the Old Testament. They differ, nonetheless, in that Augustine concedes less to the community as a locus of authority. For him, virtue is a product of interpretation in the community, whereas for Fowl, it is the opposite: the virtue of the community affects interpretation. For Augustine, scripture and community are not simply in relationship—they are caught up in the divine economy of salvation. Thus authority is located neither in text nor community, but ‘in the <italic>interaction</italic> of God revealing his will to humans who write books that are read by others in order to teach and persuade God’s church to do his will’ (italics in original, p. 205).</p>
<p>Andrews concludes his examination of Augustine and contemporary theological hermeneutics with summary remarks about the practice of scriptural interpretation. He includes the need for the use of philosophical tools, the incorporation of rhetoric, an appreciation of scripture’s <italic>telos</italic> and human anthropology, the Christological character of scripture, and the unity of the <italic>regula fidei</italic> and <italic>dilectionis</italic> as key components to theological interpretation. Above all, such interpretation has the sermon as its paradigm. This means that interpreting the <italic>res</italic> of scripture is not an end in itself but part of drawing people closer together in love of God and neighbour—and such a paradigm works only with <italic>a posteriori</italic> hermeneutics.</p>
<p>Andrews’s work is not only a lucid engagement with Augustine and biblical interpretation, but also succeeds in breathing new life into the discussion of the relationship between scripture and the church, premodern and contemporary exegesis, and above all, interpretation and application. Further sampling of Augustine’s own sermons method would certainly enhance the book, but given its scope, the near exclusive focus on <italic>De doctrina</italic> is understandable. Anyone interested in hermeneutics and scripture will undoubtedly benefit from reading this book.</p>
