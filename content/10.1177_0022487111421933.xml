<abstract>
<p>In the United States, about one third of new teachers being hired are drawn from alternative certification programs. One way to address controversy about the differences among the training experiences of teachers in traditional certification programs, fast-track alternative programs, and residency alternative programs is to examine teacher reports of how well prepared they felt in their 1st year of teaching. Using data from the 2003-2004 Schools and Staffing Survey, this study addresses questions about 1st-year teachers’ backgrounds and about their feelings of preparedness. Alternatively certified teachers are found to feel somewhat less well prepared than traditionally certified teachers. Results also show that 1st-year teachers who have fewer types of education coursework and shorter field experiences feel less well prepared than teachers whose pedagogical preparation is more complete. Finally, this study suggests important implications for program administration and policy and for methodologies used in teacher education research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the United States, 20% to 30% of new teachers are drawn from alternative certification (AC) programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487111421933">National Research Council, 2010</xref>). According to the <italic>National Center for Alternative Certification</italic>’s annual survey, this proportion is vastly larger than it was 20 years ago, when virtually all new teachers completed traditional programs and only a few thousand were alternatively certified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487111421933">Feistritzer, 2007</xref>). As generally described, these programs differ from traditional certification (TC) programs in the following ways: They often seek to fill specific geographic or content area teacher shortages, they seek to enlarge the teaching pool by recruiting a diverse group of prospective teachers, and AC program participants can become full-time teachers after as little as a few weeks of preservice training.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the dramatic increase in the number of AC programs. First, AC programs were originally developed in the 1980s to address teacher shortages by facilitating the entry of individuals into the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487111421933">Murnane &amp; Steele, 2007</xref>). Second, critics of traditional university-based teacher education argued that local teacher preparation programs, run by school districts, could supply teachers better matched to the needs of school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111421933">Grossman &amp; Loeb, 2008</xref>). A third reason for the increase is that prospective teachers value the incentives associated with AC programs, in particular the opportunity to bypass most certification prerequisites, such as coursework, and quickly begin teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111421933">Johnson &amp; Liu, 2004</xref>). However, differences between the training experiences of teachers in TC and AC programs could have implications for teachers’ feelings of preparedness, their persistence in the teaching profession, and ultimately, student outcomes. Thus, to understand the first link in the chain that connects teacher preparation to student outcomes, it is necessary to ask whether program features play a role in determining feelings of preparedness among alternatively certified teachers. In this article, this question is addressed with analyses of data from the 2003-2004 <italic>Schools and Staffing Survey</italic> (SASS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022487111421933">
<title>Background and Context</title>
<p>For decades, addressing the problem of teacher shortages has been one of the most critical policy concerns in U.S. education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487111421933">Murnane, Singer, Willett, Kemple, &amp; Olsen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487111421933">Murnane &amp; Steele, 2007</xref>). This shortage has been driven in part by the costs of preparing to teach through a traditional route, coupled with modest salaries as compared with other professions, and the possibility of poor working conditions–each a barrier for those who would otherwise want to teach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111421933">Johnson &amp; Liu, 2004</xref>). The <italic>traditional route</italic> to teaching is that prospective teachers complete an undergraduate or graduate teacher-education program prior to becoming certified to teach, and then, they teach full-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487111421933">Dangel &amp; Guyton, 2005</xref>). Typically, therefore, TC programs consist of 1 to 2 years of preparation prior to teaching.</p>
<p>By contrast, prospective teachers who choose a fast-track <italic>alternative route</italic> typically receive 4 to 8 weeks of preparation prior to beginning full-time teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487111421933">Johnson, Birkeland, &amp; Peske, 2005b</xref>), and their teacher training then continues part-time during their 1st year(s) as full-time teachers. This more rapid entry into the profession has the potential to be more attractive to prospective teachers than even direct monetary incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487111421933">Liu, Johnson, &amp; Peske, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, a new model of teacher education, the teacher residency model, came to national attention because it was included in President Obama’s education plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487111421933">Klein, 2008</xref>). This model, which is usually classified as an alternate route, blends aspects of the traditional and alternative approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487111421933">Berry et al., 2008</xref>). It capitalizes on the notion of a multilevel career path for teachers where novices get extensive support from master teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022487111421933">Troen &amp; Boles, 2003</xref>). As a result, although residency programs may focus on meeting school district staffing needs, they are different from fast-track AC programs in terms of the extent of the preparation that teachers receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022487111421933">Solomon, 2009</xref>). During their 1st year, resident teachers teach part-time while also receiving part-time training and mentoring, an arrangement that some feel is preferable to fast-track entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487111421933">Hopkins, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0022487111421933">
<title>The Debate About Preparedness</title>
<p>The differences among traditional, fast-track, and residency programs highlight two issues central to current debates in teacher education: the timing of <italic>when</italic> initial teacher preparation should occur and the <italic>content</italic> of that preparation. Recently, the <italic>Committee on the Study on Teacher Preparation Programs</italic> of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487111421933">National Research Council (2010)</xref> stated that “research is badly needed” (p. 174) to compare these pathways to determine whether the participating teachers complete most of their training before or after beginning to teach full-time, to determine what are the specific components of that training, and to understand the effects of different teacher preparation pathways on K-12 student success.</p>
<p>Some researchers argue that the abbreviated preservice preparation of AC teachers leads them to feel less prepared than do TC teachers and contributes to the decision of many AC teachers to leave the profession after a relatively brief time in the classroom. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111421933">Darling-Hammond, Chung, and Frelow (2002)</xref> analyzed results from a 1998 survey of early-career teachers employed in New York City. This often-cited study showed that AC teachers felt less prepared and expressed less of a commitment to remaining in the profession than did TC teachers. If this is true of U.S. teachers nationally, then AC programs fail in their goal of reducing the teacher shortage.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111421933">Darling-Hammond et al. (2002)</xref> study was also an example of how teacher feelings and perceptions are a relevant topic to explore as first step in addressing issues of teacher retention. Assessments of a teachers’ effectiveness can be used to judge teachers’ instructional ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022487111421933">Sindelar, Daunic, &amp; Rennells, 2004</xref>) and can lead a school leader to fire the teacher. However, most teacher turnover is voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487111421933">Marvel et al., 2007</xref>). Increasingly, teachers’ subjective assessments of their impact on student learning, such as whether they feel a sense of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487111421933">Johnson &amp; Birkeland, 2003</xref>), their sense of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022487111421933">Yost, 2006</xref>), and their sense of personal power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487111421933">Moscovici, 2009</xref>), have been found to influence teacher career decisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the persistence of AC teachers in the profession may have important consequences for student achievement because of the role that experience plays in teacher effectiveness. One longitudinal study of teacher preparation pathways in New York City found a modest effect of teacher experience on student outcomes such that some students of 3rd-year AC teachers achieved at similar levels as students of 3rd-year TC teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487111421933">Kane, Rockoff, &amp; Staiger, 2006</xref>). In a second large, multipathway study of student achievement in New York City, D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487111421933">Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff (2009)</xref> found that students had higher achievement if their teacher’s preparation program included a capstone project and careful oversight of student teaching. However, the researchers also found that among the students of 2nd-year teachers, there was no longer an effect of these program features on student outcomes because “1st-year differences converge as teachers acquire relevant knowledge and skills on the job” (p. 430). This result indicates that research on 1st-year teachers, in particular, can illuminate the effects of program features. Moreover, research on student outcomes demonstrates that teachers with less-comprehensive preparation need time to catch up—AC teachers simply cannot acquire skills on the job if they don’t stay on the job.</p>
<p>Taken together, findings on teacher preparation, teacher career decisions, and student outcomes suggest that teachers who have more comprehensive preparation experiences will feel well prepared, will consequently persist in the profession, and, ultimately, will teach more effectively than their less well-prepared colleagues. Yet, despite the fact that AC teachers, on average, have less-comprehensive preparation than TC teachers, there is disagreement in the literature as to whether they feel less prepared than TC teachers. Results from a large study of teachers in Texas showed that AC teachers felt less well prepared than TC teachers for certain teaching tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022487111421933">Zientek, 2007</xref>). However, results from other studies show little or no difference between AC and TC teachers on measures such as their feelings of preparedness or their sense of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111421933">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022487111421933">Tournaki, Lyublinskaya, &amp; Carolan, 2009</xref>). Given this disagreement, in the current study, a large, nationally representative data set is used to investigate whether AC teachers do indeed feel less well prepared than TC teachers.</p>
<p>Feelings of preparedness are relevant to comparisons among teacher education programs but are useful in other comparisons as well. For example, using the 1999-2000 survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487111421933">Boe, Shin, and Cook (2007)</xref> examined feelings of preparedness among special and general educators as a function of the extent of their preparation. In the current study, I capitalize on the additional information on teacher preparation in the 2003-2004 survey to build on work similar to that of Boe and colleagues by examining the relationship between teachers’ feelings of preparedness on the one hand and features of their preparation program on the other hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022487111421933">
<title>The Role of Program Features</title>
<p>The differing results that can be found in the AC literature on teacher preparedness may exist because the professional and empirical situation is complex and because multiple forces impact teacher outcomes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111421933">Grossman &amp; Loeb, 2008</xref>). In one of the most comprehensive studies of feelings of preparedness among AC teachers, a study of participants in 13 AC programs, researchers found that “three elements—the person, the program, and the school—contribute to the teacher’s sense of preparedness during the first year” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111421933">Johnson, Birkeland, &amp; Peske, 2005a</xref>, p. 94). The implication of this complexity is that studies of AC teacher outcomes need to account for differences in teachers’ personal characteristics, for differences in the features of their preparation programs, and for differences in the context of the schools in which they are placed (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111421933">Humphrey &amp; Wechsler, 2007</xref>). However, aside from some of the studies cited thus far, few quantitative evaluations of AC programs have incorporated statistical controls for these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111421933">Grossman &amp; Loeb, 2008</xref>). In the current study, although the primary focus is on the impact of program features on teacher outcomes, this complexity is taken into account.</p>
<p>Of the three critical elements, program features stand out as being particularly important because of their potential impact on teachers’ feelings of preparedness. As for feasibility, the basic features of teacher education programs can be modified by program directors much more readily than can the characteristics of the schools in which teachers are placed. Moreover, program features play a central role in the debate about alternative certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111421933">Cochran-Smith, 2005</xref>) and are a primary feature of state and federal AC policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487111421933">Rice, Roellke, Sparks, &amp; Kolbe, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The debate between proponents of alternative and traditional approaches to certification can be conceptualized as one of “heterodoxy” versus “orthodoxy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022487111421933">Wilson &amp; Tamir, 2008</xref>). AC program proponents argue that teacher preparation programs should focus on the practical, rather than the theoretical, aspects of teaching and emphasize on-the-job learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111421933">Haberman, 2006</xref>). Illustrating this point, in the study mentioned above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111421933">Johnson et al. (2005a</xref>) found that programs differed in terms of the general instructional strategies and subject-specific instructional strategies that teachers were taught, and in the types of clinical experiences in which they participated. In the majority of AC programs, AC teachers receive less practice teaching than do TC teachers and often have different coursework than their TC counterparts (D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487111421933">Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111421933">Humphrey &amp; Wechsler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111421933">Johnson et al., 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>Across the three certification routes, programs may offer very different constellations of program features. Although my analyses do not allow me to examine the impact of teacher residency programs directly, my findings concerning the effects of various program features on subsequent teacher perceptions suggest ways in which a particular certification route may affect teachers’ feelings of preparedness. More importantly, any findings concerning the effects of program features on teacher preparedness may help program administrators make informed program-design decisions, regardless of the overall route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111421933">Cochran-Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111421933">Grossman &amp; Loeb, 2008</xref>). Toward this goal, in the current research, I examined the impact of teacher coursework and the length of practice teaching on 1st-year teachers’ ratings of their preparedness to teach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022487111421933">
<title>The Problem of Selection Bias</title>
<p>To date, studies of teacher certification pathways have been observational, not experimental, and therefore have not been able to support strong statements of cause and effect. Practically speaking, adults cannot be randomly assigned to a career training program. Prospective teachers choose which programs to apply to and program administrators choose whom to accept. This differential selection of AC and TC teachers into their programs, and differences in the personal characteristics of the ensuing groups of AC and TC teachers, prior to training, creates a major hurdle for evaluators. One cannot draw a direct or causal connection between training route and an outcome, like teacher preparedness, without taking the impact of this selection bias into account. In fact, D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487111421933">Boyd and colleagues (2006)</xref> identified selection bias as one of the main methodological challenges in research on alternative pathways. They point out that, for example,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we see that teachers from one route have students who learn more during the year than teachers in other routes, other things being equal, this difference may be because of <italic>either</italic> differences in these candidates’ characteristics when they entered programs <italic>or</italic> differences in the pathways. (p. 162, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although most studies of AC do not address selection bias at all, some researchers have attempted to do so by including multiple covariates in their statistical models to control for observed differences in teacher personal characteristics. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487111421933">Kane et al. (2006)</xref> added covariates that described teacher demographics and academic background in their prediction of student achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487111421933">Luczak (2004)</xref> included similar controls in his investigation of teacher retention. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487111421933">Boyd and colleagues (2005)</xref> added a covariate describing years of teaching experience in their prediction of student achievement.</p>
<p>A second method of addressing selection bias in observational data, one used in the current study, is <italic>propensity score matching</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487111421933">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1985</xref>). Although propensity score matching is an innovative procedure used commonly in other disciplines, to my knowledge, no one has used this tool in the evaluation of AC programs. Propensity score matching deals with selection bias using a two-stage analytic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487111421933">Murnane &amp; Willett, 2010</xref>). In the first stage, the <italic>propensity score</italic>, that is, the probability that an individual will be selected into a particular treatment, is estimated based on a set of carefully selected covariates that are hypothesized to describe the selection process. In the second stage, the estimated propensity score is then used to match participants in the control (TC) and treatment (AC) groups so that the control/treatment comparison is purged of the bias captured in the covariates in the selection model. Thus, in this study, I used propensity score matching to sort AC and TC teachers who had similar selection characteristics into balanced groups (called <italic>blocks</italic>) to statistically adjust for some of the selection bias in my analyses.</p>
<p>Propensity score matching offered two advantages over the more standard analytic approach of simply controlling for selection covariates in the principal statistical models. First, with propensity score matching, one models the selection process explicitly and then uses the consequences of the matching in a more robust and nonparametric way to adjust the final estimate of the treatment effect for any potential observed bias. Second, the approach allows one to take into account the impact of multiple selection variables simultaneously, and this may be more efficient for subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>A limitation of propensity score matching is that the method does not control for unobserved or unobservable differences among prospective teachers entering the different programs. As such, it may not eliminate the selection bias entirely. Nevertheless, propensity score matching can strengthen causal inferences, particularly when there is detailed knowledge of the selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487111421933">Diaz &amp; Handa, 2006</xref>). Consequently, I believe that the method has an important role to play in evaluations of teacher preparation, by strengthening the causal inferences that can be made about the impact of preparation programs on teacher outcomes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0022487111421933">
<title>Survey</title>
<p>I analyzed data from the <italic>Public School Teacher Questionnaire</italic> of the 2003-2004 SASS. The SASS is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of more than 40,000 teachers that is administered approximately every 4 years by the <italic>National Center for Education Statistics</italic> and the U.S. Census Bureau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022487111421933">Tourkin et al., 2007</xref>). I analyzed the 2003-2004 SASS data (first released in March, 2007) because the more recent survey (the 2007-2008 administration, first released in June, 2009) includes fewer questions about the content of teacher preparation programs. As the survey was taken after the implementation of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, the teachers worked in a similar policy environment to current teachers. Future research should analyze the 2010-2012 surveys to incorporate recent events, such as the economic downturn of 2008.</p>
<p>To collect the data, the U.S. Census Bureau contacted and distributed surveys to teachers in elementary, middle, and high schools in each state and the District of Columbia in the fall of 2003. The U.S. Census Bureau also conducted in-person follow-up interviews to collect survey responses from those teachers who had not responded initially.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022487111421933">
<title>Respondents</title>
<p>The SASS provided a sample of teachers that is particularly well suited to addressing my research questions. First, it afforded a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of AC in a nationally representative sample of 1st-year teachers. The sample was limited to 1st-year teachers to capture the teachers’ ratings of their preparation after they began teaching but close to their participation in their preparation program. In addition, at the time of the survey, the teachers had at least a bachelor’s degree, and they were regular, full-time, part-time, or itinerant teachers, or they were long-term substitutes.</p>
<p>Second, the stratified sampling design of the SASS provided a sample of 1st-year teachers with a broad array of personal characteristics who had completed, or were pursuing, their teacher certification through a variety of routes. There were three main certification routes: the traditional route (TC), the alternative route (AC), and the waiver route (neither TC nor AC). My final sample of approximately 1,690 1st-year teachers included the teachers who had pursued either a TC (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 1,220) or an AC (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 470) route. Note that all unweighted sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10, as required by the Institute of Education Sciences. At about 28%, the proportion of AC teachers in my sample was similar to proportions reported elsewhere. By definition, AC teachers continue to receive training from their preparation programs during their 1st year (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111421933">Haberman, 2006</xref>). However, because state certification criteria vary, some of the AC teachers in my sample had completed their AC programs while others were still enrolled.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>At a 1996 conference, Erling Boe recommended that SASS designers select topics that have been the subject of policy, such as teacher preparation, and presciently remarked that “such topics are likely to be of policy interest in the next decade or two” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022487111421933">U.S. Department of Education, 1996</xref>, p. 190). Subsequently, for the 1999-2000 survey and the 2003-2004 survey, teachers were asked more questions about their preparation than they had been asked previously. My analysis focused primarily on questions from two sections on the 2003-2004 survey: teachers’ educational background and their certification and training.</p>
<sec id="section11-0022487111421933">
<title>Two routes to certification</title>
<p>The principle question predictor for each research question is <italic>AC</italic>, a dichotomous variable coded 1 for teachers who had completed or were attending an AC program for their certification and coded 0 for teachers who had completed a TC route to certification. I used two main questions to distinguish between AC and TC teachers. Respondents were asked whether they obtained their teaching methods coursework through an alternative program and whether they have a provisional certificate as a result of being in an AC program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022487111421933">
<title>RQ 1: Personal characteristics as selection predictors</title>
<p>In the first stage of my propensity-matching strategy, I predicted membership in either an AC or a TC program using carefully chosen covariates that typically distinguish who self-selects into, or is recruited for, an AC program. My selection predictors describe two of the types of personal characteristics that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111421933">Shen (1997)</xref> identified in his influential article as being important in recruitment and selection into AC programs: <italic>teacher demographics</italic> and <italic>teacher background</italic>. I describe each group of predictors briefly below.</p>
<p>The teacher demographics measures included age (whether aged 27 or older), gender (an indicator for whether a teacher was male), and race (to distinguish White, Black, Latina/o, Asian-Pacific Islander, and American Indian teachers). For teacher background, I included a measure of undergraduate major and an indicator for prior career. As AC programs seek to bring people into the profession who would not otherwise become teachers, they recruit prospective teachers who were not education majors. In particular, because the shortage of mathematics and science teachers is so acute, AC programs tend to recruit people who majored in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Therefore, I represented teacher academic background by a vector of three dichotomous indicators (education major, STEM major, and other major). I also included an additional covariate to reflect the prior work experience of the trainees because “career changers” generally may have had professional backgrounds that differed from those of recent college graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487111421933">Marinell, 2009</xref>). In addition, career changers entering into AC programs may have traits that influence their ability to capitalize on the preparation they received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487111421933">Dickar, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In my statistical models, I refer to the above personal characteristic predictors collectively as the vector, <italic>SELVECTOR</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section13-0022487111421933">
<title>RQ 2 and RQ 3 outcome: A feeling of preparedness index</title>
<p><italic>PREPARED</italic> is a continuous teacher-preparedness index that I created by compositing teacher responses to five questions on the SASS. Teachers were asked how well prepared they felt to (a) handle classroom management or discipline, (b) use instructional methods, (c) teach subject matter, (d) assess students, and (e) select and adapt curricular materials in their 1st year of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487111421933">National Center for Education Statistics, 2003</xref>). Teachers responded to each question on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all prepared</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very well prepared</italic>). A principal components analysis indicated that the five questions were similarly weighted. Therefore, to form the composite, I averaged teacher responses across items. A Cronbach’s α of .84 indicated that the scale was reliable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022487111421933">
<title>RQ 3 question predictors: Program features</title>
<p>The SASS survey allows researchers to examine a number of features of teachers’ certification programs and of their experiences in their 1st year of teaching. Based on my review of the literature, I selected two program features on which to focus: the types of coursework that teachers had received and the extent of their practice teaching. I coded them as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0022487111421933" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>CURRICULUM</italic>: It is a dichotomous variable coded 1 for teachers whose preparation included coursework in how to select and adapt instructional material, 0 otherwise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>THEORY</italic>: It is a dichotomous variable coded 1 for teachers whose preparation included coursework in learning theory or psychology appropriate to the age of the students they taught, 0 otherwise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>METHODS</italic>: It is an ordinal variable where teachers indicated the number of courses they had completed, or were taking, that were focused on teaching methods or teaching strategies. This variable was originally coded to have five ordered levels. However, I recoded the responses dichotomously because the major distinction for preparedness was between teachers with zero to two methods courses (coded 0) and teachers who had taken three or more methods courses (coded 1).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>PRACTICE</italic>: It is an ordinal variable indicating (in weeks) the length of the practice teaching that the teacher had received. I coded this variable to have four ordered levels—none, 1 to 7 weeks, 8 to 11 weeks, and 12 or more weeks.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022487111421933">
<title>Three types of covariates</title>
<p>Because teacher outcomes are known to be sensitive to school context, I included nine measures of school and teaching context, grouped into three types of covariates: measures of community context, of school type and size, and of organizational context. First, I sought to account for the effect of community context by including covariates to describe the urbanicity of the school district and the poverty level of the students. An interaction term for these two variables was also included. Three variables related to the school type and size were included as follows: a categorical school-type variable with three levels—elementary, secondary, and combined (schools with both elementary and secondary grades); the student–teacher ratio at the school; and the school size (a measure of enrollment).</p>
<p>I also controlled for three characteristics describing the organizational context: whether the teacher had planning time with other teachers, the extent to which teachers at the school reported coordinating their work, and the extent to which teachers at the school reported that the principal communicated with them about instruction. I included indicator variables for subject specialty, with teachers teaching general elementary subjects as the reference. In my statistical models, I refer to all of these school predictors collectively as the vector, <italic>SCHOOLVECTOR</italic>.</p>

<title>RQ 1: Differences in the personal characteristics of AC and TC teachers</title>
<p>I used two analytic techniques to address this question. First, I estimated the percentages of teachers with various personal characteristics in each program, adjusting the values so that they represented population percentages, and I tested differences in percentages using a design-based <italic>F</italic> statistic. Next, as part of my estimation of propensity scores, I fit the following logistic regression model to predict whether teacher <italic>i</italic> in school <italic>j</italic> had pursued certification through an AC program:</p>

<p>where each parameter in vector <italic>G</italic> describes the effect of a particular personal characteristic on the probability that an individual would select into or be selected for an AC program.</p>
<p>In subsequent analyses (to address RQ 2 and RQ 3), I then used each teacher’s propensity score, that is, her or his fitted probability of selection into an AC program, to adjust for selection bias. In these analyses, I grouped participants into six homogeneous “blocks” based on their propensities of selection and designated their membership using a vector of indicator variables, <italic>BLOCK</italic>, each of which was coded 1 if the teacher was a member of that block, 0 otherwise. In each of these blocks, the propensity scores and the selection characteristics were “balanced”—that is, equal, on average, across the TC and AC groups, as required by the propensity score–matching technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487111421933">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1985</xref>).</p>

In addition, κ represents the effect of various amounts of practice teaching. By estimating each of these parameters, I could summarize the effect of program features on the extent to which a teacher feels prepared, controlling for type of certification, selected school characteristics, and propensity block.</p>
<p>As additional steps, three potential sources of bias were addressed: missing data, the nesting of teachers within schools and states, and the timing of the data collection. For most missing data on the SASS, the Census Bureau used one of five procedures to determine a likely response. I used information from other parts of the survey or univariate imputation for addressing any remaining holes in the data set. I used the survey routines (svy) in the Stata 10 statistical program to account for the complex sampling design of the SASS survey. Finally, I controlled for when the teacher completed the survey to address the fact that 1st-year teachers may experience different challenges at different times during the school year, affecting their ratings of their preparedness.</p>

<p>The personal characteristics of AC teachers differed from those of the TC teachers in a number of ways. Demographically, a greater percentage of AC teachers were older (58% vs. 42%) and male (31% vs. 22%). In terms of racial diversity, proportionately fewer AC teachers were White (70% vs. 83%) and a higher percentage of AC teachers were Latina/o (15% vs. 7%). These results confirm prior research, which showed that AC programs are acting to diversify the teaching force to some extent (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022487111421933">Zeichner &amp; Schulte, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of academic background, only 20% of AC teachers had their primary undergraduate major in a K-12, education-focused field, such as elementary education, secondary education, special education, or other education (such as counseling). More than half of TC teachers (58%) majored in one of those fields. A more liberal definition of having an academic background in education would include those who majored in English as second language/bilingual education, health or physical education, and vocational/technical education as well as any other individual who received a bachelor’s degree from a college’s department or school of education. Using this expanded definition, 46% of AC teachers had education-related undergraduate preparation and 78% of TC teachers had this type of preparation. This latter statistic is close to results found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111421933">Cohen-Vogel and Smith (2007)</xref>, who analyzed data from the 1999-2000 SASS. In all, the percentages of teachers with particular background characteristics differed between the AC and TC groups.</p>
<p>The types of comparisons mentioned previously are common in TC research. However, these single-variable comparisons do not tell us whether personal background characteristics, taken together, describe selection into AC or TC programs. If personal background characteristics are in fact part of the criteria that determine selection into an AC program, then we would expect to find a statistically significant difference in the odds that a particular teacher would pursue certification through an AC route as compared with those odds for a teacher who did not share her or his background. As I will describe next, for many of the background characteristics, there were differences between groups in their odds of pursuing an AC route.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022487111421933">Table 2</xref>, I present a fitted logistic regression model describing selection into an AC program versus a TC program, as a function of selected personal characteristics of the teacher. For each predictor, I list parameter estimates, standard errors, and approximate <italic>p</italic> values. In the final column, I antilog the parameter estimates to provide fitted odds ratios. As can be seen from this final column, the fitted odds that a Latina/o teacher would pursue an AC route rather than a TC route were 2.2 times the odds that a White teacher would do the same. Reflecting a shortage area that AC programs target, the fitted odds that a teacher who had majored in one of the high-need STEM fields would pursue an AC versus a TC route were 5.3 times the odds that a teacher with an education-focused major would do the same.</p>

<p>In addition, the fitted odds that a career changer would pursue an AC route rather than a TC route were 4.6 times the odds that a noncareer changer would make the same choice. This latter difference is larger than what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111421933">Shen (1997)</xref> found in his analysis of the 1993-1994 SASS, perhaps because AC programs have become more numerous overall and more widely available to career changers in particular. In all, these results show that AC programs disproportionately attract prospective teachers with backgrounds in high-need STEM subjects and those who had been working in other careers.</p>
<p>To adjust for selection bias, I used each teacher’s fitted probability of selection into an AC program to group participants into five blocks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022487111421933">Table 3</xref> shows a simplified description of teachers in each propensity score block, including the percentage alternatively certified and the personal characteristics of most of the teachers in the block. As can be seen from the table, teachers’ probability of selection into an AC program ranged from being very low for first career, White, education majors (Block 1) to being very high for older, male, teachers of color who had come to teaching from other careers (Block 5). The block variables were used as controls in subsequent analyses, starting with the examination of differences in feelings of preparedness.</p>

<p>My second research question asked whether AC teachers feel less well prepared than TC teachers. Results of this study show that AC teachers do feel somewhat less well prepared than their TC counterparts. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022487111421933">Table 4</xref>, I present a fitted tobit regression model describing the extent to which 1st-year teachers feel prepared to teach as a function of whether they are alternatively certified or traditionally certified, controlling for propensity block, school context, subject specialty, and the date of survey completion. The parameter estimate associated with the main effect of certification route indicates that, on average, the preparedness scores of AC teachers are .24 points lower than those of TC teachers (<italic>p</italic> = .003, <italic>d</italic> = .42).

<p>In the sample, preparedness scores range from 1 to 4, with a score of 2 representing “somewhat prepared” and a score of 3 representing “well prepared.” The predicted preparedness score for TC teachers is 3.02 points. This is the marginal estimate, given AC = 0, and other variables held at their sample means. The predicted preparedness score for AC teachers, however, is 2.78 points. This is also the marginal estimate.</p>
<p>Recall that the preparedness index was calculated by averaging teachers’ feelings of preparedness across five tasks. Linking the estimated difference in preparedness to teachers’ responses on five teaching tasks, this means that a prototypical AC teacher might feel well prepared on four of five tasks, whereas a prototypical TC teacher might feel well prepared on all five tasks, on average, holding personal background and school context constant.</p>

<title>The impact of coursework</title>
<p>The 2003-2004 SASS asked whether teachers received three types of courses: courses in teaching methods, in learning theory or developmental psychology, and in selecting or adapting curriculum. In the analysis for this research question, I examined what relationship, if any, existed between these three types of coursework and 1st-year teachers’ feelings of preparedness, controlling for type of certification (and covariates describing the propensity blocks, the school context, subject specialty, and the date of survey completion). Results of my analysis showed that the types of coursework that teachers received had a positive, meaningful relationship with their feelings’ of preparedness. In addition, two-way interactions between certification route and coursework were not required as predictors in the model, suggesting that coursework was just as important for AC teachers’ feelings of preparedness as it was for TC teachers’ feelings of preparedness.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022487111421933">Table 5</xref>, I present the fitted tobit regression model describing the extent to which 1st-year teachers feel prepared to teach as a function of program features. In the table, I include the parameter estimates, approximate <italic>p</italic> values, and standard errors. The first three parameter estimates summarize the predicted effects of the different types of coursework on ratings of preparedness. As can be seen from these estimates, effects ranged from .16 points (<italic>p</italic> = .095, <italic>d</italic> = .27 <italic>SD</italic>) for coursework in adapting curriculum to an effect of .22 points (<italic>p</italic> = .029, <italic>d</italic> = .37 <italic>SD</italic>) for coursework in learning theory or psychology. For courses on teaching methods or teaching strategies, teachers receiving three or more methods courses had preparedness scores that were, on average, .17 points (<italic>p</italic> = .002, <italic>d</italic> = .30 <italic>SD</italic>) higher than teachers who did not.</p>

<title>The impact of the length of the field experience</title>
<p>The second program feature investigated in this study, the length of teachers’ field or clinical experience (which the SASS calls practice teaching), also has an important relationship with how well prepared 1st-year teachers feel. The second group of parameter estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022487111421933">Table 5</xref> shows that, on average, teachers who had 12 or more weeks of practice teaching had preparedness scores that were .22 points higher (<italic>p</italic> = .048, <italic>d</italic> = .37 <italic>SD</italic>) than teachers who did not have practice teaching. Similarly, teachers who received 8 to 11 weeks of practice teaching had preparedness scores that were .24 points higher (<italic>p</italic> = .082, <italic>d</italic> = .42 <italic>SD</italic>), on average, than teachers who do not have practice, though this result was marginally statistically significant. For teachers who experienced 1 to 7 weeks of practice teaching, the relationship between practice and feelings of preparedness, although practically meaningful, was not statistically different from having no practice (<italic>p</italic> = .127, <italic>d</italic> = .34 <italic>SD</italic>). At .20 points (<italic>d</italic> = .34 <italic>SD</italic>), the differences in preparedness scores suggest that teachers who receive even a few weeks of practice feel better prepared than those who have no clinical experiences at all. A study with a higher sample size could confirm this finding.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022487111421933">Figure 2</xref> shows the predicted preparedness scores of 1st-year teachers who have had field experiences of various lengths. As can be seen from the figure, the main distinction occurs between teachers who did not have a field experience and those with a field experience of any length. For example, on average, 1st-year teachers who have not had practice teaching are predicted to have a preparedness score of about 2.8 points (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.09). In comparison, 1st-year teachers who have 12 or more weeks of practice are predicted to have a preparedness score of about 3.0 points (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.03), on average. Therefore, according to these results, teachers who have longer field experiences as part of their preparation program will feel better prepared in their 1st year than teachers who do not have an opportunity to practice.</p>

<title>Examining different program configurations</title>
<p>Results from my analysis provide answers to a question of interest for program designers and faculty, “If I structure my program a particular way, how many of my teachers will feel well prepared?” To answer this question, I label AC teachers whose fitted preparedness scores were in the top-third among the AC group as feeling “well prepared.” Next, I tabulated the number of AC teachers who did, or did not, have high fitted preparedness scores across various program configurations.</p>
<p>For my first illustration, I present the percentage of 1st-year AC teachers predicted to feel well prepared given participation in programs with various configurations of methods, learning theory, and curriculum courses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022487111421933">Figure 3</xref>, teachers are divided into three groups, starting with those who were, or had been, in programs offering none of the coursework types. At the time of the survey, an estimated 11% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.02) of AC teachers were in this type of program. As is shown in the figure, if an AC program does not offer coursework, none of the teachers in that program are predicted to feel well prepared. Of teachers whose programs offer one or two of the coursework types, an estimated 14% will feel well prepared. A total of 38% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.04) of AC teachers were enrolled in this type of program.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022487111421933-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>If programs offer three or more methods classes, coursework in learning theory or psychology, and coursework in adapting curriculum, an estimated 56% of their teachers will feel well prepared. About half of the AC teachers (51%, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04) were in programs that offered all three coursework types. Multipathway and multiprogram studies have shown that AC teachers typically receive different coursework than do TC teachers (D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487111421933">Boyd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111421933">Humphrey &amp; Wechsler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111421933">Johnson et al., 2005a</xref>). What I find interesting about the results in this study is that so large a proportion of AC teachers complete programs that are able to offer a range of different types of coursework and that offering all three of these types of coursework makes such a dramatic difference in how many teachers will feel well prepared. However, coursework is only part of preparedness equation. Just as important, teachers need field experiences to feel well prepared.</p>
<p>For the second illustration, I consider the impact of having a longer field experience. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022487111421933">Figure 4</xref>, I present the percentages of 1st-year AC teachers predicted to feel well prepared, given participation in programs with various lengths of practice teaching. Among teachers in programs that either do not offer practice teaching, or that only offer brief practice (1-7 weeks), less than 20% of AC teachers are predicted to feel well prepared. About 39% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.05) of AC teachers receive no practice teaching and 20% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.05) receive 1 to 7 weeks. Among teachers in programs that offer 8 to 11 weeks of practice, 62% will feel well prepared. This applies to 9% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.03) of AC teachers. A larger proportion of AC teachers, about 32% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.05), receive 12 or more weeks of practice. Among 1st-year AC teachers who are enrolled in programs that offer a field experience that is at least 12 weeks long, almost three-quarters (71%) will feel well prepared.</p>

<p>I was surprised that the percentage of teachers who feel well prepared after 1 to 7 weeks of practice (18%) was so much lower than the percentage who feel well prepared after 8 to 11 weeks (62%). The problem with the shorter field experiences may not be the length of the practice, so much as the timing of when it occurs (S. M. Johnson, personal communication, September, 2010). For example, AC teachers in these programs likely have their field experience during the summer, whereas K-12 students are in summer school. This type of field experience, with the small classes, shorter day, and either a remedial or enrichment focus, can be quite different from “regular” school, leaving teachers feeling ill prepared to tackle the rigors of a regular school schedule.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<sec id="section28-0022487111421933">
<title>On Program Administration and Policy</title>
<p>Program administrators and state policy makers may feel uncertain about implementing federal guidelines on coursework and field experiences for AC programs. For example, for <italic>Race to the Top</italic>, a large federal funding initiative, state departments of education must develop AC routes that provide “high-quality instruction in pedagogy,” but simultaneously “significantly limit the amount of coursework required” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022487111421933">U.S. Department of Education, 2009</xref>, p. 7). However, the illustrations described previously suggest that limiting coursework may have the unintended effect of reducing the proportion of 1st-year teachers who rate themselves well prepared for core teaching tasks. By contrast, the offer of federal funding for teacher residency programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487111421933">Sawchuk, 2009</xref>) could ultimately lead to stronger feelings of preparedness among new teachers. My results about the length of field experiences bode well for feelings of preparedness among teachers in residency programs, where teachers typically participate in a yearlong practicum.</p>
<p>In terms of coursework, my findings indicate that 1st-year teachers who have limited types of coursework in pedagogy <italic>do not</italic> feel that they have received high-quality preparation, regardless of whether they are alternatively or traditionally certified. The predicted preparedness score of teachers who had none of the three types of courses was about 2.5 out of four points. By contrast, on average, a teacher who has had all three types of courses will have a preparedness score of about 3.0 points out of four points (a rating of “well prepared”). These findings confirm that administrators of teacher education programs should continue to seek ways to include topics on instructional methods, learning theory, developmental psychology, and adapting curriculum (for example, for diverse learners) in their course offerings.</p>
<p>I also investigated the impact of having a longer field experience on teachers’ feelings of preparedness. Focusing specifically on the alternative certification route, results showed that the longer the field experience, the higher the percentage of 1st-year AC teachers who will feel well prepared. For example, if an AC program either does not offer practice teaching or offers between 1 and 7 weeks of practice, less than 20% of the 1st teachers in that program are estimated to feel well prepared. By contrast, among teachers who are enrolled in (or who have recently completed) programs that offer at least 12 weeks of practice teaching, almost three-quarters—71%—will feel well prepared. The implication for AC program administrators is clear: offer as long a field experience as your program can afford.</p>
<p>Readers may wonder how an AC teacher, who did not complete 1 to 2 years of training before entering the classroom, could participate in a field experience that is at least 12 weeks long. In many AC programs, one central feature is supervision and support from a mentor during the 1st year of full-time teaching, sometimes referred to as the internship year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111421933">Haberman, 2006</xref>). In completing the survey, AC teachers may have included this mentored teaching as part of their reported practice.</p>
<p>Reviews of research on teacher education suggest that the amount of coursework and practice is only one of the issues important to consider in program design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111421933">Cochran-Smith, Feiman-Nemser, &amp; McIntyre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487111421933">National Research Council, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022487111421933">Wilson, Floden, &amp; Ferrini-Mundy, 2002</xref>). Yet the questions on the teacher survey of the SASS are not specific enough to make fine distinctions among various teacher preparation models. Therefore, one of the central lessons for me in doing this study was the need for additional research on teacher education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0022487111421933">
<title>On Teacher Education Research</title>
<p>The variability that I found in the estimates of feelings of preparedness may help explain the conflicting results in studies to date that compare AC and TC teachers. My results confirmed that there is a difference between feelings of preparedness for these two groups. However, estimates of teachers’ feelings of preparedness were sensitive to whether program features were taken into account. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022487111421933">Table 4</xref>, which shows the model that did not include program features, the estimated effect of certification route was moderate and statistically significant. When I added features of the certification program, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022487111421933">Table 5</xref>, the difference in feelings of preparedness between AC and TC teachers shrinks considerably and is no longer statistically significant. Therefore, the differing results reported by various researchers may reflect differences in which variables were included, particularly in situations where different researchers have used similar data sets.</p>
<p>Findings and limitations in extant research on AC, as well as findings and limitations of this study, suggest several implications for future research on teacher preparation. First, in doing this study, I found that it is possible to take advantage of recent statistical methods that address certain threats to validity inherent to the use of large-scale quantitative data sets. In particular, researchers may need to develop complex analytic models to investigate causal questions, given that teachers and students are situated within multiple, overlapping contexts and given that experimental control over education stakeholders and education variables can be difficult to attain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487111421933">Murnane &amp; Willett, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In a parallel effort, because qualitative research can illuminate the <italic>process</italic> by which teacher learning occurs, comprehensive, qualitative studies of AC programs are able to provide insight into teachers’ interpretations of their experiences. However, in preparing to do this study, I found that there is a dearth of cross-setting, cross-pathway qualitative research on teacher preparation. Therefore, I believe that future research, for example, research generated through partnerships between institutions, and through collaborations that cross district or state boundaries, could provide trustworthy findings for a wide variety of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Second, additional research is needed to go beyond how the <italic>quantity</italic> of coursework and the <italic>length</italic> of practice teaching relate to teacher outcomes, to a more complete framework for describing teacher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111421933">Cochran-Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, research is needed to explore how the <italic>quality</italic> and <italic>delivery</italic> of coursework and field experiences affect teacher outcomes. For example, differences in program rigor and focus (i.e., immediate curricular needs vs. a broad understanding of curriculum theory) may have long-term consequences for teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487111421933">Achinstein, Ogawa, &amp; Speiglman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The wide variation in program features affects the interpretation of data on AC programs. For example, as a group, the AC teachers in this study may have underreported participation in course-like training because AC programs often deliver instruction at unconventional times or locations and in nontraditional formats. In fact, with large-scale surveys like the SASS, it would be particularly beneficial for researchers to know the exact name of the program(s) through which a teacher had received, or was receiving, her or his initial teacher education and the dates during which the teacher was enrolled. If the breadth of a survey such as the SASS could be combined with the depth available from data on specific programs, researchers could address questions about program components more thoroughly than is currently possible.</p>
<p>Third, a more in-depth analysis of personal background and school context could enhance our understanding of the factors that mediate program effects on teacher outcomes. In this study, I included a short list of demographic, educational, and professional background measures. However, there are certain background measures that warrant further study. For example, future studies may want to incorporate whether new teachers envision teaching as a long-term career or a short-term one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022487111421933">Peske, Liu, Johnson, Kauffman, &amp; Kardos, 2001</xref>), whether they are motivated by the chance to do meaningful work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111421933">Johnson et al., 2005a</xref>), and their life histories and predispositions related to childhood and schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487111421933">Chin &amp; Young, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022487111421933">Thomas, Friedman-Nimz, &amp; Mahlios, 2005</xref>). Moreover, given that alternatively certified teachers are recruited to teach in high-need schools, additional research that incorporates an extensive analysis of school context and how that context interacts with personal background and with preparation program features is needed.</p>

<sec id="section30-0022487111421933" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>New teacher career decisions are often driven by their perceptions of their effectiveness and other factors that relate directly to the quality of their preparation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487111421933">Johnson &amp; Birkeland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487111421933">Moscovici, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022487111421933">Yost, 2006</xref>). Therefore, in this study I examined the extent to which program features relate to new teacher feelings of preparedness. According to my research, 1st-year teachers who have fewer types of education coursework and shorter field experiences feel less well prepared than teachers whose pedagogical preparation is more complete. In terms of program configuration, this means that teachers whose AC programs allow them to begin full-time teaching without having had coursework or field experiences will feel the least well prepared in their 1st year. Also, my results suggest that AC programs that recruit teachers and provide abbreviated preservice education, but do not continue the initial teacher education into the 1st year, will yield beginning teachers who do not feel well prepared.</p>
<p>By contrast, one can infer from the results of this study that 1st-year teachers in fast-track AC programs, where the summer training is followed by additional coursework as well as substantial field experience–like observation and feedback on their teaching, will feel relatively better prepared than others, as will teachers who complete residency programs. The challenge is to determine how teacher educators can design programs that offer sufficient preparation so that novice, alternatively certified teachers will feel well prepared to teach in the schools where they are needed most, while the programs also offer the expedited entry into the profession that is one of the strengths of AC. Our response to this challenge has the potential to improve the retention of alternatively certified teachers in the profession and to improve the learning of the children they serve.</p>
