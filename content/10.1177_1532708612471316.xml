<p>This article responds to Bersani’s critique of psychoanalysis’ personalism by focusing on the role of art, images, and objects in both psychoanalysis and sociology. I take examples of my research in visual art, and images conjured in my own psychoanalytic treatment, to look at the nonhuman agencies present in these relationships.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Of the many critiques of psychoanalytic theory and psychoanalysis, a recent one by Leo Bersani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471316">Bersani &amp; Phillips, 2010</xref>) focuses on what one might call its “personalism,” that is, psychoanalysis’ tendency to solely focus on human subjectivity, intention, and agency at the expense of nonhuman agencies or human nonsubjectivities. Bersani argues that we ought to consider instead an impersonal psychoanalysis. This critique comes in the broader context of the turn toward the affective and the material in cultural/critical theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612471316">Clough, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471316">Massumi, 2002</xref>), an interest in the expressive potentialities of matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612471316">Bennett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471316">Grosz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612471316">O’Sullivan, 2008</xref>), turns that can be linked to societal expansion of information, bio and digital technologies, and an increased awareness of the molecular level of life and nonhuman agencies. It cannot be coincidence that as social theorists such as Bruno Latour and Scott Lash begin to focus on nonhuman objects, those interested in psychodynamics also become interested in an impersonal psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>My own interests lie at the interstices of art, science, and social theory. I am interested in the objects of visual art and culture, the methods used in science and technology studies, and the real social changes that occur in everyday life. I do not focus so much on the institutions or art worlds as Becker does, nor critique cultural production like the Frankfurt school. I am interested in the content of art, and what it says about the changing social world. My scholarly interests lie at the interstices of art, science, and social theory. Just as I see a theoretical connection between the interests of critics like Grosz, Latour, and Bersani, I also see my research interests influence the psychoanalytic treatment I undergo, and I am aware of how my analytic treatment influences my research.</p>
<p>In this article, I explore ways “the visual” and therefore “images” may be taken as an object and how this process appears in the feedback relationship of my scholarly research and psychoanalytic treatment. An early version of this article was written for a panel on Sociology and Psychoanalysis wherein all the participants reflected on the relationship between their scholarship and psychoanalytic treatment. The fact of academics being willing to speak openly about analytic treatment in relation to their work is also a product of a certain time period. Some of the same technologies that are influencing how we understand the social (television, the Internet, digitization) are also influencing the old lines between private and public spheres. Here, I make use of that changed divide to talk about how visual images transect my research and my analytic treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532708612471316">
<title>Art</title>
<p>One artist whose work I follow, Daniela Rossell, has similarly transgressed a traditional private/public divide. She has photographed women, especially the daughters, wives, and family members of elite Mexican politicians, in their homes amidst their possessions, in lavish surroundings, together with the objects that make up their lives in all its glamour, excess, and frivolity. Her series <italic>Ricas y Famosas, Mexcio 1994-2001</italic> depicts women and objects together almost on the same plane—in the sense that Deleuze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471316">Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1994</xref>) describes a plane of consistency. She and the women together, in what I see as a conspiratorial process, produce photographs in which women, girls, and their art, furniture, toys, and possessions are displayed in a nonhierarchical interaction. In analyzing Rossell’s artwork, I use a kind of case study—“examples” or illustrations—actually kind of literal pictorial illustrations of social theory. Brian Massumi and Giorgio Agamben have both written about “the example” as a kind of singularity among others, which, however, stands for each of them and serves for all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471316">Massumi, 2002</xref>, pp. 17-18). The example is neither general nor particular, but unique unto itself. The example, as singularity, is “a belonging to itself that is simultaneously an extendibility to everything else with which it might be connected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471316">Massumi, 2002</xref>, p. 18). In this article, I offer to you some examples: Rossell’s artwork, a mental image that recurred in my own psychoanalytic treatment, and a discussion of how we might understand images amid specific technological changes.</p>
<p>One of Rossell’s striking images is of a middle-aged woman sitting on the steps to her sunken living room carpeted in vibrant, grass-green shag, and a large, stuffed, fuschia dragon perched on the stairs across from her. I am taken by the image’s absurdity—because this woman of a politically elite upper class who looks staid in a bohemian kind of way—is willing to be photographed next to a large, pink, stuffed dragon, with little else filling the field of the photo. I am impressed that the two women together, photographer and “subject,” have conspired to create a portrait of ironic mockery. What I argue in my research on a group of Rossell’s images is that they similarly depict women and objects in a kind of consensual way, together on the same plane. There are a number of ideas to think about there—feminism and new relations between subjects and objects, or perhaps, new relations between objects and objects. I’m interested in the agencies of these objects: If a woman is complicit in becoming an object what is her agency? What agency does a fuschia dragon have? What agency does an image of a woman and a fushcia dragon together have?</p>
<p>In my own analytic treatment, I have found myself prone to producing mental images with their own agencies. I would like to share one example of a very concrete image—an image of objects that I produced and that illustrates something for me. I want to play with this image a bit. But first, the location.</p>

<title>Frame: Analysis</title>
<p><italic>This conversation between she and I is framed. These relationships, the analytic relationship and the affect-image-thought relationship are enframed with the confines of her office. I’m on the couch, she’s in the chair. Both of us are in a room with walls, furniture, and art hanging on the walls. Art that I notice, that we discuss. On her walls hang art by an artist friend of hers. First, I say I dislike it, then later I say it is not what I would choose. Then I become interested in what it tells me about her. From the desert-like palette, I gather she is from the western United States. The sofa I lay on is soft yet supportive. She brings in a new pillow when the old one goes flat. I pay her late and we discuss that she has wants and needs as well. She says she’d like new chairs, the current ones feel worn to her. She moves to a new office and it takes months for me to adjust to the higher ceilings and larger space and I miss the old neighborhood</italic>.</p>
<p>I connect the perceptual and affective strata of my experience in my analyst’s office with the writings of feminist philosopher Elizabeth Grosz. In her discussion of the evolutionary role of art, Grosz speaks of furniture as enabling the body to be directly affected by, but also protected from, the chaos of events or chaos outside us. She quotes architectural theorist Bernard Cache:
<disp-quote>
<p>For our most intimate or most abstract endeavours . . . furniture supplies the immediate physical environment in which our bodies act and react; for us, urban animals, furniture is thus our primary territory. Architecture, object geography—furniture is that image where forms are fused together. (30 Cache) (Grosz 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, furniture is both image and object. It <italic>is</italic> forms, but it also forms. And it contains. But the office that holds the furniture also contains and, as she describes it, has a separating function.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It cuts into a milieu or space [and] [t]his cutting links it to the constitution of the plane of composition, to the provisional ordering of chaos through the laying down of a grid or order that entraps chaotic shards, chaoid states, to arrest or slow them into a space and a time, a structure and a form where they can affect and be affected by bodies. This cutting of the space of the earth through the fabrication of the frame is the very gesture that composes both house and territory, inside and outside, interior and landscape at once and as the points of maximal variation, the two sides, of the space of the earth. (Grosz 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section4-1532708612471316">
<title>Affect</title>
<p>In this office, on the sofa, I lay back, and I speak. As I speak; as I listen; images draw themselves.</p>
<p>Imagine vintage or antique children’s toy building blocks, the painted wooden ones that have a letter or number on each side. Next, imagine them suspended three by three, vertically and horizontally, three across and three down, nine blocks altogether connected each to one another. This is the image of my psychic insides that came to me in analysis at one point, in the context of considering how I might conceptualize change—something like intersubjective human change.</p>
<p>Let me refuse to be too consistent with temporalities, and jump back a few decades to another discussion of images. In an interview, the Chicana feminist writer Gloria Anzaldua, explains how she develops her ideas.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The way that I originate my ideas is the following: First, there has to be something that is bothering me, something emotional so that I will be upset, angry or conflicted. Then I start meditating on it, sometimes I do that while I am walking. Usually I come up with something visual of what I am feeling. So then I have a visual that sometimes is like a bridge, sometimes like a person with fifty legs, one in each world; sometimes the left-handed world et cetera, and I try to put that into words. So behind this feeling there is this image, this visual, and I have to figure out what the articulation of this image is. That’s how I get into the theory. I start theorizing about it. But it always comes from a feeling. (Anzaldua, 1987, p. 236)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this passage, Anzaldua sketches out a relationship between feelings, the visual and writing. I substitute affect where Anzaldua uses “feeling” for as Simon O’Sullivan puts it, “Affect names not only intensities on the body but also <italic>self-sufficient elements in the world</italic>” (italics added; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612471316">O’Sullivan, 2008</xref>, p. 39). Affect in relation to objects and images opens one up to the possibilities of multiple agencies. That is, in addition to the agency of the patient, analyst, sociologist, or subject, we must consider the agency of images and objects as well. This supplements and extends Anzaldua’s description of how a feeling produces an idea for her.</p>
<p>Now, if I want to change, and these connected blocks represent my “insides,” then I decided it follows that one of those blocks must move or turn. Yet I feared disturbing the blocks and I also feared that my analyst might disturb them or transform them. After I described this image, my analyst had a response to what I described. She liked the image, and she found the process creative, and she joined in, exclaiming, “You could do anything you want with the blocks, you could even paint them!” This, I immediately found threatening. I instantly imagined a different object than mine, a new set of blocks, a series of shiny black and white dominoes stood single file, pushed over, and one knocking each successive block down. The dominoes were too fast, too shiny, too new, they were not my vintage blocks, worn out, color faded to soft blues and reds, of which I apparently also felt protective. In real life, my grandmother had a set of these blocks, that my father and his brothers and sisters had played with as children and that my cousins and I also played with when we were young. Despite my poststructural influences, I produced an image of objects that were old, generational, and familial. Finally, my first, very slow, very safe version of imagining my own psychic change was for one of those blocks in the configuration of nine, to turn. Just one block. That should be enough. That felt safe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1532708612471316">
<title>Image</title>
<p>Grosz claims that “Art is not linked to some intrinsic relation to one’s own body but exactly the opposite: it is linked to those processes of distancing and the production of a plane of composition that abstracts sensation from the body” (Grosz 11). Creating an image, or in this case an image-object, may partially have the effect of dampening one’s experience of sensation and affect. Affect may be circulating across and also contained in the image of the blocks. It is affect that produces the image, and in looking at the image-object more closely, new affects will also come to light.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612471316">Mark Hansen (2006)</xref> describes a similar process. He tells us that by naming the body as a center of indetermination, Bergson endows the body with “strongly creative capacities. “If the affective body introduces specific constraints on what can constitute relevant aspects of an image, then [the body might] be said to condition its own deduction from the universe of images” (pp. 4-5). Hansen updates Bergson’s process of embodied selections: rather than selecting preexistent images, as Bergson had described it, he says the body now operates by filtering information directly and, through this process, creating images.</p>
<p>Yet let us return to the blocks. As I wrote and thought on this conceptualization of inner change, I was stymied by how those blocks might actually turn and be connected while changing. Apparently at that point I am un-integrated enough that I fear I will become unknown to myself if one part of me changes significantly. My understanding of the connectors between the blocks was very tenuous. The blocks were strung together lightly and it was the blocks that were important, not their connectors. I felt the need to keep the blocks solid, old and antique, protected. Though my understanding of the connectors was tenuous, it was clear that they were connected in a system. Writing and thinking about how they might be best connected, to allow for both maximum flexibility while still protecting something that seemed important to protect at least for the time being, the first alternative I come up with, was to drill holes through the blocks and connect them by a slim rope. So now take a moment to imagine that those nine blocks suspended and interconnected by rope. Still, the blocks would need to be strung on the rope both vertically and horizontally. This would not actually allow the blocks to turn one at a time, without adjacent connected blocks also turning. And you recall the safe version of change was for just one block to turn. Now bear with me, because I really pushed this wooden block metaphor to the limit.</p>
<p>The second alternative that occurred to me was to encase each block in a plastic bubble, and connect the bubbles to one another, which would allow the blocks to float freely inside the bubble. Thus, the blocks could turn and move within the bubble, the plastic bubbles would be connected, while still not being damaged. Perhaps you can see where this image is going, but it quickly occurred to me that the image of my psyche as Bubble Boy encased in protective plastic coating was not the direction I wanted to head.</p>
<p>The image as representational has been dissolved and transformed by new media. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612471316">Hansen (2006)</xref>, the “new media image is something the user actively goes into, zooming in or clicking on individual parts with the assumption that they contain hyperlinks . . .” (Footnote 17, p. 10). My image is resolutely not new media, not postmodern. It is, as I have often thought of myself as still at times a child of rural Iowa, still a bit premodern. Antique wooden blocks. Yet my process of accessing the image of the blocks, and my willingness to manipulate them as a thought experiment, suggests already the influence of media—the zooming in and out of Google earth, a wish to point and click on a block to make it turn. For Hansen it is especially the new technology of digitization that demands we reconceptualize the relation between body and image.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is not simply that the image provides a tool for the user to control the “infoscape” of contemporary material culture . . . but rather that the “image” has itself become a process and as such, has become irreducibly bound up with the activity of the body. Thus rather than simply abandoning it to its own obsolescence or transforming it into a vehicle for interfacing with information, we must fundamentally reconfigure the image. We must accept that the image, rather than finding instantiation in a privileged technical form (including the computer interface), now demarcates the very process through which the body . . . gives form to or in-forms information . . . the image can no longer be restricted to the level of surface appearance (p. 9. Mark B.N. Hansen. New Philosophy for New Media).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I would say that one way to think of this is as of the image as an object, not as simply a representation of something else, but an art object with its own agencies.</p>
<p>This image of my psyche, while not flat, is still representational though. It is an image that has symbolic meaning that resonates with traditional intentions of psychoanalysis. For we might also think of the blocks as scholastic and pedagogical—with painted letters and numbers on the sides, they are pedagogical toys. The blocks are antique or vintage, I identify they with family, and genealogy. Yet the shiny falling dominoes that came to mind when my analyst engaged with my imaged blocks while also representational, certainly were created in a force of affect and sensation. It may be in its relationality that psychoanalysis is most closely aligned with affect and the transpersonal.</p>
<p>In his discussion of Deleuze and art, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612471316">Simon O’Sullivan (2008)</xref> is interested in how “affect can be deployed in thinking about the actual work of art, itself understood as a specific form of thought” (p. 39). Elizabeth Grosz argues that
<disp-quote>
<p>the first gesture of art is not, as Nietzsche believed, the exteriorization of one’s own bodily forces and energies, the transformation of flesh and blood into canvas and oil but a more primary gesture that requires a body’s prior separation from the earth, from nature, from its world. (Grosz 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The image of blocks is not produced solely by my body; its creation also comes from the analytic relationship and from the world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1532708612471316">
<title>Objects</title>
<p>The feminist philosopher Karen Barad borrows from physics to theorize the relationship between objects. She sees a causal relationship between “the apparatuses of bodily production and the phenomena produced” by them, and she names this “agential intra-action.” In particular, she suggests that this intra-action is characterized by an inseparability of the “agencies of observation” and the “observed object” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612471316">Barad, 2003</xref>, p. 814). According to Bohr, the phenomena produced as a result of any given activity are not independent objects. Rather, they show the “ontological inseparability of agentially intra-acting components” (p. 815). She moves away from the term <italic>interaction</italic>, toward <italic>intra-action</italic>, to highlight the inseparability of objects, that is, an action or agency that occurs within and between rather than separately and between. The separation that does exist between objects is the result of an “agential cut,” which she contrasts with the Cartesian cut. The point she makes is that relata do not exist prior to relations, instead “relata-within-phenomena emerge through specific intra-actions” (p. 815). Oddly enough, I think my blocks as image-object illustrate this inseparability. For Barad, understanding this relationship is important because it sets up the conditions under which one might be “objective.” The point she wants to make is that apparatuses themselves are not objects in the world, but of the world, in the same manner that she changes the terms of the relationship to intra-action. As such, this is also how she brings agency to apparatuses, for she goes on to argue that they themselves are phenomena that are constituted by an “open-ended practice,” one that is not set and bounded but is always open to “rearrangements, re-articulations, and reworkings” (p. 817). Again, she carries this argument a step further, to declare then that not just the matter of science, or of social science, but the entire world—reality—is composed of phenomena in relata. As she puts it, “The world is a dynamic process of intra-activity” with an “ongoing flow of agency” and an “ongoing open process of mattering” (p. 818). The ongoing nature of this activity, its iteration, is performative.</p>
<p>The third and last solution I had for my blocks came in the middle of the night. It had the raw feeling of a bad dream, and it was that I abolish the blocks altogether and simply focus on the connector. I imagined the rope from the first image, a bright shiny plastic blue rope, similar to the one that tied our tire swing to a tree when I was a child. Yet I am of course hesitant to throw out the piece of the image, the block that so clearly is representational of something of my family and myself. The image remains unresolved, and while the relationship is not resolved, it does continue, perhaps suggesting a future source for a connector between the blocks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1532708612471316">
<title>Frame: Analysis</title>
<p>Grosz argues that “the ‘frame’ is the condition of all the arts and is the particular contribution of architecture to the taming of the virtual [or expressive potential that is in matter], the territorialization of the uncontrollable forces of the earth.” She says,
<disp-quote>
<p>The frame is what establishes territory out of the chaos that is the earth . . . with no frame or boundary there can be no territory . . . and without territory there may be objects or things but not qualities that can become expressive, that can intensify and transform living bodies. (Grosz 11-12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this framed state, psychoanalysis itself inhabits an affect-image-thought relationship.</p>
<p>The analytic relationship may be at its best when it practices what Grosz describes of art: “Art is where properties and qualities . . . take on the task of representing the future, of preceding and summoning up sensations to come, a people to come, worlds or universes to come.” Now, typically we understand what occurs in psychoanalysis as excavating a past. Yet in its ongoing relation, in its praxis over time, in the inevitable unfolding of its virtuality, new sensations are presented. Old stories, relived in the present, and relived again in the future, are not truly relivings. They are becomings of sensation, and new sensations of becoming. In the unfolding that occurs within psychoanalysis, there is often a tension between affect and thought, a taut line of frustration between the thought of a narrative past, or a past narrative, and the new sensations of present, a present that is always toward a future that may wish to break with the past, and cannot.</p>
