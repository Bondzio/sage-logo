<p>Gerald Wallace is a native of Connecticut. After receiving his undergraduate degree from Central Connecticut State, he enrolled at the University of Arizona, where he received a master’s degree in remedial education in 1963. Following his graduation from Arizona, he worked in one of the first programs for students with learning disabilities in the state of California in Palo Alto, where he worked as a resource teacher. He was awarded a federal fellowship for doctoral study in special education at the University of Oregon. Following doctoral study, Dr. Wallace was on the faculty of the special education department at the University of Utah for 1 year prior to joining the faculty of the University of Virginia. He served in a variety of roles during his 20 years at the University of Virginia, including director of doctoral studies in special education and associate dean for faculty development and external relations. He left the University of Virginia to become an executive editor at PRO-ED Publishing Company in Austin, Texas. Later, he joined the faculty of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where he served as the director of the doctoral program in education for approximately 10 years. He retired from GMU in 2002 as a professor emeritus. Dr. Wallace also served as a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii and as a commonwealth eminent scholar at Norfolk State University.</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace is the author of nine books in the area of learning disabilities, in addition to a number of journal articles, book chapters, monographs, and curriculum materials. He is also the coauthor of the <italic>Comprehensive Expressive and Receptive Language Test</italic> (CREVT). The third edition of this test will be published in 2012. His television series, <italic>Characteristics of Learning Disabilities</italic>, was aired on many Public Broadcasting System (PBS) stations throughout the United States. He has served as a consulting editor for five special education journals, in addition to serving as the first editor of <italic>Intervention in School and Clinic</italic>. Dr. Wallace has delivered many distinguished lectures at various colleges and universities throughout the world during his career. He has served as president of the Council for Learning Disabilities and as the executive secretary of the Division for Children with Learning Disabilities (at the time, a division of the Council for Exceptional Children).</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace has received several awards and honors during his career. He was honored with the J. E. Wallace Wallin Special Education Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council for Exceptional Children in 2000. He was also recognized as the Professional of the Year by the Council for Learning Disabilities. Earlier in his career, Dr. Wallace was an invited participant at a White House Meeting on Learning Disabilities.</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace currently resides at his oceanside home in Virginia Beach, where he frequently entertains his family of two sons and three grandchildren. He continues to be active in the profession through writing and consulting. He also serves as the disability advocate for his church.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>I thought I’d start by asking you to recount your career and talk about how you became interested in special education.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>I grew up in Connecticut and graduated from a small state college there. Even though I majored in education, I didn’t really know what I wanted to teach, so I decided to work directly on my master’s degree, which I did at the University of Arizona. By complete coincidence, I had an opportunity to work with Ruth Strang who had retired from Columbia University and moved to Arizona. She was internationally known and a widely published professional at that time in the early 1960s. Her expertise was reading instruction, especially remedial reading instruction. After I took a course from her my first semester at Arizona, I decided that was the area in which I would specialize. Consequently, I majored in remedial education and worked specifically with Dr. Strang for the time I was in Arizona.</p>
<p>Because I received a good taste of the West in Arizona, I decided to take a position at Palo Alto, California. Palo Alto, in the early 1960s, was considered one of the premier school districts in the state of California. They were implementing a program for children with learning disabilities; they called them educationally handicapped, but essentially they were students with learning disabilities. Palo Alto hired somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 remedial specialists to work with these students. This was considered quite unique in 1963. I was assigned a couple of schools at the elementary level and worked as a resource teacher, with students who were in need of additional instruction. I also worked with classroom teachers in implementing strategies for these students in the general education classroom. To think back to almost 50 years ago, this was just unbelievable, because very few school districts across the country were implementing this type of instruction. Palo Alto even organized workshops with professionals such as Norris Haring, who at the time was establishing a national reputation as an expert in working with students encountering learning difficulties. So very early in my career, I was exposed to individuals in the field who later became very well-known professionals in our field. I worked in Palo Alto for 3 years. One of the interesting things about working there was that of the 10 to 15 specialists they hired, 4 of us later went on for doctoral study in various areas of special education.</p>
<p>After my time in Palo Alto, I wanted to go on and do some further study. I received a fellowship for doctoral study at the University of Oregon, which had established one of the better higher education training programs in the field of special education. Oregon, by the way, continues to have an outstanding special education program all these years later. In 1966 I moved to Eugene, Oregon, and started working on a doctorate in special education, learning disabilities, and remedial education. The term <italic>learning disabilities</italic> was a term that people were just starting to use for this type of student. There were very few training programs available, but Oregon was one of them. Again, I was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time because the federal government was starting to place some financial resources into programs of study in this area. I received federal funding for my course of study at Oregon for the 3 years I was there.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>You stated that the term <italic>learning disabilities</italic> wasn’t even used when you were at Palo Alto. What is your perspective on how we came to recognize these kinds of learning difficulties as “learning disabilities”?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>During the early 1960s, these students were called “educationally handicapped” in California. The LD term slowly evolved. A number of parent and professional groups were influential in not only getting educators to recognize that these students were not being served, but also in strongly encouraging the federal government to start recognizing and funding programs for these students. There was very little available in those early years for these students. Thankfully, programs did expand and eventually become much more commonplace. Following the completion of my doctorate at the University of Oregon, I spent 1 year at the University of Utah and subsequently joined the special education faculty at the University of Virginia where I taught for 20 years.</p>
<p>I think the federal government should be applauded for some of the initiatives implemented during these early years to help individuals recognize this particular special education population. Along this line, the feds sponsored an intensive program of study at the University of Arizona where a large number of higher education professionals who were training individuals to work with students with LD were brought together for a series of workshops and discussion groups. I think approximately 100 people were invited to participate, including many of the well-known experts in this emerging field such as Newell Kephart, Helmut Myklebust, Sam Kirk, Bill Cruickshank, and I believe Marianne Frostig. It was absolutely unbelievable to see these individuals in one setting. One thing I can say, and I’ve thought about this for years, is how fortunate I was to be able to be active in this field at a time when so many important things were happening in terms of identification procedures, assessment techniques, and the development of instructional programs.</p>
<p>Another fortunate aspect of being in the LD field at that time is that I was able to witness the results of research having some very wide implications for practices in the classroom. To give you an example, when I started off supervising teachers at the University of Virginia, and even before that time, many classrooms for students with LD included perceptual-motor activities such as balance beam walking and beanbag tossing at a target as part of the curriculum. These activities were included as either a substitute or as a prerequisite for various academic skills. Through the research of a number of people, I think there were some dramatic changes in what was done in those classrooms in terms of instructional programs. Rather than using techniques that essentially were incidental to success in the classroom, various research results suggested that more direct instruction of skills had longer term benefits to students. I believe that one of the highlights of my time in special education was to witness the practical classroom implications for so many research results. People often talk about research and what it does, but I really did see the results of research in classroom instruction.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>You mentioned in an email that you produced a PBS series on learning disabilities. Can you discuss that?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I really enjoyed producing this series. In 1974, when I was at UVa, I was approached by some people in the continuing education division about producing a television show introducing people to the characteristics of LD. The idea was to use the television series along with classroom seminars to introduce the LD concept to individuals throughout the state of Virginia. Through some private funding at the university and another group called the Learning Disability Council of Virginia, these two groups were able to raise enough funds to produce a 15-program series on the characteristics of LD. I was given a leave of absence from UVa for about 9 months while I wrote the script and produced the series. We filmed in actual classroom settings and interviewed teachers in those settings as part of the program. This was before the age of taping so everything was filmed in 16 mm. It was really hard copy. I also invited a number of professionals such as Jim Kauffman, Don Hammill, Dan Hallahan, Barbara Keogh, Judy Wilson, Sylvia Richardson, and Marianne Frostig to be a part of various programs in the series. They all flew in at different times to our affiliate in Richmond, Virginia and I interviewed them there. Over a period of 9 months, through the writing of the script for the series, interviewing people, and filming students on location, we finally were ready to unveil the series of programs throughout the state of Virginia. We had somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,000 to 4,000 individuals enrolled in the initial course via television. These students also met with various instructors in seminars throughout the state. Soon after, an affiliate of the Public Broadcasting System obtained the rights to the series and it aired nationally in late 1975 through the early 1980s. It was one of those early morning television shows that various universities offered for credit. It was a very unique experience and one which I really enjoyed very much. Incidentally, the Hammill Institute on Disabilities is now compiling a video library of individuals who were very influential in the area of special education. They converted the 15 individual films of my series to DVD, and eventually they intend to use them for online resources for individuals who would like, for example, to actually hear what Marianne Frostig’s beliefs were on visual perception. They’ll be able to hear Frostig’s own words. That’s going to be fascinating and it’s not going to be limited to learning disabilities. The Institute is looking at other areas of special education including visual impairment, hearing impairment, and mental retardation. It will be a great project when it is completed. I am pleased that the LD television series will be a part of this video library. Filming the series was an extremely interesting and valuable experience for me.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>This may be too broad of a question, but if you were to do that series today, almost 40 years later, how would it be different? And I guess in order to talk about differences you may have to say a little bit more about your focus with the original series.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>Well the big difference technologically is you don’t have to go around with the 16 mm camera anymore (laughs) but I think you’re talking more about the content of the series.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>I’m actually interested in both but I was talking more about content.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>In terms of content, the series covered all the way from the etiology of learning disabilities, to the various problem areas such as spoken language, reading, written language, and math. We also looked at educational provisions, early identification of learning disabilities, and how to include parents in the education process. I think in terms of that kind of content, the broad areas certainly would be ones in which I would continue to want to place some emphasis. However, within those areas there might be a tremendous number of changes because the educational provisions are different now. Certainly some of the strategies that are used in some of the content areas would be different from what was used 40 years ago. Interestingly, the last program was called <italic>Emerging Directions of Learning Disabilities</italic>. Barbara Keogh talked about problems in the early identification of LD, which I think is something that professionals continue to talk about. Dan Hallahan talked about problems in defining LD and describing the characteristics of that student, and there are some individuals who are still attempting to establish a definition for LD and find agreement on a definition. Don Hammill talked about the concept <italic>mainstreaming</italic>, which was new in 1974. However, we are still talking about the placement of these students in general education classes in 2011. We also talked about noncategorical teacher training, which Mike Nelson from the University of Kentucky discussed. Interestingly, we were on target in terms of what emerging directions we were considering and these same issues are being discussed today.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>It’s very interesting to think about and I think it’s a fair question to ask whether we are asking the same kinds of questions today. And that’s not to say we haven’t made progress along the way, but they’re still pertinent questions. I read through some of your writings in preparing for the interview and a couple of things stood out. In one piece you discussed the broad educational goals of “ensuring a supply of qualified teachers by improving their training and work environment, decreasing adult illiteracy, reducing dropout rates, insuring that all children be ready to start school.” That was from your piece about Jeffersonian education you wrote with Spencer Niles in 1974. And of course those are things that are still at the forefront almost 40 years later. And in an article on interdisciplinary approaches to LD, you stated we needed to focus on early childhood education, early identification and prescription for treatment, professional training, and interdisciplinary approaches where you advocated for collaboration among the disciplines. I would argue that those are areas we continue to discuss as important. And let me add one more piece of context before I ask you to respond: Today it seems like the approach to training teachers is more generic than it was during the ’70s when you and your colleagues were focusing on a variety of specific aspects of teaching students with learning disabilities. And today we are charged at teacher preparation institutes with preparing students in a very short amount of time to go into the classroom and effectively instruct all students with special needs. In the state of Texas we don’t even have an LD endorsement anymore. It’s much more generic.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>I’d like to respond to a number of things you’re saying. I do think it’s kind of interesting that we are still talking about the same types of things in 2011 that we talked about in 1974 and earlier. We’re still talking about early identification. We’re still talking about various models for educating students with LD, and some of the other things you mentioned. I’ve read the earlier interviews <italic>ISC</italic> has done on “giants” in the field of LD, and I think a couple of individuals you interviewed talked about the phonics debate, and how every so often it comes back and we again debate the efficacy of phonics versus whole language approaches. It seems to happen in a number of areas. Educators are always looking for the ideal response or answer to lingering questions. And I think that’s true about the current debate over RTI [response to intervention]. Some people see RTI as an end all, whereas others see it as devastating to various special education students within our schools. One observation I would have about RTI is that the research is just not there. I think it can be a very good framework for making decisions—some good and probably some not so good decisions—about individual students, but it’s certainly not a method for organizing the whole field or providing services to students. I think it’s just one model to consider. It has become popular because large school districts and state governments need to save money. And in this economy, anywhere you’re going to save some money, even if it’s on the backs of kids who have special needs and require special services, they’re going to go for it. I’m sure you’re finding this to be true in Texas, as many states and communities struggle with budgetary problems.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>Right. I think it’s everywhere.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>You know the one thing that I always come back to is teaching. It is good teachers providing solid instruction for kids whatever their needs might be. When I’m speaking to groups, I’ll often ask them to think about a good teacher in their own school experience. And invariably everyone in the audience can remember someone in their background in their schooling who was an outstanding teacher. And they all mention various characteristics. And it’s not surprising that many of those characteristics are very similar no matter where I speak. Among the most often mentioned characteristics are organization, good management, knowledge of subject matter, insightfulness, high expectations, sense of humor, flexibility, and enthusiasm. Those characteristics are embodied in good teaching everyplace. I think that’s the key that we’re looking for and always striving for, in providing services for special students, it’s finding that special blend of good teaching. And we look for things such as RTI to help us along. However, RTI is not going to solve all of our problems in educating students with special needs.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>How big of a problem is it that we’re not training teachers as specialists to work with children with learning disabilities, at least not to the degree that we did in the past? Like I said earlier, today it’s more of a generic approach.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>There’s no doubt about it, and I think what you’re seeing in Texas is reflected in other states across the country. I do think it’s a problem because I believe there are large numbers of students in our schools who require more than just general education class instruction and remediation. I’m on the board of a private school in Virginia that serves about 50 to 60 students with various learning disabilities. This school does an absolutely fantastic job in helping students overcome the kinds of disabilities that they have. Most are encountering problems in reading and written language. This school specializes in getting the students ready to return to public school settings. Sometimes it takes just a year and sometimes it takes up to 3 or 4 years to get those kids ready to go back. However, my point in mentioning this school is that this type of intensive instructional intervention is not available in public schools to the extent that it was a number of years ago. To say that there are students who do not need intensive intervention is not being realistic because we know that there are students who require more than what is being provided in general education classrooms. Unfortunately, many students who are not provided proper instructional assistance just drop out of school when they get to a certain age. So, no, I do not think that the generic model solves the kinds of problems that we still see among so many students with LD.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>You were the first editor of <italic>Intervention in School and Clinic</italic>. Can you discuss how <italic>ISC</italic> came about?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>Many people may not be aware that <italic>Intervention in School and Clinic</italic>’s predecessor was a journal by the name of <italic>Academic Therapy. Academic Therapy</italic> was started by a man in California by the name of John Arena. He ran the journal for many years until it was purchased by PRO-ED Publishing Company. At that time, I was asked to become the editor of <italic>Academic Therapy</italic>, succeeding John Arena. I changed the journal from one that did not require peer review for article submissions to one in which we went to blind reviews. I also established an editorial board and implemented ongoing columns. After a couple of years of planning, we inaugurated <italic>Intervention in School and Clinic</italic>, which took the place of <italic>Academic Therapy</italic>. I would like to say that Lee Wiederholt and Judy Voress were instrumental in planning the change from <italic>Academic Therapy</italic> to <italic>Intervention in School and Clinic</italic>. It was always the intent that this would be a full-fledged journal that would focus on educational practices, teaching, and intervention geared toward those working in the field and those training to eventually work in the field. We never saw the journal as one that would publish just hard research without implications for classroom practices. As you know, it has become an established journal in the field. I was editor for a little under 10 years. It has been a pleasure for me to see the evolution of the journal and to see that it has become a respected publication in the field.</p>
<p>I also wanted to take a moment to talk about how professional organizations played such an important part of my own professional development and my work in the field. Very early on in my career, I became involved in the Division for Children with Learning Disabilities (DCLD), which was at that time a division of CEC (Council for Exceptional Children) and later on developed into the Council for Learning Disabilities (CLD). The years that I spent in various offices there, from executive secretary to president of that organization, really molded much of my career. It was through that organization that I became very aware of issues within the field of learning disabilities. It was at that time when P.L. 94-142 had just passed, and a time when people were really working hard for services for LD. It was at a time when parents were very influential in trying to get services for students with LD. It was very exciting to be involved in a professional organization at that time. It was through my work in that organization that I became very good friends with people such as Steve Larsen, Lee Wiederholt, and Floyd Hudson, all people who were involved in DCLD and CLD. I would encourage and have encouraged all students to become involved in organizations such as CLD and other organizations because they really provide a tremendous opportunity to interact with other professionals in the field. I’m really so proud to say that somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six of my former students have gone on to executive positions in CLD. They have also encouraged their students to become involved in professional organizations. Professional organizations I think are a wonderful way to involve yourself in the profession on an ongoing basis and to meet other individuals from across the country who have similar kinds of questions and needs that you have as an LD professional.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>So CLD came about from the division of LD in CEC?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>Yes it did. At the time, the Division for Children with Learning Disabilities was a regular division within CEC. There were a number of people within the field of learning disabilities at the time who wanted to be a member of DCLD but not be a member of CEC. They just wanted to join the LD division. At that time CEC did not allow what they called nonunified membership. One had to be a member of both organizations. So a group of DCLD professionals started an organization called CLD which did not require any type of unified membership. One was just a member of CLD. Again, the timing of my career is just so fortunate. I was the president of CLD when we had our first convention, and now that convention is into its 33rd year of continuous conventions. I was also involved when CLD started its own journal, <italic>LDQ</italic> [<italic>Learning Disability Quarterly</italic>]. Timing is everything in a career and I just happened to be at the right place at the right time for so many things, to meet great people and also to be involved in organizations and journals at a time when the field was at its height. I learned plenty and really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I’d also like to share about my experiences at two other universities during my career. During my time at the University of Virginia I took advantage of the opportunity for sabbaticals and leaves of absence from the university. I did two wonderful leaves that were great for me and for my family. I spent a year as an eminent scholar at a historically Black institution, Norfolk State University. It was a great experience for me, as a White person, to be a part of an historically Black institution and to see the wonderful work that they were doing with so many students. Norfolk State had a special education program in which I taught. Then, I also spent another year at the University of Hawaii as a visiting professor and had the opportunity to work with a number of native Hawaiian students who were working on master’s degrees in special education at the time. Both experiences were very rewarding for me and my family. I continue to hear from former colleagues and from former students from both institutions.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>And working at these culturally diverse places, did that shape how you viewed the field?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>Yes it did. At both institutions, I was primarily involved in training students to become LD teachers. However, in my supervision of our students in the surrounding areas, I found that we would have to include more appropriate assessment and instructional programs for students from diverse backgrounds. My work at both of these universities certainly helped me better understand the unique needs of all students with LD through all parts of the country. As I’ve said a couple times, I feel very fortunate to have had a career of approximately 40 years at a time when learning disabilities was both at its forefront and at a time now where it’s not receiving the kinds of attention that it did in earlier years. Nonetheless, we are still aware that these students are in our schools and that they still require special services.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Intervention:</speaker>
<p>So my last question is this: With the passing of Steve Jobs the other day I was listening to a number of people discuss the breadth of his impact in so many areas of our lives, especially in communications. And in the course of this interview, you’ve discussed how far we’ve come since 16 mm film and your experience as editor of a major journal. Do you have any thoughts about how things have changed in how we disseminate what we know about our field to others and how we use technology to train teachers?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wallace:</speaker>
<p>Isn’t it amazing! Steve Jobs was a brilliant man and a genius when you think about his work with Apple. The use of iPads in schools, the computer applications for instruction at all levels of education, and the online preparation that is a part of university training programs is just unbelievable. Technology has become an integral part of special classes and programs in schools. Nonetheless, it still comes back to something I said earlier in regard to these technological advances. I still think that the heart of it all is good solid instruction from a great teacher. Great teachers are still the ones who basically do the job. Technology certainly helps them and all the new technological advances have helped even more. However, it is still the teacher who is the central focus of teaching the student with special needs. There is no doubt about that. That’s why we do what we do, right? If I didn’t feel that way I wouldn’t have done what I did for the number of years that I did. I loved being a teacher and I loved being a teacher at the time when I was a teacher. From teaching fourth grade all the way to teaching students preparing for their final defense of their PhD, I will always consider myself a teacher. How fortunate I was that I chose teaching as a career.</p></speech>
