<p><italic>Objectives/Hypothesis</italic>. The symptom of oscillopsia in patients with bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) can be reduced as dynamic visual acuity (DVA), the reduction in visual acuity during head movement, is improved by using real-time image stabilization, delivered by augmented reality eyewear.</p>

<p><italic>Methods</italic>. Immersive virtual reality glasses used in combination with a compact digital video camera were used. A software algorithm was developed that used a center-weighted Lucas-Kanade optical flow method to stabilize video in real time. Six patients with BVL were tested for changes in DVA using the eyewear. The ability to read a Snellen chart during a 2-Hz oscillating head rotation DVA test was measured.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. For combined scores of vertical and horizontal head rotations, the mean number of lines readable at rest was 7.86, which dropped to 2.77 with head movement (a combination of vertical and horizontal perturbations).

<body>
<p>The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is vital to maintain the position of an image on the retina of the eye during head movement. This is of particular importance as the fovea of the retina contains cells that are capable of color vision and a greater visual acuity than the surrounding cells of the retina. Maintaining an image of the area of interest over the fovea in a stable way is vital for maximum visual acuity. The VOR produces an equal and opposite eye movement to any movement of the head that is undertaken during movement of the body. Whereas the maintenance of normal balance is a product of the synthesis of vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual inputs, the importance and vulnerability of the VOR for gaze stabilization are made evident when the vestibular system is damaged and dynamic visual acuity deteriorates.</p>
<p>The vestibular system is most commonly damaged by ototoxic medications, most notably gentamicin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811434708">1</xref></sup> as well as radiation, particularly to the nasopharynx in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811434708">2</xref></sup> and bilateral Ménière disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811434708">3</xref></sup> Oscillopsia is the symptom of blurring of vision with head movement. The type of oscillopsia associated with walking was described as “bobbing oscillopsia” by Maw in 1971.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811434708">4</xref></sup> This concept was further developed by Ramsden and Ackrill,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434708">5</xref></sup> who collected a case series of patients who had been administered gentamicin and subsequently developed oscillopsia. Patients described their surroundings as “bouncing” or “bobbing.” More recently, patients have begun to use examples from modern popular culture and often reference the movie <italic>Jurassic Park</italic> when they describe their vision as “like when the ground shakes when the dinosaur appears.”</p>
<p>The relationship between the extent of vestibular loss and symptoms of bobbing oscillopsia is complex; not all patients who have bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) complain of symptoms of oscillopsia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811434708">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811434708">6</xref></sup> whereas those with unilateral vestibular loss may sometimes manifest symptoms despite an ostensibly normal vestibular system on the contralateral side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811434708">7</xref></sup> As a result, correlation of oscillopsia symptoms with electronystagmography (ENG) results are often poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811434708">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Bobbing oscillopsia is difficult to treat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811434708">9</xref></sup>; a number of compensatory mechanisms can be used to reduce symptoms, largely related to the postulate of an enhanced cervico-ocular reflex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811434708">6</xref></sup> and vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to improve symptoms, but these improvements are relatively small and take a considerable amount of time to achieve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811434708">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811434708">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although in patients with oscillopsia of peripheral vestibular origin, the visual image slips from the retina, patients with BVL have the advantage that the very pathology that causes their symptoms keeps their eyes in a relatively fixed position in the orbit relative to the skull. This could allow for a stable image to be directed to the eyes, if it can be delivered by a device that is affixed to the head. We set out to determine if real-time digital image stabilization could be used to provide a stabilized image to the retina of patients with BVL and thereby improve dynamic visual acuity.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Materials included the following: Vuzix iWear CamAR camera and Vuzix iWear VR920 virtual reality goggles (Vuzix Corporation, Rochester, New York), Apple MacBook computer (Apple, Inc, Cupertino, California), and Oscillopsia Image Stabilization software (developed by the authors).</p>
<sec id="section6-0194599811434708">
<title>Eyewear</title>
<p>Virtual reality eyewear is commercially available and largely sold for use in the video gaming industry. Wearers plug the eyewear into their computers and are able to see twin high-resolution 640 × 480 (920,000 pixels) LCD displays. These are equivalent to a 62-inch screen viewed at 9 feet. The iWear VR920 produces images in 24-bit true color (16 million colors) with a visor weight of 3.2 ounces with a 60-Hz progressive scan display update rate.</p>
<p>When a video camera—in this case, the iWear CamAR camera—is added, augmented reality is possible. <italic>Augmented reality</italic> is a term for a live direct view of an environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input, such as graphics. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one’s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811434708">12</xref></sup> The main purpose of this eyewear is in the field of computer gaming, where one’s own surroundings can be augmented with characters or other objects with which the player can interact. The value of augmented reality eyewear in this context is the seamless integration of a video camera and virtual reality goggles into one device that can be produced at low cost. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811434708"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> shows the eyewear being worn by one of the research assistants.</p>

<title>Software Development</title>
<p>Image stabilization may be achieved using optical or digital mechanisms. In optical image stabilization, elements of the lens or sensor mechanism physically move to counteract small movements of the camera. Digital stabilization relies on electronic shifting of the pixels in each frame of the video.</p>
<p>Optical stabilization was not used for 3 reasons:</p>
<list id="list3-0194599811434708" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Optical systems are both large and heavy and would be uncomfortable to wear in a head-mounted configuration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The magnitude of camera shake induced by normal ambulation is of greater magnitude than can be solved by most optical systems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Optical stabilization systems were deemed to be prohibitively expensive.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Immersive virtual reality glasses used in combination with a compact digital video camera were used. A software algorithm was developed that used a center-weighted modified Lucas-Kanade optical flow method to detect movement of key points from frame to frame in real time. The average movement of these points was computed to produce a single vector, based on which the video stream was stabilized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811434708"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> shows a screen capture of the video input with overlaid key points used to stabilize the video in real time from frame to frame. These points were not visible to the patient.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0194599811434708-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The software algorithm was developed using the XCode 4 Integrated Development Environment (Apple, Inc) with a combination of Objective-C and C++ programming. Cocoa, QuickTime, and OpenCV libraries and frameworks were also used in this application.</p>
<p>The video stream was captured from the virtual reality glasses using a standard Universal Serial Bus Video Class Device Driver and a QuickTime image capture source. This information was decoded into a bitmap array for processing by the computer vision algorithm. The stabilized output was displayed full-screen on the goggles via an 800 × 600-pixel video graphics array interface.</p>
<p>A 64-bit multithreaded binary application was produced for the Mac OS × 10.6 environment (Apple, Inc) using the XCode integrated development environment. The application was written in C++ and Objective-C using an agile development approach. The application relies on core Apple video-processing frameworks, including QTKit as well as the external computer vision library OpenCV (version 2.2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/">http://opencv.willowgarage.com/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Images are captured from the head-mounted video camera as a video stream of 640 × 480 resolution at a rate of 30 frames per second. A custom image-processing algorithm is implemented in the software using a modified center-weighted Lucas-Kande optical flow method to stabilize the video in real time with minimal latency (average latency 12 ms; 95th percentile range, 8-19 ms).</p>
<p>The Lucas-Kande optical flow algorithm aims to identify the borders between dark and light objects in the video frame and compares their movement between adjacent frames. The mean deviation of all points successfully tracked in 2 or more successive frames is calculated for the x and y axes individually. The deviation is smoothed to exclude any artifactual elements and to avoid unnecessary or unhelpful correction. An optimum video offset target parameter is calculated based on this information and is sample-checked to ensure that a minimum of 50% of the captured image is visible in the output frame.</p>
<p>An affine transform matrix is calculated and applied to the source image. The stabilized image feeds are provided to the user via the glasses-mounted displays while a debug stream containing the stabilized images, tracking points, and statistics for debugging and monitoring purposes is wirelessly streamed and recorded on a second testing system.</p>
<p>This software setup allows a “bobbing” video feed to be stabilized in real time and projected to the video screens of the eyewear in a stabilized format. Furthermore, the software allows the image stabilization processing to be toggled on and off. Exact details of the software component of the device are subject to registration of intellectual property procedures and are therefore not described in detail.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599811434708">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>A Snellen chart was used to record visual acuity. The chart was placed a standard distance from the subject, and the goggles were applied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599811434708">
<title>Testing Procedure</title>
<p>Three conditions were tested: condition 1 (rest) established a baseline of visual acuity at rest, condition 2 (unstabilized) established dynamic visual acuity, and condition 3 (stabilized) established dynamic visual acuity with stabilization software running.</p>
<list id="list4-0194599811434708" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Condition 1: reading the Snellen chart through the goggles while the head is at rest.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condition 2: reading the Snellen chart while the head is in motion at 2 Hz through the goggles with the image stabilization turned off. The patient’s head was rotated at 2 Hz in the horizontal plane and then in the vertical plane. The number of lines correctly read in each plane was recorded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condition 3: reading the Snellen chart while the head is in motion at 2 Hz through the goggles with the image stabilization software running. The patient’s head was rotated at 2 Hz in the horizontal plane and then in the vertical plane. The number of lines correctly read in each plane was recorded.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each condition was undertaken 3 times, and the outcome was recorded as a mean of the 3 attempts. This produced values for horizontal and vertical head rotations; these were combined to produce an overall score for head movement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599811434708">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and found to be normally distributed. The mean difference was calculated for scores at rest and scores with the head in motion without image stabilization being activated, the scores in motion with and without the image being stabilized, and between the scores at rest and during head motion with the image stabilized. A paired Student <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare unstabilized combined scores with stabilized combined scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients with vestibular lesions are at risk of falls as a result of poor vestibular input to maintain balance but are also at risk of visual problems stemming from failure of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. This problem is most marked in those with bilateral vestibular loss but can also manifest in patients with unilateral lesions.</p>
<p>The first description of oscillopsia associated with walking where the symptom was of a blurring of vision during head movement was described by Maw in 1971.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811434708">4</xref></sup> The term <italic>bobbing oscillopsia</italic> was first coined to describe a patient who had developed toxicity of the vestibular system from gentamicin therapy. This was followed by a case series by Ramsden and Ackrill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434708">5</xref></sup> in which 15 patients with bobbing oscillopsia were described. Each had been treated with gentamicin; the natural history of this condition was described. Although most of these patients improved, they remained considerably affected by their symptoms of visual disturbance. Although Marra et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811434708">13</xref></sup> went on to describe further cases of oscillopsia from aminoglycoside toxicity, this was described as a rare outcome from aminoglycoside administration. Black et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811434708">1</xref></sup> however, showed a more widespread problem was developing. In their work, it was shown that even a year following gentamicin toxicity, 32 of 33 patients had persistent oscillopsia, and all had features of vestibulotoxicity on vestibular function testing.</p>
<p>Although the most common forms of oscillopsia are the result of a poorly functioning vestibulo-ocular reflex, the other main category of oscillopsia is the central or neural variety where a nystagmus causes the inability of a visual image to be fixated on the retina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811434708">14</xref></sup> The causes of nystagmus that may result in neural oscillopsia are varied, but most are congenital where patients typically develop suppression techniques to stabilize an image.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811434708">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Downbeat nystagmus, the most common form of congenital nystagmus, has been treated with Botox injection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811434708">16</xref></sup> 3,4-diaminopyridine and 4-aminopyridine, and gabapentin, baclofen, and clonazepam, all to relatively poor effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811434708">17</xref></sup> In addition to medical treatments, neurological nystagmus has been treated with optical stabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811434708">18</xref></sup>; Stahl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811434708">19</xref></sup> used prisms with motors for pendular nystagmus, where the rate of image slip could be predicted and counteracted. Contact lens treatments for central nystagmus have also been attempted with varying degrees of success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811434708">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811434708"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599811434708">22</xref></sup> These techniques, however, have limited application to bobbing oscillopsia of a vestibular origin where the eye remains relatively stable in the head and oscillopsia is absent at rest.</p>
<p>Currently, the only treatment to show reliable results in some patients is vestibular rehabilitation therapy. It has been suggested that cervico-ocular reflexes may improve oscillopsia in patients with bilateral vestibular loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811434708">6</xref></sup> Herdman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811434708">11</xref></sup> demonstrated that vestibular exercise improved dynamic visual acuity in patients with bilateral vestibular loss, but this involved very intensive therapy and was not universally effective. These findings were confirmed by Tee and Chee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811434708">10</xref></sup> who also used a visual analog scale to assess oscillopsia in addition to their recordings of dynamic visual acuity (DVA). Interestingly, there was no correlation between improvement in oscillopsia and improvement in DVA for predictable and unpredictable head movements for their studies.</p>
<p>The use of real-time image stabilization is a promising technology that has been used in the digital camera industry for some time. Image stabilization comes in 2 broad categories: optical and digital. Optical stabilization makes use of physical phenomena to move the lens or other hardware components of the camera to ensure that the image in question is kept on the CCD chip that is used to take the photograph. Although this is a very elegant technique, it is a bulky technology, which is not practicable as a solution when used as a head-mounted device. As the supporting components of this technique become smaller and cheaper, it may well become a viable solution. Digital stabilization, on the other hand, does not attempt to stabilize the image as it falls onto the CCD chip; it merely takes the unstabilized image and converts it into a stabilized format before sending it to the area that it is viewed.</p>
<p>Digital image stabilization was concentrated on for these experiments for the reasons mentioned previously, as well as the fact that current techniques to provide image stabilization are available in open-source libraries and are far more economical.</p>
<p>Using real-time image stabilization, we have demonstrated, for what appears to be the first time, a technical solution for bobbing oscillopsia. Dynamic visual acuity has been shown to improve significantly with the software being used, and this improvement was sustainable, repeatable, and clinically significant.</p>
<p>The device has a number of strengths, including the effect of improving DVA immediately—the eyewear can be switched on and used immediately and without training. In addition, this technology is of relatively low cost—the device can be run using a low-cost set of augmented reality goggles ($500 at time of writing) and a laptop computer.</p>
<p>There are weaknesses of the current prototype, including a somewhat cumbersome design; the device is not easy to transport as it relies on a laptop computer. This is a prototype and will have this issue addressed in subsequent designs in the iterative process.</p>
<p>The current prototype has relatively poor resolution, coming equipped with a 640 × 480 resolution camera and display screens. These give rise to reduced acuity in both the stabilized and unstabilized video streams. Future devices will make use of recently released upgrades of both the camera and the video units.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of immersive augmented reality eyewear allows for the real-time digital stabilization of images captured by a video camera, which can then be displayed on video screens to the eyes of patients with bilateral vestibular loss. This is the first effective treatment of bobbing oscillopsia that improves dynamic visual acuity immediately and with consistent results.</p>
