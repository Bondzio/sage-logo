<body>
<p>Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy (CN) is a chronic, progressive-destructive process affecting the osseous arch of the foot including the joints and the surrounding soft tissue in patients with sensory neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712464957">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> Although this process was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712464957">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464957">3</xref></sup> in the context of tabes dorsalis, diabetes mellitus is now the most common cause of the underlying neuropathic dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712464957">20</xref></sup> Less frequently, the loss of protective sensibility originates from leprosy, poliomyelitis, syringomyelia, alcohol/drug abuse, severe metal intoxication, trauma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or congenital neuropathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464957">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712464957">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712464957">23</xref></sup> CN can lead to a (partial) loss of the affected extremity and is associated with decreased quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712464957">18</xref></sup> and increased mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712464957">22</xref></sup> In the context of a worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetic syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464957">8</xref></sup> diagnosis and treatment of the Charcot foot will become more significant.</p>
<p>In addition to causing a destructive and progressive deformity, acute CN is characterized by a pronounced inflammatory reaction. An increase in proinflammatory phenotypes of monocytes in patients with active CN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712464957">21</xref></sup> and a potential role of proinflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464957">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>After a prodromal stage with inflammation restricted to the soft tissue only, the progression of CN follows the stages originally described by Eichenholtz,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464957">5</xref></sup> with increasing osseous destruction in the beginning and consolidation of the deformity in the end. Secondary ulceration due to the combination of deformity and neuropathy is frequent and sometimes results in the need for amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464957">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because the pathogenesis of CN remains unclear,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464957">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of acute CN have yet to be established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712464957">7</xref></sup> Currently, the treatment of choice for acute CN is off-loading and immobilization in a total contact cast (TCC) for several months to counteract both inflammation and deformation of the foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> Earlier, it was generally thought that once CN activity subsided, recurrence of osteoarthropathic activity in the same foot was uncommon. Also, recurrence of CN was described only rarely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464957">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464957">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712464957">16</xref></sup> However, as a result of their long-term follow-up, Fabrin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464957">6</xref></sup> reported CN recurrence rates exceeding 15%. This suggests that data on CN recurrence are underrepresented in the literature. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the rate of CN recurrence after treatment of acute Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy and to find predisposing factors during the course of therapy.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1071100712464957">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>A monocentric case-control study (recurrence vs no recurrence) was conducted through retrospective review of charts and radiological imaging at a specialized center for multidisciplinary treatment of foot ulcerations and deformity. This study was carried out in accordance with the local institutional ethics committee’s terms of reference. Written informed consent allowing retrospective data analysis was received from all patients enrolled.</p>
<p>Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with and treated for acute CN. Acute CN was defined according to Eichenholz’s stages 0 to 2 (stage 3 at first diagnosis was excluded),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464957">5</xref></sup> showing a progressive-destructive process affecting the osseous arch of the foot including joints and the surrounding soft tissue in patients with sensory neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712464957">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> In patients with a clinical picture suggestive of an infection as the source of inflammation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to confirm the diagnosis of CN. When differentiation between infection and CN was still not possible, osseous biopsies were taken.</p>
<p>After initial cast immobilization, all patients underwent treatment with either orthopedic footwear or orthotic treatment and were seen in our outpatient clinic from January 2005 to June 2012.</p>
<p>From this study, patients with follow-up intervals shorter than 3 months after casting treatment through use of footwear or orthotic treatment were excluded, as were patients with immunosuppressive or osteoactive medication (ie, bisphosphonates), status post arthrodesis of the foot before onset of CN, and amputation proximal to the Lisfranc joint during the course of their treatment.</p>
<p>Fifty-two patients with 57 affected feet met the above criteria and were enrolled in this study. Standard treatment of acute CN consisted of immobilization with a TCC and partial weight-bearing with crutches. With decreasing signs of inflammation, a removable TCC (rTCC) was applied and full-weight bearing was allowed. Edema was treated using elastic bandages and tailored stockings. The course of disease was monitored frequently in our outpatient clinic. When clinical signs of inflammation receded, orthopedic footwear was fitted. If uncertainty remained regarding inflammation, MRI was performed. In patients with severe deformities and when sufficient stability was not achieved by orthopedic footwear, a custom-made ankle–foot orthosis was used. The mean follow-up after initial immobilization and establishment of orthopedic footwear or orthotic treatment was 47 ± 40 months (range, 3-152 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1071100712464957">
<title>Data Acquisition</title>
<p>At first diagnosis of CN, patient specific and demographic characteristics, localization according to Sanders and Frykberg,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712464957">17</xref></sup> and stage of disease according to Eichenholtz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464957">5</xref></sup> were documented. Special focus was put on the presence of obesity (body mass index greater than 30). During the course of therapy, occurrence of ulcerations, the need for wound or reconstructive surgery, noncompliance, and type of subsequent treatment (orthopedic footwear or orthotic treatment) were recorded. Noncompliance was defined as the patient’s refusal of initial continuous immobilization in a TCC; these patients were then treated with an rTCC as many hours per day as accepted. During routine follow-up, the incidence of recurrence of CN was observed and patients were divided into 2 groups: recurrence and no recurrence. Recurrence of CN was present if the previously affected and treated foot showed a new deformity with fragmentation on plain radiographs and/or noninfectious swelling and redness with a corresponding MRI abnormality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712464957">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The stage of disease at first diagnosis and the duration of immobilization before subsequent treatment were determined as potential factors influencing the rate of recurrence, because early and long-lasting immobilization is the suggested therapy for CN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> Additionally, the effects of noncompliance (no immobilization due to patient’s refusal) and obesity (sufficient immobilization not possible) were investigated.</p>
<p>All data were recorded in an Excel database (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) and exported to SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) for statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Where applicable, cross-tabulations of nominal variables were associated with chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Since the considered variables exhibited somewhat nonnormal distributions, a nonparametric analysis by a Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare continuous data. Differences were considered significant for values of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. To determine the prognostic value of 4 factors—noncompliance, obesity, stage of disease at time of first diagnosis, and duration of immobilization before subsequent treatment—an odds ratio with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% was calculated.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Fifty-two patients (age 59 ± 11 years, 16 female) with 57 affected feet were enrolled. Five patients developed CN on the contralateral foot. Patients’ baseline characteristics showed no differences between the “recurrence” and “no recurrence” groups with respect to age, gender, and comorbidities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712464957">Table 1</xref>). Diabetes was the most common reason for sensory neuropathy. Two patients presented with toxic neuropathy due to alcohol and drug abuse, and 1 patient had a chronic radiculopathy in dermatome S1. In 6 patients, sensory neuropathy was confirmed by electroneuromyography but the cause of the dysfunction remained unclear.</p>

<p>Patients with recurrence of CN were immobilized for shorter periods of time than were patients without recurrence (3 ± 3 vs 5 ± 5 months). However, the difference in mean hospitalization periods was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .133). Twelve of 13 feet (92%) that showed signs of recurrence at follow-up had an advanced stage of CN (Eichenholtz greater than 0) at the time of first diagnosis versus 79% in the group without recurrence. This finding as well was not statistically significant given the small number of patients.</p>
<p>Noncompliance was observed during treatment of 9 of 13 feet with recurrence (69%), whereas only 4 of 39 patients without later recurrence (10%) refused immobilization. Patients who did not adhere to the suggested immobilization scheme had an odds ratio of 19.7 (CI, 4.1-94.4; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) to experience recurrence of active CN. Sensitivity of the factor “noncompliance” to predict recurrence was 69% and specificity 90%. The second significant factor to predict the chance of recurrence with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 85% was obesity. Patients with a body mass index greater than 30 had an odds ratio of 6.4 (CI, 1.6-25.9; <italic>P</italic> = .06) to experience recurrence of active CN.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to evaluate possible predictive factors for recurrence of acute CN after subsequent treatment was started. It was shown that the rate of recurrence increased when immobilization was not possible (noncompliance) or was insufficient (obesity). Noncompliance and obesity were strong factors to predict recurrence of CN.</p>
<p>In the past, recurrence of CN was believed to occur only infrequently. In contrast, the few recent studies touching on recurrence of CN report recurrence rates from 12% to 33%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464957">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464957">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464957">6</xref></sup> These results are comparable to those of our study.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the considerable gap between clinical perception of the frequency of recurrence and the reported recurrence rates in the literature and our own study may be a considerable time period between the end of immobilization and the onset of a recurrent episode of CN. A major difficulty is differentiating between re-exacerbation of a nonhealed CN (ie, Eichenholtz stage 2), where immobilization was stopped too soon, and recurrence after complete remission was achieved. This dilemma is especially challenging because the pathogenesis of CN is still poorly understood.</p>
<p>The mean duration of immobilization in our study was in accordance with most of the studies on CN, which report intervals of 4 to 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464957">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464957">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464957">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> The periods of immobilization in patients who experienced a recurrence, however, were rather short. It is therefore possible that some recurrences may have occurred because CN was not in remission at the time when immobilization was first discontinued. In the present study, the determination that osteoarthropathic activity was absent was strengthened by radiographs or MRI in patients for whom the clinical picture seemed unclear. A threshold of 3 months after start of subsequent treatment was used to minimize the chance of mistaking an exacerbation of CN activity as a recurrence. Still, it is possible that residual activity was present in some patients and that a threshold longer than 3 months might have been appropriate.</p>
<p>The fact that both noncompliance (no immobilization due to patient’s refusal) and obesity (sufficient immobilization not possible) were the strongest predictors of recurrence of CN might indicate that the cessation of osteoarthopathic activity was not enough in some of the patients with recurrence in our population.</p>
<p>However, the predisposing factors for CN remain unchanged even after successful treatment of an acute episode. Obesity may aggravate repetitive microtrauma and deformity of the foot and thereby lead to a new onset of CN. It is known that obesity independent of other risk factors is associated with an increased incidence of CN and that weight loss reduces its risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712464957">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Noncompliance as well is a known problem in patients with CN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712464957">13</xref></sup> Diabetes, which was present in most of the patients with recurrence, is associated with impaired and declining cognitive function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712464957">24</xref></sup> This could be a factor connected with noncompliance and is in accordance with the fact that an elevated HbA1c is associated with an increase in risk for CN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464957">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712464957">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>A further risk factor for recurrence that was not assessed in our study is the extent of deformity remaining after the initial treatment. Accordingly, it seems probable that CN feet of obese and noncompliant patients may have had greater deformity.</p>
<p>Further limitations of our study are the retrospective study design and the lack of precise matching of both groups. We did not monitor weight gain during the course of treatment. Although our study population is one of the larger samples in comparison to other studies on CN, the inhomogeneity of patients with this disease may require prospective trials with larger samples. As this was a case-control study, one has to keep in mind that only correlations have been shown and that as long as the origin and pathogenesis of CN remain unclear, it will be difficult to understand causalities. In this regard, there may be other relevant risk factors for recurrence of CN (ie, HbA1c, extent of prior deformity). Yet, our results may help to direct future studies toward the underlying mechanisms that, for example, link obesity to recurrence of CN.</p>
<p>What is important is that recurrence of CN is not uncommon. To trust in clinical signs of remission alone may not be sufficient in all patients. Especially in the obese and in patients with impaired compliance, the clinician has to confirm the absence of osteoarthropathic activity. Some authors advocate measurements of skin temperature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref></sup> whereas some question whether this method is susceptible to confounding factors in patients with CN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464957">12</xref></sup> To avoid recurrence of CN, we recommend the use of imaging methods like MRI or bone scintigraphy before discontinuation of immobilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464957">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464957">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712464957">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Recurrence of osteoarthropathic activity is a possible complication after conservative treatment of CN with subsequent orthopedic footwear or orthoses. Obesity and noncompliance are strong predictors for the recurrence of CN. Early and enduring off-loading with immobilization remains the gold standard in the treatment of CN. Patients with heightened risks for CN before treatment are prone to recurrence, whether exacerbated or reactivated.</p>
