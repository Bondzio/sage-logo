<abstract>
<p>Biventricular repair in right atrial isomerism is rarely feasible due to associated anomalies of venous connection, ventricular imbalance, nonroutabilty of the interventricular communication, a common atrioventricular junction, and inadequate pulmonary arterial branches. These patients are also often not ideal for univentricular repair due to some of the above associations. We describe a novel surgical technique that was utilized in such a patient for biventricular repair of a child with right atrial isomerism with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, regurgitant common atrioventricular valve, hypoplastic left ventricle, nonroutable ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Poor long-term outcomes of univentricular repair in right atrial isomerism are secondary to commonly associated anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, common atrioventricular (AV) junction with its natural history of developing regurgitation, and inadequate branch pulmonary arteries.<sup>

<p>Biventricular repair in right atrial isomerism is also a surgical challenge due to ventricular imbalance and nonroutabilty of the interventricular defect to either great artery, in addition to the other associations hindering univentricular repair. The long-term results of biventricular repair may be superior to those of a univentricular repair despite technical difficulty.<sup>

<title>Material and Method</title>
<p>A 10-year-old-male child weighing 25 kg presented with complaints of dyspnea on exertion, cyanosis, and grade 3 clubbing. His resting oxygen saturation ranged from 75% to 80%. Echocardiogram revealed situs ambiguous, dextrocardia, right atrial isomerism, bilateral superior cava, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) to the right-sided atrium, common atrioventricular valve (CAVV) with moderate-to-severe regurgitation, large inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD) distant from the aorta arising anteriorly from the right ventricle (RV), ventricular inversion, with right-sided hypoplastic left ventricle (LV), double outlet morphological RV with valvar and subvalvar pulmonary stenosis, and stenosis of the right pulmonary artery at its origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112438231">Figure 1</xref>). There was asplenia with bilateral right-sided bronchial arrangement. The schematic depiction of cardiac anatomy is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112438231">Figure 2</xref>. The LV volume was calculated by Simpson method and was found to be 12 mL/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure was measured as 8 mm Hg at cardiac catheterization.</p>

</fig>
<p>In view of significant LV hypoplasia, the initial surgical plan was to attempt repair of the leaking CAVV and perform bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt. Biventricular repair was kept as second option if the AV valve were to prove unrepairable.</p>
<p>On cardiopulmonary bypass with aortobicaval cannulation and aorta cross-clamping and cardioplegic arrest, the left-sided atrium was opened and intracardiac anatomy was inspected. Superior caval drainage into either atrium and pulmonary venous drainage into the right half of the common atrium were confirmed. The AV valve anatomy was Rastelli type C with a large superior bridging undivided common leaflet and a partly divided inferior bridging leaflet. The posterior right-sided ventricle was the smaller of the two. Neither great artery could be seen, looking up through the ventricular cavity and AV valve opening. An Alfieri type stitch at the opposing edges of the bridging leaflets failed to limit the regurgitation as judged by saline injection. Due to the known poor outcome of univentricular repair in the presence of residual AV valve leakage and as we were loath to go for valve replacement along with a univentricular repair, we decided to consider the other option, that is, biventricular repair. We made a judgment that the left component of the CAVV appeared adequate on visual inspection without specific measurement of its dimensions. In view of insufficient literature data on minimal acceptable left ventricular size in AV canal defect, we decided to use this as a marker of LV adequacy. The CAVV was divided into left and right components. The VSD was closed with a boat-shaped Dacron patch without any attempt at visualization of the aorta, which we knew was arising from the RV. The cleft in the left AV valve component was closed. A right ventriculotomy was then performed. The rightward aspect of the VSD patch and the remote conus surrounding the aortic valve were visible. A cruciate incision was made in the VSD patch; the corners were excised to get an opening of approximately 22 mm. This was routed to the aorta using a 22-mm extended polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tube graft of appropriate length. The pulmonary valve was stenotic and the annulus hypoplastic, but amenable to transannular patching. However, it was elected to place an RV to main pulmonary artery (MPA) conduit to provide a competent RV to PA junction. An indigenously constructed RV to PA conduit was used. The conduit was made from a sheet of commercially available bovine pericardium (SJM Biocore Pericardial patch, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA). A trileaflet valve made up of 0.1–mm-thick ePTFE membrane (Gore PRECLUDE pericardial membrane, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was sutured into the tube. The native RV outflow was also retained. The systemic and pulmonary veins were routed to respective AV valves and ventricles using an autologous-treated pericardial baffle. The schematic depiction following repair is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150135112438231">Figure 3</xref>. The patient could be separated from cardiopulmonary bypass without difficulty and shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with stable hemodynamic parameters. The total cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp durations were 387 and 312 minutes, respectively. Transesophageal echo showed good biventricular function, unobstructed outflows, and mild systemic AV valve leakage with no ventricular inflow obstruction.</p>

<p>The patient had a protracted postoperative course secondary to high left atrial pressures (mean of 25 mm Hg) possibly due to hypoplastic LV. Cardiac catheter study done to exclude significant residual anatomic defect did not reveal any structural heart defect except a hypoplastic LV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2150135112438231">Figure 4</xref>). The patient was managed conservatively with sedation, positive pressure mechanical ventilation, and afterload reduction. He was extubated successfully on postoperative day 44 and discharged 10 days later. A permanent dual chamber pacemaker was implanted in view of intermittent AV dissociation.</p>

<title>Comments</title>
<p>The natural history of double outlet of RV with significant regurgitation of the CAVV and with significant cyanosis is not encouraging. It is amply clear that univentricular repair is a poor long-term answer to hearts with regurgitant AV valves especially those guarding the common AV orifice. This is more so if the leakage persists despite valve repair. Even if valve repair is successful in controlling the regurgitation, this is likely to be temporary in the absence of an inferior supporting VSD patch, that is, a ventricular septation. This left us with little option but to go ahead with the repair described above.</p>
<p>Left ventricular volume &lt;20 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, LV/RV long axis ratio of &lt;0.8, and so on,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112438231">5</xref>
</sup> are some of the measurements described to denote cutoff limits for acceptable LV dimensions for successful biventricular repair. However, many of these have been described in relationship to critical aortic stenosis. No such reliable indicators have been described in AV canal defects associated with both arterial connections to the RV. In fact, it has been suggested that in the presence of CAVC with volume-loaded RV, the LV may appear hypoplastic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438231">6</xref>
</sup> The apparently hypoplastic LV may be suitable for biventricular repair. In such a situation, it seemed logical to rely on the size of the left half of the CAVV opening. Successful repair and weaning from bypass proved the broad supposition of left heart adequacy, but the surges in left atrial pressure in the subsequent ICU course also denoted a ventricle inadequate to handle systemic ventricular burden at all ranges of loading. Excellent functional outcome and left ventricular adaptation to its new role at 1-year follow-up are the evidences that support the ability of borderline LV to regain its normal function even at this advanced age.</p>
<p>The other issue was the unroutable interventricular communication. Routing of non-committed VSD to the aorta was first described by Kirklin and Castanada.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112438231">7</xref>
</sup> There are other reports in the literature, where the noncommitted VSD has been routed to the aorta using either VSD translocation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438231">8</xref>
</sup> or multiple patches.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112438231">9</xref>
</sup> The utilization of an intact tube to function as left ventricular outflow, although unconventional and not described before to the best of our knowledge, seems to have some advantage. The tube is not prone to immediate gradients which are otherwise possible in a long intraventricular tunnel following the repair of a 200% double outlet of the RV. One of the criticisms could be the possibility that pseudointima formation could result in progressive gradients. Another criticism could be that such a prosthetic tube is stiff and indistensible in response to the pressure variations of cardiac cycle; be that, as it may, the ePTFE tube in this patient has served its role for a year without any issue. Similar tubes are in routine use on the venous side in extracradiac Fontan connections and have performed well in that location.</p>
<p>A transannular patch would have sufficed in the RV outlet. However, we thought best to avoid pulmonary regurgitation and RV volume overload in the presence of hypoplastic LV and possible residual left AV valve issues and therefore used a conduit with a competent pulmonary valve.</p>
