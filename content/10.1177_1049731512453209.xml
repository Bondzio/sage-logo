<abstract>
<p>Context: The development of a consolidated knowledge base for social work requires rigorous approaches to identifying relevant research. Method: The quality of 10 databases and a web search engine were appraised by systematically searching for research articles on resilience and burnout in child protection social workers. Results: Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) had greatest sensitivity, each retrieving more than double than any other database. PsycINFO and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) had highest precision. Google Scholar had modest sensitivity and good precision in relation to the first 100 items. SSCI, Google Scholar, Medline, and CINAHL retrieved the highest number of hits not retrieved by any other database. Conclusion: A range of databases is required for even modestly comprehensive searching. Advanced database searching methods are being developed but the profession requires greater standardization of terminology to assist in information retrieval.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The need to base practice and policy in the social work profession on a foundation of robust evidence and research is stronger than ever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512453209">Darragh &amp; Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512453209">Lindsey &amp; Kirk, 1992</xref>). Not only do taxpayers, charity donors, politicians, and managers seek evidence of effective outcomes and management of social work services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512453209">Taylor &amp; Campbell, 2011</xref>) but also health service professionals seek evidence of effective psychosocial interventions as alternatives to medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512453209">Layard, Clark, Knapp, &amp; Mayraz, 2007</xref>). A systematic approach is required to the identification, appraisal, synthesis, dissemination, and application of robust research to support decision making within the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512453209">Cook, Mulrow, &amp; Haynes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731512453209">Taylor, 2010</xref>). The focus of this article is on the first of these elements: the systematic identification of relevant research.</p>
<p>Systematic approaches to identifying relevant research are required to ensure that social work practice is based on the best available evidence. The computer age has transformed the processes of accessing research of interest to social work. The ever-increasing volume of published material requires the development of methods to identify material on the computerized data management facilities now available. The busy social worker in any setting requires methods that are efficient as well as effective to identify relevant research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512453209">Beall, 2007</xref>). For this purpose, effectiveness is defined as the capability of a database to identify all the relevant published items on a topic. Efficiency is defined as ensuring that the searcher’s time and efforts are well used for the task of retrieving relevant items, particularly by avoiding the retrieval of irrelevant items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512453209">Hoogendam, de Vries Robbé, Stalenhoef, &amp; Overbeke, 2009</xref>). These qualities are represented here, respectively, by measures of sensitivity (the ability to retrieve as many as possible of the items that you want) and precision (the ability to avoid in the process giving you irrelevant items which you do not want) as defined below. There is limited study on database searching in relation to identifying social work research, where the complexities of practice and the nuances of language across jurisdictions, states, and cultures create particular challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512453209">Bender, Tripodi, Sarteschi, &amp; Vaughn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512453209">Coren, Thomae, &amp; Hutchfield, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512453209">Golder, Mason, &amp; Spilsbury, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731512453209">Taylor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731512453209">Taylor, Dempster, &amp; Donnelly, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731512453209">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049731512453209">Tripodi, Bledsoe, Kim, &amp; Bender, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Ten databases and a popular web search engine that provide abstracts of articles of interest to the profession were evaluated by carrying out a search in relation to resilience and burnout among child protection social workers. This topic lends itself to empirical research using a wide variety of methods as is common in research relevant to social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512453209">Matthews et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, the results of this study on database searching are of interest beyond this particular topic, as a key issue is being able to retrieve material using diverse research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731512453209">Killick &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>). By contrast, systematic reviews that focus on effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731512453209">Taylor, 2012</xref>) are able to capitalize on the search facilities that have been developed specifically to add precision to the retrieval of experimental studies on particular databases. This topic also encapsulated a range of terminology across cultures, organizations, and jurisdictions, as is common in other aspects of social work.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049731512453209" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Judging the availability of articles on a database is not as simple as knowing which journals are abstracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512453209">Crumley, Wiebe, Cramer, Klassen, &amp; Hartling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512453209">Papaioannou, Sutton, Carroll, Booth, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>). There may be inconsistencies in coverage of intended journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512453209">Holden, Barker, Covert-Vail, Rosenberg, &amp; Cohen, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512453209">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512453209">Shek, 2008</xref>) and variations in indexing against the database thesaurus (a standard set of search terms, such as MeSH, against which each article is indexed). In addition, the structure of the thesaurus may itself be more or less useful for particular topics of interest to the profession. The method used here has been designed to enable an appraisal of database quality that takes into account all three of these factors by focusing on what can be retrieved with a relatively sophisticated search. The method is in effect asking a clinical question and analyzing the yield rather than assessing the retrieval of each database against a given pool of articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512453209">Moseley, Sherrington, Elkins, Herbert, &amp; Maher, 2009</xref>). The premise is that the searcher will use the database thesaurus and whatever facilities are available on that database so as to conduct as efficient a search as possible.</p>
<p>Social workers wishing to search for studies using a particular research design are hindered by the fact that most databases of interest have very limited filters regarding methodology. It is not feasible to use database facilities to filter by research method except on one or two databases with more sophisticated filters (such as Medline and PsycINFO) and then only in terms of types of experimental methods. There has been some development in creating search terms to locate studies using qualitative research designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512453209">Fisher, Qureshi, Hardyman, &amp; Homewood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512453209">Flemming &amp; Briggs, 2006</xref>) and the development of established search strings for such concepts is a great asset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512453209">Jenkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512453209">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512453209">Shlonsky, Baker, &amp; Fuller-Thomson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049731512453209">White, Glanville, Lefebvre, &amp; Sheldon, 2001</xref>). Generally, however, searching must be done by topic with subsequent filtering by hand in relation to the more precise question of interest. This study was designed therefore to focus on this type of searching.</p>
<p>The overall study design contained the following stages, the main components of which are described in more detail below.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049731512453209">
<title>The Search Question</title>
<p>The study topic was defined as “an examination of the effectiveness and efficiency of electronic databases for retrieving research on the topic of resilience and burnout amongst child protection social workers.” Turnover and staff retention are key issues at present as undesired turnover has huge human and financial implications as well as the loss of expertise and relationships with clients and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731512453209">Mor Barak, Nissly, &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>). Inexperience in teams and the need to retain competent and committed staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512453209">Ellett, Ellett, Ellis, &amp; Lerner, 2009</xref>) are a high priority in this critical area of social work practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049731512453209">
<title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>To be included, papers had to focus on social workers in child protection or child welfare work. Papers on resilience among other professions and in other areas of social work practice were excluded. Papers had to report empirical research or be reviews of relevant research. Government papers, policy documents, theoretical material, and descriptive case study articles were excluded. It became clear during scoping that a number of relevant empirical studies were available through dissertation publications by research students at master’s and doctoral levels so gray literature was included. Extending the search to this type of gray literature should reduce the potential for publication bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512453209">Burdett, Stewart, &amp; Tierney, 2003</xref>), although it is recognized that this is likely to be less of an issue for social work than for some other areas of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512453209">Egger, Juni, Bartlett, Holenstein, &amp; Sterne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731512453209">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). The studies selected were limited to English language due to the high cost of translation. The study focused on a 10-year time frame: January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049731512453209">
<title>Selection of Databases</title>
<p>Ten academic and professional databases and a web search engine were used for this case study. The selection was influenced by accessibility within our work environment, a scoping exercise and recent guidance from the Social Care Institute for Excellence in London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512453209">Clapton, 2010</xref>). All of these databases include abstracts for articles. The databases included were Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, Index to Theses, Medline, PsycINFO, Social Care Online (SCO), Social Services Abstracts (SSA), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and ZETOC. Google Scholar, a commercial web search engine, was also used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049731512453209">
<title>Development of Search Formulae</title>
<p>The structure for developing search formulae suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512453209">Taylor (2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731512453209">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049731512453209">Taylor, Wylie, Dempster, &amp; Donnelly, 2006</xref>) as developed in guidance by the Social Care Institute Guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512453209">Coren &amp; Fisher, 2006</xref>) was used to turn the review question into concept groups. The four main concepts used were:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>(stress/burnout/workload/fatigue/turnover/retention/exhaustion/depersonalization/) and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(resilience/coping/adjustment/thriving/satisfaction/hardiness/)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(child protection/child care/child welfare/) and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(organization/workplace/supervision/job engagement/work attitudes/).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731512453209">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this general search structure as operationalized on PsycINFO database. It was not possible to use methodological search filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512453209">Shlonsky et al., 2011</xref>) as we were interested in papers on a wide variety of aspects of the topic.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049731512453209-fig1a.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Terms used to express these concepts (i.e., the range of terms within the brackets in the general search structure above) were developed, so as to include international usage during the defined time period and variations in spelling. For example, in United States and Canada studies often refer to “child welfare,” whereas United Kingdom and Australian studies tend to refer to “child protection.” Index terms (MeSH/thesaurus/database/key words) were used where appropriate terms existed, as well as text term searching.</p>
<p>Available database facilities were used to improve precision. Search filters were used where provided by the database to improve precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049731512453209">White et al., 2001</xref>) such as to eliminate articles not indexed as “research” on some databases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049731512453209">
<title>Sensitivity and Precision</title>
<p>The first quality required of a database is its ability to retrieve as many as possible of the published relevant articles on the topic. Sensitivity is a measure of how many of the relevant articles are retrieved by a database. The sensitivity of the search on a particular database is calculated by dividing the number of relevant studies identified on that database by the total number of relevant studies retrieved. The sensitivity might be regarded as the “completeness” of the database in terms of the fraction of the total number of relevant items potentially available that are retrieved by the search on that database. Some authors in information science use the term <italic>recall</italic> for this measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731512453209">Stokes, Foster, &amp; Urquhart 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049731512453209">Vaughan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049731512453209">Walters, 2009</xref>). The term <italic>sensitivity</italic> is used here as it is widely used in disciplines such as health, social care, and psychology with the same meaning as in relation to diagnostic and screening tests.</p>
<p>The second quality required of a database is its ability to avoid retrieving irrelevant items, so that the relevant items are more easily retrieved from among the “hits” produced by the database. This is most appropriately measured in terms of <italic>precision</italic>. <italic>Precision</italic> may be defined as the number of relevant hits identified by a database divided by the total number of hits (relevant and irrelevant) retrieved by that same database search. The <italic>precision</italic> might also be termed the <italic>positive predictive value</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512453209">Haynes &amp; Wilczynski, 2004</xref>), a term used to express this concept in some fields of clinical practice.</p>
<p>It is not possible to use the concept of <italic>selectivity</italic> in relation to database searching with this research design, as in practice the total number of items on the database from which to calculate the total number of irrelevant items is not known. This study uses the terminology and definitions of <italic>sensitivity</italic> and <italic>precision</italic> as used widely in the literature on information retrieval in disciplines such as health care, social work, and psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512453209">Adams, Power, &amp; Lefebvre, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453209">Boynton, Glanville, McDaid, &amp; Lefebvre, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512453209">Dickerson, Scherer, &amp; Lefebvre, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512453209">Golder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512453209">Hay, Adams, &amp; Lefebvre, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512453209">Haynes &amp; Wilczynski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731512453209">Stokes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731512453209">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731512453209">Taylor, Wylie, Dempster, &amp; Donnelly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049731512453209">Watson &amp; Richardson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>For the purposes of a Cochrane Review of the effectiveness of health and social care interventions, one might seek high sensitivity and ignore precision so as to attain as comprehensive inclusion as possible. However, that is only possible because of the limited number of research designs of interest, and because of (1) the availability of search filters designed for this purpose and provided on relevant databases such as Medline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512453209">Minozzi, Pistotti, &amp; Forni, 2000</xref>) and (2) the availability of databases—such as the Cochrane Library—dedicated to studies using these research designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512453209">Hoogendam et al, 2009</xref>). When the focus involves research using other than experimental methods, database facilities are rather more limited. Therefore, searches in social work generally need to seek high precision as well as high sensitivity so that the searcher is not inundated with irrelevant material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512453209">Allison, Kiefe, Weissman, Carter, &amp; Centor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453209">Boynton et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Sensitivity and precision were calculated for each search. In the case of Google Scholar, items deemed relevant by the computer algorithm are rank ordered beyond the control of the user. Sensitivity and precision were calculated for the first 100, 200, and 300 hits on this search engine so as to appraise the value of extending the length and rigor of the search process to include each of these numbers of hits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049731512453209">
<title>Overlap and Unique Relevant Items Identified</title>
<p>If the relevant items retrieved on a particular database were all available on other databases, then that database might be regarded as redundant for the purposes of a search on this topic. The issue of overlap between databases has been studied in relation to various academic disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512453209">Gluck, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512453209">McDonald, Taylor, &amp; Adams, 1999</xref>), more recently using fuzzy set theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512453209">Hood &amp; Wilson, 2003</xref>). For the present purpose, the main point of interest is whether a database is worth using because it uniquely identifies relevant articles not retrieved by any other database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049731512453209">Topfer et al., 1999</xref>). The number of <italic>unique relevant items identified</italic> was calculated for each database as a measure of how many items would be missed if that database were not used.</p>

<p>The total number of relevant articles retrieved across all the databases was 69 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731512453209">Table 1</xref>). This figure was used to calculate the sensitivity of the searches. Column 2 of the table gives the number of relevant items (of this 69) retrieved on each database.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In relation to Google Scholar, sensitivity and precision were calculated in relation to the first 100, 200, and 300 hits retrieved and these are labeled GS100, GS200, and GS300, respectively in the table. It needs to be acknowledged that databases are designed for different purposes and the data presented here must be viewed with this in mind. In particular, the Cochrane Library is designed only to contain systematic reviews of the highest quality experimental studies of the effectiveness of interventions.</p>
<p>Although this study did not explicitly compare database facilities, it was apparent that there were few filters available for identifying research on the databases. While Medline had admirable filters for identifying various experimental designs, it did not facilitate a search for research using qualitative designs or “research” in general. A search filter, where available, for “research” was perhaps the single most useful filter.</p>
<sec id="section10-1049731512453209">
<title>Sensitivity</title>
<p>ASSIA, SSA, and SSCI had the highest sensitivity retrieving about 30 relevant hits each, and each locating about 40–45% of the relevant items. CINAHL was next most sensitive retrieving about half as many hits (20% sensitivity). Each of the three Google Scholar searches were next most sensitive, each retrieving about a third of the number of hits as the most sensitive databases, followed closely by PsycINFO and Medline. SCO produced just one relevant hit. The Cochrane Library, Index to Theses, and ZETOC produced no relevant hits. Studies reported in theses that are included here as relevant hits were found through searching other databases, not Index to Theses. Extending the Google Scholar search from 100 to 200 items gave only one additional item on top of the 10 already retrieved, and extending it from 200 to 300 items gave no additional sensitivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049731512453209">
<title>Precision</title>
<p>CINAHL and PsycINFO had the highest precision, equaled by the search of the first 100 Google Scholar items. Generally, precision was low.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049731512453209">
<title>Unique Relevant Items Identified</title>
<p>SSCI produced the highest number (13) of unique relevant items not retrieved by any other database, almost double the seven retrieved by the Google Scholar searches. This in turn was nearly double the next nearest databases in terms of unique items retrieved: Medline and CINAHL at four each. A searcher could omit using SSA and SCO without missing any relevant hits. A searcher would miss only one by omitting ASSIA or two by omitting PsycINFO if all other searches were conducted in each case.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study of database performance embodied a wide range of databases and a commercial web search engine. The relevance of social work to the intended scope of the databases varied and the databases have different journal coverage. What this study has achieved is to view each of these databases in terms of its practical usefulness for retrieving relevant material on the topic used for this case study. It cannot be assumed that a database designed for social work will be more useful than one designed for a broader range of social sciences or for other health and social care professions. This has been tested through this study.</p>
<p>Due to resource constraints, it was not possible to include Social Work Abstracts or ProQuest Digital Dissertations as these were not available in our work environment. These purchasing decisions may reflect perceived utility in relation to cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512453209">Flatley, Lilla, &amp; Widner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512453209">Holden et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512453209">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512453209">Shek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731512453209">Taylor, 2009</xref>), although we were not privy to such decision making. Searching EMBASE was not regarded as cost effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049731512453209">Topfer et al., 1999</xref>). The searches produced a number of relevant unpublished dissertations. Dissertation results are included in the ASSIA and SSA hits which are both ProQuest products, and it may be that subscription to these services provided unofficial access to <italic>Dissertation Abstracts International</italic>. PubMed was not included, as our advice was that this basically would have given us Medline in a different format, but with substantially the same content for our purposes.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that the databases have different target audiences and purposes. While performance in this case study might give an indication of utility in relation to some social work topics, performance of a database in relation to its intended audience and purpose might be considerably different. In particular, the Cochrane Library is designed only for systematic reviews of the effectiveness of health and social care interventions. SCO and SSA are the only two of those used designed specifically for social work and social care. As social science databases, ASSIA and SSCI might be regarded as designed for social work as an academic discipline. Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL are targeted toward allied professions, and it is an asset for the profession that these abstract so much relevant social work material. Google Scholar and ZETOC are more generic data search engines, and search mechanisms such as these are perhaps likely to improve in quality in future.</p>
<p>Sensitivity was greatest on ASSIA, SSA, and SSCI. These databases were the most fruitful in retrieving articles relevant to this aspect of practice. British researchers may be disappointed at the low number of relevant items retrieved on SCO, a service provided by the Social Care Institute for Excellence, which is a government body charged with disseminating knowledge and developing guidance to promote high standards of practice. PsycINFO and CINAHL had the highest precision on this topic out of the conventional databases, but generally precision was disappointingly low. Index to Theses did not prove worth using, even though we planned to include gray literature.</p>
<p>A complex search across multiple databases was required in order to achieve comprehensive identification of relevant research. SSCI, Google Scholar, Medline, and CINAHL produced the highest number of unique hits (those not retrieved by any other database). Although the SSCI had high sensitivity, the other databases did not, reinforcing the importance of using a wide range of databases for comprehensive searching on social work topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512453209">Kemp &amp; Bustman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731512453209">Mendelsohn, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512453209">Stevinson &amp; Lawlor, 2004</xref>). We did not use any more complex measure of overlap between databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512453209">Egghe &amp; Goovaerts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512453209">Gluck, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512453209">Hood &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>) although this should be considered for future studies.</p>
<p>The lack of a large, international database with anything approaching a high level of sensitivity is a major challenge for the profession. Efficient retrieval of a reasonably comprehensive range of research is an essential underpinning for any systematic review of best evidence to inform practice and policy. The number of relevant items retrieved on only one database (unique hits) confirms the need to use a number of databases for comprehensive searching, confirming studies on other social work topics and in related professional disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512453209">Brettle &amp; Long, 2001</xref>; Mcdonald et al., 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512453209">Stevinson &amp; Lawlor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731512453209">Subirana, Solá, Garcia, Gich, &amp; Urrútia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731512453209">Taylor, Wylie, Dempster &amp; Donnelly 2007</xref>). These types of searches across multiple databases will require social work professionals to engage with librarians and information scientists increasingly if we are to be able to avail of the ever-increasing volume of published material.</p>
<p>One measure that would help curb the complexity of searching required would be if the profession could develop a more restricted and standardized vocabulary for key concepts, particularly those used in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512453209">Brown &amp; Sönksen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512453209">Curran, Burchardt, Knapp, McDaid, &amp; Li, 2007</xref>). This will become increasingly urgent if the generic web search engines mentioned above come to have a more prominent place in knowledge retrieval for the profession. At the point in time of conducting the search, it is not possible for the searcher to maximize both sensitivity and precision. This can be illustrated graphically using receiver operator characteristic curves, which are used in various fields to conceptualize the ability of a system to discriminate between the “wanted items” and the “noise” from which the signals must be differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512453209">Allison et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512453209">Centor, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731512453209">Taylor, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>It was a worthwhile exercise to run the three searches on Google Scholar, so as to appraise the merit of using this search engine for this purpose. The sensitivity was modest, being about a third of that achieved by the three best databases, but slightly better than PsycINFO and Medline. It was noteworthy that using the second and third hundred hits on Google Scholar gave very little more return than the first hundred. Using the first 100 items retrieved on Google Scholar gave good precision, making this a good search facility for more limited, rather than comprehensive searching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512453209">Haynes, McKibbon, Wilczynski, Walter, &amp; Were, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049731512453209">Wong, Wilczynski, Haynes, &amp; Ramkissoonsingh, 2003</xref>). Given the capacity to search the web pages of all journals on the World Wide Web, this suggests that the Google Scholar search algorithm, of which the user has limited knowledge and control, has sacrificed sensitivity for precision. This finding might be viewed in the context of the literature on rapid versus extensive searching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731512453209">Royle &amp; Milne, 2003</xref>). Google Scholar was commendable in retrieving the third highest number of unique hits, highlighting its importance as a search tool on this topic. This finding of the reasonable sensitivity and high precision of Google Scholar confirms studies in other topic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049731512453209">Walters, 2009</xref>). It may be that other search engines and meta-search engines (such as AltaVista, Ask.com, Dogpile, Metacrawler, and Yahoo) should be included in future studies of research retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512453209">Kumar &amp; Pavithra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512453209">Robinson &amp; Wusteman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049731512453209">Vaughan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The range of research methods used in the papers retrieved confirms the validity of this approach to constructing searches to identify social work research and the validity of appraising the quality of databases by the methods used in this case study. The methodology used here in effect appraises both the article coverage of the database, the quality of indexing (where this is provided), and the search facilities available. For practical purposes, all these dimensions are important for effective and efficient retrieval. However, it must be borne in mind that the complexity of the searches employed here are likely to require the assistance of a librarian or information scientist. The busy professional is unlikely to have the time or skills to create such sophisticated searches.</p>
<p>The findings of this case study can be compared with two previous database searching case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731512453209">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731512453209">2007</xref>) as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512453209">Table 2</xref>, both of which were on the topic of professional decision making on the admission of older people to institutional care (out of home placement).</p>

<p>As databases are designed for a particular readership, one might expect sensitivity to vary across databases according to the topic. The highest sensitivity on this topic of resilience among child protection social workers was achieved by ASSIA, SSA, and SSCI; in the case studies cited above on decision making about the long-term care of older people, Medline and SSCI had highest sensitivity (ASSIA was not included in those studies). The tentative conclusion might be that SSA is more suited to an organizational topic related to social work services, while Medline is more suited to a clinical topic, particularly where there is an obvious interface with health services. SSCI proved itself on both types of question, although ASSIA has not yet been tested on a more clinical topic using this method. CINAHL achieved reasonable sensitivity on both types of topic.</p>
<p>In general, this study did not achieve the levels of precision achieved on the earlier cited studies by Taylor and colleagues. This suggests that the concepts in this study were harder to define or that the terminology is less clearly defined in the literature. Otherwise no consistent picture emerged regarding precision of searching.</p>
<p>Google Scholar is freely available through the World Wide Web and therefore accessible to all practitioners and researchers even if they have limited access to other electronic databases. The findings of this study shed some positive light on the utility of using this resource.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The best evidence to inform social work practice is not a luxury; it should be a foundation for professional and management decisions. On this particular topic, we need to know how the workforce is best managed and supported to do a critical job in child protection social work. Systematic reviews of best evidence need to become a much more regular part of the reading of social workers, their managers, and policy makers.</p>
<p>This study illustrated the need to search a number of databases for comprehensive searching on this topic, echoing the results of earlier studies. The availability on a database of a search filter for “empirical research” is an asset when searching for research relevant to social work. The gradual development of established strings of search terms to capture common concepts (such as qualitative research) helps to improve the quality of searching. The performance of the publicly available web search engine Google Scholar suggests that such web search engines and meta-search engines should be included in future studies of professional information retrieval. It seems likely that web search engines will become increasingly important for this task in the future.</p>
<p>Finding few relevant articles for an undergraduate essay is straightforward, provided the database has reasonable sensitivity and the searcher modest patience. The challenge, however, is in any context where a reasonably comprehensive search is required to develop a sound knowledge base, such as PhD theses, preparation for research projects, service improvement plans, policy documents, and development of professional guidelines and assessment tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731512453209">Taylor, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To underpin systematic reviews of best evidence, the social work profession needs to develop knowledge and skills in identification of relevant research. This does not relate only to systematic reviews addressing questions of effectiveness, such as those published by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Campbell Collaboration, crucial as these are. The profession also needs the capability to know the best evidence for questions of prevalence, change, perceptions, and processes which might be addressed by research designs other than experimental ones. Database searching is generally more complex in social work than in health care disciplines as the terminology is not so clearly defined; is more likely to change with time; and is less likely to be agreed internationally due to variations in language use across states and cultures. This increases the need for knowledge and skills in database searching to support the profession. The ability to identify relevant research must become a priority if we wish to ensure that the best available knowledge is accessible to inform practitioners, researchers, educators, and policy makers, for the ultimate benefit of the clients and families whom we serve.</p>
