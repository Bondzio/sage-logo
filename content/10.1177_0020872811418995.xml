<title>Background</title>
<p>In recent years, there have been increasing demands for international and cultural competency training in social work education programs around the world. Recognizing the importance of cultural competency, the <italic>Global Standards for the Education and Training of the Social Work Profession</italic> of the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) stipulates the following: ‘recognition and development of indigenous or locally specific social work education and practice from the traditions and cultures of different ethnic groups and societies, insofar that such traditions and cultures do not violate human rights’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811418995">Sewpaul and Jones, 2005</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>Despite the increasing demands for cultural competency in social work training, social work educational programs in many countries have not appeared to move steadily in the direction of incorporating a new vision of social work practice within cross-cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811418995">Nagy and Falk, 2000</xref>). Social work in South Korea has been rapidly growing due to a major increase in social problems, such as poverty, discrimination, violation of human rights, and so forth. According to the Korean Association of Social Workers, a ‘social worker’ in South Korea is defined by the Social Welfare Law, Article 11, as a professional who possesses expertise and skills related to the welfare of society. Although the issues of multiculturalism and diversity have been raised as a result of the rising rate of immigration along with a number of recent social problems such as an increasingly aging population, only a handful of programs in major universities such as the Seoul National University and Ewha Womans [Women’s] University have incorporated international and multicultural contents in their social work curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Struggles that are frequently experienced by migrants and non-South Korean residents attest to a critical need to incorporate cultural competency in social work education and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>). This article underscores the importance of incorporating cultural competency in social work education and practice. We begin with a brief discussion of theoretical frameworks for understanding cultural competency, which is followed by demographic profiles of non-South Korean residents and a background of social work education in South Korea. We then examine the reality of incorporating cultural competency in South Korean social work education programs. Suggestions for effectively incorporating cultural competency in South Korean social work programs are also included.</p>

<sec id="section2-0020872811418995">
<title>Cultural competency: Definition and theoretical framework</title>
<p>In the United States, there have been increasing demands for cultural competency in social work training due to the rapidly growing diverse population. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of Ethics, which sets the ethical standards for the social work profession in the US, includes evidence of social workers’ growing recognition of the importance of acquiring cultural competence in training and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811418995">Weaver, 1999</xref>: 12). Cultural competence in social work research and practice has become a required standard in the United States when working with diverse racial and ethnic groups. According to the NASW Code of Ethics, cultural competence is a process by which individuals and systems respond respectfully and effectively to people of all cultures, languages, classes, races, ethnicities, nationalities, religions, etc. in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values the worth of individuals, families, and communities and protects and preserves the dignity of each. NASW also stipulates that culturally competent social workers must be cognizant of cultural differences; they must reflect on their own cultural identity and biases, and be aware of the dynamics of difference in others and the development of professional knowledge when working with diverse clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811418995">Lu et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of theories and models of cultural competence and related constructs, such as ‘cultural sensitivity’ and ‘multicultural practices’, have emerged in social work in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811418995">Boyle and Springer, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811418995">Green (1982)</xref> defined cultural competency as the ability to provide professional services in a way that is consistent with the culture of the client, which requires workers’ ability to adapt their professional tasks and work styles to the cultural values of their clients.</p>
<p>A number of recent researchers have developed several theoretical frameworks for social workers in the United States to strengthen cultural competency. One example is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811418995">Lu and colleagues (2001)</xref> who set criteria for cultural competency, including: (1) awareness of ethnic and cultural experiences that are an integral part of the personal and professional socialization and education of the social worker; (2) knowledge related to culturally diverse practice; (3) skills related to working with culturally diverse clients; and (4) inductive learning that forms a continuum of heuristic information on culturally diverse persons, events, and places (pp. 4–5). Cultural competency can also be understood as a process that integrates attitudes, knowledge, and skills to effectively assist clients achieve behavioral and emotional changes or ‘bi-culturalization integration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811418995">Kwong, 2009</xref>). According to this theory, clinical knowledge is the foundation for cultural competency; hence, social workers must incorporate their clinical skills to fit them for a target population. This clinical–cultural integrative process solidifies practical processes for social workers to utilize.</p>
<p>Multicultural education promotes the right to equal opportunity in education; affirms equity and full inclusion; calls for elimination of all types of discrimination; encourages respect for all color, cultures, and creed; and demands the guarantee of fundamental human rights and dignities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811418995">Kang, 2010</xref>). Considering that multicultural education is a prerequisite for culturally competent social work practice, there is a critical need to understand the present situation of ‘multicultural’ population and social work education in South Korea, and to call for cultural competency training in South Korean social work education.</p>

<title>‘Multicultural’ population</title>
<p>Throughout history, Koreans have developed a sense of nation based on sanguine ties and common ancestry, and the Korean nation was ‘racialized’ through a belief in a common origin that produced a sense of collective oneness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811418995">Shin, 2006</xref>). Although ethnicity and race are distinguished in multicultural societies, such as the United States, this is not so for the Koreans. Instead the Koreans, like the Japanese, believe that they all belong to a ‘unitary nation’ (<italic>tan’il minjok</italic>), characterized as being ethnically homogeneous and racially distinctive. Thus, South Korea remained a homogeneous country for several centuries with relatively few non-South Korean residents in South Korea. However, rapid industrialization and economic growth in South Korea in recent years have generated major changes in South Korean demographics. Despite several tragic events that befell the Korean peninsula during the first half of the twentieth century such as Japanese imperialism (1910–1945), the Korean War (1950–1953), and decades of military dictatorship, South Korea emerged as one of the four newly industrialized countries (NICs) along with Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore in the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>). South Korea’s success story in a relatively short period of time earned its reputation as the ‘Miracle of the Han River’. Today, South Korea is recognized as a world leader in information and technology.</p>
<p>As the thirteenth largest economy in the world, South Korea has attracted migrants and refugees from countries such as the People’s Republic of China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. According to the Ministry of Justice (2000), the total number of laborers from Third World countries increased from 6,409 in 1987 to 243,363 in 2000 (as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811418995">Seol, 2000</xref>). Since 2000, the number of foreign migrant workers in South Korea has increased rapidly. The number of foreign migrant workers rose from 115,466 in 2002 to 528,812 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811418995">Kwon, 2009</xref>). As of 2009, among the 696,817 foreign migrant workers who entered South Korea, 36,921 (5.3 percent) were employed as professionals while 659,896 (94.7 percent) worked in low-skilled jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872811418995">Seol, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of inter-national marriages between South Korean men and other Asian women has also risen significantly since the late 1990s. According to the Korean Statistical Information Service, inter-national marriages increased from 3.2 percent in 1997 to 13.6 percent in 2007. Of these, marriage between South Korean men and foreign women constituted 75.7 percent of all inter-national marriages, which also resulted in an increasing number of mixed-race children in South Korea. According to the Korean National Statistics Office, South Korea saw the number of mixed-race children increasing at schools across the nation from 7,998 (30.6 percent) in 2006 to 13,445 (119.7 percent) in 2007 (as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811418995">Kang, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these groups frequently experience discrimination, abuse, and human rights violation in South Korean society, with little or no recourse, mainly due to language and cultural barriers. Social workers are in a position to ‘advocate for the inclusion of marginalized, socially excluded, disposed, vulnerable, and at-risk members of society and to address and challenge barriers, inequalities, and injustices …’ as stated by the IFSW (Sewpaul and Jones, 2004). However, given the major lack of research regarding cultural competency in social work practice in South Korea, much is unknown about the degree to which South Korean social work professionals have taken a stance against the prevailing cultural values and paradigms that reinforce racist and xenophobic sentiments. The question then remains: to what degree are social workers in South Korea educationally prepared to meet these challenges?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872811418995">
<title>Social work education in South Korea</title>
<p>A social work education program in South Korea was first established in 1947 at Ewha Womans [Women’s] University when a limited number of classes in casework were offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811418995">Hong et al., n.d.</xref>). The program at Ewha Womans University followed the direction of social work education programs in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811418995">Chǒn, 2004</xref>). Several major universities in South Korea, notably Seoul National University and Yonsei University, subsequently established schools of social work in 1958 and 1980 respectively.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1980s that social work became recognized as a ‘legitimate’ profession. Concerns about income inequality and relative poverty stemming from the adverse effects of rapid industrialization and urbanization prompted greater demands for social adequacy and economic satisfaction in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811418995">Chi, 1987</xref>). To meet society’s demands, the social work workforce has increased with a growth rate of 50 percent annually within the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872811418995">Korea Association of Social Workers, 2005</xref>). In the 1980s, there were only about 600 licensed social workers in South Korea, but in 2004 the number rose to 85,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872811418995">Shim et al., 2009</xref>). In 2001, there were 77 graduate and 101 undergraduate programs in social work and social welfare, and the 64 vocational schools offering a specialized program in social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872811418995">Kwon, 2004</xref>) increased to more than 369 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811418995">Korean Academy of Social Welfare, 2007</xref>). These programs produced more than 15,000 social workers in 2004 and approximately 45,000 licensed social workers in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811418995">Choi et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, a handful of programs in South Korean schools have included classes in international and multicultural social work in the curriculum. The Graduate School of Social Welfare at Ewha Womans University, for example, offers classes such as ‘International Social Work’, ‘International Cooperation for Regional Development’, ‘Cultural Diversity and Social Work Practice’, and ‘Regional Study and International Volunteerism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the major focus of social work education in South Korea has been to prepare students for the Social Worker Licensure Examination rather than train students to effectively provide culturally relevant social services. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811418995">Han and Hong (n.d.)</xref> argue, despite establishment of the social work licensure system, there is a critical lack of a qualification system that fosters social work specialization that meets global standards in a wide range of fields, such as cultural competency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872811418995">
<title>Applicability of cultural competency training in South Korea</title>
<p>There has been much discussion and implementation of multicultural education in South Korea in recent years. Although there have been a number of books and research studies on multicultural education in South Korea, there exists relatively little concrete information that would provide guidance for preparing social work students and professionals for culturally competent practice with a ‘multicultural’ population.</p>
<p>The critical lack of educational information regarding culturally competent social work practice with racially and ethnically diverse populations in South Korea is attributed to the fact that South Koreans have been taught since elementary school that they are racially and ethnically homogeneous – a belief which most South Koreans have taken for granted. South Korean children are taught in elementary school that Koreans are of the Han race and therefore have the same ancestry and bloodline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811418995">Kang, 2008</xref>). The major goal of multicultural education in culturally pluralistic societies such as Europe, Canada, and the United States is harmonious co-existence. In South Korea, ‘multiculturalism’ is a relatively recent phenomenon. Foreign immigrants and ethnic minorities in South Korea, like their counterparts in the United States who underwent assimilation and mainstreaming, are often forced to abandon their traditional cultural heritage in order to adjust to the mainstream society.</p>
<p>Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811418995">Boyle and Springer (2001)</xref> pointed out, empirical measurement of educational outcomes is essential for the development of multicultural awareness and cultural competency. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus in South Korea regarding what would be considered an appropriate and effective training program or about how the outcomes of such training are to be assessed empirically. To date, there has been little focus among social work researchers directed toward developing psychometrically sound instruments for assessing and evaluating cultural competency training and multicultural practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811418995">Boyle and Springer (2001)</xref> also argued that little has been done in the United States about measuring cultural competence skill development in social work. In the case of South Korea, this may be attributed to the fact that there are only a handful of social work classes that minimally cover cross-cultural and multicultural social work practice.</p>
<p>And finally, a number of researchers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811418995">Ellsworth, 1989</xref>), argue that cultural competency requires an in-depth exploration of oppression (pedagogy of oppression) with its multiple realities. Similar to the United States, however, such exploration generates fear and resistance in students’ learning, vulnerability, misunderstanding, guilt, and resentment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811418995">Tatum, 1992</xref>). When confronted with the reality of oppression, students either embrace or reject early in the process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811418995">Schmitz and colleagues (2001)</xref> warn that unless students are able to accept the reality of oppression and are guided in separating the ugliness of oppression from the strength of diversity, they will not be fully equipped with cultural competency. Because the issue of immigration is relatively recent in South Korea, students have little opportunity to experience the reality of oppression for two reasons: (1) there are relatively few (if any) foreign students in South Korean social work programs, and (2) consequently South Korean students have limited contact with foreigners in the classroom, and little opportunity to directly explore diverse viewpoints and experiences of minorities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811418995">Schmitz et al. (2001)</xref> warn, unless social work students are given the opportunity to explore their understanding of the impact of oppression and the value of diversity, they will not have a context for the application of cultural competency</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0020872811418995">
<title>Suggestions for cultural competency training in South Korea</title>
<p>In spite of the barriers to inclusion of cultural competency in social work education, cultural competency training is nevertheless becoming an important element of social work educational programs in South Korea. Following are several suggestions to consider when moving towards cultural competency training in South Korea. First, require cultural competency training on multiple social work educational levels: baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral, as well as in the social work licensure examination system. Social work graduates who become practitioners, administrators, and academicians all need to have cultural competency education to be effective. In order to train social work students in South Korea to be culturally competent, educators must consistently educate themselves about problems that ethnic minorities and immigrants frequently encounter such as domestic violence, discrimination, and poverty. To instill a substantive understanding of the importance of cultural competency, educators must also actively reach out and involve these groups in educating social work students (e.g. acting as a guest speaker).</p>
<p>Second, include cultural competency knowledge, skills, values, and ethics content throughout all classes required for the social work degree. Cultural competency content in practice, human behavior, policy, and research classes grounds the student in a broader perspective that fosters professional effectiveness with the diverse populations in South Korea. Cultural competency content may be infused throughout the required classes or offered as specific required classes. Social work practicum in South Korea offers students a wide range of social work-related experiences at various types of social services agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811418995">Han and Hong, n.d.</xref>). Students need to have the opportunity to experience and demonstrate cultural competency when working with ethnic minorities at their practicum site. Social work practicum must include cultural competency, particularly for those students interested in working with ethnic minorities and immigrants and using their knowledge and skills to bring about changes for the betterment of these groups.</p>
<p>Third, conduct research and develop cultural competency perspectives, paradigms, and models that target the current and projected incoming ethnic minority populations. South Korean researchers in recent years have conducted extensive research on the prevalence and problems of ethnic minorities and immigrants. By comparison, there are relatively fewer studies regarding the efficacy of interventions and social services designed specifically for ethnic minorities and immigrants. Social work scholars need to conduct research on social work practice that can effectively meet the needs of ethnic minority and immigrant populations. Perhaps an appropriate beginning is to evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of the existing intervention programs and social services for ethnic minorities and immigrants in South Korea.</p>
<p>Fourth, cultural competency can be best achieved through joint collaboration and partnerships between social workers and social services for ethnic minorities and immigrants in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>). Recently, social work programs in South Korea have actively established ties with international organizations and civic groups for oppressed groups. In addition, we recommend that social work programs forge partnerships with leaders in the minority and immigrant communities to address their needs and to determine what are effective and culturally relevant services. We also suggest that social work educational programs empower these disenfranchised groups by actively recruiting talented and qualified ethnic minority and immigrant students to be involved in the change. To our knowledge, South Korean social work programs have not actively established joint collaborations and partnerships with disenfranchised communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, anchor cultural competency education on a broad Asian-centric foundation that takes into consideration the immigrants’ many countries of origin. While it is understandable to want to focus cultural competency training on the larger immigrant groups, the smallest group should be included also as we promote social justice.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a response to an escalating demand to alleviate social problems, the South Korean government has been rapidly expanding its social expenditure by increasing social insurances and social services. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea spent 7.87 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP) on social expenditure, which rose from 5.3 percent in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872811418995">OECD, 2008</xref>). Over the past 20 years, the government increased its expenditure on social welfare from 2.9 percent in 1986 to 6.7 percent in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811418995">Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2006</xref>) to increase public services for vulnerable populations, including the elderly, the disabled, and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811418995">Choi et al., 2009</xref>). At the community level, about 400 community-based nonprofit social service centers nationwide have been operating, which include an array of services for the vulnerable population. These community-based centers provide services for the disabled (130 centers) and the elderly (190 centers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811418995">Choi et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, there are 63 international non-governmental organizations that provide services for non-Korean residents in South Korea, such as Puchǒn Migrant Workers’ Welfare Center, Nepal-Kyung Hee Goodwill Hospital, UNICEF Korea, and United Help for International Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418995">Hong and Han, 2009</xref>). In addition, the South Korean government has subsidized a number of programs that facilitate adjustment for immigrants and multicultural families, such as scholarships for Korean language classes in major universities, as well as after-school Korean language classes for school-age children of foreign migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811418995">Kim, 2001</xref>). Although providing these services and incentives for ethnic minorities and immigrants are first steps, the development of cultural competency and ‘multicultural education’ in South Korean social work educational programs still has a long way to go.</p>
<p>This article demonstrates that the changing demographics of the South Korean society necessitate training social workers who can effectively provide services for diverse clients. The South Korean society has evolved from the days of a military dictatorship to a constitutional democracy, and the government respects the rights of its citizens. Unfortunately however, it is difficult for non-South Koreans to be fully accepted, and legal protection for ethnic minorities and immigrants is often weak. As a result, many ethnic minorities and immigrants in South Korea struggle to adjust to their new homeland. Discrimination, exploitation, abuse, and human rights violations are unfortunately social problems that ethnic minorities, immigrants, foreign brides, and mixed-race people in South Korea frequently encounter. Although a number of social services and government subsidies for multicultural families have been expanded since the 1990s, social work education in South Korea has not effectively equipped social workers to address these problems from a culturally competent perspective. Perhaps the first step is to raise awareness in social work education of the importance of multicultural and cultural competency training, which would go hand-in-hand with achieving equality and social justice for all.</p>
