<abstract>
<p>No current national data exist to characterize safety-net physicians and their attitudes toward and participation in quality improvement activities compared with non–safety-net physicians. The authors conducted a national random sample survey of internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics primary care physicians (PCPs) and used weighted multivariable regression models to assess attitudes and participation in quality improvement activities. After multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences in provider attitudes about or participation in quality improvement activities between safety-net and non–safety-net physicians. However, safety-net providers were almost twice as likely to look for racial/ethnic disparities in care within their practices and are as likely to be involved in quality improvement activities as non–safety-net providers; their attitudes are consistent with providing equitable and universal care. Increasing access by expanding Medicaid eligibility will require continued investment in the number and training of safety-net PCPs.</p>

<body>
<p>More than 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612451048">1</xref></sup> Without universal coverage, a de facto safety net exists, consisting of individual physicians and organizations that disproportionately care for uninsured and underinsured populations, including many racial/ethnic minorities and patients who live in geographically or economically disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its report on the state of the safety net found a financially precarious system with an insufficient number of providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612451048">2</xref></sup> Medicaid, a major component of the safety net, has suffered from chronic underfunding over the years while demand continues to rise, thereby further stressing this fragile system.</p>
<p>To address this problem, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (commonly referred to as the ACA) aims to ensure almost universal health insurance coverage. Increased insurance coverage will be accomplished through an individual mandate for people to purchase insurance privately, through their employer, or through insurance exchanges. In addition, ACA expands Medicaid eligibility to all adults with family incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612451048">3</xref></sup> In some areas, safety-net providers are likely to be the main source of health care for current and future Medicaid patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612451048">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612451048">4</xref></sup> However, because of a number of historical physician workforce issues, including the uneven geographical distribution of physicians, many physicians may not have the capacity or willingness to accept new patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451048">5</xref></sup> An overall shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs) may result in poor access to primary care for the newly insured.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that physicians who care for a disproportionate share of vulnerable populations may provide lower quality care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612451048">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612451048"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612451048">9</xref></sup> Given the role these providers are likely to play in caring for the newly insured, it is imperative to empirically understand who these providers are, what their quality improvement attitudes and activities are, and which physicians potentially will accept new Medicaid patients. To date, no national data exist on this topic.</p>
<p>To address this issue, the authors analyzed a nationally representative sample of US PCPs who were surveyed as part of a physician professionalism study. Among the goals of this study were to empirically describe the primary care safety net, to assess which PCPs were willing to accept newly insured Medicaid patients, and to examine the quality-related attitudes and activities of PCPs. This insight could inform the implementation of ACA mandates.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1062860612451048">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The questionnaire was a revised version of a 2004 physician professionalism survey that assessed a broad range of physician attitudes and behaviors related to physician professionalism; the questionnaire’s design, testing, and administration are described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612451048">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612451048">12</xref></sup> The authors revised the 2004 survey instrument based on findings from 4 focus groups involving 40 physicians and recommendations from an interdisciplinary expert advisory group comprising 15 members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860612451048">
<title>Survey Sample</title>
<p>The American Medical Association 2008 Masterfile was used to identify all US physicians in primary care (internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics) and 4 non–primary care specialties (cardiology, general surgery, psychiatry, and anesthesiology). The following groups were excluded: all doctors of osteopathy, resident physicians, physicians in federally owned hospitals, those with no address, those who requested not to be contacted, and those who were retired. From this pool of eligible participants, the authors randomly selected 500 physicians within each of the 7 specialties (total sample = 3500).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612451048">
<title>Survey Administration</title>
<p>The survey was administered by mail and a $20 incentive was paid. Of the 3500 sampled physicians, 562 were ineligible because they were deceased, out of the country, practicing a non-sampled specialty, on leave, or not currently providing patient care. A total of 1891 of the remaining 2938 eligible physicians submitted surveys, yielding an overall response rate of 64.4%. The response rate for PCPs (internal medicine, pediatrics, and family practice) was 66.9%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1062860612451048">
<title>Defining the Safety Net</title>
<p>The IOM qualitatively defined safety-net providers as those for whom a “substantial share of their patient mix is uninsured, Medicaid and other vulnerable patients.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612451048">2p21</xref></sup> Consistent with previous research, the IOM definition was operationalized as those who reported having a patient panel with more than 20% uninsured and/or Medicaid patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612451048">13</xref></sup> To create this variable, physicians were asked, “Approximately what percentage of your patients is covered by Medicaid?” A separate question was asked about the percentage of their patients who were uninsured and unable to pay. In addition, physicians were asked if they were “currently accepting Medicaid patients and/or uninsured patients who are unable to pay?” The response categories were “yes” and “no” for each question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612451048">
<title>Physician Personal, Professional, and Practice Characteristics</title>
<p>The survey used standard survey questions to collect data on physician characteristics, including sex, underrepresented minority status (all races other than white and Asian), number of years in practice (less than 10, 10-19, 20-29, 30 years or more), graduation from a medical school outside the United States or Canada, specialty (family practice, internal medicine, and pediatrics), income (less than $100 000, $100 000-$150 000, $150 001-$200 000, $200 001-$250 000, $250 001-$300 000, and more than $300 000), practice organization (hospital, university or medical school, staff-model health maintenance organization, group practice, solo or 2-person practice, and other), and primary payment mechanism (fee for service, capitation, salary, and other).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612451048">
<title>Quality-Related Attitudes and Activities</title>
<p>Three questions explored physician attitudes about what physicians should do for quality improvement, and 9 other questions focused on physicians’ opinions about the usefulness of certain quality improvement activities. Three questions assessed the preparedness of physicians to participate in quality improvement activities, and 4 questions asked about participation in quality improvement activities in the last 3 years. Five questions asked about attitudes toward and activities relating to serving vulnerable populations. (The questions used are available from the authors on request.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1062860612451048">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Because the authors were interested primarily in primary care safety-net providers, they included only the survey responses of general internal medicine, pediatrics, and family practice physicians in the analysis. Differences in simple proportions were tested using the χ<sup>2</sup> analysis. Logistic regression analyses were used to control for the same set of factors relating to respondents’ personal (sex and underrepresented minority status), professional (safety-net status, number of years in practice, graduation from a medical school outside the United States or Canada, specialty, and income), and practice characteristics (practice organization and primary payment mechanism). As a sensitivity analysis, all analyses were repeated defining safety-net physicians as those who reported having 30% Medicaid and/or uninsured patients in their panels (compared with the 20% cutoff). All analyses used weights to account for differential sampling rates and nonresponse by specialty of the survey, using SUDAAN 10.0.1 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612451048">14</xref></sup></p>

Safety-net physicians were almost twice as likely to report that they had looked for racial/ethnic disparities in their practices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612451048">Table 3</xref>) and almost 3 times as likely to report that they added 1 more Medicaid patient or uninsured patient to their panel compared with non–safety-net providers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1062860612451048">Table 4</xref>). In addition, these safety-net providers were more likely to report providing free medical care to the uninsured.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Primary care is the core of health care delivery, and it is an essential component of high-quality medical care. An adequate supply of PCPs is associated with lower mortality rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612451048">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612451048">17</xref></sup> a significant decrease in health care use, and improved continuity of care, which has been shown to decrease hospitalizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612451048">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612451048">20</xref></sup> However, currently, the United States has a shortage of physicians needed to deliver primary care, and this shortage will be exacerbated with implementation of the ACA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451048">21</xref></sup> The predicted PCP shortage may reach 46 000 full-time employees by 2025, which accounts for more than one third of the total predicted physician shortfall; this primary care shortage is greater than that for other specialties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612451048">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACA aims to ensure almost universal health insurance coverage, but this may be difficult with the current physician coverage. As in prior national studies, our recent nationally representative survey of physicians found that care for Medicaid and uninsured patients is highly concentrated among a small number of providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1062860612451048">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1062860612451048">25</xref></sup> In addition, we found that only 56% of all PCPs are accepting new Medicaid patients. Therefore, increasing access by expanding Medicaid eligibility is likely to be a challenge to achieve. This conclusion is consistent with the experience of Massachusetts health reform’s near- universal insurance coverage: although there have been gains in access to care, access problems persist because of physicians not accepting new patients generally and Medicaid patients specifically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1062860612451048">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1062860612451048">27</xref></sup> In addition, 28% of safety-net physicians are not accepting new Medicaid patients. Thus, it is not a given that safety-net providers will accept new Medicaid patients, inasmuch as these practice settings may already be at capacity or unable to continue increased Medicaid participation because of decreased reimbursement rates compared with other insurers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1062860612451048">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1062860612451048"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1062860612451048">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the ACA is to fulfill its promise of improving access to and the quality of health care, the PCP safety net needs to be strengthened—because the newly insured may be more likely to seek care among the current safety-net PCPs than among non–safety-net PCPs. As our research demonstrates, safety-net PCPs represent almost half (45%) of all PCPs nationally. Our study found that women, younger physicians, and underrepresented minorities are more likely to be safety-net PCPs. Prior research has shown that minority physicians are more likely than white physicians to care for patients of similar racial and ethnic backgrounds, to practice in underserved areas, and to care for poor, underinsured, or uninsured persons and those on Medicaid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451048">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1062860612451048">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1062860612451048">34</xref></sup> These findings suggest that increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the PCP workforce likely would expand the PCP safety net.</p>
<p>In addition, our study found that twice as many foreign medical graduates (FMGs) were safety-net PCPs than non-FMGs. FMGs have a long history of filling the physician workforce gap, especially in rural and underserved settings such as federally funded health clinics, inner-city hospitals, needy rural counties, or Health Professional Shortage Areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1062860612451048">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1062860612451048">36</xref></sup> Prior work has demonstrated that up to 25% of PCPs in the United States are FMGs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1062860612451048">35</xref></sup> and our findings indicate that more than half (63%) are safety-net providers.</p>
<p>The ACA proposes to increase the number of PCPs by expanding primary care residency slots and increasing funding for the National Health Service Corps by $1.5 billion over 5 years, thus expanding the number of providers in underserved areas. The unique personal characteristics of safety-net providers found in our study must be considered as the ACA is implemented. For example, these funds might be most effective at shoring up the existing safety net by encouraging the training of additional women, underrepresented minorities, and FMGs.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have documented the income gap between PCPs and specialists. Current PCP compensation is 30% to 60% lower than that of specialists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1062860612451048">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1062860612451048">38</xref></sup> Our study confirms these observations by documenting a similar income gap between safety-net PCPs and non–safety-net PCPs. More than half (60%) of our sample reported earning less than $150 000, and 30% earned less than $100 000. Lower income is a significant factor in the decreased recruitment and retention of PCPs—especially among those serving the poor and uninsured. The ACA will include a 10% payment increase for qualified PCPs for 5 years (2011 to 2015) and will fund Medicaid payments to Medicare levels for 2 years (2013 to 2014), thus temporarily creating reimbursement parity. However, it is unclear that these temporary reimbursement increases will be sufficient to correct the chronic income and workforce disparity in the long run.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1062860612451048">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>A commitment to improving and to participating in quality-related activities are central tenets of medical professionalism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1062860612451048">40</xref></sup> Our study adds to the quality debate by demonstrating that safety-net PCPs’ self-reported quality activities and attitudes about quality improvement efforts are similar to those of non–safety-net PCPs. A few studies suggest that safety-net providers as a group may provide lower quality care to the poor, uninsured, and other vulnerable populations. These physicians are less likely to be board certified and are more likely to report having difficulty obtaining access for their patients to high-quality subspecialty referral, high-quality diagnostic imaging, and nonemergency admission to the hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612451048">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612451048"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612451048">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1062860612451048">41</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that if physicians’ reports of participation in quality activities are accurate, then observed differences in quality by these other studies are likely to be attributable to other factors such as fewer resources flowing into safety-net PCP practices and barriers to care delivery.</p>
<p>Racial/ethnic-based differences in care are well documented and a major goal of the ACA is to reduce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1062860612451048">42</xref></sup> Researchers and policy makers have called for physicians to audit their own practices and look for disparities as an important strategy to eliminate observed racial/ethnic disparities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1062860612451048">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1062860612451048">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1062860612451048"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1062860612451048">45</xref></sup> Our study finds that safety-net providers were twice as likely to report that they look for disparities in their practices compared with non–safety-net providers. However, the percentage of PCPs who report looking for disparities in the care they provide (68.3%) is still unacceptably low and represents an ongoing challenge that must be addressed.</p>
<p>Our analysis has a number of limitations. First, the overall response rate to the survey was 64.4%. However, this is comparable to other national physician surveys, and our sample of PCPs is comparable to other national estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451048">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1062860612451048">46</xref></sup> Second, our survey did not permit a direct measurement of the demand for primary care services among Medicaid beneficiaries and assessment of the capacity among PCPs to provide that care. Our survey focused on the current willingness of providers to enroll new Medicaid patients, which likely will have a strong association with actual enrollment. Prior studies have demonstrated that when the uninsured qualify for Medicare, there is an initial surge in the demand for services, suggesting the possibility of a similar increase among newly enrolled Medicaid participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1062860612451048">47</xref></sup> Third, our measure of participation in quality improvement activities was self-reported, and physicians may be biased to overreport their participation because it is the socially desirable response. We are unaware of any other national information on physicians’ involvement in quality improvement. Finally, our definition of safety net was based on physician self-reported insurance panel composition. Prior work demonstrates that physicians can accurately describe whether they participate in Medicaid but that there is an upward bias in their reported estimates of how many Medicaid patients are there in their practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1062860612451048">48</xref></sup> This should minimally bias our results because we are evaluating physicians’ reports of Medicaid participation, and our results are comparable to prior studies.</p>
<p>A consensus has emerged that primary care is “too important to fail.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1062860612451048">49</xref></sup> We stand at a momentous time in the restructuring of our health care delivery system. After 2019, even with health reform implementation and a significant reduction in the number of uninsured Americans, there still will be a need for the safety-net system. What we do next to carefully and thoughtfully prevent the errors of the past is of paramount importance for the future of America’s health care system. Investing in primary care, especially safety-net PCPs, will increase the likelihood of creating a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable health system for all.</p>
