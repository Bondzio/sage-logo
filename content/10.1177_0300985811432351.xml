<abstract>
<p>A prevalent and distinctive infectious interstitial pneumonia (IIP) of immunocompetent laboratory rats was suspected to be caused by a putative virus, termed rat respiratory virus, but this was never substantiated. To study this disease, 2 isolators were independently populated with rats from colonies with endemic disease, which was perpetuated by the regular addition of naive rats. After <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> was demonstrated by histopathology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the lungs of rats from both isolators and an earlier bedding transmission study, the relationship between <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> and IIP was explored further by analyzing specimens from 3 contact transmission experiments, diagnostic submissions, and barrier room breeding colonies, including 1 with and 49 without IIP. Quantitative (q) PCR and immunofluorescence assay only detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection and serum antibodies in rats from experiments or colonies in which IIP was diagnosed by histopathology. In immunocompetent hosts, the <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> concentration in lungs corresponded to the severity and prevalence of IIP; seroconversion occurred when IIP developed and was followed by the concurrent clearance of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> from lungs and resolution of disease. Experimentally infected immunodeficient RNU rats, by contrast, did not seroconvert to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> or recover from infection. qPCR found <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> at significantly higher concentrations and much more often in lungs than in bronchial and nasal washes and failed to detect <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in oral swabs. The sequences of a mitochondrial ribosomal large-subunit gene region for <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> from 11 distinct IIP sources were all identical to that of <italic>P. carinii</italic>. These data provide substantial evidence that <italic>P. carinii</italic> causes IIP in immunocompetent rats.</p>

<p>Publications first appearing in the mid-1990s describe the occurrence of distinctive lung lesions characterized by lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and perivascular lymphocytic cuffs in immunocompetent laboratory rats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811432351">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0300985811432351">39</xref>
</sup> Gilbert et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985811432351">19</xref>
</sup> reported that these lesions interfered with interpretation of pulmonary histopathology in a liposome inhalation study. The lymphohistiocytic nature of the lesions and their eventual resolution, as separately described by Elwell et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811432351">15</xref>
</sup> and Slaoui et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0300985811432351">39</xref>
</sup> suggested an infectious etiology. However, standard diagnostic methodologies to detect known rodent pathogens, including serology for <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus and viruses, microbiologic culture, and special stains, were unrewarding. Early attempts to isolate and transmit an infectious agent led to the description of a novel enveloped virus, referred to as rat respiratory virus (RRV), that reportedly could be propagated in cell culture and was antigenically related to Hantaan virus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985811432351">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0300985811432351">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811432351">36</xref>
</sup> In a limited evaluation of an experimental RRV antibody assay, however, we found that the assay results did not correspond to the known infectious interstitial pneumonia (IIP) status of colonies as established by pulmonary histopathology (C. B. Clifford, unpublished data). In the absence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and meaningful serologic tests, pulmonary histopathology was the only reliable diagnostic methodology available for surveillance of rat colonies.</p>
<p>The histopathologic criteria for diagnosing the pulmonary lesions of IIP were recently published by Albers et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985811432351">1</xref>
</sup> These authors also found a consistent time course for lesion development in naive rats introduced into an endemically infected breeding colony, where animals were housed in open cages. At necropsy, small, irregular gray-white lesions were observed in the lung at 6 to 13 weeks postexposure. Histologically, lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and prominent perivascular lymphoid cuffing were observed from 5 to 13 weeks postexposure with peak severity from 7 to 8 weeks. These data also provided support for the transmissible nature of the interstitial pneumonia. Therefore, in presenting our studies, we will refer to this histopathologic diagnosis as IIP.</p>
<p>Just-published research has provided convincing evidence that <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic>, and not the putative RRV, causes IIP.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811432351">26</xref>
</sup> Consequently, the publication’s authors have proposed that this prevalent, once idiopathic disease be called <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia. The genus <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> comprises obligate extracellular parasites that were once considered to be protozoa but are now classified as ascomycetes fungi.<sup>

</sup> <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> species are host specific and have yet to be described as infecting aberrant hosts.<sup>

</sup> with<italic> P. carinii</italic>being much more common and the only species so far linked to IIP. Significant clinical disease (ie, pneumonia with eventual obstruction of alveoli with organisms and subsequent respiratory failure) due to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>in any species, including rats, has typically been associated with acquired or congenital immune deficits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300985811432351">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0300985811432351">31</xref></sup> although several studies have found mild lesions in immunocompetent human and animal hosts,<sup>

<p>This report provides the results of multiple investigations into the cause and pathogenesis of IIP that were performed with the ultimate objective of developing pathogen-specific PCR and serologic assays better suited than histopathology to routine, high-throughput colony surveillance. Furthermore, understanding the pathobiology of the agent responsible for IIP is fundamental to assessing the efficacy of biosecurity measures aimed at eliminating and excluding this infectious disease from production and research colonies.</p>
<p>Our data independently corroborate the cause-effect relationship between <italic>P. carinii</italic> infection and IIP just reported by Livingston et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811432351">26</xref>
</sup> To study IIP, 2 isolators were independently populated with rats from colonies with endemic disease, which was perpetuated by the regular addition of naive rats. After histopathology and PCR demonstrated <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in the lungs of rats from both isolators and an earlier bedding transmission study, the relationship between <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>and IIP was explored further by analyzing specimens from 3 contact transmission experiments, diagnostic submissions, and barrier room breeding colonies, including 1 with and 49 without IIP. Immunocompetent WH and CD and the immunodeficient athymic RNU rat strains were exposed to IIP from 3 distinct sources.

</sup> rats in transmission experiments were exposed to infection by being housed on bedding from or in contact with contagious animals. The time course and severity of IIP were compared with the concentration of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lung as measured by a real-time quantitative (q) PCR and the titer of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> serum antibodies determined by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA).

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All rats discussed in this research report, except diagnostic submissions from external clients of the diagnostic laboratory were housed in Charles River's facilities and all facilities were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. All experimental work on live animals was approved by the Charles River Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For most studies, the rats were housed in flexible film isolators. Each isolator was equipped with wire-topped solid-bottomed cages, bedded with irradiated kiln-dried aspen shavings (NEPCO, Warrensburg, New York). Animals had ad libitum access to sterile filtered water and irradiated feed (Lab Diet 5L79; Purina Mills, Richmond, Indiana) and were maintained on a light cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark. In studies in which rats were removed from their isolator, they were then housed in filter-top microisolation caging, and all cage changes and animal manipulations were performed under a class II biosafety cabinet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0300985811432351">
<title>Infectious Disease Monitoring</title>
<p>Surveillance for adventitious infections was performed on the isolator and barrier colonies that were the source of the IIP-negative (naive) and IIP-positive rats used in transmission experiments. Surveillance included (1) serology for Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, sialodacryoadenitis virus, Kilham’s rat virus, H-1 virus, rat minute virus and rat parvovirus-1, rat theilovirus (RTV), reovirus, <italic>Mycoplasma pulmonis</italic>, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, hantavirus, mouse adenovirus, CAR bacillus, <italic>Clostridium piliforme</italic>, and <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>; (2) culture for <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, <italic>C. piliforme</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium kutscheri</italic>, <italic>Pasteurella pneumotropica</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>; (3) PCR for parvoviruses, RTV, <italic>Helicobacter</italic>spp, <italic>M. pulmonis</italic>, <italic>Streptobacillus moniliformis</italic>, and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>; and (4) necropsy with gross pathology, pulmonary histopathology for IIP, and microscopic examinations for enteric protozoa, endoparasites, and ectoparasites (Research Animal Diagnostic Services; Charles River, Wilmington, Massachusetts). Testing detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in IIP-positive colonies but did not detect the other infectious agents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0300985811432351">
<title>Animal Sample Collection</title>
<p>Rats were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation. Immediately after euthanasia, blood was collected to prepare serum for serology and lung specimens for histopathology and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR testing. In some studies, a nasopharyngeal wash, a bronchial wash, and an oral swab were also collected for testing by qPCR. Oral swabs were performed by opening the mouth of the animal and swabbing the tongue and oral cavity with a sterile cotton swab. To perform nasal and bronchial washes, the trachea was exposed and incised using an aseptic technique. A sterile pipette was then used to instill approximately 1 ml of trypticase soy broth (TSB) either rostrally into the nasopharynx (nasopharyngeal wash) or caudally into the lungs (bronchial wash). The TSB was washed several times through the nasopharynx or the bronchi, then aspirated and collected into sterile 1.7-ml tubes for further processing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0300985811432351">
<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Lungs and other tissues were collected from rats after euthanasia. Lungs were gently inflated with 10% neutral-buffered formalin. All tissues were fixed by immersion in formalin. After at least a 24-hour fixation, representative samples were cut from the fixed tissues and processed into paraffin blocks. Sections approximately 4 microns thick were cut onto slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for light microscopic examination by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. For routine pulmonary histopathology, a single section that included portions of all lobes was examined. In certain situations, portions of lung were sampled for other purposes (PCR, bacterial culture, etc), and in those situations, less was available for histopathology. IIP was diagnosed in accordance with published criteria<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985811432351">1</xref>
</sup> by a board-certified pathologist (T. M. Albers), and all IIP diagnoses were confirmed by a second board-certified veterinary pathologist (M. A. Simon). For lungs from the transmission experiments, the pathologists ranked the severity of IIP on a scale of 0, for no lesions, to 4 indicating severe IIP. Additional sections were cut for PCR evaluation or for special histochemical stains, including a Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).</p>

<italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR</title>
<p>DNA was isolated by column purification (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, California) from approximately 15 mg of lung tissue or paraffin-embedded lung or 100 μl of nasal wash, bronchial wash, or vortexed swab wash; the DNA was eluted with 200 μl of AE buffer (Qiagen) and tested by a qPCR targeting a region of the mitochondrial large subunit 18S rRNA gene conserved among <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> species. This target was selected using the blastx algorithm<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985811432351">5</xref>
</sup> to align GenBank accession AY532651 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/index. html) and to identify regions specific for <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>. Primers were designed and analyzed with NetPrimer software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, California): PNEU18F (5′-TAACCTRCTAAATAGCCAGATTA-3′) and PNEU18R (5′-GGCTTCATGCCAAYAGTC-3′). The probe was analyzed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calfiornia): PNEU18P (5′-FAM-CCYGCGATCAGC-MGB-3′). All primers and probes in this study were synthesized by Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri) and Applied Biosystems, respectively. The positive control standard was prepared by amplifying a product from a <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>-positive RNU rat lung with HotStar Hifidelity polymerase (Qiagen) and ligating the product into a plasmid (pCR 4 Blunt TOPO; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid DNA specimens from PCR-positive transformed bacteria were submitted to Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, Massachusetts) for DNA sequencing to verify product integrity and to confirm identification consistent with available GenBank accessions. The plasmid concentration was quantified via spectrophotometer (OD260/280) and diluted to create a positive control standard, which was included in every assay run. Reaction components and thermocycler parameters used for the qPCR are as described<sup>

</sup> and performed on an ABI 7300 real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). The instrument reported assay reactions as cycle threshold (C<sub>T</sub>) values. These were converted to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> DNA (or genome) copies/reaction using a C<sub>T</sub> value of 3.3 to calculate 10-fold differences from a 100 plasmid-copy standard.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0300985811432351">45</xref>
</sup> The <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> DNA copies/reaction were adjusted to copies per mg lung, per μl of bronchial or nasal wash, and per swab. The limit of detection for qPCR assay was determined to be 1 to 10 plasmid copies. A positive cutoff of 5 DNA copies was selected based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.<sup>

</sup> Briefly, serum incubation was followed by a wash step, incubation with FITC-labeled goat IgG anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon), and a second wash. After being covered with mounting medium and a coverslip, slide wells were examined with an epi-illumination fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), and reactions were classified as positive, negative, or nonspecific according to the pattern and intensity of fluorescence. A positive control serum from naturally infected rats and a negative control serum were tested in every IFA run to verify assay sensitivity and specificity. Serum samples were screened at a 30-fold dilution. Serial 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> dilutions of each positive serum were retested to determine antibody titers (ie, the reciprocal of the highest dilution that gave a positive reaction).</p>

<title>Experimental Transmission of IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> to Immunocompetent and Immunodeficient Rats</title>
<p>Pulmonary histopathology on an immunodeficient RNU rat from an IIP isolator demonstrated <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in the same areas of the lung as IIP lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811432351">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811432351">4</xref>). Initially, this finding was considered incidental based on the putative viral etiology of IIP and the general understanding that <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>pneumonia is principally a disease of immunodeficient hosts. The results of ongoing <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR testing and pulmonary histopathology of rats from the IIP isolator colonies, however, consistently showed in lungs from CD rats a correlation between the concentration of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> DNA copies and the severity of IIP (data not shown). In addition, between January 2009 and July 2010, PCR failed to detect <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in any of the more than 2500 bronchial washes from rats in 55 IIP-negative barrier-room colonies located in 10 Charles River facilities in North America, Europe, and Japan.</p>
<p>The role of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection in the pathogenesis of IIP was investigated by analyzing respiratory and serum specimens collected at regular (usually weekly) intervals during the 4 transmission experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300985811432351">Table 1</xref>. In these experiments, infection was transmitted to immunocompetent CD and WH rats and athymic RNU rats from 3 independent sources of IIP, including an enzootically infected ZDF breeding colony in a barrier room, and IIP isolators 1 and 2. To model natural transmission, rats were exposed to infection by bedding transfer (experiment I), direct contact with contagious animals in IIP isolators 1 and 2 (experiments II and III), or contact with RNU rats inoculated oronasally with infective lung homogenate prepared from an RNU rat in IIP isolator 1 (experiment IV).</p>
<p>In transmission studies with immunocompetent CD and WH rats, qPCR detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lungs several weeks before pulmonary histopathology demonstrated IIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985811432351">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0300985811432351">6</xref>). For example, of the 12 CD rats tested at 1 week following contact exposure in experiment II, 5 (42%) were <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR positive, whereas none had IIP lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0300985811432351">Fig. 6a</xref>, c). The percentage of lungs with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> rose to 100% at 2 weeks postexposure. By comparison, IIP lesions were not seen until 3 weeks and then in just 1 of 12 rats (8.3%); the maximum IIP prevalence of 85.7% was reached 1 to 2 weeks later. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811432351">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811432351">2</xref> are photomicrographs showing the close similarity in appearance between IIP in WH rats from our earlier study and CD rats.</p>

<italic>Pneumocystis</italic> seroconversion by IFA coincided with the concurrent peaks in the prevalence and severity of IIP and the concentration of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>in lungs. As the percentage of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>-seropositive animals increased and IFA antibody titers rose, the prevalence and levels of disease and infection declined. All CD rats were seropositive by 5 weeks after being co-housed with oronasally inoculated RNU rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300985811432351">Table 2</xref>) and by 7 and 8 weeks following contact with infective rats in IIP isolator 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0300985811432351">Fig. 6a</xref>) and isolator 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0300985811432351">Fig. 6c</xref>), respectively. At 10 weeks following contact exposure in the IIP isolators,<italic> Pneumocystis</italic> IFA serum antibody titers in CD rats ranged from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>, with a mean of approximately 4000; of the 12 animals sampled at this time, none had IIP, and qPCR measured low levels of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> (ie, roughly 10 and 100 DNA copies/mg) in the lungs of just 2 rats.</p>
<p>In CD contact transmission experiment II, a total of 122 rats from the 2 IIP isolators were sampled from 1 to 10 weeks postexposure. Of the 53 rats that were <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> IFA seronegative, qPCR detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lungs from 46 (86.8%), which was significantly higher than the 14 (26.4%) diagnosed with IIP (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, Cochran and McNemar tests). For these seronegative animals, the median concentration of organisms in lungs with and without IIP was 10<sup>4.6</sup> and 10<sup>2.9</sup> DNA copies/mg, respectively. This concentration difference was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, Kruskal-Wallis test) and consistent with the correlation between the level of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection and prevalence of IIP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0300985811432351">Fig. 6</xref>.</p>
<p>Of the 132 contact-exposed rats in transmission experiments II and IV, histopathology demonstrated IIP in 44 (33%), qPCR found <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in the lungs of 84 (64%), and IFA detected serum antibodies in 77 (58%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0300985811432351">Table 4</xref>). The positive rates by <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR and IFA were not statistically different from one another (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05, Cochran and McNemar tests), but both were significantly higher than the percentage of rats in which histopathology found IIP (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>In the contact transmission experiment to immunodeficient RNU rats (experiment III), <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> was detected in all rats sampled from 2 weeks postexposure forward. The concentration of<italic> Pneumocystis</italic> continued to rise throughout the study.

IFA did not detect <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> antibodies in sera from any of the 40 RNU rats sampled between 1 and 10 weeks postexposure. In sharp contrast to the time course of IIP in immunocompetent animals, lesions consistent with IIP were not found in RNU rats until 10 weeks postexposure and then in just 2 of 4 rats (data not shown).</p>

<title>Comparison of Respiratory Specimen Types for Detection of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> by qPCR</title>
<p>During transmission experiment II, bronchial wash, nasal wash, and oral swab specimens were collected in addition to lung from 120 (of 122) contact-exposed CD rats. qPCR first detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lungs at 1 week postexposure and in bronchial and nasal washes 2 weeks later but never demonstrated the organisms in oral swabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0300985811432351">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0300985811432351">Table 3</xref>). From 2 to 5 weeks postexposure, the percentage of infected lungs averaged 98%; in association with the development of humoral immunity, the percentage decreased to 17% when the study concluded at 10 weeks. By comparison, <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> could only be demonstrated in bronchial and nasal washes between 3 and 6 weeks postexposure; during this period, 75% of the bronchial washes and 33% of the nasal washes were qPCR positive. Of the 120 rats from which upper and lower respiratory samples were collected during this 10-week study, <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> was detected in 68% of the lungs; this percentage was approximately 3 and 6 times higher than those for bronchial and nasal washes, respectively. In addition, the average <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> DNA copies/mg lung was 40- to 80-fold higher than the average copies/μl of bronchial or nasal wash (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0300985811432351">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<italic>Pneumocystis</italic> Survey of IIP-Positive Rat Populations</title>
<p>Lung sections from external diagnostic submissions where 1 or more rats were diagnosed with IIP were tested for <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> by qPCR. Of the 99 lungs sections evaluated, 38 were positive for IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> and 54 were negative for both. Of the 7 remaining sections, 2 had IIP without <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> and 5 were <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> positive without IIP. The 93% agreement between the histopathology and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> PCR results was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, Fisher exact test).</p>
<p>SD rats from 4 age groups were acquired from a barrier-room breeding colony reported by the vendor to have enzootic IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>. This colony was unrelated to those used as sources of infection for the transmission experiments listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300985811432351">Table 1</xref>. There were 18 rats 29 to 30 weeks of age and 6 rats in each of the younger age groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0300985811432351">Fig. 9</xref>, all of the 3-week-old rats had maternal antibody titers to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, and none was infected with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> or had IIP lesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985811432351">21</xref>

The average <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> concentration for the 5 IIP-positive rats was 10<sup>3.7</sup>DNA copies/mg lung, which was 100-fold higher than the average concentration of 10<sup>1.6</sup>in the remaining 6 qPCR-positive rats that were IIP negative. <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> antibodies were undetectable in sera from 7- to 8-week-old rats but were demonstrated in sera from four 10- to 12-week-old and all eighteen 29- to 30-week-old rats. None of the 29- to 30-week-old rats had IIP; 1 was <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR positive but with just 15 DNA copies/mg lung. Of the 24 colony rats evaluated, IIP was found in 5 (21%), and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> was detected in lungs from 12 (50%); 28 (78%) were <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> seropositive.</p>
<p>A comparison of pulmonary histopathology, <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> qPCR, and <italic>P. carinii</italic> IFA results for 168 immunocompetent rats is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0300985811432351">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0300985811432351">Figure 9</xref>. These included 132 contact-exposed CD rats from transmission experiments II and IV and 36 SD rats from the enzootically infected barrier-room breeding colony. Overall, the percentages of rats that were positive by qPCR and IFA were more than twice the percentage diagnosed with IIP by histopathology (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, Cochran and McNemar test). Rats were positive for <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> by either qPCR or serology 96% of the time, which was significantly more frequent than the 63% by each method alone (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).

<italic>Pneumocystis</italic> Survey of Immunocompetent Rats From IIP-Negative Charles River Barrier-Room Breeding Colonies</title>
<p>Charles River’s policy has been to screen rat colonies for IIP by performing quarterly histopathology on young adult rats and to depopulate and disinfect rooms containing colonies with IIP. Pulmonary histopathology detected IIP in 0.6% of the more than 13 000 rats evaluated since 2002 and in none of the 2500 animals screened in 2009 and 2010. We reported elsewhere<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300985811432351">32</xref>
</sup> that the prevalence of IIP in 3900 rats from external sources between 2002 and 2008 was 6%.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, PCR did not detect <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in any of the 2500 rat bronchial washes from IIP-negative colonies screened in 2009 and 2010. To corroborate that IIP-negative rat colonies are indeed free of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, we tested rats from IIP-negative colonies by <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> IFA serology and qPCR of lung specimens, instead of bronchial washes. The switch to lung was made based on data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0300985811432351">Table 3</xref> showing that <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> were found in lungs considerably more often and at much higher concentrations than in bronchial washes. For most colonies, lung and serum samples were collected from each of 4 retired breeder and 4 young adult rats; for some, however, sera were prepared from retired breeders only. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0300985811432351">Table 5</xref>, 440 lungs and 352 sera were collected from rats representing 49 barrier-room breeding colonies at 10 Charles River facilities on 3 continents. <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> were not detected by qPCR in any of the lung specimens, and all sera were <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> IFA negative.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IIP, a prevalent and transient mild interstitial pneumonia of immunocompetent laboratory rats, had been attributed to a putative viral pathogen referred to as RRV,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985811432351">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811432351">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811432351">38</xref>
</sup> but the nature of this agent was never proven. The data in this report provide persuasive evidence that IIP is caused by <italic>P. carinii</italic>, the most common <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> species of laboratory rats. Analysis of rat respiratory and serum specimens from 4 transmission experiments, a barrier-room breeding colony with enzootic IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, external diagnostic submissions during 2009-2010, and more than 400 rats from 49 IIP-negative barrier-room colonies in North America, Europe, and Japan, showed that qPCR and IFA only detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection and serum antibodies in rats from colonies and experiments in which histopathology demonstrated IIP. In immunocompetent rats, the concentration of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lungs correlated with the severity of IIP, and the resolution of pneumonia invariably followed the development of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> humoral immunity and the clearance of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection from lungs. The genotypes of IIP-associated <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> from 11 independent sources matched that of <italic>P. carinii</italic>. This cause-effect relationship between <italic>P. carinii</italic>infection and IIP that our data support is wholly consistent with findings just published by Livingston et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811432351">26</xref>
</sup> Our study was contemporaneous with theirs and was carried out without prior knowledge of their research. Thus, the 2 studies independently corroborate one another and, as far as we can ascertain, are the first reports of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia in immunocompetent rats.</p>
<p>As the lymphohistiocytic infiltrates of IIP are consistent with a viral etiology and one had been proposed, our preliminary investigations into the cause of IIP focused on finding novel viruses. To do this, lung and other tissues from transmission experiments were probed for viral antigens by Western immunoblotting and indirect IFA with IIP-convalescent rat serum. Nonspecific PCR techniques, such as single primer amplification (SISPA)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985811432351">3</xref>
</sup> and random primer amplification,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811432351">4</xref>
</sup> were performed on nucleic acid extracts from nasal aspirate, bronchial wash, clarified fecal slurry, serum, urine, and skin specimens pretreated to deplete host nucleic acid and enrich viruses. These analyses failed to reveal viral antigens or genomic sequences despite being applied to a variety of specimens collected over a wide range of times postexposure (data not shown).</p>
<p>When pulmonary histopathology first demonstrated <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in the lungs of an RNU rat from one of the IIP isolators used in transmission experiments and then PCR detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in the lungs of immunocompetent CD rats from both IIP isolators, we were skeptical of a relationship between the infection and disease because <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>is primarily an opportunistic pathogen of immunodeficient hosts. Furthermore, we were unable to locate reports of lesions similar to IIP among the many studies of <italic>P. carinii</italic> in immunosuppressed rats as a model for human pneumocystosis. Finally, according to PCR test results reported by others, <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> were not detected in diseased rat lungs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811432351">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811432351">38</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>In immunocompetent rats from the transmission experiments and an endemically infected barrier-room breeding colony, seroconversion to <italic>P.</italic> <italic>carinii</italic> coincided with the concurrent peaks of IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection. Subsequently, in association with increasing antibody titers, <italic>P.</italic> <italic>carinii</italic> was cleared from lungs and the lesions of IIP resolved. Infected immunodeficient RNU rats, by contrast, did not seroconvert to or recover from infection with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> during a 10-week transmission experiment. Interestingly, of the 40 RNU rats sampled over the course of this experiment, IIP lesions were diagnosed in just 2 at 10 weeks. These striking differences between the pathogenesis of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in immune-competent and immune-deficient hosts are consistent with the characteristic lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and perivascular cuffs of IIP being mediated by the adaptive immune response to infection. Once the infiltrating immunocytes have cleared the infection, the lesions they compose resolve. This link between IIP and the development of adaptive immunity that clears <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection provides a plausible explanation for cysts rarely being observed in areas of inflammation.</p>
<p>The time course of <italic>P. carinii</italic> infection in contact-exposed immunocompetent rats shown here is very similar to the time course reported for <italic>P. murina</italic> in immunocompetent mice exposed to infection by direct contact.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985811432351">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985811432351">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300985811432351">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0300985811432351">44</xref>
</sup> In experimentally infected animals of both species, the concentration of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lungs peaked at approximately 1 month postexposure, and the infection was quickly cleared as the acquired immune response developed.</p>
<p>IIP peaked several weeks later and persisted longer in WH rats exposed to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in bedding than in CD rats exposed by direct contact.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985811432351">1</xref>
</sup> This apparently was not due to the strain difference as the slower rate at which IIP progressed in the WH experiment was duplicated in CD rats exposed to infective bedding (data not shown). Thus, we believe that contact-exposed CD rats developed and recovered from IIP sooner because the <italic>P. carinii</italic> dose they received was much higher than the dose in soiled bedding. The pronounced effect of <italic>P. carinii</italic> dose on the development and progression of IIP is probably a function of the slow doubling time of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, reported to be 4.5 days in rats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985811432351">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the SD barrier-room breeding colony with endemic <italic>P. carinii</italic>, maternal antibodies apparently protected rats from infection until after weaning. <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> were detected in the lungs of nearly all rats (11/12) between 7 and 12 weeks of age. Lungs from 10- to 12-week-old rats had the highest prevalence of IIP (67%) and concentration of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> (10<sup>3</sup> DNA copies/mg). IFA detected <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> serum antibodies in none of the 7- to 8-week-old rats and in 4 of 6 (67%) of the 10- to 12-week-old rats. By 29 to 30 weeks of age, all rats were <italic>P</italic>. <italic>carinii</italic> seropositive, with antibody titers that were on average 10-fold higher than those in the 10- to 12-week-old group. These results correspond with those from the transmission experiments in that the peaks of IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection were concurrent and coincided with seroconversion; in addition, the clearance of the <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection by the acquired immune response was followed by the resolution of IIP. This pattern of infection being delayed by passive immunity until after weaning and convalescence, following with the development of active immunity, is common for endemic infections in research animal breeding colonies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0300985811432351">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Overall, comparative test results in this report for experimentally and naturally infected rats show that the positive rate for both <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> assays is over 60%, which is more than twice the rate at which pulmonary histopathology detected IIP. Combined, the <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> assays detected lung infection or serum antibodies in 96% of rats. Even though <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> assays proved to be significantly more sensitive than histopathology in this study, we have never found <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in IIP-negative rat colonies or failed to detect <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in rat populations with the disease. Therefore, in our hands, histopathologic monitoring of rat colonies for IIP has accurately predicted their <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> status. Moreover, our retrospective data for diagnostic submissions show a highly significant correlation between IIP and <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> in lung sections.</p>
<p>To determine the species of <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> connected with IIP in rats, we sequenced a region of the mitochondrial ribosomal large-subunit gene used by others to compare <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> species.<sup>

</sup> <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> from 11 distinct sources of IIP had identical sequences that matched the <italic>P. carinii</italic> sequences in GenBank. This outcome is not unexpected since <italic>P. carinii</italic> is much more common than the only other <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> species identified in laboratory rats, <italic>P. wakefieldiae</italic>.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811432351">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As part of transmission experiment IV, RNU rats were inoculated oronasally with <italic>P. carinii</italic>–infected lung homogenate. Although we would have preferred to inoculate rats with a pure culture of <italic>P. carinii</italic> to strictly fulfill Koch’s postulates, this was not feasible because <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> have not been propagated continuously in culture. The <italic>P. carinii</italic> inoculum used by Livingston and coworkers was prepared from the lungs of an immunosuppressed Lewis rat.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811432351">26</xref>
</sup> By showing that rats given a 0.2-micron filtrate of the inoculum did not develop IIP, they conclusively demonstrated that rats must be infected with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>to develop the disease. However, as the sources of <italic>P. carinii</italic> for their experiments and ours were infected rat lungs and not pure cultures, we cannot claim categorically that no other agent is involved the pathogenesis of IIP. For instance, a virus transmitted with <italic>P. carinii</italic> could contribute to the disease by facilitating <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> colonization of the lower respiratory tract in immunocompetent hosts. On the other hand, the participation of an infectious agent other than <italic>P. carinii</italic> in the pathogenesis of IIP is highly improbable for several reasons. First, routine surveillance of the IIP-positive colonies used in transmission experiments did not detect any known pathogen other than <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>. Furthermore, no evidence was found for a novel virus in specimens from diseased rats by the generic immunological and genetic methods discussed earlier. Finally, novel pathogens are infrequently found in long-used and intensively characterized laboratory animal species such as the rat.</p>
<p>On the basis of the strength of the evidence that the histopathologic diagnosis of IIP in immunocompetent rats is <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia, we have replaced surveillance by pulmonary histopathology with <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> PCR and serologic assays better suited to routine, high-throughput screening. Since this switch, we have developed a <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> recombinant protein antigen multiplexed fluorometric immunoassay (MFIA) to replace IFA for screening (data not shown). Hence, we have achieved the key aim of this research to expand and improve the methodologies for diagnosing this prevalent disease of laboratory rats.</p>
