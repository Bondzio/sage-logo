<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term patellar tendinopathy refers to painful overuse tendon without implying pathology; it isideal for clinical diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511411114">1</xref></sup> Patellar tendinopathy was first referred to as ‘jumper’s knee’. This term is not appropriate for clinical diagnosis because the condition can occur in athletes who do not perform jumping in their sports as well as in people who are not athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511411114">2</xref></sup> The term patellar tendonitis is also incorrect for clinical diagnosis because the condition is degenerative rather than inflammatory. This condition is characterized by the increased presence of fibroblasts, vascular hyperplasia, increased amounts of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, disorganized collagen, absence of inflammatory cells and prostaglandin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511411114">3</xref></sup> The term patellar tendinosis refers to pathology of the patellar tendon and is the best diagnostic term.</p>
<p>The principal factors that lead to its development are hard playing surfaces, increased frequency of training sessions with repetitive eccentric movement and finally tight hamstring and quadriceps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511411114">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511411114">5</xref></sup> It is most commonly characterized by pain at the inferior pole of the patella, although pain can also be at the tibial attachment, in the attachment of the tendon to the superior pole of the patella as well as midsubstance pain has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511411114">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511411114">8</xref></sup> The pain can be caused by performing a functional activity such as squat or hop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511411114">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, no ideal treatment has emerged for the management of patellar tendinopathy. Many clinicians advocate a conservative approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511411114">9</xref></sup> and physiotherapy is usually recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511411114">2</xref></sup> A wide array of physiotherapy treatments has been recommended for the management of patellar tendinopathy such as electrotherapeutic modalities, exercise programmes, soft tissue manipulation, and manual techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511411114">1</xref></sup> These treatments have different theoretical mechanisms of action, but all have the same aim, to reduce pain and improve function. Such a variety of treatment options suggests that the optimal treatment strategy is not known, and more research is needed to discover the most effective treatment in patients with patellar tendinopathy.</p>
<p>One of the most common physiotherapy treatments for patellar tendinopathy is an exercise programme. One consisting of eccentric exercises has shown good clinical results in patellar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511411114">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511411114">13</xref></sup> and Achilles tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511411114">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511411114">19</xref></sup> On the other hand, eccentric and static stretching exercises seems to be an effective treatment for lateral elbow tendinopathy, commonly referred to as tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511411114">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511411114">22</xref></sup> Such an exercise programme is used as the first treatment option for patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511411114">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>To our knowledge, there have been no studies to investigate the effectiveness of eccentric and static stretching exercises in patients with patellar tendinopathy. Tightness of hamstring and quadriceps has been found in patients with patellar tendinopathy as an aetiological factor. It is possible to combine eccentric training with static stretching exercises to see if the combination of these two therapeutic approaches offers superior results to eccentric training alone in patellar tendinopathy patients. Therefore, the aim of the present article was to make a comparison of the effects of an exercise programme consisting of eccentric training and an exercise programme consisting of eccentric training and static stretching exercises for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511411114" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A controlled, monocentre trial was conducted in a clinical setting to assess the effectiveness of an eccentric training programme and once involving eccentric training with static stretching exercises. A parallel group design was used because crossover designs are limited in situations where patients are cured by the intervention and do not have the opportunity to receive the other treatments after crossover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511411114">24</xref></sup> Three investigators were involved in the study: (1) the primary investigator who administered the treatments (DS); (2) a medical doctor (KS) who evaluated the patients to confirm the patellar tendinopathy diagnosis; and (3) a physiotherapist (PM) who performed all baseline and follow-up assessments, and gained informed consent. All assessments were conducted by PM who was blind to the patients’ therapy group. PM interviewed each patient to ascertain baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including patient name, sex, age, duration of symptoms, previous treatment, occupation, affected leg and dominant leg.</p>
<p>Patients between 18 and 30 years old who were experiencing anterior knee pain were examined and evaluated in a private outpatient physiotherapy clinic located in Athens, Greece, between September 2003 and September 2007. All patients lived in Athens, were native speakers of Greek and were either self-referred or referred by their physician or physiotherapist.</p>
<p>The selection criteria for the study were<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511411114">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511411114">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511411114">9</xref></sup>:</p>

</list>
<p>All patients received a written explanation of the trial before entry into the study and then gave signed consent to participate. They were allocated to two groups by sequential, alternate allocation: the first patient was assigned to the eccentric training and static stretching exercises group, the second to the eccentric training group, and so on.</p>
<p>All patients were instructed to use their knee during the course of the study but to avoid activities that irritated the joint such as jumping, hopping and running. They were also told to refrain from taking anti-inflammatory drugs throughout the course of study. Patient compliance with this request was monitored using a treatment diary.</p>
<p>Communication and interaction (verbal and non-verbal) between the therapist and patient was kept to a minimum, and behaviours sometimes used by therapists to facilitate positive treatment outcomes were purposefully avoided. For example, patients were given no indication of the potentially beneficial effects of the treatments or any feedback on their performance in the pre-application and post-application measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511411114">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The eccentric training was the same for both groups. As eccentric exercises, participants carried out three sets of 15 repetitions of unilateral squat on a 25° decline board. The squat was performed at a slow speed at every treatment session. The patients counted to 30 during the squat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511411114">20</xref></sup> As they moved from the standing to the squat position, the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon by inference were loaded eccentrically; no following concentric loading was done, as the noninjured leg was used to get back to the start position. At the beginning the load consisted of the body weight and participants were standing with all their body weight on the injured leg. Subjects were told to go ahead with the exercise even if they experienced mild pain. However, they were told to stop the exercise if the pain became disabling. When the squat was pain-free the load was increased by holding weights in their hands. Between each set there was a two-minute rest. In the eccentric training and static stretching exercises group, static stretching exercises were performed as described by Jensen and Di Fabio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511411114">28</xref></sup> before and after the eccentric training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511411114">10</xref></sup> Each stretch lasted 30 seconds and there was a one-minute rest between each stretch. Each training session was to be completed once daily, five times per week, for four weeks and was individualized on the basis of the patient’s description of pain experienced during the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511411114">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pain, function and dropout rate were measured in the present study. Each patient was evaluated at baseline (week 0), at the end of treatment (week 4) and at six months (week 24) after the end of treatment.</p>
<p>The VISA-P questionnaire was used to monitor the pain and function of patients. The instrument is a simple questionnaire, consisted of eight questions that takes less than five minutes to complete and once patients are familiar with it they will be able to complete most of it themselves. It is a valid and reliable outcome measure for patients with patellar tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511411114">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>A dropout rate was also used as an indicator of treatment outcome. Reasons for patient dropout were categorized as follows: (1) withdrawal without reason, (2) not returned for follow-up, and (3) request for an alternative treatment.</p>
<p>The change from baseline was calculated for each follow-up. Differences in this change was calculated between the groups and was determined using a one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons were conducted when the results from the one-way ANOVA were significant to determine how the two groups differed. A 5% level of probability was adopted as the level of statistical significance. SPSS 11.5 statistical software was used for the statistical analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The eccentric training with static stretching exercises produced the largest effect at the end of the treatment and six months after the end of the treatment. The results obtained from this controlled clinical trial are novel; to date, there have been no data comparing the effectiveness of eccentric training on a 25° decline board with static stretching exercises and eccentric training alone for the reduction of pain and improvement of function in patellar tendinopathy in non-athletes between 18 and 30 years old.</p>
<p>Standard eccentric exercises offer adequate rehabilitation for tendon disorders, but many patients with tendinopathies do not respond to this prescription alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511411114">27</xref></sup> The load of eccentric exercises was increased according to the patients’ symptoms because the opposite has shown poor results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511411114">28</xref></sup> Eccentric exercises were performed at a low speed in every treatment session because this allows tissue healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511411114">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511411114">29</xref></sup> The avoidance of painful activities is crucial for tendon healing, because training during the treatment period increases patients’ symptoms and delays tendon healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511411114">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Eccentric training and static stretching exercises appear to reduce the pain and improve function, reversing the pathology of tendinopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511411114">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511411114">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511411114">33</xref></sup> as supported by experimental studies on animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511411114">34</xref></sup> The way that eccentric training and static stretching exercises achieves the goals remains uncertain as there is a lack of good quality evidence to confirm that physiological effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes and vice versa.</p>
<p>Eccentric training with or without static stretching exercises is called an exercise programme. There are two types of exercise programme: home exercise programmes and exercise programmes carried out in a clinical setting. The former is commonly advocated for patients with tendinopathies, such as patellar tendinopathy, because it can be performed any time during the day without requiring supervision by a physiotherapist. Our clinical experience, however, has shown that patients fail to comply with this regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511411114">23</xref></sup> This problem can be solved by exercise programmes performed in a clinical setting under the supervision of a physiotherapist. For the purposes of this report, ‘supervised exercise programme’ will refer to such programmes. Therefore, such a supervised exercise programme was used in the present trial.</p>
<p>Previous trials have found that a home exercise programme reduced the pain in patellar,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511411114">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511411114">13</xref></sup> lateral elbow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215511411114">35</xref></sup> and Achilles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511411114">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511411114"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511411114">19</xref></sup> tendinopathy. However, it was performed for about three months in all previous studies. In contrast, in the present controlled clinical trial and the studies of Stasinopoulos and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511411114">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511411114"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511411114">22</xref></sup> a supervised exercise programme was administered for one month. Thus it seems that the supervised exercise programme may give good long-term clinical results in a shorter period of time than a home exercise programme. The most likely explanation for this difference is that a supervised exercise programme achieves a higher degree of patient compliance. Studies to compare the effects of these two types of exercise programmes are required to confirm the findings of the present controlled clinical trial.</p>
<p>However, this trial does have some shortcomings. First, a power analysis was not performed. Second, although this study was not a randomized controlled trial because a genuine randomization procedure was not followed, the use of sequential allocation to allocate patients to treatment groups allowed a true cause and effect relation to be demonstrated. Third, no placebo (sham) or no treatment group was included in the present trial. The placebo (sham)/no treatment group is important when the absolute effectiveness of a treatment is determined. However, the absolute effectiveness of technique-based interventions is difficult to investigate because a good and trustworthy placebo (sham)/no treatment control for exercise programmes appears to be difficult or impossible to devise, due in part to difficulties in defining the active element of these treatments. Absolute effectiveness also does not provide the therapists with information as to which is the most appropriate treatment for the management of a condition, in this case LET. Finally, the blinding of patients and therapists would be problematic in that case, if not impossible, because patients know if they are receiving the exercise programme treatment and therapists need to be aware of the treatment to administer it appropriately.</p>
<p>In summary, eccentric training of patellar tendon and static stretching exercises of quadriceps and hamstrings had reduced the pain and improved the function in non-athletes between 18 and 30 years old with patellar tendinopathy at the end of the treatment and at follow-up. Controlled studies are needed to establish the effects and the mechanism of action of such a treatment approach in patellar tendinopathy. A cost-effectiveness analysis should be incorporated into the analysis of the effectiveness of such a treatment approach in future trials.</p>
