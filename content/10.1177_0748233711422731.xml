<abstract>
<p>The hypothesis that two known chelators deferasirox and deferiprone (L1) might be more efficient as combined treatment than as single therapies in removing aluminum from the body was tested in a new acute rat model. Seven-week-old male Wistar rats received chelators: deferasirox (orally [p.o.]), L1 (p.o.) or deferasirox + L1 as 100 or 200 mg/kg dose half an hour after a single intraperitoneal administration of 6 mg Al/kg body weight in the form of chloride. Serum aluminum concentration, urinary aluminum and iron excretions were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Both chelators were effective only at the higher dose level. While deferasirox was more effective than L1 in enhancing urinary aluminum excretion, L1 was more effective than deferasirox in enhancing urinary iron excretion. In the combined treatment group, deferasirox did not increase the L1 effect on aluminum and L1 did not increase the effect of deferasirox on iron elimination. Our results support the usefulness of this animal model for preliminary <italic>in vivo</italic> testing of aluminum chelators. Urinary values were more useful due to the high variability of serum results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aluminum toxicity was first observed in patients in whom aluminum was administered parenterally, that is through renal dialysate (Hewitt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711422731">1990</xref>) and intravenous nutrient solution (Greyer and Powers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711422731">1992</xref>). Aluminum is proposed to be a factor contributing to several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (Fraga et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711422731">1990</xref>). There is evidence that exposure to aluminum in drinking water results in cognitive impairment and an increased incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (Savory et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711422731">1996</xref>). Understanding the possible enhanced bioavailability of aluminum in this type of exposure or after other exposure such as antacid intake or industrial exposure needs to be considered or explored. Although these points might be debatable, there is little doubt that accumulation of aluminum leads to tissue damage (Quartely et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711422731">1993</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been estimated that the human body contains around 35 mg of aluminum, of which approximately 25% is in the soft tissues, 25% in bone and the rest in the lungs, probably as inhaled dust particles. There is no known biological role for aluminum—it does not appear to be an essential trace element—and the body has highly effective barriers to exclude aluminum. Only a minute fraction of aluminum in the diet is taken up from the gut; and in healthy individuals, most of this absorbed aluminum is excreted by the kidneys (Bertini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711422731">2010</xref>; Gómez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711422731">1998a</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well documented that aluminum can be toxic in excessive amounts to plants, animals and humans, but the mechanism of action is somewhat understood (Fatemi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711422731">1991</xref>; Flaten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711422731">1996</xref>; Jeffery et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711422731">1996</xref>). One way to remove toxic elements such as aluminum from the body is chelation therapy that could be carried out as a single and combined therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711422731">Fatemi et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711422731">2009</xref>; Shokooh Saljooghi and Fatemi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711422731">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711422731">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711422731">2011</xref>; Tubafard and Fatemi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711422731">2008</xref>; Tubafard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233711422731">2010</xref>). Chelation therapy involves the use of ligating drugs that bind metals in the treatment of potentially fatal conditions. The ligands that have been used in chelation therapies promote the excretion and subsequent depletion of these toxic metals in biological systems (Gómez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711422731">1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711422731">Scott and Orvig, 2009</xref>). For the last several decades the most widely used chelator in the treatment of aluminum intoxication has been desferrioxamine (DFO) (Winship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711422731">1993</xref>). Its use is restricted due to its oral inactivity and therefore subcutaneous administration is usual but intravenous is also possible. This can lead to reduced quality of life. These properties also may result in diminished medicinal activities in biological model. In view of these considerations, there is a great need for the development of an alternative orally effective chelating drug (Gómez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711422731">1998a</xref>; Scott and Orvig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711422731">2009</xref>; Shokooh Saljooghi and Fatemi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711422731">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711422731">b</xref>). Recently, many candidate compounds have been screened in animal models (Fatemi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711422731">2009</xref>; Shokooh Saljooghi and Fatemi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711422731">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711422731">b</xref>). In our laboratory, we investigated using animal models the effects of two alternative orally effective chelating drugs, deferasirox and L1, as combined and single therapies in removing aluminum from the body <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The synthesis of deferasirox (4-[3,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-benzoic acid, or ICL670, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711422731">Figure 1</xref>) was first reported in 1999 (Heinz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711422731">1999</xref>). It is a tridentate chelator and shows little affinity for divalent ions such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup> (Steinhauser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711422731">2004</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, this selectivity is demonstrated by conserved plasma Zn and Cu levels in patients taking deferasirox, and while its efficacy is rather low for inducing negative iron balance, it is effective and well tolerated (Nisbet-Brown et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711422731">2003</xref>). In 2005, deferasirox became the first Food Drug Administration (FDA)–approved oral alternative in the treatment of iron overload and was subsequently approved in the European Union (EU) in 2006 (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233711422731">2007</xref>). Its relatively long half-life before excretion allows once-daily dosage and good overall patient compliance, as well as cost-effectiveness, and deferasirox is considered superior to DFO (Scott and Orvig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711422731">2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Deferiprone (1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one [L1], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711422731">Figure 1</xref>), which belongs to the family of α-ketohydroxpyridines, can remove excess iron from various parts of the body of iron-loaded patients, including the liver and, particularly, the heart (Kontoghiorghes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711422731">2004</xref>). The drug is also used worldwide to treat cancer, leukemia and other diseases. It is worth noting that the drug L1 may be used in the detoxification of other metals, such as aluminum in hemodialysis patients, plutonium in nuclear industry workers and uranium in some military personnel (Di et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711422731">2004</xref>; Fukuda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711422731">2005</xref>; Paschalidis and Kontoghiorghes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711422731">1999</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711422731">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As above description, aluminum is a modern toxic metal. Hence, it prompted us to investigate the chelation potency of deferasirox and L1 in combination given to animals after aluminum loading. To the best our knowledge, no such study of aluminum mobilization with deferasirox and L1 given concurrently has been done previously. Testing was performed using an acute experimental model on rats with single or combined chelators given shortly after aluminum application. Urinary aluminum and iron excretion and serum aluminum concentration were measured after single treatment with chelators.</p>

<p>Male Wistar rats were obtained from Razi Institute (Karaj, Iran). They were bred in animal house at Kerman Neuroscience Research Center, Kerman, Iran. The rats were maintained under a controlled light:dark (12:12 h) schedule at 23 ± 1°C and humidity of 55%. The animals were assigned to control and treated groups and were kept in well-cleaned sterilized cages. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran, and Kerman Neuroscience Research Center, Kerman, Iran.</p>

<p>L1 was synthesized using a previously described method (Kontoghiorghes and Sheppard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711422731">1987</xref>). Deferasirox was purchased from Novartis Co.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In the present work, we used a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of aluminum and early administration of chelating agents similar to experiments performed by Gómez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711422731">1998a</xref>). The experiment lasted only for 24 h and urinary elimination of aluminum and iron and serum concentrations of aluminum were determined. Experiments were performed on 7-week-old male Wistar rats. Body weights of animals were between 195 and 205 g with mean ± SEM of 200 ± 2 g. Two experiments were performed, E1 and E2, with two different doses of chelators. In each experiment animals were divided into 4 groups, control, L1, deferasirox and L1 + deferasirox, of 5–15 animals in each group. Chelators were given half an hour after aluminum application and animals were immediately placed into individual glass metabolic cages for 24-h urine collection. Animals were given deionized water <italic>ad libitum</italic> and no food to avoid possible contamination of urine with aluminum originating from food. Before placing the animals into metabolic cages, deionized water was splashed and collected as a blank sample of each cage separately. Blank samples and urine collected were analyzed for aluminum and iron content. To all groups aluminum was given in a single i.p. dose of 6 mg/kg in the form of AlCl<sub>3</sub>ċ6H<sub>2</sub>O. Aluminum chloride was dissolved in saline solution and injected in a volume of 0.5 ml. Two chelators were given orally (deferasirox and L1) as a single or combined therapy. Dose of deferasirox and L1 was 100 mg/kg in experiment E1 or 200 mg/kg in experiment E2, dissolved in deionized water or saline solution. Control group received vehicle.</p>
<p>After collection, urine was acidified by adding one drop of concentrated nitric acid to each sample and then the total volume was measured. Aluminum was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GT AAS) on a Shimadsu instrument. Results were expressed as μg/24 h urine. After this step, animals were killed by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta and blood samples were collected for serum aluminum determination. Aluminum samples were measured as described above for urine. The data were subjected to statistical analysis by Student’s <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results of aluminum and iron elimination in urine and serum concentrations of both control groups from E1 and E2 experiments were not statistically different. Therefore, the results of urinary aluminum and iron excretion and serum aluminum from two control groups were pooled and presented as one control value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233711422731">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233711422731">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Urinary aluminum elimination in treated groups at the lower chelator dose in experiment E1 were not statistically different from the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233711422731">Table 1</xref>). At higher dose in experiment E2, L1 group was about four times higher than the control group, and on the other hand, urinary aluminum excretion in deferasirox and L1 + deferasirox groups was also about seven to eight times higher than that of the control group. Aluminum excretion of treated animals at higher dose was significantly higher in all experimental groups than the corresponding groups at lower dose. In experiment 2, the efficiency of L1 in increasing aluminum excretion was lower than that after deferasirox or L1 + deferasirox treatment.</p>
<p>There was no statistical difference between the deferasirox and the combined therapy group (L1 + deferasirox). Serum aluminum concentrations showed relatively high variability, especially in the control group, and therefore although lower in all treated groups, significantly lower values were only found in the deferasirox and combined L1 + deferasirox groups given at higher dose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233711422731">Table 2</xref>). The higher variability in serum values for aluminum could have been due to hemolysis in some samples, since blood cells store aluminum. Urinary iron excretions in the E1 experiment were measured in treated groups which were not statistically different from the control. In the E2 experiment, the highest excretion of iron in urine was found in L1 and L1 + deferasirox groups, which is five to seven times higher than in control group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In general, experimental studies with chelation of aluminum are difficult to perform because of the great possibility of sample contamination from the environment, especially urine, and because of the relatively high biological variability between animals in the same experiment. Most of the aluminum studies reported previously were performed as short- or long-term experiments by multiple aluminum exposure and chelation therapy with DFO or L1 thereafter (Elorriaga et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711422731">1992</xref>; Gómez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711422731">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711422731">1998b</xref>; Graff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711422731">1995</xref>; Yokel and Kostenbauder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711422731">1987</xref>). In some of these reports, serum aluminum was measured and no significant change in serum aluminum concentration was found, although serum aluminum concentrations of chelator-treated animals were lower (Elorriaga et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711422731">1992</xref>). No elevation of urine aluminum (Graff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711422731">1995</xref>) or depletion of bone aluminum (Elorriaga et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711422731">1992</xref>) was noted. In the present study, a short-term experimental model was used in order to speed up the preliminary testing procedure. As described above, in spite of the proven efficacy of DFO, not all patients are willing to cope with the rigorous requirements of the long-term use of portable pumps. In addition, the high cost of this treatment is a serious obstacle to its more widespread use. In view of these considerations, there is a great need for the development of alternative, orally effective chelating drug. Within recent years, many candidate compounds have been screened in animal models. Among all of the new chelating drugs which are available today, only deferasirox has been used as a substitute for DFO in clinical trials involving many hundreds of patients. It is a new drug that shows beneficial properties. Its relatively long half-life before excretion allows once-daily dosage and good overall patient compliance, as well as cost-effectiveness, and deferasirox is considered superior to DFO (Cappellini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711422731">2008</xref>; Lindsey and Olin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711422731">2007</xref>; Scott and Orvig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711422731">2009</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the combination of deferasirox and L1 have ideal properties for our <italic>in vivo</italic> aluminum detoxification proposes.</p>
<p>When comparing individual efficiencies of chelators in this experiment, deferasirox was more effective than L1 in enhancing urinary aluminum excretion, while L1 was more effective than deferasirox in enhancing urinary iron excretion. Our results showed that in the combined treatment group, L1 did not increase the deferasirox effect on aluminum and deferasirox did not increase the effect of L1 on iron elimination.</p>
<p>Also our results indicate that this procedure might be useful for preliminary testing of the efficiency of chelating agents in removing aluminum <italic>in vivo</italic>. We obtained dose-related increases in aluminum excretion and decreases in serum aluminum concentration for the two known chelating agents deferasirox and L1 as expected. We observed a higher efficiency of L1 than deferasirox in enhancing urinary iron excretion. It should be also mentioned that in this experimental model urinary values of aluminum showed less variation than serum aluminum values. This testing procedure, of course, does not provide all the relevant answers for evaluating the efficiency of chelating agents in aluminum toxicity like, kinetic data, mobilizing aluminum from deeper compartments, aluminum dosing and so on. Previously interactions between aluminum and iron have been reported <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fatemi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711422731">1991</xref>). In such a case, iron deficiency could result in increased absorption, as it is observed for several inorganic elements such as manganese, cobalt, lead, cadmium, gallium and indium (Fatemi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711422731">1991</xref>; Harriss and Messori, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711422731">2002</xref>; Shokooh Saljooghi and Fatemi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711422731">2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the above results show that the addition of L1 did not increase the deferasirox effect on aluminum and also the addition of deferasirox to L1 did not increase the effect of L1 on iron elimination. Therefore, these results do not support the hypothesis that L1 and deferasirox could be used interactively permitting lower doses of chelators to be effective. However, when given together as combined treatment, a simultaneous increase in both aluminum and iron elimination was observed. This applies especially to testing our hypothesis at later time intervals after aluminum administration, when differences in lipophylic properties between these two chelates might cause higher aluminum tissue depletion than after monotherapies which were not noticeable in urinary elimination in this acute experiment. This might provide additional information on the potential usefulness in using combined chelation treatment of aluminum or iron overload.</p>
