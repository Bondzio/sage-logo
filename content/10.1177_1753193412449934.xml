<p>In this issue we have published together three papers on pyrocarbon PIP joint arthroplasty. Grouping papers together should help our readers compare the data. The three papers on PIP joint arthroplasty illustrate this clearly. One paper reports good reliable results with pyrocarbon implants. One reports less good results and one reports disappointing results. This seems to accord with the experience of many surgeons. It would appear that pyrocarbon PIP joint is not a straightforward procedure with consistent results. As a scientific community we need to work out the causes of both the failures and, possibly more important, the factors that lead to a good result. We hope that reading these papers together with assist in this. There is also a podcast discussion, which provides another perspective on the published data. We will continue to try to publish together papers with clear links. This may mean a brief delay in papers being published in print but they will already have been published online.</p>
<p>We have also published some papers looking at the basic science of hand surgery. This is important work that we wish to publish in this journal. These are not always easy papers to read, but as a scientific journal we want to publish basic science alongside clinical studies. Both are essential to progress in our speciality.</p>
<p>A key role of the journal is to publish scientific papers, and in so doing improve the work that is submitted to make the studies more robust and the conclusions stronger. There will inevitably be bias from the authors, the reviewers and the editors. We hope to further redress the balance with written commentaries and have two more in this edition. They provide a different perspective on the papers. We will continue this and hope it will enhance the work we publish.</p>
<p>In our continuing section on <italic>Further Knowledge</italic> we publish a brief history of the early days of hand surgery societies in the UK. We are a European journal and so welcome histories of other societies in Europe or elsewhere.</p>
