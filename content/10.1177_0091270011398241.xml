<abstract>
<p>The impact of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in Chinese patients has been less investigated. A prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter study, therefore, was carried out to address this issue. Ninety patients with multicause-induced PAH received oral sildenafil (75 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The 6-minute walk test (SMWT) and cardiac catheterization were performed at the beginning and the end of the 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the changes in exercise capacity assessed by the SMWT; the secondary endpoint included assessment of functional class, evaluation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and clinical worsening. Drug safety and tolerability were also examined. The results showed that there was a significant improvement in SMWT distances (342 ± 93 m vs 403 ± 88 m, P &lt; .0001), Borg dyspnea score (2.9 ± 2.6 vs 2.4 ± 2.0, P = .0046), World Health Organization functional class, and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (mean pulmonary artery pressure, P &lt; .0001; cardiac index, P &lt; .0001; pulmonary vascular resistance, P &lt; .0001) after 12 weeks of oral sidenafil therapy. Almost all enrolled patients did not experience significant clinical worsening. This study confirms and extends the findings of previous studies relating to effects of sildenafil on PAH, suggesting that oral sildenafil is safe and effective for the treatment of adult patients with PAH in the Chinese population.</p>

<body>
<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to right ventricular failure and premature death. Besides conventional agents (anticoagulants, diuretics, digoxin, and supplemental oxygen, as well as calcium-channel blockers in selected patients), other therapeutic options include antiproliferative agents such as prostanoids and endothelin-receptor antagonists, which are targeted at abnormalities of endothelial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270011398241">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398241">4</xref></sup> But for patients with PAH in China, these agents are very expensive. There is a need for an affordable, easily available, orally effective agent for the management of these patients. Sildenafil is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of the guanosine monophosphate–specific phosphodiesterase-5 isoenzyme. Recently, oral sildenafil has been shown to have promising results in patients with PAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011398241">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398241">11</xref></sup> Results of the few available clinical trials from the Western population have demonstrated that sildenafil could improve exercise capacity, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, and hemodynamics in patients with symptomatic PAH because it could enhance nitric oxide–mediated vasodilatation and might have additional beneficial effects on platelet activation, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and cardiac function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270011398241">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270011398241">8</xref></sup> However, the potential effects and safety of oral sildenafil on patients with PAH in the Chinese population have not been well studied. Therefore, in this prospective, multicenter, open-label, 12-week study, we observed 90 PAH subjects using oral sildenafil 75 mg/d to examine the impact of sildenafil therapy on patients with PAH in a Chinese population.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Ninety adult patients with PAH were diagnosed by right heart catheterization according to recognized criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270011398241">1</xref></sup> PAH was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 25 mm Hg or more and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or less at rest by catheterization examination. Patients were included if they had PAH that was idiopathic, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or related to connective tissue disease or if they had a congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt that occurred after surgical or interventional repair that had been performed at least 5 years previously or in the absence of indications for surgery/intervention treatment. Sildenafil was added to supportive treatment with anticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, diuretics, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and supplemental oxygen. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) at least 18 years of age and less than 65 years old, (2) no response to acute vasodilator testing, and (3) baseline 6-minute walking distance between 100 and 450 m. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history or suspicion of inability to cooperate adequately; (2) current treatment (less than 3 months) with specific therapy (prostanoids, endothelin antagonist, L-arginine, and phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy); (3) unable to perform the 6-minute walk test (SMWT); (4) history of bleeding diathesis, gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months, intracranial bleeding, trauma, or other disease with a high risk of bleeding; (5) serum transaminase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or serum creatinine greater than 450 µmol/L; (6) other heart disease including serious cardiac arrhythmias, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months; (7) blood pressure lower than normal (&lt;90/50 mm Hg) or uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;170/110 mm Hg); (8) pigmentary degeneration of the retina; (9) history of transient ischemia attack or stroke within 3 months; or (10) pregnant or breastfeeding.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The study was a 12-week, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label trial. At baseline, all subjects underwent acute vasoreactivity testing with inhaled iloprost 20 µg for 10 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398241">12</xref></sup> Patients received oral sildenafil at a dose of 25 mg each time and 3 times per day and were offered repeated assessment at 12 weeks. The dose of sildenafil used in this study was based on guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with PAH. The study protocol was approved by local institutional review boards and ethics committees. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0091270011398241">
<title>Study Endpoints</title>
<p>The primary endpoint was the change in exercise capacity, as examined by the total distance walked in 6 minutes, from baseline to week 12. The SMWT was performed in accordance with guidelines from the American Thoracic Society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270011398241">13</xref></sup> Secondary endpoints included WHO functional classification of PAH (an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification), hemodynamic parameters (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac index), scores on the Borg scale of dyspnea (0 = <italic>no dyspnea</italic>, 10 = <italic>maximal dyspnea</italic>), and clinical worsening (defined as death, transplantation, hospitalization for PAH, or initiation of additional therapies for PAH, such as intravenous epoprostenol or oral bosentan). Physical examinations and laboratory tests were also performed covering hemoglobin level, platelet count, leukocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The adverse effects of sildenafil were also carefully recorded by investigators in all patients throughout the study. We determined patients’ compliance for the therapy according to each follow-up interview.</p>

<sec id="section5-0091270011398241">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed by a group of epidemic and statistical departments at the Peking Union Medical University (Beijing, China). The authors assume full responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the content of the article. Changes from baseline to week 12 for each study endpoint were summarized for all patients with nonmissing values at each of these assessments. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was analyzed with the use of a stratified <italic>t</italic> test. All paired changes from baseline to week 12 were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To avoid the potential bias of the results in this uncontrolled study, no imputation for missing values was used. Data are presented as mean ± SE. All reported <italic>P</italic> values are 2 sided. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Baseline Characteristics of Patients</title>
<p>Between May 2007 and April 2009, 90 consecutive adult patients with PAH from 14 medical centers in China were enrolled in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270011398241">Figure 1</xref>). All patients successfully completed the 12-week protocol. No significant clinical worsening was observed in any of the patients. None of the patients died or needed to receive other specific therapies. The baseline characteristics of all enrolled patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270011398241">Table I</xref>. Female gender (79%) and WHO functional class II (61%) were predominant.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study, we have, for the first time, demonstrated that sildenafil significantly improved exercise capacity in Chinese patients with PAH, as assessed by the SMWT, whether it was idiopathic, related to congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Although sildenafil has potential adverse effects including flushing, hypotension, dyspepsia, abnormal vision, headache, indigestion, diarrhea, and dizziness, the extent and profile of the side effects appeared to be mild and acceptable in our Chinese patients. Accordingly, our findings confirmed previous studies relating to the effects of sildenafil on PAH, suggesting that oral sildenafil was safe and effective for the treatment of adult patients with PAH.</p>
<p>PAH is a common disease in China, especially PAH due to congenital heart disease with left to right shunt. In the past, as a result of the lack of effective treatment, patients with PAH have had poor prognosis, high morbidity, and high mortality. In recent years, because of the use of targeted therapy drugs for PAH, there have been significant improvements in the prognosis of these patients. Clinical studies have shown that targeted therapy drugs, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, prostacyclins, and type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors, can improve both exercise tolerance and hemodynamics of patients suffering from PAH as well as the quality of their lives. Since the cost of endothelin receptor antagonists and prostacyclins is extraordinarily high, patients with PAH in China cannot afford such medical treatments. Although type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil are relatively cheap, evidence for the efficacy and safety of the drug taken by patients in China is insufficient. Therefore, we designed a multicenter, prospective, noncontrolled, open clinical study aimed at defining the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in patients with PAH (idiopathic, associated with congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease related, and chronic thromboembolic) in Chinese patients, who comprise a population with a different ethnic background.</p>
<p>This study showed that oral sildenafil for 12 weeks in patients with PAH was well tolerated and significantly improved exercise capacity, Borg dyspnea score, WHO functional class, and hemodynamic parameters. Although there are similarities in the pathological features of pulmonary hypertension of varying etiologies, abnormalities at the cellular and molecular levels may be different, and beneficial effects of sildenafil were seen in enrolled patients with 4 kinds of PAH. The results are comparable with the previous studies of sildenafil in patients with PAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011398241">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398241">11</xref></sup> In the SUPER-1 study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270011398241">7</xref></sup> 278 patients with PAH (either idiopathic PAH or PAH associated with connective tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts) were given placebo or citrate sildenafil (20, 40, or 80 mg) orally 3 times daily for 12 weeks. The data showed that sildenafil significantly increased SMWT, reduced the mean pulmonary artery pressure, and improved functional class. The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil versus placebo. Side effects include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and epistaxis. In that study, the patients with CTEPH and congenital left-to-right shunts that occurred in the absence of indications for surgery/intervention treatment were not enrolled. Therefore, our study extended the findings of previous studies regarding the effectiveness and safety of sildenafil in patients with PAH.</p>
<p>Exercise capacity assessed by either measurement of the SMWT or cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measurement of peak oxygen consumption in patients with PAH may reflect disease severity and assist prognostic evaluation. The SMWT distance has been used successfully to evaluate objective exercise limitation in patients with PAH of various etiologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011398241">14</xref></sup> That is why we choose the SMWT as an index reflecting our study endpoint. It has been reported that reduced peak oxygen consumption and the SMWT were associated with impaired prognosis in patients with PAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270011398241">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398241">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the nitric oxide pathway, sildenafil selectively dilates pulmonary vessels, decreases pulmonary artery pressure, and increases cardiac output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270011398241">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011398241">20</xref></sup> In the present study, sildenafil significantly improved hemodynamics at 12 weeks. The observed reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary artery pressure in sildenafil-treated patients are apparently similar to those observed in another controlled clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270011398241">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270011398241">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011398241">14</xref></sup> Sildenafil did significantly improve pulmonary vascular resistance at 12 weeks (1743.8 ± 907.7 Dys.s.cm<sup>−5</sup> vs 1334.4 ± 657.4 Dys.s.cm<sup>−5</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In addition, mean pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac index also were significantly improved in our study (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), which is in agreement with the SUPER-1 study.</p>
<p>Oral sildenafil has been reported to be well-tolerated in patients with PAH, and only minor side effects have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011398241">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270011398241">9</xref></sup> Headache and flushing were the most frequent adverse events in our study. The median times of first occurrences were clustered within the first 1 to 2 weeks after treatment. After that, all patients can adapt to it. None of the patients withdrew from the present study because of intolerable adverse events. Adverse effects covering dizziness, visual disturbance, and skin rashes in the SUPER-1 study were not found in our Chinese ethnic background patients, although they had frequently been reported in previous studies in patients receiving oral sildenafil therapy in the Western population.</p>
<p>The optimal dose of oral sildenafil for PAH remains unclear. In animal experiments, Weimann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270011398241">21</xref></sup> showed that serial cumulative doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 mg reduced pulmonary artery pressure by 21%, 28%, and 43% and pulmonary vascular resistance by 18%, 23%, and 45%, respectively. Previous studies with various dose regimens of sildenafil (up to 500 mg/d) have reported favorable effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270011398241">22</xref></sup> In the SUPER study, no dose-dependent effects of sildenafil were observed. A citrate study suggested the optimal target dose as 150 mg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270011398241">23</xref></sup> However, a randomized, double-blinded study for the effect of sildenafil 1 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg is ongoing (unpublished data, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/sjow/NCT00430716">www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/sjow/NCT00430716</ext-link>). We choose 25 mg thrice daily for our clinical study due to the economic burden and patient convenience. The cost of treatment with sildenafil 25 mg orally 3 times per day is about RMB 2000 per month, which is 15 times cheaper than bosentan and 45 times cheaper than inhaled iloprost.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present prospective, multicenter, open-label trial suggests that oral sildenafil 25 mg 3 times per day for 12 weeks is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with PAH caused by different etiologies (idiopathic, congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, and chronic thromboembolic) in Chinese patients. The treatment is well tolerated. Therefore, a random, double-blinded trial evaluating the long-term effect of oral sildenafil on survival for Chinese patients with PAH might be worthwhile.</p>
<sec id="section12-0091270011398241">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were several limitations in the present study. First, it is not a randomized double-blinded trial. Second, the study of the dose-dependent effect of sildenafil on PAH was not performed. Finally, the length of the study (12 weeks) may not be long enough to fully elucidate the possible effect of sildenafil on PAH patients.</p>
