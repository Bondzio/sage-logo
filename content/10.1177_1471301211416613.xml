<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the staff's view on dementia and its impact on the care delivered arising out of a qualitative comparative study focusing on long-term care of older people in France, Portugal and Sweden. The aim was to explore the staff's view on the illness dementia; on older people suffering from dementia; the care provided and the impact of various views on the care. The care was studied through observations at 22 care settings in the three countries and the staff's attitudes were explored by means of interviews with 79 people. A relation-oriented phenomenological approach was used. Great differences appeared regarding the various staff groups’ views. The findings also indicated that the staff's view; the cultural context and the organizational environment might have an impact on the care provided. However the impact of professional affiliation and the way of collaborating seemed to be of greater significance than other similarities or differences. An interdisciplinary based starting point, with close collaboration between medical based health care and social care of older people suffering from dementia in integrative care models, is therefore of vital importance.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211416613" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dementia is one of the most common diseases among the elderly and a major cause of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211416613">Berr, Wancata, &amp; Ritchie, 2005</xref>). However the care of older people suffering from dementia is often connected with problems and researchers recurrently report great challenges and difficulties for the staff in coping with the tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416613">Askham, Briggs, Norman, &amp; Redfern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211416613">Astvik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416613">Edberg &amp; Hallberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211416613">Jönson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211416613">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211416613">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211416613">2008</xref>). Overall challenges with an ageing population are more and more becoming a reality in the western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211416613">Brookmeyer, Johnson, Ziegler-Graham, &amp; Arrighi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211416613">Janicki, Dalton, McCallion, Baxley, &amp; Zendell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211416613">Lothian, McKee, Philip, &amp; Nolan, 2001</xref>). Since cognitive impairments and the prevalence of dementia increases with age, we can expect a growing number of older people in need of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211416613">Larsson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211416613">Pekkarinen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211416613">Thorslund, 2002</xref>). However the ways of taking care of older people in need of care vary and there are different views across the European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211416613">Blackman, 2000</xref>). Arising out of a comparative qualitative study, focused on long-term care of older people in France, Portugal and Sweden, the aim of this article is to discuss the staff's view on dementia, on older people suffering from dementia and its impact on the care delivered in three different cultures. Through observations and participant observations the everyday care was studied from various perspectives and the care staff's own perception of their attitudes and values was explored by means of interviews.</p>
<p>Extensive research on various models of dementia care and living forms, teamwork and staff educational programmes has been carried out during many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211416613">Hannan, Norman, &amp; Redfern, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211416613">Ohara 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211416613">Onishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1471301211416613">Parks, Haine, Foreman, McKinstry, &amp; Maxwell<italic>,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211416613">Slone &amp; Robinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1471301211416613">Surr, 2006</xref>). Care quality and dementia patients needs have been focused as well as the staff's difficulties to deal with their work situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416613">Edberg &amp; Hallberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416613">Josefsson, Sonde, Winblad, &amp; Wahlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1471301211416613">Wilkinson, Kerr, &amp; Cunningham, 2005</xref>). Varies staff training programmes have been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211416613">Hughes, Bagley, Reilly, Burns, &amp; Challis, 2008</xref>) and the meaning of environmental change for older people suffering from dementia has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416613">Cioffi, Fleming, Wilkes, Sinfield, &amp; Le Miere, 2007</xref>) as well as the situation of family careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211416613">Hellström, Nolan &amp; Lundh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211416613">Nolan, Ryan, Enderby, &amp; Reid, 2002</xref>). The staff patient−relationship has also been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211416613">Gilson &amp; Moyer, 2000</xref>), but no ideal forms of care have been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211416613">Macdonald &amp; Woods, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1471301211416613">Train, Nurock, Kithcen, Manela, &amp; Livingston, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Both Sweden and France are among the countries with the largest proportion of citizens over 65 years of age − 17.3 percent (Prioux &amp; Mandelbaum, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1471301211416613">Swedish Institute 2007</xref>). In Portugal the number is 16.3 percent (Bonsang, 2008). In Sweden the care of older people in general is an integrated part of the welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211416613">Edebalk &amp; Lindgren, 1996</xref>). Through the Ädel Reform, put into practice in 1992, all Swedish long-term medical care of older people in residential care, nursing homes and group living units became a municipal responsibility under the Municipal Social Welfare Services Department governed by the Social Service Act (Social Dept, 1989). This organizational change implied a politically marked ideological shifting from a medical based health care to a social care work with practically no element of medical care. In a certain sense the health care system's view of ‘dementia as an incurable disease’ was changed to the social care system's opinion of ‘older people suffering from dementia as old persons in general’. This in turn involved a large number of health care personnel being transferred from county councils to the municipalities and changed from medical care to social work, while some former home help social workers became assistant nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1471301211416613">Trydegård, 2000</xref>). At the same time as these two categories got a new job, some of them also got different theories for their social work practice which was of vital importance, especially the residents suffering from dementia living in special housing and the staff in these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211416613">Moss &amp; Cameron, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416613">Josefsson, Sonde, Winblad, &amp; Robins Wahlin (2007)</xref> mean that this change divided the care of older people in Sweden into two groups: dementia care and generic care. These changes had a significant impact on the work situation of the socially trained social service staff as well as of the medically trained nursing staff (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In France a considerable change of the care policy regarding older people was implemented in 2002. By the <italic>allocation personnalisée à l'autonomie</italic> (APA),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211416613">1</xref></sup> citizens aged over 60 dependent on care, receive cash benefits of up to a certain amount a month as a copayment for expenses incurred by beneficiaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1471301211416613">Pavolini &amp; Ranci 2008</xref>). The care is provided by many different stakeholders and only the short term health care is under the direct organizational and economical responsibility of the French Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211416613">Sandier, Paris &amp; Polton, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Portugal, legislation in 1979 established the right of all citizens to health protection and access to the National Health Service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1471301211416613">2</xref></sup> However, in the 21st century, the health care system in Portugal is still considered to face many problems and to have insufficient provision of community care services, including long term care and social services for the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211416613">Santana, Dias, Souza, &amp; Rocha, 2007</xref>). Some social services are provided through the Ministry of Social Security, which are non-profit non-public institutions solidarity, and among them religious charities are the main providers.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211416613"><title>Dementia and the care provided</title>
<p>Dementia is a generic term that covers illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontal lobe dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211416613">Lyng, 1996</xref>) as well as symptoms of a condition caused by organic brain damage resulting in decreased cognitive abilities, memory loss and delusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211416613">Nordberg &amp; Winblad, 1996</xref>). The comprehensive impairment in cognition and behavioural disturbances involved contribute to the burden of caring for older people suffering from dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211416613">Chrzescijanski, Moyle, &amp; Creedy 2007</xref>). As one of the most common diseases in the elderly and a major cause of disability and mortality it is furthermore considered a significant public health problem.</p>
<p>Research on dementia was initially quite modest, but in recent decades it has exploded exponentially. Due to orientation the research has developed differently over time and in a certain sense the various perspectives focused also reflect changed views, not only on dementia and the care provided, but also on older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211416613">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211416613">2005</xref>). Firstly the research can be described as mainly ‘cause-oriented’ dominated by attempt at finding the cause of the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211416613">Fratiglioni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416613">Gustafson, 1990</xref>). Then, as the results continued to be insufficient, a more ‘treatment-oriented’ view took over with increased interest in developing treatments to relieve the consequences for people suffering from dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211416613">Bleeker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211416613">Josephsson, 1994</xref>). Thereafter the ‘understanding-oriented’ viewpoint concentrated on the meaning of the illness for those afflicted and people in their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211416613">Hallberg &amp; Norberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211416613">Jansson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211416613">Nygård, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1471301211416613">Ritchie and Ledésert, 1992</xref>). Eventually a ‘relation-oriented perspective’ emphasizing the understanding of the residents' <italic>and</italic> staff members' actions was centred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416613">Feil 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1471301211416613">Ploton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211416613">Schmid, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1471301211416613">Swane, 1996</xref>;).</p>
<p>In recent times the various research perspectives have been going in parallel and they are all still alive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211416613">Kaskie, Coddington and Abrams (2004</xref>, p. 32) state that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Clinical dementia has become one of the most serious and persistent health problems affecting persons over the age of 65. Efforts to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia are ongoing, while healthcare executives continue to face a number of challenges.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of diagnosing dementia is currently discussed, partly to differentiate the illness from other psychical, psychiatric or psychological conditions, but also in order to use treatment available.</p>
<p>In the study referred to in this article France, Portugal and Sweden were partly selected due to their traditions regarding dementia care. In a certain way France represents a pioneer as they already in the late-1960s developed the group living idea for older people suffering from dementia under the term ‘cantou’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1471301211416613">3</xref></sup> When intensive research on dementia failed to find any cures, emphasis was placed on maintaining the healthy aspects of the patients. Usually six to eight persons lived in their own flats with a common area for meals and social activities. An appropriate balance of assistance in everyday chores was intended to compensate for diminished cognitive functions. Central to the idea was the relationally based approach in the framework of qualified health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211416613">Annerstedt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211416613">Colvez, 1994</xref>). In some sense this can be considered an early attempt to integrate two focuses of care, namely health care and social care in the area of institutionally based settings for older people suffering from dementia. Nowadays this group living idea has disappeared as a care form in France, but sometimes the term ‘cantou’ is used for special dementia care units within residential homes.</p>
<p>In Portugal, which is the other extreme, they are just in the beginning of the development of dementia care and research is still focused on accurate assessment of patients' social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211416613">Fernandes et al., 2009</xref>). Yet no special care forms are available and most of the publications accessible are care manuals published by Alzheimer's Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211416613">Alzheimer Europe, 2006</xref>). Even the interest in ageing and research on older people on the whole is relatively new and primarily because the challenges with an ageing population have become apparent in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211416613">European Commission, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the development of dementia care, Sweden can be placed somewhere in between France and Portugal. In the end of 1970s, about ten years after the French initiative implementing ‘cantou’ as a living and care form, the idea was realized in Sweden and until the middle 1990s this form of care grew rapidly. Integrated care is still discussed from various perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211416613">Kodner &amp; Spreeuwenberg, 2002</xref>), however group living for older people suffering form dementia has almost disappeared also in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 2004</xref>). Overall extensive changes have occurred in the care of the elderly during the 1990s, with fewer people being provided public care at all and with a dislocation towards market –provided care as well as voluntary and informal care often focused on the families’ efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211416613">Blomberg, Edebalk, &amp; Pettersson, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211416613"><title>Aim and points of departure</title>
<p>In a global perspective long-term care units are more and more providing care for people with considerable cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211416613">Hughes, Bagley, Reilly, Burns, &amp; Challis, 2008</xref>). From Australia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416613">Cioffi, Fleming, Wilkes, Sinfield, and Le Miere (2007)</xref> report that at least 60 percent of the residents in nursing homes are diagnosed with moderate or severe dementia. An example from South-East England is pointing out a prevalence of 74 percent in general care homes for frail elderly people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211416613">Macdonald &amp; Woods, 2005</xref>) and in Sweden the number of older people suffering from dementia is estimated to be over 80 percent at many non-specialized care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211416613">Thorslund, 2002</xref>). This complexity of the needs of older people implies great challenges to the staff responsible for the care units and also the staff involved in the direct care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211416613">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1471301211416613">Zimmerman, Sloane, Heck, Maslow, &amp; Schultz, 2005</xref>). However many of the training programmes tested, based on varies professional and theoretical frameworks, give no accounts of effect on the quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211416613">Macdonald &amp; Woods, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In Sweden extensive care problems continuously have been described in the mass media and discussed by researchers during the last decades and especially after the reform, mentioned earlier on in this text, carried through in 1992 implying a radical ideological change of the care policy. By comparing the caregivers’ views and the care observed in three different cultures, one of the intentions with the study referred to in this article was to come closer to an understanding of those care problems reported. Based on these experiences, the primary aim of this article is to discuss the following questions:
<list id="list1-1471301211416613" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The staff's view on the illness dementia;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The staff's view on older people suffering from dementia and the care provided;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The impact of the various views on the care delivered in relation to the care delivered and to the cultural context.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Comparative qualitative studies centred on similarities and differences between various countries are rare. In a research review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211416613">Hannan, Norman and Redfern (2001</xref>, p. 189) conclude that there is considerable research done on work satisfaction, care load and the well-being of older people, but very little research links the staff's perceptions with the actual care they give. Available intercultural research rather reports the actual situation than introduce analytical based findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211416613">Philp, 2001</xref>). In this text health care refers to medical based care carried out by medical doctors and registered nurses. Social care is the practical support to help people cope with the everyday life provided by assistant nurses and caregivers. The definition of social work in general used is the one stated by International Federation of Social Workers:
<disp-quote>
<p>The social work profession promotes social change, problem solving in human relationships and the empowerment and liberation of people to enhance well-being. Utilising theories of human behaviour and social systems, social work intervenes at the points where people interact with their environments. Principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211416613"><title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>In dementia care the illness dementia is the phenomenon bringing the staff and the residents together. However severe problems are often identified with passivity, hostility and aggressive behaviour as common visible phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1471301211416613">Wall et al., 2008</xref>). To broaden and deepen the comprehension of those incidents a comparative relation-oriented intercultural approach was chosen mainly based on a phenomenological/hermeneutic standpoint. Even if relation-oriented studies mainly are centred on relationships, the most usual viewpoints are either the staff's <italic>or</italic> the residents’ reactions and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211416613">Clare, Rowlands, Bruce, Surr, &amp; Downs, 2008</xref>), but in this project the interaction between staff and the residents actually was studied. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211416613">Kitwood (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211416613">1995</xref>) who emphasizes the importance of the relationships and the environmental factors in dementia care, the staff and their actions were focused instead of just seeing the older people suffering from dementia as the ‘problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211416613">McIntyre, 2003</xref>). Principally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211416613">Rogers’ (1987)</xref> holistic perspective and psychological theory of personality, behaviour and counselling was used. Based on a humanistic view his theory was built on the conviction that ‘it is the quality of the personal relationship which matters most’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211416613">Rogers, 1967/1994</xref>, p. 89). He started his approach in <italic>self- actualization</italic> and meant that every individual try to develop her or his potentials to the fullest extent possible. He also meant that a counsellor in order to help must have three very special qualities namely <italic>congruence</italic>, <italic>empathy</italic> and <italic>respect</italic>. According to Rogers the self consists of three selves: the self-concept, the ideal self, and the real self. The self-concept is the way a person sees him/herself. The ideal self is the one the person would like to be and the real self is the one the person actually is. <italic>Congruence</italic> is the amount of agreement between the three selves. The more congruence, the more psychological health there is within a person. The aim of person-centred counselling is to increase the client's congruence. <italic>Empathy</italic> is the ability to feel what others feel. Empathetic understanding involves sensing the other person's world as if it were one's own. Two processes foster empathic understanding: reflection and clarification. <italic>Respect</italic> is acceptance and unconditional positive regard towards another person. Rogers believed the therapist should have unconditional positive regard for the client – that is, not judge the client's character. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211416613">Holst, Edberg and Hallberg (1999)</xref> used similar points of departure in dementia care when they studied how nurses helped old dementia patients to meaning through retelling their life stories. The concept of empathy and the empathy levels between staff and people suffering from dementia has also been discussed as an effect of personality characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211416613">Gilson &amp; Moyer, 2000</xref>). Already in the early 1990s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211416613">Sabat &amp; Harré (1992)</xref> argued that people suffering from dementia attempt to keep their ego identity by appropriating ‘pictures' they had before they lost their identity. They return to episodes earlier on in their lives and through these, and stories about them, they live their lives in their own reality. In those processes the relationships and the staff's action are central for the dementia care provided and studies show that positive staff attitudes are linked to higher degree of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>In this study everyday care was focused upon using qualitative methods. The methodological considerations were primarily aimed at understanding people's actions and their inherent meaning in relation to their perceptions and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211416613">Alvesson and Sköldberg, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211416613">Huberman and Miles (1994)</xref> think that the methods chosen always are intimately tied to <italic>what</italic> one intends to study and <italic>who</italic> will be carrying out the research work. In the present study, containing interviews, observations and participant observations, there were close points of similarity between the care studied and the research methods used to study this reality. That is, through the data collection the researcher's interaction with the people and the environment and the perception of what was happening constituted the base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211416613">Jarvie, 1991</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211416613"><title>Data collection and participants</title>
<p>This study is part of a larger qualitative project comparing institutionally based dementia care in France, Portugal and Sweden. The project in its entirety was aimed at exploring and understanding the gap between political goals and the care of older people suffering from dementia. By studying how the socio-political standpoints are implemented in France and Portugal, the aims were to try to understand the phenomena in the Swedish culture manifested in care problems. Data were collected between 2002 and 2005 during three visits to France of 6.5 weeks in total, four visits to Portugal totalling 6.5 weeks and three journeys in Sweden totalling 2.5 weeks. The care settings were residential homes, nursing homes and hospital wards and the providers varied. The ambition was to get access to residential homes run by different providers. Some units were organised under the National Health Service and others under the local authorities, some were voluntary and others arranged within the private sector. In each of the three countries the capital, one or two medium-sized cities and a small town were chosen. In all, 22 care settings for older people were included; eight in both France and Portugal and six in Sweden (three municipally based special housing units and three county council based wards).</p>
<p>In Portugal the contacts were made in quite a formal way. Initially an information letter was sent to some universities and institutions. After receiving a list of various long-term living units another information letter was sent. Two weeks later the manager at each unit was contacted. Those who agreed to participate then received another letter in order to get informed consent from the staff. In Sweden, a similar procedure which started with the managers took place. However, in France none of the universities contacted replied; neither did the managers at a later date. Only after being connected by private contacts could the research procedure begin.</p>
<p>Seventy-nine people involved in direct care were interviewed; 23 in France (21 women and two men), 22 in Portugal (20 women and two men) and 34 women in Sweden. After biographical queries regarding age, education and time in care, a dialogue focused on everyday care was initiated. Examples of introductory questions in the 37 individual interviews were: ‘Could you please describe an ordinary day at work?’ followed by questions about possibilities and hindrances. Then the interviews continued on attitudes and values concerning older people, dementia and dementia care. Forty-two people participated in ten focus group settings. The fundamental idea with focus groups is that the researcher brings together a group of people with the intention of discussing several pre-formulated questions or themes that in some way concern the participants. The themes then guide the direction and thereby constitute the focus of the interview session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211416613">Krueger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211416613">Merton, Fiske, &amp; Kendall, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1471301211416613">Wibeck, 2000</xref>). The questions in this part of the study were the same as the ones used in the individual interviews. In addition to the content of the focus group discussions, great importance was also attached to the group dynamics. The result can be said to constitute an analysis in which content and form in combination represent the central parts. The participants in all represent eight different professions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211416613">Table 1</xref>).

<p>In addition data include 37 informal conversational interviews (19 in France and 18 in Portugal) performed mainly with assistant nurses and unqualified care workers during observations and participant observations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1471301211416613">Patton (1990)</xref> describes this form as the most open-ended approach to interviewing and considers this method ‘a major tool used in combination with participant observation to permit the evaluator who is participating in some programmatic activity to understand other participants’ reactions to what is happening’ (ibid. p 281). All research contacts and interviews were carried out by the author in the respective native language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211416613"><title>Methodological and ethical considerations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211416613">Kvale (1996</xref>, p. 281) distinguishes pragmatic validity, which is the dialogue with the participants and others familiar with the circumstances, from communicative validity that is about the communication with the reader. In this study all participants were offered the data to read. Almost one third of them accepted, but data have also been orally introduced to many of the participants and also discussed at various seminars. Quotations have been included so readers can make their own interpretations of what the interviewees were saying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211416613">Henriksson and Månsson, 1996</xref>). However in this type of qualitative research the risk of becoming too involved always constitutes a limitation and even if the projects described were approved by the Research Councils’ ethical committees, there were many other ethical considerations to decide on during the research process. A case in point is the fact that only one third of the participants were interested in reading the data which lead to the decision to try to go back to as many units as possible and orally introduce the data and the findings. Even if it was the staff's views that were focused on in this study, the observations also involved the residents present. That implied many ethical reflections, which in turn actually lead to omission of some interesting empirical examples due to the risk of offending some of the dementia patients (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211416613">Sheratt, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211416613"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data principally consist of three types of written material, namely tape recordings and transcribed interviews, field notes from observations and participant observations and notes of informal conversation interviews. Content analysis procedures were mainly based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211416613">Rogers’ (1967/1994)</xref> theoretical and methodological approach focusing on people's self concept. Due to aim and content the data were separately arranged and different questions were put to the material from interviews and observations. All the data were then read repeatedly in order to find patterns which could then be subject to further interpretation and description (Fontana and Frey, 2000). Mainly the interviews were aimed at answering the research questions concerning the staff's view on dementia, dementia care and the care provided. Thus the observations were supposed to show the actual care performed and also constitute the base for further interpretation regarding the impact of the attitudes on the care situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211416613"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Four themes emerged and different views were found in the three countries. In France the staff experienced the residents as <italic>‘old and ill’</italic>. It might be understood in the health based care context dominated by a medication oriented treatment and an economically ruled trust emphasizing efficiency. In Portugal the staff considered the older people <italic>‘old in need of help’</italic>, but saw things differently depending on the level of their qualification. While the managers, who all were BSc in social work and trained as social workers, wanted diagnoses for better care, the assistant nurses and the unqualified caregivers were more concerned with everyday activities. In Sweden two different attitudes appeared. In the municipal based special housing governed by the social service organization, the older people were considered <italic>‘old residents’,</italic> while the staff on the county council based hospital wards saw them as <italic>‘old patients’</italic>. This is a finding in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416613">Josefsson, Sonde, Winblad, &amp; Robins Wahlin (2007)</xref> who contend that the reform of 1992 divided the care of older people in Sweden into dementia care and generic care. Also in this study the social service personnel wanted to think about the residents as old and healthy people with no need of medical health care. In accordance with this, the socially trained staff considered the long-term living units to be a form of living and not a place for care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211416613"><title>‘Old and ill’</title>
<p>In France the socio-political ambition is to diagnose all older people in need of long-term care, but most residents in the settings under study had not been tested regarding dementia. Instead the assessment tool ‘Modèle Aggir’ was used to measure autonomy and care needs.
<disp-quote>
<p>Our unit has 64 residents. Approximately half of them are suffering from dementia, but far from all are diagnosed. (Registered Nurse)</p>
<p>This long-term hospital is focused on care of older people. We have 125 beds: 30 at the emergency ward, 30 short term places and the remaining 65 are long-term patients. Roughly 80 of our patients are suffering from dementia, but all are not diagnosed. (Psychologist)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Besides the participants quoted above, only another five of the personnel reflected upon dementia in relation to the residents. The ones aware of the disease were talking about various types of treatments and discussed the importance of knowledge among the staff. They also emphasized activities aimed at maintaining the remaining functions (cf. Almkvist and Winblad, 1999). Fifteen of the staff members were talking about the residents as ‘old and ill’ patients, but not in relation to a dementia disease. The experienced difficulties in care situations are well-known phenomena from eldercare research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416613">Askham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211416613">Astvik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416613">Edberg and Hallberg, 2001</xref>).
<disp-quote>
<p>I don't know so much about dementia but I think the patients here are heavy and therefore difficult to care. Sometimes it's also hard to know how to answer when they are asking the same questions all the time. (Assistant Nurse)</p>
<p>I am a district nurse since many years but I am not specialised in geriatrics. My job here includes being on duty that is the assistant nurses working during the night can call me if they need any advice or they want me to come in. Actually I have never been thinking of any special care of people suffering from dementia. I don't know so much about that. For me they are ill, the physician prescribes the medicines and I am the one responsible for the deliverance of the care (Registered Nurse, Assistant Manager)</p>
<p>As an Occupational Therapist I'm mainly working with the technical means of assistance. I hardly don't know anything about dementia and I'm not thinking of the patients in that way. (Occupational Therapist)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Many assistant nurses were talking about the residents and the daily care situations in a practical way concerning medication, feeding, shower-baths and wheelchairs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416613">Murphy (2005</xref>, p. 478) states that ‘studies have consistently found that care of older people continues to be dominated by routine’ which also seemed to be what was happening at the units in the research project. Even when staff was asked to reflect upon the everyday meetings with older people suffering from dementia they often answered: ‘I never think of dementia and I don't think of the old patients as people suffering from dementia’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211416613"><title>‘Old in need of help’</title>
<p>At the care settings studied in Portugal they did not set out to diagnose dementia at all in connection with long-term living decisions. To assess the care needs they used the European instrument ‘Easy Care’ (Sistema de Avalicação de Idosos). Three BSc (trained as social workers and head managers at three of the units) three Registered Nurses and three Physicians showed that they had detailed knowledge of dementia and different forms of care. From various standpoints they all complained over the lack of diagnoses. Regarding the problems with vocally disrupted behaviour the findings are supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211416613">Hallberg's (1990)</xref> studies showing the importance of environmental stability in dementia care:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have 50 older people living here but nobody is diagnosed as suffering from dementia. As we do not have so many single rooms I believe it is a problem especially with vocally disruptive behaviour. (BSc in Social Work, Manager)</p>
<p>I believe they should diagnose as many as possible so that the older people with Alzheimer's disease would get medicine. But it is only in the beginning here and most of the residents live here of social reasons. (Registered Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Even if Managers, Registered Nurses and Physicians were aware of dementia as a disease the rest of the staff did not talk about it at all. They considered the residents ‘old in need of help’. Autonomy, activity and a home like environment were their lodestars which have been found also in other studies (see i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416613">Murphy, 2005</xref>).
<disp-quote>
<p>Nobody should eat in the room. Therefore we help them all to the dining-room three times a day. They get a healthy appetite and the meals are like an activity even for the weakest residents. (Assistant Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the staff members at the eight care settings in Portugal did not reflect upon dementia as a disease. When they were talking about the residents and the care delivered it seemed to be an integrated part of their culturally based beliefs. Many of the caregivers were unqualified and had no idea about dementia, but they liked their work and the residents. Similar findings are reported from previous dementia studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211416613">Melin Emilsson, 1998</xref>).
<disp-quote>

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211416613"><title>‘Old residents' or ‘old patients’</title>
<p>In the six care units in Sweden different views were found in different organizational contexts. Neither in France nor in Portugal did these differences appear. In the Swedish municipal based special housing the staff emphasized the focus on social care, but also pointed out their own lack of knowledge of dementia and dementia care. They also missed a health care based leadership. However in the changed organizational system of 1992 no health care staff were wanted in the social care environment of older people. The Swedish managers in this study, of whom very few were Registered Nurses, consequently complained about the caregivers’ lack of knowledge regarding health care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416613">Josefsson et al. (2007)</xref> found similar complaints among Registered Nurses working with social care trained staff; this is a result of the reform in 1992 when the care of all older people in Sweden became a municipal responsibility.
<disp-quote>
<p>According to the care philosophy the older people living here of course should be considered old, but not with severe cognitive impairments. In fact most of them are suffering from dementia even if far from all are diagnosed. (BSc in Social Work, Manager)</p>
<p>Good leadership is necessary when working with old people with dementia because they bring out so many strange reactions in you. (Assistant Nurse)</p>
<p>This is a form of living for older people but not a nursing home. Even if most of the residents are suffering from dementia, we are just supposed to take care of older people in their everyday lives. This is social care but not health care. (Assistant Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the county council based Swedish geriatric clinics they first of all saw the older people as ‘old patients’, which in a certain sense is understandable as these clinics actually are hospital wards. Even if no long-term care of older people in Sweden is under the health care system, a comparison with France is interesting since many of the French care settings studied were organized under the health care services:
<disp-quote>
<p>Of our outdoor patients about 50 percent get medical treatment against Alzheimer's disease. Even after moving in to special housing units they want to come back here as particularly their families don't trust the staff's competence. Actually I agree as many of them don't know anything about dementia care. (Registered Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In particular a recently started French clinic that focused on diagnosing dementia had many similarities with the Swedish clinics. However the Swedish staff demonstrated much more experience and knowledge of dementia and dementia care. They gave detailed accounts of both the patients’ symptoms and the skills required from the staff in the interaction with the dementia patients.
<disp-quote>
<p>When working with dementia patients one has to be personally involved, empathetic, honest and respectful. One also must have a lot of patience and above all good colleagues and leaders to get support when it is difficult. (Assistant Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec13-1471301211416613"><title>Concluding discussion</title>
<p>From the theoretical starting point taken in this article, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211416613">Rogers’ (1969)</xref> statement that the quality of the relationship is what matters most in care work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211416613">Kitwood's (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211416613">1995</xref>) notion stressing the importance of the relationships and the environmental factors in dementia care, great differences appeared regarding the different staff groups’ view of dementia, older people suffering from dementia and the care delivered. The findings also illustrated different views on dementia among the staff groups when comparing the three countries involved and within different organizational frameworks. The results also indicated that the staff's view and the cultural context as well as the organizational environment might have an impact on the care provided.</p>
<p>The four themes that emerged pointed out that the majority of the staff in France, and at the municipal based social care units in Sweden, did not even think of the interaction going on between them and the residents, which also was reflected in their behaviour. In the French settings the personnel considered the older people suffering from dementia just as ‘old and ill’ and in need of medical care, and they did not see the patients as persons in need of interpersonal interaction based on empathy and basic human relationships. Both in France and in Sweden the staff spent much more time together with one another than with the residents and while providing the care they talked to each other but not to the residents. The staff's way of considering the residents as just ‘old and ill’ or ‘old residents’ in terms of ‘objects to handle’ can also be interpreted as lack of respect. According to Rogers' theory, empathy comprises the ability of sensing the other person's world. The staff's way of talking about the residents indicates that they did not even try to imagine how it would be getting old and suffering from dementia. At the Swedish special housings the social work staff constantly reproved the residents, expecting them to behave like healthy and well-mannered people. These findings are in line with the discussions by researchers and theorists referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211416613">Gilson &amp; Moyer (2000)</xref> concerning the question to what extent people are willing or able to imagine themselves in another person's situation and involve themselves at an emotional level. From an interactional perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211416613">Hellström, Nolan, and Lundh (2005</xref>: 271) find that lack or awareness of the symptoms of dementia may result in failure ‘to establish a shared “social construction of the situation”’. This attitude, implying an ignorance of the dementia disease, can be considered to be a shortage of empathy but it could also be seen as a misunderstanding of the ideas with the early group-living concept emphasizing the maintenance of the healthy aspects.</p>
<p>In an intercultural comparative perspective data pointed out the greatest differences between the care provided and the staff's view in Portugal and in France, while the Swedish examples represented the both attitudes. The impact of the cultural context is therefore difficult to assess. Neither did the fact that both in France and in Portugal, but not in Sweden, the families are responsible for the care of their older relatives, show any differences with reference to number of visits and participation in the care. At the care settings under study in Portugal, where the awareness of dementia on the whole was very low, the care was very similar to the group living idea that started in France in the late 1960s. The Portuguese staff's views and manners also indicated that many of them had the three qualities congruence, empathy and respect (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211416613">Rogers, 1969</xref>). They liked working with the residents; they spent the whole working time with them and accepted them as they were without fostering tendencies. Even on the Swedish geriatric wards corresponding results were found. Therefore it is difficult to know what might be culturally influenced, and what might be an outcome of organization and training, as the staff on the Swedish geriatric wards is trained in medical health care of older people, while the staff at the special housing units is trained in the social work care system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211416613">Chrzescijanski et al. (2007)</xref> mean that societal attitudes towards ageing and older people influence the staff's view and in Portugal the tradition of taking care of older people is deeply rooted. In Sweden on the other hand education is traditionally emphasized. Holst, Edberg and Hallberg's (1996) point out the importance of knowledge of dementia among staff, which may be a possible explanation to the findings from the Swedish geriatric wards.</p>
<p>The most interesting findings, from the study referred to in this article, are probably the notion that the impact of the professional affiliation and collaboration seems to be of greater importance than cultural similarities or differences within or between the countries. In Portugal, all the participating managers held a BSc in Social Work at the same time as all the care settings involved in the research had doctors and nurses employed in leading positions. Thus both the social care and the health care perspectives were professionally represented. And instead of competition, it looked liked the various professional views at these care units complemented each other. It seemed like the two focuses of care were not only functioning side by side, but they were integrated into a holistic care perspective giving the older people a kind of care very similar to the old group living idea mentioned.</p>
<p>To conclude, both the impact of knowledge and professional training and the impact of cultural context seem to be crucial for the staff's view and the care delivered. According to this and due to increasing cross-cultural movements implying that there will be older people with different cultural backgrounds in need of care in different countries, this study is pointing out the relevance of knowledge both on dementia, older people suffering from dementia, the care provided and ethnical issues. But above all what is required is an interdisciplinary based starting point, with close collaboration between medical based health care and social care of older people suffering from dementia in integrative care models.</p>
