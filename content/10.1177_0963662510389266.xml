<abstract>
<p>Will synthetic biology elicit controversies similar to those of genetically modified crops before? Maybe, but where exactly are the analogies, and how can we gain substantial insights rather than mere guesses? We argue that as well as the intrinsic properties of the technologies at stake, the context of their implementation is decisive. To assess mechanisms of past and potential controversies, an investigative tool is presented. The Gate Resonance model, derived from older models of societal conflict, allows the identification of key elements of conflict generating processes. In monitoring the developing debate on synthetic biology using this model, analogies to the case of genetically modified crops appear less convincing. So far, there are only few indications that a controversy is imminent.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Synthetic biology (SB) is one of the most topical emerging technologies with a strong link to genetic engineering. Fears have been expressed that it will elicit similar suspicion among a critical public possibly entailing a controversy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510389266">de Vriend, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510389266">IRGC, 2009</xref>). Since the conflict over genetically modified (GM) crops had severe implications for the prospects of the technology in Europe, learning from past experiences is considered a major task for the governance of emerging technologies in general and SB in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510389266">Torgersen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparisons, however, are difficult to draw as new technologies may raise diverse concerns – or none. Reactions to new technologies differ vastly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510389266">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>); in the past, only a few elicited controversies and even if they arose, reasons and mechanisms differed subject to applications, local conditions and other contingencies. This was also the case for various fields of biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510389266">Torgersen et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than drawing simple comparisons to predict conflicts out of the blue sky, we will more systematically use past debates over GM crops as a working analogy to develop investigative tools. In this conceptual paper, we present a model based on earlier work on societal conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510389266">Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510389266">Renn, 1992</xref>) that, in addition, draws on insights into the GM crops debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510389266">Levidow and Carr, 2009</xref>) as an analytic heuristic. It renders hypotheses for SB by logic of abduction arriving at hopefully useful conjectures. Thus, we aim at contributing to the analysis of the institutional end of technology governance.</p>
<p>The Gate Resonance model of public technology controversies (in the following “the Model”) features several elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662510389266">Figure 1</xref>):</p>

<title>2. Some approaches relevant for understanding technology controversies</title>
<p>Conflicts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510389266">1</xref></sup> are often attributed to a clash of interests. Older research addresses mainly the conditions of interest representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662510389266">Zald and McCarthy, 1987</xref>) or various organisations’ opportunities for influence (neo-corporatists approach, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510389266">Kriesi, 2001</xref>). The constructivist turn emphasises the role of societal actors over the attributes of an issue. To set the agenda, actors apply resources to convey issues to the regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510389266">Blumer, 1971</xref>), which, however, is only able to deal with a few issues in parallel. This implies making choices; emerging issues have to overcome limitations in the regulatory processing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510389266">Baumgartner and Jones, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Conflicts are complex series of events, so other researchers address topics such as the role of the media (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510389266">Bauer and Bonfadelli, 2002</xref>). While most research focuses on specific aspects, only a few integrative concepts have been developed. One of them, the Public Arena model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510389266">Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988</xref>), asks why some issues are debated in the public, the media and political institutions while others are ignored. Accordingly, social problems cannot objectively be defined by their harm but are the products of collective definitions. Here too, attention is a scarce resource, so the number of issues taken up is restricted. What renders an issue likely to raise a public controversy is considered to be a result of competition and selection processes in social arenas like newspapers or congressional committees. Selection principles follow dimensions such as drama, culture, politics and institutional rhythms.</p>
<p>The Arena model of risk conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510389266">Renn, 1992</xref>) analyses political processes along different conflict dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510389266">Renn, 2008</xref>: 130f.). It integrates political actors, interest organisations, the media and the public under the assumption that technology conflicts are part of a structural arrangement. Arenas (i.e. Parliament, media discourse, regulation, etc.) are considered symbolic locations where agenda setting and interest mediation take place in a structured way, and where societal actors, surrounded by issue amplifiers (the media), enter into discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510389266">Renn, 1992</xref>: 181ff.). Different actors apply arena-specific resources – money, power, commitment, evidence – to influence policy outcomes. Communication and mobilisation connect an arena to its environment – interest groups, uninvolved groups and the general public – and compensate for resources lacking: actors can modify the rules by mobilising uninvolved groups or the public. The Arena model highlights the environment in helping actors pursue their interests but remains vague regarding processes between actors and the environment as well as the publics’ role.</p>
<p>More specifically, in a study on the controversy over GM crops, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510389266">Levidow and Carr (2009)</xref> find that political institutions take an active role, different arenas vary in importance over time and conflicts transgress from media discourse to regulatory and parliamentary arenas and back again. Actors aim at framing issues to match their interest; selecting the arena, they try to convey interests and views to political decision-making. Conflicts thus appear on two interrelated levels: setting the rules of the decision-making process, and the process itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963662510389266">
<title>3. The Gate Resonance model and its application to the cases of GM crops and SB</title>
<p>In a nutshell, the Model conceptualises the regulatory system as comprising institutions being addressees of interest representation as well as actors themselves. They determine the success of interest representation by selecting the issues they deal with and restrict the frame of the regulatory debate. They also select interest groups regularly involved in political negotiation processes (so-called established interests), while others (organised interests) are excluded. In addition to selecting interest groups, institutions select problems to deal with and types of arguments that are either processed or rejected. The central selecting element is a function called the “Gate.” It selects arguments according to formal criteria, strictly adhering to a particular frame, to be processed through formalised routines. Arguments that do not fit the criteria are rejected as irrelevant for regulatory purposes. Any interest-representing organisation not integrated into the normal mode of policy-making can either transform their views into terms fitting the Gate or try to modify it, for example via mobilisation strategies. Resonance with the media and with the public is an important prerequisite for mobilisation, but the number of issues taken up is limited and subject to attention cycles and competition.</p>
<p>In the following, we will develop central elements of the Model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662510389266">Figure 1</xref>) and apply them to the cases of GM crops and SB to allow for comparisons.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963662510389266">
<title>i. The regulatory system consists of regulatory institutions having to select issues because their processing capacities are limited</title>
<p>The regulatory system, supposed to produce binding decisions, is not a homogeneous entity as it consists of institutions working together in establishing rules while competing for competencies. They process regulatory needs and set the conditions for interest representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662510389266">Streeck, 1994</xref>). The organisational structure of an administrative bureaucracy is not least a result of the political system’s coping with past regulatory demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510389266">Häußermann, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The Model conceptualises the regulatory system as active and not only as subject to pressure from other actors. Regulatory institutions have their own agenda apart from, but embedded in, the general political agenda of the elected government. Not only interest representatives but also regulators have stakes that may collide. They influence the system’s selection criteria as well as its internal structure, reflecting the “frozen” experience of previous conflicts and the structure of interest representation. The higher the political relevance of a topic the more important it is in the organisational hierarchy. Departments dealing with issues deemed politically important gain in reputation, staff and budget, while issues without addressees within the system are hardly taken notice of.</p>
<p><italic>GM crops</italic> is a multi-level regulatory issue where institutions at different levels (national ministries, the European Union and international bodies such as the World Trade Organization) got involved in the regulation of something considered novel. From the late 1980s, the issue caused problems despite the European Commission (EC)’s common regulatory frame. Although most governments strived “to make biotechnology happen” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510389266">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>: 280), differences among competing Directorates General and member states became evident in 1996 when the first GM soy arrived in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510389266">Lassen et al., 2002</xref>). While the European Parliament gained in profile, the “frozen experience” of regulatory institutions turned out to be insufficient. New institutions like the European Food Safety Authority stepped in, having been set up as a consequence of food conflicts such as over bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662510389266">Sato, 2010</xref>), which existing institutions had not been able to cope with.</p>
<p><italic>Synthetic biology</italic> does not yet seem to have found its appropriate regulatory environment. Without obvious necessity, the regulatory “frozen experience” seems to be that of GM crops almost by default. Regulatory attention has been indecisive even regarding support (Schmidt et al., this issue); no “trigger event” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510389266">Hampel et al., 2006</xref>) has forced regulatory institutions to come up with a quick solution so far.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662510389266">
<title>ii. Interest-representing organisations bridge the gap between the public and the regulatory system, competing for influence on regulatory activities</title>
<p>The regulatory system is the target of interest-representing organisations trying to influence decisions, conveying specific interests and world-views. However, there are more interests in a society than organisations representing them. Nevertheless, some interests are easier to organise than others, and some can mobilise resources more easily. In seeking support, organisations interpret particular issues as potential causes of conflict. Other groups or individuals join them and invest resources backing them. The ensuing policy outcome is the result of a contest for hegemony between different narratives rather than a direct function of the respective actors’ political power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662510389266">Zald and McCarthy, 1987</xref>). Similarly, the Model sees conflicts partly arising from societal actors’ attempts at achieving public support for their interpretation of an issue and not only as a result of their existing political power.</p>
<p>On <italic>GM crops</italic>, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) offered narratives particularly attractive to critical parts of the public. They emphasised risk while other arguments supplemented their cause. Regulatory agencies, however, did not consider “other” arguments relevant; according to World Trade Organization rules, only scientific risk arguments might defend regulatory trade barriers. Nevertheless, these other arguments decisively helped to build up commitment among the NGOs’ constituencies.</p>
<p>Regarding <italic>SB</italic>, most NGOs did not consider it worthwhile campaigning apart from the agriculturally oriented ETC Group. Their first report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510389266">ETC, 2007</xref>) deliberately framed the issue as “extreme” genetic engineering, repeating old points of critique. Thus, it followed the “frozen experience” of NGOs, but raising attention in a limited expert public only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662510389266">
<title>iii. Established and organised interests differ in their influence on the regulatory system, the latter lacking direct access</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510389266">Kriesi (2001)</xref> identifies access to the decision-making process to be a crucial resource, offering opportunities to influence decisions and define the subject. Regulatory institutions provide direct access to some organisations while excluding others. Kriesi distinguishes established from “outsider” interests: regulatory institutions listen to organisations having proved helpful in performing the institution’s tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510389266">2</xref></sup> If such a relation has existed for some time, interests become established and the respective organisations acquire access to decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662510389266">3</xref></sup> With more resources, chances rise that access is institutionalised. This may lead to regulatory capture that jeopardises the institution’s autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510389266">Laffont and Tirole, 1991</xref>), but mostly regulatory institutions benefit as their political importance increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510389266">Häußermann, 1977</xref>: 68). Other interests lack direct access, in particular those having emerged only recently or commanding a small power base. Organisations representing them, e.g. most environmental and consumer NGOs, must follow other strategies. More than on money, scientific reputation or direct channels to politics they depend on commitment: they campaign, i.e. increase their conflict potential by attracting public and media support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510389266">Gamson and Modigliani, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The Model conceives the political arena as fluid, with actors rising and falling in importance. The choice of organisations reflects the government’s perception of which interests and issues are important or legitimate. This may change with the context: a new government, the economy or media attention. Eventually, the organisations’ relative influence will grow or fall: some become established while others lose privileges.</p>
<p>Early on, <italic>GM crops</italic> were supported by a number of powerful established interest organisations. Rejection of GM crops was a minority interest in the beginning, yet specialised NGOs took up the (value-laden) protest and turned it into a salient issue. Competing with established interests, their prospects appeared dim, although the US “revolving door” system openly connecting regulatory institutions, academia and industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510389266">Jasanoff, 1990</xref>) provided opponents with the argument of regulatory capture. Remarkably, it was in Europe that GM crops gained an image as a scientific-commercial issue where opposing parties were denied access to decision-making despite unclear risks. When environmental and consumer NGOs established links to regulatory institutions in some European Union (EU) member countries and Brussels, their interests got established and influenced policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662510389266">Roose, 2002</xref>). Commitment had balanced the lack of resources.</p>
<p>With <italic>SB</italic>, official policy and regulatory institutions frequently stress the need to consider ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) that formerly would have been taken up by organised interest groups. For example, US President Obama asked the Presidential Ethics Commission to deliver an opinion on SB in 2010. Such moves make it more difficult for organised interest groups to campaign on these issues and to mobilise their constituency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963662510389266">
<title>iv. The Gate selects, according to formal criteria, information to be processed through formalised routines in the regulatory system</title>
<p>The Punctuated Equilibrium model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510389266">Baumgartner and Jones, 1993</xref>) describes how regulatory institutions normally deal with many issues in parallel while the information processed is limited. To prohibit overflow, institutions accept interventions only selectively. Picking issues follows certain criteria (dominant “frames,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510389266">Goffman, 1974</xref>), for example risk, economic interests, ethical reasoning, etc., to reduce complexity to a level the institution can cope with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510389266">Luhmann, 2004</xref>). The concept of frames thus offers an analytical tool for exploring how relevant and irrelevant aspects are distinguished and, in the case of conflict, which argument is considered legitimate and which is filtered out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662510389266">Schön and Rein, 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662510389266">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Model conceptualises the Gate as the central filter function in the regulatory institutions’ normal mode of processing. Any argument has to be framed in a way the institution considers legitimate. If an actor’s input is irrelevant as defined by the Gate it gets rejected, while arguments pass the Gate if they fit. What the Gate really “is” varies over time and is the outcome of a political process, such as a collection of stipulations or a regulatory practice considering an aspect relevant (e.g. health risk). The Gate is the regulatory institution’s official interface with the outside world in a particular issue. It limits the information flow so that the input can be managed, excluding certain interests and their representation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662510389266">5</xref></sup> Established interests are likely to be involved in defining the Gate so that their arguments can pass. If their arguments are rejected, other interests have to apply “outsider” strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510389266">Kriesi, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For <italic>GM crops</italic>, Gate action on the EU level took a legal form. Among the many arguments raised, only risk was considered relevant, juxtaposing it to the (default) free trade frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510389266">Torgersen et al., 2002</xref>). The Gate’s filtering function forced those who wanted to bring in for example ethical issues or consequences for the agricultural system to re-formulate their arguments in terms of risk. However, proponents considered the evidence of health or environmental risk inferred from dissident scientific studies insufficient. Opponents nevertheless gained ground in public debates on risk by emphasising uncertainty as risks could not be dismissed, so the argument challenged the established regulatory apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510389266">Levidow and Carr, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With <italic>SB</italic> today, issues such as safety/security, distributional and ethical arguments are all officially considered relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510389266">IRGC, 2009</xref>). The Gate is still wide open for arguments that would have been deemed unable to pass it in the case of GM crops. This may be so because regulatory action is (yet) considered unlikely, often with a view to the established body of regulation for biotechnology and the lack of an acknowledged distinctiveness of SB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0963662510389266">
<title>v. Detectors screen the environment to provide early warning for activities potentially threatening the normal functioning of a regulatory institution</title>
<p>If regulatory institutions only had Gates to interact with their environment, phases of normal functioning and conflicts would alternate in a stop-and-go fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510389266">Baumgartner and Jones, 1993</xref>). The regulatory institutions’ autonomy would be endangered if they only interacted with the environment by restricting irrelevant rather than searching for relevant information.</p>
<p>The Model postulates “detectors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510389266">Hampel and Torgersen, 2010</xref>), a mechanism enabling regulatory institutions to actively observe, and react to, developments that could jeopardise normal policy-making. Detectors search for public unease, scientific arguments supporting dissident views or anything that challenges the dominant frame. Whether a hazard is real or not is irrelevant as long as it is suspected to turn into a threat. In practice, media observation is not the only but a very important means to detect such regulatory hazards.</p>
<p>Regarding <italic>GM crops</italic>, screening activity often took the form of support for scientific investigations into alleged risks, such as with the famous Monarch butterfly, or participatory events such as the “GM Nation” project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510389266">Rowe et al., 2005</xref>). Involving critical stakeholders gave regulators an idea of arguments and issues that might develop into political threats. Regulatory institutions also reacted to events considered hazardous for policy-making in other contexts, for example NGO campaigns during the BSE crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510389266">Hampel et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For <italic>SB</italic>, detector action has been institutionalised via ELSI research programmes at an early stage and is currently “well-fed” by semi-official reports from scientific organisations and think tanks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510389266">IRGC, 2009</xref>, or the initiative by US President Obama). With Gate action virtually absent, detectors currently seem to be the main intelligence tool.</p>

<title>vi. Mass media define topics of salience and transport narratives and interpretations mixed with factual information</title>
<p>Being core elements of the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510389266">Bauer and Gaskell, 2002a</xref>), mass media determine what a wider public in principle can know about an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510389266">Luhmann, 2004</xref>). They address different publics and play different roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510389266">Bauer and Bonfadelli, 2002</xref>) observing events and developments within policy, the public, science, business and other social subsystems while everyone observes the media. By selecting, reporting and commenting, mass media define topics of salience and transport views and interests inextricably linked with information. The Issue Attention Cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510389266">Downs, 1972</xref>) describes how an issue first appears in a special section (e.g. business or science) and then in the general policy section regulatory institutions consider most important; a peak in reporting is reached when the issue is on the front pages and headlines before it disappears again. Accordingly, reporting is particularly intense when regulatory activity is needed. Since activities and arguments covered have a better chance of being considered relevant, the political agenda setting is influenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662510389266">Shaw and McCombs, 1977</xref>: 77). Regulatory institutions competing for competencies keep an eye on reporting as it also indicates, via issue salience, the stance of interest-representing organisations.</p>
<p>Regarding the mass media’s influence on the climate of public opinion however, research has shown that reporting does not predictably change the attitudes of recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510389266">Peters, 2000</xref>). Actively selecting and processing reports, recipients are more autonomous than stimulus-response models suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510389266">Blumler and Kavangh, 1999</xref>). Therefore, the Model does not conceive the media as independent actors setting public opinion but as entrepreneurs similar to interest-representing organisations: they dwell on the consumers’ willingness to accept their selection and interpretation of information. The frames issues are presented in have to be in line with those prevalent among the target group. The media must keep in contact with what they perceive to be public opinion while shaping it.</p>
<p>Mass media coverage on <italic>GM crops</italic> was comparatively extensive, often reaching the policy pages, but rather diverse in different countries. Some authors found media support for NGOs’ positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662510389266">Vogel, 2001</xref>), others considered reporting neutral or favourable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510389266">Bauer and Gutteling, 2006</xref>). Similarly, the significance for policy was assessed ambivalently. Over time, GM issues have been subject to several attention cycles, mostly linked to trigger events and external “scandals” (see below) such as BSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510389266">Marris, 2001</xref>). Survey timelines reveal links between reporting frequency and negative attitudes as a result of issue salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510389266">Gutteling et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the context seems to frame the publics’ views more profoundly than intrinsic technological properties, and maybe even risks.</p>
<p>In comparison, media reporting over <italic>SB</italic> so far has been rather positive, focussing on benefits and on the engineering perspective. If critical, it covered prominent scientists and ethical issues such as “creating life” (Seiringer et al., this issue). Media draw links to genetic engineering in general, but less so to GM crops, and public scapegoats such as multinational companies are largely absent.</p>

<sec id="section10-0963662510389266">
<title>vii. Public opinion can be understood both as an aggregate of what individuals “think” about a topic, and as a result of communication</title>
<p>Social sciences see “the public” and its “opinion” as an analytical construct, with definitions differing e.g. between attitude and media research. In a more complementary view, public opinion is the perceived collective outcome of the public arena’s communication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510389266">Neidhardt, 1994</xref>: 25–7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510389266">Bauer and Gaskell (2002b)</xref> proposed a triangle involving regulation, mass media coverage and public perceptions. Here, public opinion is almost equivalent to the outcome of debates, i.e. similar to what will be described as resonance.</p>
<p>The Model distinguishes between the general public and specific publics. It conceptualises the general public as all people able to communicate and participate in matters political within a country, even if they actually do not. Specific publics are characterised by individuals holding determined (and often material) interests connected to particular issues, for example farmers, commuters, etc. Some have no particular relation to any interest-representing organisation, others do. Overlapping, but conceptually apart, are groups with shared world-views such as religious beliefs, political ideologies, or groups holding opinions about specific issues such as biotechnology and food. These “representational fields” share a set of social representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510389266">Moscovici, 1984</xref>) and images of an issue, especially if the issue is difficult to reconcile with the “Lebenswelt” of a layperson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662510389266">Wagner and Kronberger, 2001</xref>). Such fields are sometimes linked to organisations promoting a world-view, or to specific publics sharing concrete interests. Some views and interests are not represented by any organisation, and some organisations represent interests that may be marginal but can command other resources. By gaining access to larger representational fields, interest-representing organisations may increase their legitimisation vis-à-vis the regulatory system. Public opinion is considered a result of communication between different societal fields, groups and organisations; observed, supported or counteracted by the media.</p>
<p>The deficit model of public understanding frames the conflict over <italic>GM crops</italic> as rational expert-based regulation against the publics’ lack of understanding and special world-views manifested in NGO propaganda (critically: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510389266">Allum et al., 2002</xref>). However, the biotech conflict exceeded single specific publics such as environmentalists, religious greens or consumer activists sharing a world-view. Rather, unusual coalitions emerged between groups with opposite interests such as retailers, organic and conventional farmers, often homing in on joint fears of “pollution” as a dominant frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510389266">Hampel et al., 2006</xref>). This interplay made it easy for opposing NGOs to forge links between otherwise dissenting societal actors. The media in some countries supported this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662510389266">Wagner and Kronberger, 2001</xref>) and profited from temporary issue-specific conglomerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510389266">Hampel and Torgersen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding <italic>SB</italic>, anchor points for social representations partly tap into existing aversions against genetic engineering. Like other areas of modern biology, SB has an ambivalent image, if any. Results from focus groups suggest that some perceptions are carried over and, with more exposure, give rise to split opinions framed after pre-existing attitudes (Kronberger et al., this issue). Negative opinions may be hidden in the collective minds of some publics as “sleeping dogs.” Without a trigger, however, they may remain there for good.</p>

<sec id="section11-0963662510389266">
<title>viii. Resonance is a result of communication between interest-representing organisations, mass media and members of the public</title>
<p>Interest-representing organisations try to appear as advocates of public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662510389266">Renn et al., 1992</xref>). Research on new social movements shows that non-established interests get organised bottom-up, with small “spearhead” single-interest groups often remaining obsolete. To gain access to decision-making, they need “resonance” with a broader public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510389266">Kriesi, 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662510389266">6</xref></sup> Interest-representing organisations therefore screen their environment for topics enabling them to bring their agenda into correspondence with public opinion. Resonance is more likely if an actor succeeds in expressing views that fit social representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510389266">Moscovici, 1984</xref>) prevalent in the public, or if attitudes linked to many persons or social identities are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662510389266">Shavitt, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The Model conceives organisations conveying interests as issue entrepreneurs: facts and interpretations are presented to different publics to elicit resonance. Such “probing” is a trial and error game; organisations monitor, filter and communicate internally and externally what happens in their environment and what they deem relevant according to their interests. They observe whether their communication activities succeed or fail and continually update their interpretations accordingly. In other words, organisations present interpretations and hope the public will accept them. If so, they can convey their agenda to regulatory institutions. The Model assumes that resonance between interest-representing organisations, mass media and the public occurs if communication inputs match public opinion, in other words, if they fit a dominant frame of public perception.</p>
<p>With <italic>GM crops</italic>, international NGOs joined forces with groups representing special interest, who had been campaigning for years, but only so when mobilisation became feasible. Susceptible publics had to be identified and canvassed first. Among them, uncertainty over risk had repeatedly proved to be the most decisive argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662510389266">Schütz et al., 2000</xref>). Such reasoning incongruent with the dominant frame of evidential risk matched with the NGOs’ argument of unforeseeable risks. It provided a basis for resonance: diverse actors, media and parts of the public jointly and successfully rejected the introduction of GM crops. Powerful actors such as the EC and national ministries had to re-think their strategies.</p>
<p><italic>SB</italic> has not been associated with a dominant frame, resulting in little coverage and NGO interest even in countries with notoriously critical public attitudes. The potential for resonance seems limited; maybe because so much has been campaigned for on genetic modification already. If SB is not seen as fundamentally different, for NGOs special campaigning might not promise to deliver enough resonance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0963662510389266">
<title>ix. Public mobilisation can result in non-established interests overrunning the Gate function and gaining access to the regulatory system</title>
<p>In public mobilisation, a significant number of activated people endorse the demands of an interest-representing organisation on an issue and carry the message in forms of social communication and action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662510389266">7</xref></sup> If significant mass media, important actors and/or a broader public perceive an issue to be salient (a “scandal”), an issue can only be ignored at the cost of a loss in media circulation or political legitimisation for regulatory institutions. Others follow suit, and further coverage is guaranteed. If the issue is taken up on a political level, salience has become self-sustaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510389266">Kepplinger, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Model conceives mobilisation to be an opportunity for interest-representing organisations lacking established regulatory links to circumvent the Gate and bring otherwise rejected views into the political arena. Regulatory institutions are then forced to deal with the issue under high priority, which implies that the Gate’s selection function is levered out. Mobilisation may even lead to a switch to the “emergency mode” in the institution’s processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510389266">Baumgartner and Jones, 1993</xref>), undermining the sustainability of decision-making and entailing a policy shift. Nevertheless, mobilisation is a matter of social construction – it depends largely on the actors’ perceptions rendering it a powerful negative vision for the governance of novel technologies. Other conflict parties may attempt to counter-mobilise by presenting contrasting interpretations, changing the dominant frame or gaining time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662510389266">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>With <italic>GM crops</italic>, regulatory uncertainty reached a peak in the late 1990s. Regulators interpreted NGO activities as indications that the public is mobilised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510389266">Hampel and Torgersen, 2010</xref>). The double challenge of GM crops and BSE entailed the coupling of conflicts and mobilisation, which made it impossible to uphold the normal mode of processing on both a national and EU level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510389266">Hampel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662510389266">Sato, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662510389266">9</xref></sup> On the EU level, a shift of the dominant frame ensued: risk was supplemented by freedom of choice for producers and consumers through coexistence, segregation and labelling, making explicit the economic frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510389266">Levidow and Carr, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For <italic>SB</italic>, there are no indications for mobilisation whatsoever. Even issues that might elicit strong moral contention such as the notion of “creating life” have so far not led to noticeable public reactions. However, dominant actors anticipate mobilisation as a negative vision, emulating the example of the GM crops debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510389266">Torgersen, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>4. Conclusion: does the GM crops debate really provide a blueprint?</title>
<p>Controversies over genetic engineering, and GM crops in particular, have often served as blueprints for technology conflicts: after having been scrutinised from within the scientific system, public opposition emerged. This is also expected for SB. However, simple analogies are misleading. A closer look reveals that the GM debate developed under unique conditions.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, a broadening societal debate over ecological, social and ethical concerns promoted by strong NGOs met a narrowing regulatory gate restricted to “sound scientific” risk issues, to the effect that publicly salient topics were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510389266">Torgersen et al., 2002</xref>). Although such mismatch is frequent, it prepared the grounds for public distrust in the expert-based approval system: the early warning receptor action had failed. A gap opened over risk and benefit claims.</p>
<p>Established interests from industry and science had promised GM to be a panacea free from demonstrable risks, only requiring regulation based on sound science. This was successful up to the early 1990s, when the first GM products were sold in the UK, but proved unable to cope with three challenges. Firstly, the BSE crisis unfolded the limitations of a scientific risk-based regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510389266">Marris, 2001</xref>). Secondly, neglecting issues other than risk in the regulatory discourses allowed NGOs to weaken the Gate, extending the risk frame to uncertainty over long-term consequences under the header of “precaution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510389266">Levidow and Carr, 2009</xref>). Thirdly, unfortunate industry action triggered a campaign across Europe resulting in public mobilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510389266">Lassen et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Emulating the BSE case, an imminent consumer boycott rendered the precautionary frame increasingly relevant for decision-making. Both debates merged over food safety, quality and the tasks of the agricultural sector, which could no longer be tackled under the GM issue. The EC’s regulatory escape strategy replaced risk by freedom of choice as the leading frame, devolving decision-making to the member country level. In terms of public attitudes, though, GM remained stigmatised. Today, many Europeans seem to consider GM food undesirable.</p>
<p>Compared to SB, few similarities and many differences appear. As well as being biotechnology, a similarity is the experts’ promise for economic importance, problem solving and the critics’ fear of “tinkering with life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510389266">OECD and Royal Society, 2009</xref>). Among the differences are firstly, a lack of tangible products, especially food; secondly, a different actor landscape; and thirdly, a lack of regulatory dedication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510389266">Torgersen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Lacking products, SB is largely unknown among the public. Upon exposition, the issue is prone to fall into categories of traditional medical and environmental biotechnology but not food (Kronberger et al., this issue). As conflicts were mostly over food, this suggests the mobilisation potential to be low. The media report on SB mainly on the science pages, oriented at new developments rather than societal impacts or risks (Gschmeidler and Seiringer, this issue), so they seem to lack interest in making a scandal of SB. All this makes resonance unlikely at present.</p>
<p>Technology critics have not yet been able to frame issues of general concern other than those the scientific community already acknowledged to be relevant. In addition to safety, scientists addressed security, equity (e.g. intellectual property rights) and ethical concerns pertaining to “making life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510389266">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, scientists sensitive to societal issues acquired a quasi-detector function (Schmidt et al., this issue). This may be why few NGOs have taken up the issue; in contrast, novel actors such as student groups promote the field. In addition, the technology has been deliberately framed as similar to information technology: since the 1980s, computer sciences have been able to close debates and are little contested.</p>
<p>Thus, arguments raised by established interests the regulatory system accepts are not very different from those non-established interests would raise, so what should the latter then campaign on? The regulatory discourse is still open: rather than separating accepted from non-accepted arguments, inclusion of various positions is considered appropriate. The Gate has not yet been set, with one exception: a consent among established interests holds that technology-specific regulation is currently unnecessary. This will probably not suffice to trigger public mobilisation over regulatory failure (as with GM and BSE). Most scientists and regulators agree that regulatory attention should be directed at single issues such as safety, security and future shortcomings of pieces of regulation. Regulatory activity thus does not systematically neglect certain aspects to uphold an ideology such as “sound science.” Instead, openness to the publics’ fears and the need to “reach out” are often stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510389266">OECD and Royal Society, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Gate Resonance model provides systematic insights into key elements to be observed when looking for emerging conflicts over an emerging technology. Applied to SB, it renders few arguments supporting the expectation that the history of technology controversies over GM crops will repeat with SB.</p>
