            </sup> Adoption and permanence orders: whether parental consent should be dispensed with and permanence order with authority for adoption granted</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Edinburgh Council, Petitioners, in respect of CC</italic>
         </p>
         <p>Sheriffdom of Lothian and Borders at Edinburgh</p>
         <p>Sheriff Principal Mhairi M Stephen</p>
         <p>12 November 2012</p>
         <p>In January 2010, City of Edinburgh Council applied under section 80 of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 for a permanence order with authority for adoption (POA) for the child, CC. The child’s birth parents both opposed the petition. After various procedural stages, the proof hearing was completed in January 2011. The sheriff issued her judgment in February 2012 and granted the POA. Both birth parents appealed to the Sheriff Principal, who heard arguments in October and issued her decision in November.</p>
         <sec id="sec2-0308575913478783">
            <title>Held</title>
            <p>Appeal allowed to the extent of adding an additional finding in fact, but otherwise refused, and the POA upheld.</p>
            <p>The Sheriff Principal outlined the background to the application and appeal, along with the sheriff’s decision and some discussion of procedural matters. She then dealt individually with the grounds of appeal put forward on behalf of the birth parents.</p>
            <p>The first ground was the procedures in the case under sections 95 and 96 of the 2007 Act, that was the interface between the court dealing with the POA application and the Children’s Hearing system. There had been some irregularities about notifications. However, the Sheriff Principal took the view that there were sufficient overall safeguards in the process to mean that what had happened did not ‘irreparably’ damage the proceedings, because it had not been ‘of such profound materiality’.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, the Sheriff Principal dealt with the ground concerned with delays in the case and their consequences. There had been considerable delays and she re-emphasised the cases and Practice Notes which have dealt with this issue. She said that ‘delay erodes justice’ but that in this case the ‘delay must be looked at in the round before considering the consequences’ of it. The delay was not acceptable, but it was not solely caused by the sheriff. Looking at all aspects of the case, this ground of appeal failed.</p>
            <p>The next ground of appeal was about the arrangements for contact and, particularly, criticism of the sheriff’s reasoning about past and future contact. Her judgment had given the birth parents only indirect contact. The Sheriff Principal took the view that the sheriff had had regard to the welfare principle in considering the evidence and coming to her decision about contact. The Sheriff Principal referred to the recent case of <italic>S v L</italic> 2012 SLT 961, [2012] UKSC 30 (reported in <italic>Adoption &amp; Fostering</italic> 36(3–4), 2012: 126) and quoted Lord Reed’s quotation in French in that case, from <italic>Pontes v Portugal</italic> (Application No 19554/09) (unreported) given on 10 April 2012, and roughly translated: ‘The Court repeats with considerable emphasis that, in cases of this type, the interests of the child must take precedence over all other considerations.’ For the reasons given by the Sheriff Principal, she held that this ground of appeal also failed. There were also criticisms of the sheriff’s decision about contact concerned with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), but the Sheriff Principal dealt with these as part of the final grounds of appeal.</p>
            <p>The next ground of appeal concerned the sheriff’s failure to make a finding in fact on undisputed evidence about the father’s drug use. The Sheriff Principal dealt with this by adding an additional finding.</p>
            <p>The final grounds of appeal were about whether the sheriff had properly addressed the relevant law and other matters in her judgment, including Article 8 of the ECHR. The Sheriff Principal dealt with these matters at considerable length, including setting out an analysis of the statutory framework and the findings in fact. She made reference to the decision in <italic>S v L.</italic> She concluded by saying that, having looked at the facts and applied the relevant provisions of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and the 2007 Act, the sheriff’s decision to grant the POA could be supported on the basis of the facts as found by her. It was ‘important to recognise that the focus of this significant exercise has been the child, CC’.</p>
