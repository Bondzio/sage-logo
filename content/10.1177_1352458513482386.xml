<p>Asked to select the most important clinical paper of 2012, I have actually opted to choose a pair of conjoined twins, two papers published back-to-back in the New England Journal of Medicine reporting the results of the two parallel phase 3 clinical trials of BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate). The first paper, <italic>Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of Oral BG-12 for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</italic> by Gold et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458513482386">1</xref></sup> reports the comparison of two doses of BG-12 (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg three times/day ) versus placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in a trial known as DEFINE. The companion paper by Fox et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458513482386">2</xref></sup> provided the results of a Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of oral BG-12 or glatiramer in Multiple Sclerosis, known as CONFIRM. The two studies, which involved nearly 2,700 patients, were essentially identical with the exception of the inclusion of glatiramer acetate as a reference comparator.</p>
<p>In selecting these tandem papers as the most important clinical reports of 2012, I asked, “Which paper will have the greatest impact on the clinical understanding or management of people with MS?” Candidate papers were those included in a PubMed search of the heading “Multiple sclerosis clinical”, limited to English language, for 2012, which returned 675 entries.</p>
<p>Since 1993 with the approval of subcutaneously injected interferon beta-1b (IFNB-1b), the mainstay of disease modifying therapy for relapsing forms of MS has been injectable interferon beta (several preparations) or glatiramer acetate. However, long-term adherence to these medications is mediocre with reports of more than 30% of treated patients no longer on therapy after 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458513482386">3</xref></sup> Many patients voice the desire for oral medication.</p>
<p>Currently orally administered fingolimod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458513482386">4</xref></sup> and teriflunomide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458513482386">5</xref></sup> have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and are available in the US as either first-line therapy or for use in patients who have previously been treated with other agents. The European Medicines Agency has approved fingolimod as a second line therapy in RRMS; teriflunomide is currently being considered for approval by the agency. Fingolimod provided annualized relapse rate reduction of approximately 50% compared to placebo in its Phase 3 clinical trials. However, some concerns remain over its safety profile, particularly cardiovascular effects and the theoretical potential for emergence of infection or neoplasm in view of the marked lymphopenia that is an effect of the drug. Teriflunomide appears to have efficacy that is comparable to the interferons and a reasonable safety profile based not only on the results of two large Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, but also on the extensive experience with leflunomide which has been available for more than a decade for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide is directly metabolized to teriflunomide.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint of the DEFINE trial was the percentage of patients relapsing by 2 years. A 27% reduction compared to placebo was achieved for the twice-a-day (2x/d) dosage of BG-12 and 26% for the three-times-a day (3x/d) dosage (p&lt;0.002 for both comparisons). For a more typical analysis, annualized relapse rate for the 2x/day was 0.17; for the 3x/d, 0.19; and for placebo 0.36. Thus, the two BG-12 doses resulted in 53% and 48% annualized relapse rate reductions respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Progression of disability confirmed at 3 months occurred in 16% and 18% of the BG-12 doses, respectively compared to 27% in the placebo groups for a relative risk reduction of 38% and 34%, both highly statistically significant. In a large subset of patients undergoing MRI, the number of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was decreased by 85% in the 2x/d dose and 74% in the 3x/d dose. The odds of an increase in gadolinium-enhanced lesions were decreased by 90% and 73% respectively.</p>
<p>The adverse event profile revealed frequent occurrence of flushing in both BG-12 groups (38% and 32%) but only 2% of subjects discontinued participation because of this symptom. Gastrointestinal events, particularly diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, also occurred more frequently in the BG-12 treated patients, with 5-6% discontinuing study drug, compared to 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of infections and serious infections were comparable in the fumarate and placebo groups. These symptoms tended to occur early and diminish with continued treatment.</p>
<p>Laboratory assessments revealed mean decreases of peripheral leukocyte counts and absolute lymphocyte counts of 10% and 28% respectively at 1 year. Grade 2 leukopenia (&lt;3.0 X 10<sup>9</sup>) and Grade 3 lymphopenia (&lt;0.5X10<sup>9</sup>) occurred in 4%. ALT elevations <underline>≥</underline> 3X upper limit of normal occurred in 6% of the BG-12 patients compared to 3% of the placebo patients.</p>
<p>The optimistically but aptly named CONFIRM trial showed similar results. In this trial, the more traditional primary endpoint of annualized relapse rate over two years showed a reduction of 44% for the 2X/d dose and 51% for the 3x/d dose compared to placebo. MRI endpoints were also highly statistically significantly reduced. However, unlike the results of the DEFINE study, in the CONFIRM trial the decrease in disability progression for the BG12 doses (21% and 24% respectively) did not achieve statistical significance in comparison to placebo. The adverse event profile was similar to that in the DEFINE trial.</p>
<p>The CONFIRM trial was not powered to attempt to show statistical significance of BG-12 over glatiramer acetate (GA), which was included as an active comparator. Post-hoc comparisons of BG-12 to GA did statistically significantly favor the 3x/d dose of BG-12 on annualized relapse rate and both doses of BG-12 in reduction of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions. Most other comparisons between the fumarate arms and the GA group were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Based on the substantial reduction in disease activity achieved by BG-12 and its apparent safety, I expect this agent will be widely utilized by the MS patient population. Because of this expected large usage, I expect these papers will have the greatest impact of clinical articles published in 2012. The field of MS therapeutics has achieved considerable success, at least for relapsing forms of the disease. In 2012, results of important clinical trials of laquinimod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458513482386">6</xref></sup>, another oral agent, and alemtuzumab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458513482386">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458513482386">8</xref></sup>, a monoclonal antibody that is administered intravenously for 5 days initially and then for 3 days a year later were also published. I selected the BG-12 papers over these others because the greater efficacy of the dimethyl fumarate suggests it will be more widely used than laquinimod (if both are ultimately approved by regulatory agencies). I believe the BG-12 reports will have greater impact than the alemtuzumab papers because of apparently greater toxic potential of the latter agent, notably the emergence of other autoimmune phenomena, particularly thyroid disorders and less frequently thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p>The past year saw the publication of a variety of articles concerning pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, possible biomarkers, and pediatric MS. Many of these could ultimately prove to contribute greatly to our understanding and management of the disease. None, however, is likely to have the substantial and immediate impact of these reports of Phase 3 trials of dimethyl fumarate.</p>
