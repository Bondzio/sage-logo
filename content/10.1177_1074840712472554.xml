<abstract>
<p>Nursing care of families continues to be a challenge within complex and demanding health-care systems. Educational strategies to bridge the theory−practice gap, connecting classroom learning with clinical experiences in undergraduate nursing education, enable students to develop the skills required to form meaningful partnerships with families. This article describes how undergraduate nursing students complete a 15-Minute Family Interview in a clinical practice setting, and document the interview process in a reflective major paper. Students integrate research and theory and identify ways to improve the care of families in the clinical setting while building communication skills and confidence in interacting with families in everyday practice. The implementation of the assignment and the evaluation of the process, including quotes from 10 student papers and 2 clinical faculty members, are discussed. Implications for education and ongoing research are offered.</p>

<p>Bridging the theory to practice gap remains an elusive goal for many undergraduate nursing education programs. Teaching nursing students to connect clinical realities and classroom material is a major concern in nursing education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, &amp; Day, 2011</xref>). Those of us who teach family nursing know that the theory to practice gap remains large and that pedagogical strategies should be employed that enable students to gain family nursing competencies in a way that is meaningful and relevant to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712472554">Bell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712472554">Fast Braun, Hyndman, &amp; Foster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712472554">Moules &amp; Johnstone, 2010</xref>). In a study sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, based on nine site visits and extensive interviews with teachers and students in nursing schools across the United States, the most challenging issue in nursing education was identified as a practice−education gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although health-care systems around the world are faced with the challenge of implementing patient and family-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840712472554">Balik, Conway, Zipperer, &amp; Watson, 2011</xref>), a review of the health-care system in Saskatchewan, consulting approximately 4,000 residents, recommended that frontline providers be empowered to deliver patient and family-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712472554">Dagnone, 2009</xref>); however, no specific strategies were identified for how to do so. Considering the need for nurses to support families within the demands of a stressful and chaotic health-care system requires that nursing students learn to apply theory to practice by engaging in authentic, experiential, learning experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, there is a lack of effective, feasible pedagogical approaches to facilitate the transfer of complex family nursing theory to clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712472554">Eggenberger &amp; Regan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712472554">Fast Braun et al., 2010</xref>). Examining and articulating our pedagogical practices is an important step to improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning of family nursing skills and abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712472554">Moules, Bell, Paton, &amp; Morck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712472554">Moules &amp; Johnstone, 2010</xref>). One strategy that may prove useful in addressing this gap is the clinical application by nursing students of the 15-Minute Family Interview, as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright and Leahey (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). Based on their extensive research and practice with families, this research-based nursing tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712472554">Bell, 2012</xref>) acknowledges the challenge of finding time to work with families in a demanding and stressful clinical context, offering five essential ingredients to engage, assess, and intervene with families, enhancing the formation of collaborative relationships.</p>
<p>Students who complete the 15-Minute Family Interview with patients and families, encountered during their clinical practice experiences, embark on at least the first four of the recommended steps toward integrating family-centered care, as described by the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario [RNAO] guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712472554">RNAO, 2006</xref>), and consider all eight when reflecting on their experience in a major term paper. These RNAO guidelines provide nurses with eight recommendations to implement best practices in family nursing care. These eight recommendations include (a) developing an empowering partnership with families; (b) assessing families in the context of the event(s); (c) identifying resources and supports to assist families; (d) educating and providing information to families, nurses, policy makers, and the public to assist families in managing life events; (e) sustaining a caring work environment conducive to family-centered practice; (f) supporting implementation of interdisciplinary family-centered practice in the workplace; (g) advocating for changes in public policy to benefit families; and (h) planning for adequate resources, organizations, and administration support to implement recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712472554">RNAO, 2006</xref>, pp. 2-6). These guidelines are comprehensive and remain a challenge for experienced nurses to implement in current working environments, and the theory to practice gap remains large, especially for nursing students.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712472554">Bruce et al. (2002)</xref> state that family nursing theory is not useful until it is put into practice. Furthermore, teaching and learning occur in a relationship between ideas and experience and between knowledge and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712472554">Moules &amp; Johnstone, 2010</xref>). Although nursing students do learn about the concepts of family nursing and the best practice guidelines related to family-centered care in the classroom, completing a 15-Minute Family Interview during a clinical practice experience offers an opportunity to apply theory to practice and to learn from their experiences by reflecting upon them. The purpose of this article is to describe the learning experienced by nursing students and feedback from faculty who have been involved in the process of implementing the 15-Minute Family Interview as a major assignment in a third-year undergraduate family nursing course. The major term paper assignment for the family nursing course was envisioned as a way to integrate classroom and clinical learning, enabling students to make meaningful connections between education and practice. Students also have the opportunity to discover the unique needs of the families they encounter, to direct salient interventions, and to gain communication skills and confidence in talking to families, thus addressing the education−practice gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner et al., 2011</xref>) commonly found in current nursing education.</p>
<sec id="section1-1074840712472554">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Barriers to implementing family-centered care in current clinical settings have been identified as a lack of basic and ongoing education in relation to understanding the complex concepts involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712472554">Bruce et al., 2002</xref>) and a need find more specific ways to bridge the theory−practice gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712472554">Segaric &amp; Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840712472554">St. John &amp; Flowers, 2009</xref>). Nurse educators have described various pedagogical approaches to teach family nursing including the use of therapeutic letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712472554">Erlingsson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712472554">Freed, McLaughlin, SmithBattle, Leander, &amp; Westhus, 2010</xref>), simulation scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712472554">Eggenberger &amp; Regan, 2010</xref>), a case model approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712472554">Fast Braun et al., 2010</xref>), and family labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712472554">Moules &amp; Tapp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712472554">Tapp, Moules, Bell, &amp; Wright, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Writing a therapeutic letter to a family in a clinical setting offered students an opportunity to reflect on the family’s experience and areas of concern, although students had difficulty focusing on the family’s strengths and resources instead of problems they perceived the family as having (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712472554">Erlingsson, 2009</xref>). Barriers to this approach might be a lack of time and opportunities to apply this learning in ongoing practice. Using simulation to teach family nursing theory provided a limited opportunity for students to practice and develop competencies that could be watched and evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712472554">Eggenberger &amp; Regan, 2010</xref>), but opportunities to learn while in an authentic clinical setting would also include dealing with the multiple complexities of actual practice. Students have difficulties shifting their thinking to a family focus and although a promising case model approach is still being evaluated, questions remain regarding the link between classroom teaching and implementation in the clinical practice setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712472554">Fast Braun et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The 15-Minute Family Interview has been effective when applied in clinical settings by practicing nurses, providing a tool that nurses could use to engage with, assess, and intervene with families in acute care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712472554">Holtslander, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712472554">Martinez, D’Artois, &amp; Rennick, 2007</xref>). We believe that using this tool in undergraduate nursing education offers a practical, effective, and feasible tool to engage students in bridging a theory−practice gap. In Benner et al.’s study of nine schools of nursing in the United States, the real deficiency found in nursing education was the lack of connection between clinical realities and classroom material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner et al., 2011</xref>). The 15-Minute Family Interview provides a well-developed approach for nursing students to apply classroom teaching in a real clinical setting, reflect on the process of implementing this tool in practice, and engage in meaningful relationships with families. We propose that the experience students gain through applying the 15-Minute Family Interview will strengthen their ability to assess and intervene with families throughout their careers.</p>
<sec id="section2-1074840712472554">
<title>The Course Project: Implementing the 15-Minute Family Interview in a Clinical Setting</title>
<p>Each year more than 300 nursing students at a university in Western Canada complete a one term, three credit nonclinical course during their third year, focused on theories of families within the context of community and society. Students completing this course are expected to: (a) explore the diversity of families within the context of community and society; (b) explore relevant theories of family nursing; (c) conduct and implement holistic assessment and strategies for beginning interventions with families; and (d) explore family health including: reducing inequities, increasing prevention, enhancing coping, and health promotion within the context of caring. Prior to 2008 undergraduate nursing students enrolled in this course conducted at least three family interviews in a community setting with a family of their choice, to complete the major term paper assignment. The process was based on the complete Calgary Family Assessment Model (CFAM) and the Calgary Family Intervention Model (CFIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). In addition to the logistical issues of meeting with families numerous times over and above classroom and clinical hourly requirements, students often struggled to make firm connections between these complex theoretical models and their work with families in their clinical practice areas, even with the support of an instructor in a small lab group setting. The 15-Minute Family Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>), modified from the full CFAM and CFIM, includes the five essential ingredients of applying manners, setting up a therapeutic conversation with a family, completing a genogram and ecomap, asking several therapeutic questions, and offering commendations, which offers a feasible, suitable, and realistic approach for teaching family nursing to students. Essentially, completion of a 15-Minute Family Interview during clinical practice was an ideal opportunity to facilitate an authentic learning experience; a student-centered approach offering situated learning in a realistic, and relevant, real-world context, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712472554">Herrington and Herrington (2006)</xref>. The family interview completed within a clinical experience offers situated learning through completion of an authentic task and an important opportunity to reflect while writing a major paper.</p>
<p>This family nursing course, which occurs in the third year of a 4-year undergraduate program, is the only course focused solely on family nursing and offers the opportunity for students to consider their role in family-centered care. During the term, students are concurrently completing an instructor-led clinical practice experience focusing on either complex medical-surgical care, or maternal-newborn and pediatric care. Students conduct a 15-Minute Family Interview in either one of these assigned clinical practice areas, during scheduled clinical hours. Students are responsible for setting up the interview with one assigned patient and their family, and are responsible for obtaining written consent from the family to participate in the interview. Throughout the classroom time in the family nursing course, students are prepared to complete an authentic, holistic assessment of a family, and implement family interventions based on the foundations of the CFAM and the CFIM during the interview process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). The family nursing course leader also meets with the clinical faculty involved to explain the assignment, and is available throughout the term to answer questions from students or clinical faculty. After completing the interview, students write a 10-page reflective paper that demonstrates integration of theory and applicable literature, relevant to the family context. The paper requires an analysis of the collected data and that students describe the application of the professional nursing role to meet family needs. Three family nursing diagnoses relating to the data collected are described and a number of appropriate interventions for each diagnosis are identified. Students also reflect on what went well and what could be improved in addition to describing ways to improve the care of families in complex clinical contexts and comment on their personal and professional growth in working with “real” families. By using the 15-Minute Family Interview as the framework for interacting with families during clinical practice, students have the opportunity to practice theory in a way that is meaningful to them and the families they encounter.</p>
<p>Ethics approval was not obtained as university guidelines state this is not required for a program evaluation project, although approval from the College of Nursing was granted. The outcomes of this educational strategy are presented using selected quotes from 10 student papers, two clinical faculty members, and the course evaluation documentation completed by the students. Permission to include quotes from student papers in this project review was obtained by emailing a group of 15 students who had met the requirements for the course and submitted well-written papers, 10 of these students responded and willingly agreed to have their quotes included. Fifteen clinical faculty were contacted and asked to provide their perspective of student learning in applying the 15-Minute Family Interview in a clinical practice setting, two sent in their written, e-mailed responses, to be included in this article.</p>

<title>The 15-Minute Family Interview</title>
<p>Wright and Leahey developed the 15-Minute (or shorter) Family Interview based on their years of research and clinical practice at the Calgary Family Nursing Unit at the University of Calgary. The 15-Minute Family Interview is based upon the foundations of the CFAM and CFIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). The five key components to the 15-Minute Family Interview are: therapeutic conversation, the use of manners, completing a genogram and ecomap, asking a few therapeutic questions, and offering commendations. The guide is flexible and easy to use, and can be adapted to any area of nursing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712472554">Holtslander, 2005</xref>). How the 15-Minute Family Interview is implemented depends upon the context of care being provided, the experience and comfort level of the student, and the family situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712472554">Holtslander, 2005</xref>). The 15-Minute Family Interview offers a way to bridge the gap between classroom and clinical, theory and practice, and enables students to move beyond the focus on skills toward becoming expert nurses that really care for the patient and family through the development of strong interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner et al., 2011</xref>). As one of the students stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Working with families is not an easy task. It takes time and skill. However, employing the use of the 15-Minute Family Interview will enable me to gather information as well as develop a therapeutic rapport with all the families that I will surely encounter throughout my nursing career.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As students completed the key components of the family interview they gained insight into the needs of the families they were caring for, and enhanced their ability to work within the context of a therapeutic relationship. Student learning and perspectives related to each of the five main components of the 15-Minute Family Interview is discussed next.</p>
<sec id="section4-1074840712472554">
<title>Therapeutic Conversation</title>
<p>Conversations involving a brief family interview are therapeutic because the interview is purposeful and time limited, as are the relationships that students have with the patients and families they care for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). The healing power of engaging patients and families in therapeutic conversations cannot be underestimated. A nursing student described how effective a therapeutic conversation could be:
<disp-quote>
<p>During this interview I found it beneficial to utilize therapeutic communication techniques integrated with the helping skills previously learned in other nursing classes. The patient and his family were very appreciative for the purposeful conversations that we shared during the interview. The patient informed me that he was very thankful for my undivided attention and genuine concern regarding his illness. He also told me that I empowered him in a way that no other nurse ever has.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The objectives of the project include enhancing the nursing student’s abilities to work with families by setting up a therapeutic conversation, to listen to families, and seeking to understand what they need. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright and Leahey (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>) propose that all conversations that patients and families have with nurses include the potential for healing. As nursing students are practicing the nursing role in working with patients and families during clinical learning experiences, we propose that the conversations that nursing students are engaged in with patients and families also have the potential for healing; offering both an educational strategy and an opportunity for therapeutic intervention with families and for themselves as learners. Students experienced personal growth in their skills, abilities, and attitudes to working with families, both through engaging in a conversation with a family in an acute care setting, and also by reflecting on the process while writing about their experience.</p>
<p>In order to provide an opportunity for therapeutic conversations, students can concentrate on showing compassion, demonstrate a willingness to make a connection, and listen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712472554">Moules &amp; Johnstone, 2010</xref>). When students understand the theory behind what they are doing in practice and engage in therapeutic conversations with patients and families, they are able to practice becoming attentive listeners. They can then provide patients and family members with the opportunity to be acknowledged and to have their thoughts and perspectives affirmed. As noted by one of the students:
<disp-quote>
<p>Initially I felt that this [listening] was irrelevant, until by simply listening attentively I realized the importance of this action in [my patient’s] ability to cope. The act of me listening to her in this case was therapeutic as she was able to share great happiness and pride in something with another person.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1074840712472554">
<title>Using Manners</title>
<p>Manners are simple but profound acts of kindness, courtesy, respect, and politeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). As one student wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>My first act of [using] manners was demonstrated by knocking before entering the patients’ room. Once I entered the room, I introduced myself by first and last name as well as my title as a third year nursing student.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many of us would like to believe that the statement made above by one of the students exemplifies the regular use of manners in practice when nurses meet families and begin the therapeutic relationship. We intuitively know that consistently displaying good manners is fundamental to building trusting and therapeutic relationships in practice. Unfortunately though, with the changing ways in which we interact with each other in today’s society, the display of manners in the workplace is much less common than one might argue is necessary and ethical. Nursing is certainly not immune to these changes and the profession has experienced the negative effects of the erosion of manners and civility in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). As part of conducting the 15-Minute Family Interview successfully, nursing students must introduce themselves to the patient and the family and explain the purpose for the interview to obtain the families consent to participate. Other comments from students regarding the importance of using manners include:
<disp-quote>
<p>Introductions are very important because it gives me, the healthcare worker, a sense of identity and [promotes] trust.</p>
<p>Throughout the interview I remembered to call each person by their name, as a way of demonstrating respect and courtesy.</p>
<p>As the interview progressed, I was conscientious of not interrupting the family members as they spoke and interacted, although there were times when I needed to politely provide them with some direction so as to not go off on a tangent.</p>
<p>Through my display of manners I was able to develop a sense of trust in the professional relationship I shared with the patient and his family. The trusting relationship continues throughout the day which allowed me to provide high quality care to the patient.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although many nurses are respectful and thoughtful in their practice, nursing students must purposely employ manners, and understand the reasons for doing so, in order to ensure that these practiced behaviors are carried forward into their working careers.</p>

<p>The genogram is a concise visual representation of the family’s internal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). The most essential information to be gathered for the genogram during the 15-Minute Family Interview includes data about age, occupation or school grade, religion, ethnic background, immigration date, and the current health status of each family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). These family diagrams usually record this data across three generations of a multigenerational family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840712472554">Butler, 2008</xref>). Once the information is collected for the genogram, students are encouraged to collect external family information in the form of an ecomap. One student describes how completing the genogram and the ecomap helped her to engage the family:
<disp-quote>
<p>I found that by [working to complete] the genogram and the ecomap at the beginning of the interview, [that] it provided a solid basis to gather information about the family, and in essence allowed [the rest of] the interview to flow smoother. It also encouraged the entire family to be involved from the onset of the interview. I think that [completing] the ecomap and genogram were not only useful to me to be able to understand their family composition, but also in that it allowed the patient and her husband to realize the extent of the support they have.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As exemplified by the student quote above, completing the genogram and the ecomap at the beginning of the interview serves as a quick engagement strategy that provides a set of structured questions to begin the interview.</p>
<p>Students had varied experiences in working to complete the genogram and the ecomap with patients and families. Some statements from the students about their learning include:
<disp-quote>
<p>The patient and her husband were somewhat hesitant to fill out the genogram and ecomap at first. Upon further investigation, I discovered that they were afraid that if they were honest about their family, that they might be judged because their family is different than other families.</p>
<p>They laughed when they could not remember specific dates or details, and looked to one another to finish each other’s thoughts. The smiles and laughter led me to the conclusion that the family enjoyed this process.</p>
<p>Although the mother was overwhelmed with fear and stress regarding her daughter’s condition, [completing] the genogram and the ecomap helped to reassure her that she had many supports and family members that played a positive role in her life.</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section7-1074840712472554">
<title>Therapeutic Questions</title>
<p>Therapeutic questions are a key, defining element in the therapeutic conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). Wright and Leahey encourage nurses (and nursing students) to think of at least three questions that they will routinely ask all family members. As one student reflected on the therapeutic questions that she asked the family members:
<disp-quote>
<p>By asking a variety of open, closed, and circular questions, I was able to observe the family interacting, and obtain pertinent information for the family assessment. Observing their interactions provided information about their ability to communicate, how they agree or disagree, [their] personality differences, and [their] viewpoints.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although students encounter patients and families in a variety of clinical settings, there are a few themes that can be addressed in any clinical situation when identifying appropriate therapeutic questions. As students are often concerned about asking “the right” questions, they were directed to keep in mind that one of the primary goals in the process was to meet the family’s needs for information, referrals, acknowledgement, and involvement as caregivers. Keeping these themes in mind and the context of care, students were able to ask each family a number of therapeutic questions relevant to the patient and family situation and build upon their confidence in working with the family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1074840712472554">
<title>Offering Commendations</title>
<p>Nursing students routinely work with patients who are coping with chronic, life threatening, or psychological problems and many patients and family members may feel defeated, hopeless, or as though they are failing in the efforts to live with the illness or to heal from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712472554">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712472554">2013</xref>). By commending families’ strengths and resources, the nursing student offers family members a new view of themselves and their ability to cope with the situation today and into the future, creating a context for change that allows families to recognize strengths and identify solutions to the problems they are facing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712472554">Bohn, Wright, &amp; Moules, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712472554">Houger Limacher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712472554">Houger Limacher &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>). Knowing when to provide a commendation can be challenging for students upfront, but often a situation presents itself as this quote from one of the student’s papers exemplifies:
<disp-quote>
<p>Within approximately five minutes of beginning the interview I became aware of the unique relationship of the family and expressed my thoughts by saying, “your family has been through a lot with your kidney failure and frequent hospitalizations. Your ability to remain so close and responsible for one another despite your limitations is very impressive.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Offering commendations is a positive way to help families reach their goals and cope with difficulties, as the nurse identifies family strengths, develops strengths, and calls those strengths forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840712472554">Feeley &amp; Gottlieb, 2000</xref>). Commendations must be deliberate, thoughtful, and carefully and directly offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712472554">Moules &amp; Johnstone, 2010</xref>). By commending families in a “real” situation, students see the immediate impact that offering commendations has on the family, especially when their suffering has been acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712472554">Houger Limacher &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>). Students routinely note in their reflective papers that using commendations in practice will provide them with powerful, positive interventions that can be used with all families throughout their career.</p>

<title>Evaluation of Student Learning</title>
<sec id="section10-1074840712472554">
<title>Student Perspectives</title>
<p>A review of the course evaluation documents indicated that nursing students found the experience beneficial in increasing their ability to apply concepts learned in class to practice situations. As one student commented: “the family interview forced me out of my comfort zone, but through [doing] it I was able to learn a good deal about myself and the way in which I plan to incorporate the family into my nursing career.” Another said: “It helped me learn how to involve the family in my patient’s plan of care and gave me the tools to do so.” “Using the 15-Minute interview was very effective. It really helped get to know the family on a whole new level. By assessing the whole family, I’ve learned to change the way I provide care in my rotations on peds [pediatrics] and postpartum.”</p>
<p>Students have routinely commented through their reflective papers that the families they approached to complete the interview were agreeable, and that they were surprised when families were eager to participate in a conversation about their needs. Students also indicated challenges with this assignment, including difficulties setting up an interview with at times nonexistent family members and some discomfort in asking personal questions to complete the genogram and ecomap. Nursing students may not know how to handle the amount of suffering they will witness as nurses which is why it is helpful to have an experienced instructor nearby who can assist the student in this type of situation. Students will see difficult situations in practice and need to know how to respond, and what questions will they ask; “in effect, nursing students must learn to change the boundaries of their social access,” moving beyond hands-on skills and tasks to really caring for the person and the family involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712472554">Benner et al., 2011</xref>, p. 182). A number of students commented that completing the interview earlier in the shift would have facilitated a deeper therapeutic relationship throughout their limited time together, based on an understanding of the family’s needs and priorities. The students were able to reflect upon what went well and the challenges they encountered while completing the interview; an important skill fostered through the completion of the major paper for the course. Learning the skills of involvement with challenging problems, as it relates to interpersonal relationships with patients and families, is fundamental to becoming a nurse that employs family-centered care in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1074840712472554">
<title>Faculty Perspectives</title>
<p>Although using the 15-Minute Family Interview is described primarily as an educational strategy, student comments revealed that there were opportunities for therapeutic intervention to take place. Through the completion of family interviews, students described important opportunities to provide information, referrals and resources, listen to difficult emotional outpourings; and support caregivers, often just by listening to their concerns. Students demonstrated an ability to create a context for change, deep healing, and acknowledgement of feelings, by offering positive commendations, giving families “credit for what they have done,” and by recognizing the strength and resilience often found in families who are caring for each other in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Clinical faculty were e-mailed to offer their viewpoints on how integrating the 15-Minute Family Interview changed the practice of the students in their clinical areas, two responded as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Incorporating the 15-Minute Family Interview has certainly influenced the way that my students function in my clinical area (Postpartum unit). First, it facilitates providing care to the entire family, rather than just an individual. For most students, the focus in previous clinical settings has been on one patient with some type of medical issue. My clinical area is the first one that they have worked in that the families are encouraged to stay and be part of the nursing process. The structure of the 15-Minute Family Interview facilitates the development of a care plan that is specific to the needs of the whole family that they are actually working with. They are also able to see that the family could and perhaps should be included in any clinical setting. Second, it expands the student perspective on what it means to have a plan of care, allowing them to focus on strengths. The idea of implementing a positive care plan is new to most of my students. Rather than finding problems, the students are able to help families focus on their own strengths. This kind of nursing really facilitates therapeutic relationships with patients, which is beneficial to the families as well as the care providers (students). They are able to reflect on the situation and see that they were able to provide family centered care, and that their patients are better able to achieve their goals prior to being discharged. It also allows for a more well-rounded perspective for the students in regards to the behavior of other staff members. Overall, the 15-Minute Interview enhances the care that the students’ patients and families are receiving.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another instructor who works with students in a pediatric clinical area indicated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Often we are so focused on the patient; we do not take time for the family. Students are generally timid going in to this interaction but the majority come out realizing it was not as hard as they thought. It helps students see that families just want to be heard and informed regarding their child’s care. I think this helps students to get to know the families better. Students often bring back or write comments as how they learned so much more about the family from doing this project. Sometimes students are able to get a better sense for family concerns/issues and bring this feedback to the healthcare team. I think this would be something beneficial in all clinical areas as we are striving toward family centered nursing.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Overall, clinical faculty have been very supportive in having students complete the 15- Minute Family Interview in various clinical areas as the process is geared toward incorporating family-centered care in practice.</p>

<title>Implications for Education, Research, and Practice</title>
<p>Nursing educators need to offer opportunities for students to engage in family nursing in order to integrate it into their future practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712472554">Fast Braun &amp; Foster, 2011</xref>). Nursing students experience deep learning through applying theory to practice in this authentic learning assignment. This report describing undergraduate nursing students applying the 15-minute Family Interview in a clinical setting is unique in the literature, although practicing nurses have applied the 15-Minute Family Interview in hospital settings to bring a positive impact on a nurse’s ability to conduct family assessment and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712472554">Martinez et al., 2007</xref>). Nurse−family meetings were identified in research on a critical care unit as offering an opportunity to acknowledge suffering and open a channel for honest communication, including the information families were seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712472554">Nelms &amp; Eggenberger, 2010</xref>). Families desired an authentic connection with the nurse caring for them.</p>
<p>The implementation of family care practices, including the development of effective partnerships with families, continues to be a challenge in acute care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712472554">Duhamel, 2010</xref>). During the course of these student-led family interviews, families expressed their many concerns and frustrations with the health-care system, including a lack of communication especially related to information about the patient’s condition and treatment, and a general lack of inclusion of the family as partners in care. In current clinical practice, having time to talk with families continues to be a challenge. Having the skills, confidence, and a passion for families is essential to family nursing practice. Further research is needed to identify the practical ways the health-care system could become more equitable, effective, efficient, and empathic in meeting the needs of patients and families. An evaluation of this project with newly graduated nurses is needed, after their first few years of skill development, to give added insight into the appropriateness of this tool in nursing education. Research is also needed to obtain the perspective of nurses, patients, and family members to determine if transfer of family theory to practice has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712472554">Segaric &amp; Hall, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1074840712472554">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Providing health care that is truly responsive to the needs, wants, and expectations of individuals and families remains a challenge in health care around the world, requiring a major reevaluation of our values and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840712472554">World Health Organization, 2007</xref>). Requiring students to implement the 15-Minute Family Interview as an educational strategy was a powerful way to integrate clinical and classroom learning, engaging students in an authentic learning experience that was indeed transformative. Students completed interviews in the clinical setting, reflected on and prioritized a set of family nursing diagnoses and family nursing interventions, choosing what is uniquely important to the family at that point in time, reflecting on what went well and what could have been done better. Learning the tools to engage and support family nursing into everyday practice enables the empowerment of nurses, patients, and families by building compassionate, therapeutic relationships, and offering support and information when it is needed the most.</p>
