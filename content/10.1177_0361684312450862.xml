      <p>Editors Lillian Comas-Diaz and Marcella Bakur Weiner challenged 11 diverse psychotherapist authors to describe their personal and professional journeys in becoming woman healers and their experiences in “female healing” (p. xiii). Collectively, these personal narratives provide common and unique maps of the complex terrain of becoming psychologists, healers, and social activists. Comas-Diaz and Weiner assert that women “have an inherent predisposition for healing” (p. xi). Their aims were to give voice to the unique perspectives of diverse women on psychological healing, to stimulate readers to remember their own common struggles, and for readers to honor their own lessons as women healers.</p>
      <p>Our review of this book is being written from two main perspectives. Allie Minieri and Kristin Miserocchi, both doctoral students in counseling psychology, are feminist psychologists near the beginning of their journeys as women healers. Dr. Pam Remer is an associate professor of counseling psychology who has been training feminist psychologists for over 38 years and who is nearing retirement. Thus, we review this book for its contributions to two separate ends of the journey. </p>

         <title>Beginning Journey</title>
         <p>We read this book from the perspective of counseling psychology doctoral students studying feminist therapy. As we approach internship, we are reflecting on past and present work with clients and future career paths. We appreciated reading this book because the authors addressed the meaning of womanhood as healers and pioneers in their personal and professional lives.</p>
         <p>Through their stories, these women showed us as professionals how to honor traditionally feminine traits, such as nurturing, connecting, and empathizing. Many of these women talked about losing a family member, experiences with trauma, and other wounding experiences. For them, being a healer to others helped them heal. This metaphor is a beautiful way of honoring the historically devalued experience of womanhood.</p>
         <p>Hearing their stories gave us a sense of what to expect professionally, as if they were our mentors. We felt comforted reading about how these women live successfully in the two seemingly different realms of work and family by intertwining them. For instance, these pioneers painted a picture of how the quintessentially female experience of pregnancy existed in both realms by sharing their experiences as pregnant professional women. Through this and other examples, we understand how they challenged sexist environments, transforming how our profession values womanhood.</p>

         <title>Nearing Retirement</title>
         <p>As I read, I reflected on my own journey as a feminist healer. Our journeys, theirs and mine, have been significantly influenced by our personal life events as women. Our struggles with trauma and societal oppressions, initially barriers to well-being, became opportunities for developing strengths and connecting emotionally to our clients. I was awed by the courage the authors displayed as they described stepping out from mainstream psychology into their roles as healers. In addition to scientific theories and data, they use nontraditional theoretical orientations, attend to their intuition and body senses, draw from their ancestors’ transcultural lessons, value self-awareness, and view psychotherapy as an art as well as a science. They bravely assert that healing is reciprocal, with both client and therapist being healed by the relationship. I was comforted by their narratives, feeling support for my choices to speak my truths, to weave the personal and professional in my work with clients, and to trust myself and my feelings. I was challenged to be more courageous, to color more boldly outside the lines.</p>

         <title>Our Collective View</title>
         <p>Our “beginning journey” and “nearing retirement” expectations were satisfied by this book. We appreciated most those authors (especially Lillian Comas-Diaz, Thema Bryant-Davis, and Carla Bradshaw) who spoke most deeply from their hearts about their journeys. Taken together, these journeys will give readers (both men and women) support for daring to be nontraditional psychotherapists who integrate subjective ways of knowing and research to help heal their clients.</p>
