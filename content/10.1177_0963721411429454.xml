<abstract>
<p>GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> (the <italic>global vs. local processing model, a systems account</italic>) includes predictions about cognitive mechanisms (the how) and functionalities (the why) of two processing systems: one that processes information holistically and one that processes the parts. GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> suggests that global versus local perceptual processing carries over to other perceptual and conceptual tasks; it summarizes antecedents of global/local processing; and it proposes that global processing is functional for understanding the general meaning of novel events, whereas local processing supports encoding of details in familiar situations and when novel events are threatening.</p>

<p>People can attend to the same event in different ways. A fundamental distinction is whether they attend to the event as a whole or whether they focus on its details—or, in other words, whether they look at the proverbial forest or the trees. Differences in perception can affect evaluations. To illustrate, somebody who looks at the beautiful details of a sweater may overlook its bad fit, and somebody who looks at the nice neighbor family as a whole may overlook the aggressive behavior of the father. Here I summarize research on global versus local processing, as well as describe more counterintuitive research showing that a more global perspective on the world can enhance people’s creativity.</p>
<p>The distinction between holistic (i.e., global) and elemental (i.e., local) processing was captured long ago in philosophy and was taken up by Gestalt psychology; however, it received even more attention after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963721411429454">Navon’s (1977)</xref> introduction of his letter task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963721411429454">Fig. 1</xref>). He presented participants with large letters that were made up of small letters and found that participants were generally faster to identify a global target letter than a local letter, providing support for his global-dominance hypothesis. While researchers challenged the notion of global dominance, global versus local processing has generated an abundance of research.</p>

<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721411429454">Förster and Dannenberg (2010)</xref> introduced a comprehensive model, a systems account of the <italic>global and local processing model</italic>, or GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963721411429454">Förster, Liberman, &amp; Kuschel, 2008</xref>). This theory points to cognitive mechanisms elicited by global/local processing styles, it summarizes factors triggering global/local processing, and it discusses why people engage in global or local processing. GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> suggests the operation of two processing systems: a global system, “glo-sys,” and a local system, “lo-sys.” When glo-sys is activated, people perceive gestalts, activate broad categories in memory, and integrate incoming information into existing knowledge structures; whereas when lo-sys is activated, people perceive details, and activate narrow categories that typically lead to exclusion of incoming stimuli. I first describe cognitive mechanisms and then discuss functionalities.</p>
<sec id="section1-0963721411429454">
<title>Cognitive Mechanisms: The How</title>
<p>Within GLOMO<sup>sys</sup>, global versus local processing can carry over to unrelated tasks without participants’ awareness. Such carry-overs can support or impair subsequent performance. To illustrate, focusing on a global letter in one trial of the Navon task enhanced reaction times to global letters relative to local letters on a subsequent trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963721411429454">Ward, 1982</xref>). Importantly, the content of the trials (whether one looked at a big H made of Ls or different letters and whether the subsequent trial was a big F made of Cs or different letters) did not matter for the effects, and it was concluded that global/local processing styles are <italic>content-free</italic> ways of perceiving that are stored in procedural memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963721411429454">Tulving &amp; Schacter, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Automatic carry-overs have also been shown across different visual tasks. Most prominently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963721411429454">Macrae and Lewis (2002)</xref> suggested that face recognition profits from holistic processing. In their experiment, participants performed an allegedly unrelated Navon letter task before they were asked to recognize faces from a video they had watched before. The task was modified to prime different processing styles for two groups of participants: One group was instructed to attend to global features of Navon letters; the other, to attend to local features of Navon letters. As predicted, face recognition worsened after participants focused on the local features, whereas it increased after global priming compared to an unprimed control group.</p>
<p>According to GLOMO<sup>sys</sup>, the global/local distinction is not restricted to vision. People can listen, for example, to the whole or to parts of a song, they can examine the ingredients of a dish or taste the entire composition, they can attempt to smell the single components of a perfume or try to enjoy the entirety of the aroma, and they can touch the details or the whole of an object. Recently, I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963721411429454">Förster, 2011</xref>) demonstrated cross-modal processing shifts. For example, blindfolded participants were asked to touch a plastic square made of four small plastic squares; some were led to grasp the gestalt, whereas some were directed to the details. Afterward, a variant of the Navon letter task was assigned, and results showed that global grasping enhanced global visual perception and local grasping enhanced local visual perception. Participants also “looked at the forest” after they had listened to the gestalt of a poem or after they were led to taste a balanced mix of cereals or to smell a balanced mix of aromas, whereas they “looked at the trees” when they focused on the details of a poem or when they focused on the specific ingredients of food or aromas.</p>
<p>Such effects occurred outside of participants’ awareness: They were neither aware of the source for the elicited processing style nor aware of its operation. So, for example, when the global/local distinction was explained to them at the end of the experiments, they could not report which processing mode they used. In general, the findings suggest two processing systems that operate across sensory modalities. Similar automatic carry-overs have been examined using more complex conceptual tasks.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963721411429454">Derryberry and Tucker (1994)</xref> suggested that the mechanisms that drive perceptual attention and let you focus on one percept while excluding others are linked to conceptual attention. Conceptual attention reflects selective activation within semantic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963721411429454">Anderson &amp; Spellman, 1995</xref>), and it can be narrow or broad. For example, when “mountain” is primed, in narrow conceptual attention people may activate concrete associates (e.g., “stone” and “goat”), whereas in broad conceptual attention they activate superordinate concepts (e.g., “landscape” or “nature”). Activation of superordinate concepts gives room for further activation of remote associates (e.g., “eternity” or “World Wildlife Fund”) and thereby should support creative generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963721411429454">Friedman &amp; Förster, 2010</xref>). For example, the chef who invented basil ice cream may have profited from the activation of remote exemplars to the category of desserts. In contrast, many analytic tasks (such as syllogisms of the sort “If A &lt; B and C &gt; B, then ?”) profit from a narrow and systematic focus on the information given and use of deductive reasoning to draw conclusions from that information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963721411429454">Amabile, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistently, research demonstrates a link between perceptual and conceptual breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963721411429454">Friedman, Fishbach, Förster, &amp; Werth, 2003</xref>). To give an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963721411429454">Förster and Denzler (2012)</xref> used the visual, haptic, auditory, olfactory, or gustatory manipulations of global/local processing as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963721411429454">Förster (2011)</xref> and showed that across modalities, participants primed with global processing generated more creative titles for a cartoon but solved fewer syllogisms than participants primed with local processing.</p>
<p>GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> further suggests that when events are included in broadened categories, they may be experienced as similar to each other, whereas when they are excluded, they look dissimilar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963721411429454">Schwarz &amp; Bless, 2007</xref>). To illustrate, a broadened category of vehicles would allow for inclusion of fringe members of that category, such as “feet,” and upon inclusion into a category, objects may be perceived as similar to other members. Consistently, studies showed that participants perceived more similarities between two different events (artworks, animals, people) when they were primed with global perception, whereas local perception enhanced perception of dissimilarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963721411429454">Förster, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, globally primed participants perceived themselves to be more similar to others than did locally primed participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963721411429454">Förster et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond creative thought and similarity focus, construal-level theory (CLT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963721411429454">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>) suggests a relation between global, abstract processing and mental distancing. Because for distant events concrete information is usually lacking, people habitually represent them on a more abstract level. Numerous studies show that when participants imagined a distant event in one phase of an experiment, it facilitated global processing, abstraction, and creative generation in subsequent tasks. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721411429454">Liberman and Förster (2009)</xref> demonstrated that local priming resulted in smaller distance estimates on unrelated tasks (e.g., the distance from here to another city, or from now to graduation), whereas global priming led to larger estimates.</p>
<p>To sum up, perceptual scope is related to conceptual scope in that global/local perception influences creativity, similarity focus, and distancing. Carry-overs from one to the other task are rather mechanical: Whether they support or impair performance depends on the fit between processing styles. Future research should examine whether people can deliberatively make use of appropriate processing styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963721411429454">Wyer &amp; Xu, 2010</xref>). However, is there a general function of global/local processing?</p>

<title>Functions of Global Versus Local Processing: The Why</title>
<p>Why do we start with either global or local processing? Research shows that global/local perception can be triggered by a variety of psychological variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963721411429454">Fig. 2</xref>); identifying the commonalities among them may eventually inform us about the functions of lo-sys and glo-sys.</p>

<p>Some examples of moderators of global versus local processing as identified in various research studies. The blue conditions typically enhance global relative to local processing in perceptual tasks, whereas for the red conditions the opposite is true. Furthermore, the blue conditions have been related to novelty (defined as distance from experience), whereas the red conditions have been related to familiarity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721411429454">Förster &amp; Dannenberg, 2010</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To name a few examples, compared to healthy participants, participants with high chronic levels of autism, obsessionality, or anxiety show enhanced local processing. Self-regulation research could further show pronounced global processing when people think about their ideals compared to their duties and when their approach-motivational system is triggered (e.g., via inductions of arm flexion, the color blue, or positive-mood inductions). Moreover, global processing occurs when people are exposed to unfamiliar as opposed to familiar events or when obstacles are standing in the way of goal pursuit. Finally, studies demonstrate that people look at the forest when they are power holders and when their right hemispheres are relatively more activated than their left.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721411429454">Förster and Dannenberg (2010)</xref> speculated about a dimension underlying these relations. Is there a commonality among those different variables triggering processing styles (a “psychological glue”)? The authors made use of novelty-construal theory (NCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963721411429454">Förster, Marguc, &amp; Gillebaart, 2010</xref>), predicting that novelty defined as <italic>not previously experienced</italic> or <italic>lack of familiarity</italic> increases global processing. When people explore novel events or when they are confronted with them, the global processing level provides them efficiently with a global meaning; when an event is familiar, the local processing level is useful to learn more about its details. Additionally, lo-sys supports self regulation in case of threat.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it is suggested that people are naturally curious and want to integrate new information into existing knowledge structures. Such a process is supported by broadened mental categories. Why? First, the meaning of local features depends on global aspects more than vice versa, and thus the global level is more stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721411429454">Förster, Liberman, &amp; Shapira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963721411429454">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>). For instance, the general meaning of a door or a spoon does not depend on what the objects are made of (i.e., their local features)—doors are used for protecting property and spoons are made for carrying food, regardless of their material. Yet, the meaning of the local detail depends on the global feature: If a door is made of wood (e.g., it needs to get painted), this carries a different meaning than if a spoon is made of wood (e.g., you cannot put it in the dishwasher). Thus, global processing may direct people’s attention to a thing’s stable and general meaning. Second, in order to understand new events, it is more efficient to first search the global levels of representation, because they have fewer features than the local levels do. Consistently, recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721411429454">Förster et al. (2009)</xref> shows that novelty (manipulated, for example, via no exposure to an event as opposed to frequent exposure) automatically leads people’s attention to global letters in a Navon letter task.</p>
<p>However, such processes driven by epistemic motives can be overridden when novelty is subjectively threatening. Based on regulatory-focus theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963721411429454">Higgins, 1997</xref>) and attentional-tuning approaches (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963721411429454">Friedman &amp; Förster, 2010</xref>), it is suggested that when confronted with threatening novel events, people narrow the scope of their perceptual attention and search for conventional ways to efficiently cope with the threat. Consistently, introducing a new event as potentially threatening has been shown to enhance local rather than global processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721411429454">Förster et al., 2009</xref>). More generally, then, the two basic motives of self-protection and learning about novel events may underlie global versus local processing.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> suggests novelty as a psychological glue among moderators listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963721411429454">Figure 2</xref>. It is known that people are more exploratory and motivated to learn about novel events when they are in certain situations, such as when they are in a promotion focus, when they have power, or when they are in love; here, global processing is supportive of their goals. Furthermore, some factors immediately trigger global versus local processing because they increase perception of novelty. To illustrate, events may appear to be more abstract, ambiguous, or blurry and “new” when viewed from a distance than when from a proximal place. In order to understand them better, glo-sys is activated. However, when events appear threatening (such as when people are anxious or concerned) or when people already understood an event’s general meaning (i.e., it is familiar or close), they may make use of lo-sys to better process the details.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963721411429454">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In sum, two psychological processing systems evolve: glo-sys, processing novel events, and lo-sys, processing familiar events and threatening information. While glo-sys integrates, lo-sys differentiates. Whenever something is novel, unfamiliar, ambiguous, complex, uncertain, distant, unclear, blurry, vague, abstract, or otherwise represents an information gap, glo-sys tries to make sense of it by integrating it into inclusive, superordinate knowledge structures. Upon a global understanding, processing stops or lo-sys takes over, reflecting a global-to-local sequence. Whenever something is experienced as familiar, clear, close, proximal, or concrete, lo-sys may accept this event as “understood” or, in case one is motivated to “dig deeper,” it may search further for informative details. Routinized processing styles applied to novel or familiar events can carry over to other unrelated tasks, such as creativity tasks. Such routines are changed, however, when people need to protect themselves from potential danger; in this case, lo-sys takes over. Future research has to show whether extreme cases of novelty are experienced as threatening or whether valence and novelty are independent from one another.</p>
<p>Future studies may also more carefully investigate whether a systems account (implying a dichotomy) or a process model (implying a continuum) is more appropriate. However, while from the stimulus level one may prefer a continuum account—because stimuli in the real world have many levels of detail—GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> takes the perspective of the perceiver who can principally look at everything in a local <italic>or</italic> a global manner. While features of the stimulus may invite attention to the global or the local level to a more or lesser extent, the moment the person looks at it, only one system is (strongly or weakly) activated. Neural data may help to clarify this and related questions. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721411429454">Förster and Dannenberg (2010)</xref> listed neurophysiological studies consistent with a two-systems approach, future research may examine more thoroughly the relationship between novelty/familiarity and global/local processing at the brain level.</p>
<p>Admittedly, many aspects of GLOMO<sup>sys</sup> need to be examined more systematically; however, an advantage of this approach is its enormous heuristic value. The functional links between real-world variables, processing styles, and task affordances enable the examination of relations between variables that have traditionally been studied apart from each other within largely disconnected subfields.</p>
