<p>The first thing I noticed about <italic>Taking the Crime Out of Sex Work</italic> is the cover: a sunny sky partially covered by a brightly colored red and blue umbrella. No scantily clad women, no presumed sex workers with their faces blacked out or heads cut off, no neon signs, no street corners—no images typical of covers of academic treatises on sex work. The aesthetic feels textbookish, an appreciated indicator of the sound analysis inside on the passage of New Zealand’s Prostitution Reform Act (PRA) of 2003, which decriminalized prostitution.</p>
<p>The anthology, edited by Gillian Abel, Lisa Fitzgerald, and Catherine Healy with Aline Taylor, includes both social scientists and leading sex work advocates, lending a practical, grounded foundation to the book as it deconstructs the historical and legal conditions leading up to the introduction of decriminalization at the national level (including a thorough historical analysis starting in the 1600s through the present in chapter three), the sociopolitical context in which it occurred, an examination of the act itself (found in chapter seven), and the resulting outcomes of the PRA on sex workers’ lives (chapters eight to 14 cover this in depth, including a review of the mandatory five-year assessment as required by the PRA).</p>
<p>What is particularly compelling about this anthology is the way it contextualizes the background and outcomes of the PRA in light of New Zealand’s particular gender politics, geography, and relatively young, liberalist political system. The PRA is a landmark piece of legislation, marking the first country in the world to decriminalize sex work (the Australian territory of New South Wales did so in 1996). As the book points out, most other North World nations have some form of regulation, meaning some activities like soliciting are criminalized while others are not. The Swedish model is often held up as the exemplar of a regulatory model, criminalizing only the clients by outlawing the purchase of prostitution. Less common to postindustrial countries is the complete criminalization of prostitution, found in the United States (except for the legal rural, small Nevada brothel industry).</p>
<p>Chapter six explores how liberal and conservative women’s groups alike used liberal feminist logic, including a feminism emphasizing self-determination and control over one’s own body and sexuality to argue for the decriminalization of prostitution. This argument for individual liberty aligned with New Zealand’s liberal political backbone and not with anti-sex-work advocates’ concerns about an increase in sex trafficking. Similarly, chapter three offers a refreshing read about how a sex workers’ rights organization, the New Zealand Prostitutes’ Collective, garnered support from nongovernmental agencies and politicians, making the organization instrumental in the push to decriminalize prostitution in that country. This is the strongest common thread throughout the anthology: how the strategic deployment of a human rights framework complemented New Zealand’s liberalist political leanings.</p>
<p>Despite the passage of a decriminalization bill, the stigmatization of sex workers remains, as discussed in chapter 14, and some sex workers benefit less from the PRA than others, such as marginalized or vulnerable populations like transgender workers and youth younger than 18. The PRA has not affected media-perpetuated stereotypes of sex work and sex workers (discussed in chapter 12) or many of the more complex risks and issues sex workers deal with (see chapters 13 and 14). The book is sensitive to the fact that legal change and social change are often out of sync.</p>
<p>Though light on theory, the book offers a broad cursory introduction to existing theoretical perspectives on the study of sex work: sex work as a form of labor, sex positive feminist theories, and public health (chapter 11 explores the new duties of the medical officers of health after the passage of the PRA). While the anthology offers little in the way of new theoretical insights into prostitution as a point of inquiry, it is a thoroughly engaging look at sex work in a contemporary society that achieved the holy grail of sex work activists: decriminalization.</p>
<p>In a sea of radical feminist scholarship asserting commercialized sex as a form of violence against women, this book fits with a recent wave of scholarship that examines the sex industry as a multifaceted phenomenon reflective of the complex emotional labor and blurring of personal and private spheres in late capitalist service industry work. The anthology successfully demonstrates that decriminalization of prostitution works. It is a clear, easy-to-read text for undergraduate courses on the sociology of law, liberalism, gender, and sexuality, or the commercialization of sex/uality. The book is a mix of quantitative measures, qualitative fieldwork and interviews, and historical and legal analyses providing a comprehensive examination of a unique piece of legislation that encourages the reader to question the meaning of criminalizing sex work and perhaps to question the prostitution policies in her or his own country.</p>
