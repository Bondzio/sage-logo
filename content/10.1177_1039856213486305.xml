<body>
<p>For many people with schizophrenia, recovery in terms of everyday functioning fails to be realised with standard care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486305">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486305">2</xref></sup> Existing pharmacological interventions have clear efficacy and effectiveness in reducing positive symptoms, and to a lesser extent, negative symptoms; however, the degree to which they ameliorate other core problems such as neurocognition, social cognition and social functioning is less convincing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486305">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486305"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486305"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486305"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486305"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486305">8</xref></sup> This is significant, given that functional outcomes in schizophrenia are influenced by the degree of neurocognitive and social cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486305">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>At a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) workshop on social cognition, consensus was reached that the concept encompasses at least five domains: theory of mind; social perception; social knowledge; attribution bias and emotional processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486305">10</xref></sup> Converging evidence suggests that neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments reflect part of the core symptomatology of schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486305">11</xref></sup> While there are individual differences in the nature and severity of these problems, the performance deficits in group-based comparisons with control subjects are marked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486305">12</xref></sup> These problems have been noted in a broad range of patients, including those with recent symptom onset, a chronic illness course, and whom are unmedicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486305">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Optimising community functioning is a current target of research, with emphasis on programs with behavioural components embedded in a broader rehabilitative approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486305">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486305">14</xref></sup> Social cognition appears to be a relevant treatment target, especially when delivered within a rehabilitation setting.</p>

<title>Overview of Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT)</title>
<p>SCIT is a 20-24 session, manualised, group therapy that utilises Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy (CBT) principles to address the social cognitive deficits of psychosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486305">15</xref></sup> The program is organised into three phases (‘Emotions’, ‘Figuring out situations’ and ‘Checking it out’); it involves education, interpretation of videos and photographs, and practicing strategies for making sense of social problems, using games and group problem solving. SCIT has demonstrated effectiveness (in uncontrolled and quasi-experimental studies) in improving social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, including: emotion perception,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486305">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486305">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486305"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486305"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref></sup> theory of mind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486305">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486305">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486305">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486305">19</xref></sup> and the tendency towards hostile attributions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486305">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486305"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486305">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Initial SCIT studies were conducted in controlled research settings in psychiatric inpatient units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486305">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486305">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486305">19</xref></sup> Roberts and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref></sup> examine the transportability and feasibility of SCIT in community setting, in a preliminary open trial, finding partial support for its usefulness for community services. Attrition rates of 24% were observed, the average attendance of study completers was 69% of sessions, and both patients and clinicians tended to rate the group as helpful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213486305">
<title>Aims</title>
<p>This study aimed to replicate the preliminary open trial of SCIT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref></sup> evaluating the acceptability of the intervention in an Australian community rehabilitation service. It was undertaken outside of a formal research setting, without external incentives such as payment, transport or meal provision. We were interested in whether the consumers would attend these sessions, and if they would find them useful and relevant to the challenges they face in their lives.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1039856213486305">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The evaluation was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Participants provided informed consent. We aimed to recruit 10 clinically-stable participants with psychotic illness from three areas of the rehabilitation service: Early Psychosis (EP), an assertive early intervention service for young adults; Mobile Intensive Treatment Team (MITT), an assertive community team; and a Community Care Unit (CCU), a medium-term community residential rehabilitation unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856213486305">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The evaluation utilised a mixed-methods approach. Primary outcome measures of the intervention’s acceptability were recruitment, attendance and attrition data; a secondary outcome was the impact on social cognition. Case managers were asked to complete the Life Skill Profile (LSP-16)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486305">20</xref></sup> prior to commencement and on completion of the study.</p>
<p>Acceptability was further examined using an anonymous survey of completers and clinicians. Thematic analysis was based on consensus agreement of three of the authors (PW, SF and SP); each had facilitated the program at different sites. Themes were initially derived independently, using coded response elements. Once agreement was reached on the underlying themes, each author had the opportunity to reallocate response elements. Through this process, consensus was reached.</p>
<p>Social cognition was assessed using three of the measures previously utilised and described in the Roberts et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref></sup> preliminary open trial. The Hinting Task was used to assess theory of mind;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213486305">21</xref></sup> emotion recognition was assessed via the Facial Emotion Identification Task (FEIT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486305">22</xref></sup> and attribution style was assessed via the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486305">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856213486305">
<title>General procedures</title>
<p>Sessions ran weekly for 1 hour and followed the 20-session manual. Facilitators were trained by one of the authors (FD) and included: a Psychiatrist, Psychiatry Registrars, Psychologists and nursing staff. This trainer, trained by David Roberts, had permission to deliver further training and supervision. We ran the EP and MITT groups at an outpatient clinic, and CCU sessions in the meeting room of the rehabilitation unit.</p>
<p>Qualitative data was collected anonymously from participants and facilitators, at the end of the program. We administered the AIHQ and Hinting Task prior to group commencement; we administered the FEIT in a group format during the first session, using the same modified projection slides as Roberts et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref></sup> We repeated these measures at the conclusion of the program.</p>

<p>Distinct themes were identified upon analysis of the written facilitator feedback. Most facilitators (7/8) discussed the benefits of the program with reference to ‘The impact on clinical outcomes’. These responses either expressed a general sense of confidence in the value and relevance of the program, or of specific components. Facilitators emphasised the usefulness of focusing on participants’ real-world problems, in motivating and engaging these participants. This was most apparent during the final phase of ‘checking it out’, with one of the facilitators writing:<disp-quote>
<p>‘The aspect of the intervention that seemed most useful was the final phase. In these sessions consumers became much more motivated and animated. I recognise that the earlier skills provided an important platform for these discussions but wonder whether there might be a way to increase the real-world focus of the initial sessions.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, some facilitators discussed benefits relating to the generalisation of skills learnt during SCIT to other therapeutic interactions.</p>
<p>‘The problem of poor motivation’ was emphasised by most facilitators (6/8), who discussed the impact of late attendance, non-attendance and poor participation on the ability to deliver the program. Additionally, the ‘negative impact of positive symptoms and cognitive impairment’ on session delivery and the assessment process was acknowledged (2/8).</p>
<p>Facilitators suggested ‘ways to improve the existing program’ (7/8). These included: reducing the number of sessions, decreasing the duration of sessions, increasing the transparency of the content of the initial sessions to the problems in the lives of the participants, reducing the repetitiveness of the content and condensing the sessions over a shorter time period.</p>
<p>Two facilitators emphasised ‘observed non-specific benefits on clients’, including normalisation of emotions, opportunities to express empathy and provide support to peers. One reflected, ‘Participants were able to connect, share experiences, normalise emotional responses, practice/develop empathy’.</p>

<p>Post-intervention data collection was incomplete for the EP and MITT groups. For this reason, data was available for the CCU group only.

A poor response from case managers in completing the LSP-16 meant this data was not available for analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Significant challenges were met in this trial of SCIT in the ‘real-world’ setting of a public community mental health service. The qualitative data suggested that at least a subset of participants viewed the program as valuable and relevant; however, we were unable to establish and maintain groups of an adequate size to permit meaningful evaluation, with consumers from the outpatient groups being most likely to discontinue the program. The trend in the CCU data suggested improvements in theory of mind and emotional processing, but not in the tendency towards hostile attributions. This was consistent with the outpatient replication trial of Roberts and Penn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486305">18</xref></sup> The increased hostility bias may relate to the way the measure is scored, whereby an increased focus on ‘action’ through ‘checking it out’ was interpreted as an increase in hostility. The predominant themes from the facilitator feedback suggested significant adaptations may be required to the content and delivery of the program, to better meet the needs of our consumers, and to create a learning environment that is intrinsically motivating and able to deliver the target outcomes for a heterogeneous consumer group.</p>
<p>Difficulties with the motivation of consumers pervaded our recruitment, program delivery and evaluation. Many of those consumers who provided consent to be involved in the groups did not attend more than one session, and both the EP and MITT groups were discontinued early due to their inability to maintain adequate levels of participation to sustain the program. In research settings there are often multiple external incentives for participation, including payment and the provision of transport assistance. It is interesting that the best attendance was in the residential rehabilitation setting, and also that additional people ultimately joined the group and attended well, despite their refusal to consent to involvement in the research project.</p>
<p>Whilst it is promising that there are several psychosocial interventions with an emerging evidence base in research settings, these are unlikely to have practical utility unless they are delivered in ways that captivate the interest of participants in routine mental health settings. Furthermore, given the reality of intermittent attendance, further effort is required to determine how to best engage and select participants, and how much exposure is required to achieve target outcomes.</p>
<p>The disparity in attendance between the community and the residential settings seems significant; this observation fits with the research setting data from the initial pilot studies, showing more robust outcomes in closed inpatient versus community settings. Possibly, the sense of community at the CCU reduced the anxiety associated with group participation and provided additional motivators for engagement to those intrinsic to the program.</p>
<p>Staff reported participant inclusion of skills and concepts from SCIT into other modes of their therapy, such as Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) and CBT, raising the possibility of ‘cross-pollination’ between therapies. Additionally, several facilitators commented on the impact of neurocognitive impairment on an individual’s ability to follow and participate constructively in the group. It is possible that assessment of the degree of such impairment might guide the assessment of appropriateness of a consumer for participation in social cognitive interventions, or whether a step-wise progression after CRT may be more appropriate.</p>
<sec id="section16-1039856213486305">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The evaluation of the program was completed in an unblinded manner, as a quality activity within a real-world clinical setting. The researchers were embedded within the program, not only as facilitators but also providers of other aspects of care. Considerable self-selection bias would be expected in the outcome data and participant evaluation data, as this was largely only available for those partipants who had sustained attendance. Whilst clinical stabilty was one of the inclusion criteria, a weakness of the study is that formal assessment of neurocognition and positive and negative symptoms was not completed.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Evidence-based interventions are being developed to address the social cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia; however, we found significant challenges in replicating these programs and their outcomes in real-world clinical settings. Our experience indicated that there are some consumers who are motivated and see benefit in the SCIT program. It is also apparent that there are many consumers for whom the program, in its current format, is not intrinsically motivating. Further work is required to explore the characteristics that separate these two groups: possible factors include the severity of neurocognitive impairment and the active positive symptom load. Collecting evaluation data at the end of each session might provide an opportunity for further clarifying who attends, who leaves and what gains are made. Such evaluations would need to find ways to detect more subtle shifts in the domains of social cognition and motivation. Further implementation studies will hopefully enable the research benefits of SCIT to be realised within real-world settings.</p>
