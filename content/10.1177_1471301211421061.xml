<abstract>
<p>In this paper we describe the development and pilot implementation, in a primary care context, of a programme for helping families adapt to living with a person with dementia (proFamilies-dementia). This programme aims to promote the healthy adaptation of the family to the <italic>presence</italic> of an elderly member with dementia living in their homes. It comprises three components: a psycho-educational, multi-family discussion group for the families; cognitive stimulation for the elderly person with dementia; and a mediation service to support the families after participation in the first two components. proFamilies-dementia was implemented with one group involving five families. The main benefits mentioned by families include: an opportunity to share experiences with others who are living through similar circumstances; the development of an improved sense of competency; and the improvement of family relationships. proFamilies-dementia reveals potential for promoting the provision of integrated support from health and social services, which usually function as independent and parallel support structures.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421061" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dementia is not just one person's illness: patients and their families need to adjust socially, emotionally and on a daily basis to the <italic>presence</italic> of the disease in order to prevent problems in their functioning and development. Programmes in this field tend to target the elderly person with dementia (including pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies) and/or target the family carer (providing, for example, respite care, education and home care). The development of effective models of caring for individuals with dementia and their families is of paramount importance. The literature suggests that effective support programmes should entail a multi-component approach which combines psychological and educational dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421061">Acton &amp; Kang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421061">Zarit &amp; Femia, 2008</xref>). Considering these principles, we developed a programme entitled proFamilies-dementia, which aims to promote the healthy adaptation of the family to dementia in one of its members, improving their quality of life and well-being and facilitating the connection between family and support systems (social and health). This programme was developed to support families that care for an elderly person with dementia in their homes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421061"><title>Construction and implementation</title>
<p>proFamilies-dementia has its roots in proFamilies-cancer and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421061">Chiquelho et al., 2010</xref>), which aims to promote a healthy adjustment of the family to a chronic illness. It is also inspired in the literature and in other programmes for older people with dementia and their families (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421061">Boise, Congleton, &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421061">Klein, 1998</xref>). It incorporates the needs of families which are expressed during the recruitment process. In short, the families reported that they were joining this programme because they <italic>hoped</italic> to improve their emotional self-efficacy, to improve care delivery, to learn more about the disease and to share experiences.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421061" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title>
<p>This project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Health Administration of the Centre Region, and authorized by the Health Centre of Ílhavo (Portugal). Participating families were recruited according to the following procedure: (i) the Director of the Health Centre met the medical team and requested their collaboration in the identification of recent diagnoses of dementia (1 to 2 years after diagnosis); (ii) family doctors identified dementia cases and made the families’ contacts (address and phone number) available to the research team; (iii) families were contacted by telephone, informed about the purpose of the project and invited to participate; (iv) an interview was scheduled for interested families; (v) the researcher (first author) went to the families’ home and presented the objectives and organization of the programme; for those who declined to participate, the interview ended here (six families declined, reporting discomfort at having to leave the care receiver and lack of time); for those who continued to be interested, the interview continued with the collection of information related to their psycho-social situation (socio-demographic data, health status); (vi) anonymity and confidentiality were guaranteed and authorization to record the sessions was requested; all participants signed the informed consent form; (vii) the researcher informed the participants that they would be contacted soon to schedule the sessions. proFamilies-dementia started with 6 families, but 1 family dropped out, on the grounds that they did not feel the need for support since their relative with dementia was merely in a phase of memory loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421061" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>One group was established, involving five families, with one family being represented by two non-patient family members. The average age of non-patients was 56.17 years (SD = 15.4) and five were female; one participant worked full time and four were retired; four were married. Three participants have been caring for the elderly person with dementia for about 1–2 years, and the others have been doing so for more than 2 years. As for academic qualifications, one never attended school, two had 4 years of schooling, two had up to 9 years of schooling and two participants attended higher education. The kinship of the participants with the elderly dementia sufferer was as follows: two were spouses, two were offspring, one was as nephew and one was a son-in-law. Only one family used formal support services (home care).</p>
<p>The five elderly persons with dementia had an average age of 79.6 years (SD = 5.8) and three were male. They all had primary school education and four were married. Regarding the time between the diagnosis and the initiation of the programme, it was observed that in one case, this was less than 2 months; in the other four cases, more than 1 year had passed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421061"><title>Components</title>
<p>The programme was coordinated by a gerontologist (the first author). proFamilies-dementia comprises three components: (A) psycho-educational multi-family groups; (B) stimulation for elderly persons with dementia; (C) mediation service.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421061"><title>Component A. Psycho-educational group</title>
<p>This component was developed over six sessions (one per week, 90 minutes each) in multi-family discussion groups. The sessions took place in the Ílhavo Health Centre and were coordinated by a psychologist and a gerontologist who combine experience and training in psycho-education with caring for elderly persons with dementia. The programme involves a multi-disciplinary approach, requiring the participation of a family doctor, nurse and social worker. Professionals should assume an active and empathic attitude. Each session is organized into four parts: educational, supportive, relaxation and task assignment. In each session participants receive handouts summarizing the main topics.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421061"><title>Session 1</title>
<p>This session begins with the introduction of the group facilitators, the families and the objectives and format of the programme. The educational goal consists in giving the participants basic information about dementia. A family doctor delivers a brief presentation, and then participants may ask questions. Some queries are frequent, namely: whether the illness is hereditary and what the reasons for the disturbed behaviours are. Another goal (supportive) is to help families to normalize the experience of dementia. Participants identify the positive and negative impacts of the dementia diagnosis on their family life. It is emphasized that the illness did not convey <italic>anything good</italic>; however, when considering family functioning, it is possible to give value to some aspects. The most common positive aspects mentioned are family unity and avoiding the institutionalization of the elderly relative. Negative impacts include isolation and dealing with the memory loss. A further objective is to develop effective ways of dealing with stress, so a moment of relaxation is created in all sessions. In this session, the participants practice diaphragmatic breathing. At the end, participants are given the task of contacting a friend during the week as a way of reducing the feeling of isolation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421061"><title>Session 2</title>
<p>Beginning with the second session, all remaining sessions start with group members discussing their degree of success with the task of the previous week.</p>
<p>This session aims at helping participants improve their self-care and this topic is discussed using scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421061">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>). Participants are asked to answer the following question, using a scale ranging from 0 (not important) to 10 (highly important): <italic>How much do you think you need to care for yourself?</italic> Participants report that the importance of self-care was about 3 to 5 points (<italic>we can't think about self-care while our relative with dementia is alive</italic>). After a brief explanation, participants recognized they could promote their self-care by <italic>being more patient with the care receiver, and accepting and finding more support</italic>. Participants are then invited to engage in cognitive relaxation. The task of this session requires the organization of a self-care plan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421061"><title>Session 3</title>
<p>The educational objectives are centred on caring for an elderly person with dementia, and involve the collaboration of a nurse who provides information on relevant topics (such as nutrition, sleep and rest) and answers the participants’ questions. Participants’ queries usually focus on <italic>what to do when the elderly have cold feet, how to be sure whether a complaint is true or not.</italic> The supportive part aims to help the participants develop more efficient strategies of stress management. Each participant is asked to identify how stress is felt in his/her life; and to identify the most functional strategies they have used, which include seeking the support of friends or looking for information. Participants are then invited to take part in a moment of cognitive relaxation. The task to be done during the week entails the practice of this relaxation technique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421061"><title>Session 4</title>
<p>In this session participants discuss how to communicate their feelings and concerns more effectively. Facilitators address the topic of different forms of communication, emphasizing that assertiveness is, in general, the most efficient. How to communicate in an assertive way using the DESC technique is explained (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421061">Bower &amp; Bower, 2004</xref>): <underline>d</underline>escribe the facts; <underline>e</underline>xpress feelings; <underline>s</underline>pecify the desired changes; explain the <underline>c</underline>onsequences. Subsequently, the group is asked to think about situations in which it is difficult for them to be assertive and role-playing exercises are put into practice. The task for the next session requires the participants to use the assertive training in a situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421061"><title>Session 5</title>
<p>This session begins with a report on available community resources presented by a social worker. Some queries arose, such as how to <italic>acquire technical aids and what social benefits are available.</italic> The supportive part of this session aims to help families improve their emotion-management strategies. The use of the game ‘six colours six ways of thinking’ (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421061">Bono, 1985</xref>) is recommended. In this game, each colour has a thought associated with it: black, negative; red, emotive; white, neutral; yellow, optimistic; green, creative; blue, meta-thinking. The group chooses a challenging situation and uses this game to test how different thoughts induce different emotional moods. At the end of the session, two tasks are handed out: participants have to pay attention to the moments when they feel negative emotions and apply the game; as the next session is the last, they are asked to bring something to eat or drink to celebrate the end of the group activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211421061"><title>Session 6</title>
<p>Participants are asked to think and share their desires for the future (to maintain significant goals for their individual and family lives). Facilitators provide information on legal support.</p>
<p>The group should end with special events to ensure that families can remember their participation positively. The final session also includes the presence of the volunteers and the mediators. Finally, a celebration (a party with food and drinks) takes place; photographs are taken of each family and of the whole group; 3 months later, the photos are sent by mail to each family, with a personalized message.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421061"><title>Component B. Stimulation for the dementia sufferer</title>
<p>During the initial contact with families, researchers asked about their interest in having a volunteer group service, and this component was made available for the families who were interested in it (three families). A volunteer training programme was created and implemented at the University of Aveiro and advertised among health professionals and students of health professions. Six people signed up (all female; average age = 27.16 years, ranging from 19 to 51 years): four gerontologists, one student of gerontology and one nurse.</p>
<p>The main objectives of this component are as follows: to delay the progression of the disease; to allow families to participate in the psycho-educational sessions; to provide families with concrete information about strategies they can use with their relative with dementia. Before the start of the stimulation component, the volunteers visit the family twice; first, to be introduced to all the family members; second, to evaluate the needs and potential of the elderly person with dementia. Sessions are developed in the elderly person's home and are organized as follows: Session 1, information is gathered about the elderly person (interests and preferences); Sessions 2–6, cognitive stimulation activities are undertaken, such as memory, attention and language stimulation and reality orientation therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211421061"><title>Component C. Mediation service</title>
<p>The mediator is a social worker who, on a voluntary basis, facilitates the coordination between families and the formal support services. The mediator fulfils tasks which are usually highly valued by families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421061">Dupuis, Epp, &amp; Smale, 2004</xref>): giving current information about community resources; facilitating access to health services and social support. proFamilies-dementia provides one professional for each family, for a minimum period of 6 months (the time considered reasonable for assessing this service). Mediators were recruited using the snowball technique, starting with the social worker from the Health Centre where the programme took place. Five mediators were recruited, all female and with an average age of 41 (ranging from the age of 31 to 54).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1471301211421061"><title>Evaluation</title>
<p>The programme was evaluated in order to collect suggestions from the participants about how to better adjust it to their needs and to identify benefits for individuals and families. For this purpose, focus group interviews were carried out with the participants 2 weeks after the end of the programme. The interview focused participants’ opinions on three topics: structural and functional aspects; the roles of volunteers and mediators; and individual and family benefits. The interview (which lasted 70 minutes) was led by the psychologist and the gerontologist who coordinated the group. The interview was taped, transcribed and submitted to content analysis. The sample is identical to the participants, since all of them agreed to participate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1471301211421061" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>With regard to the functional aspects of proFamilies-dementia, the results indicate that: the number, duration, sequence and frequency of sessions were adequate. Participants emphasized that this type of programme should be carried out in community institutions, to guarantee that participants live nearby and can keep in contact after the end of the group:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>If I feel the need to grumble I would have people to talk to</italic>.’ [Sandra<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211421061">1</xref></sup>, 55 years]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the most relevant feature of the programme, they highlighted the fact that they were all on the same level; with the facilitators, which allowed them to feel free to talk ‘<italic>without fear of being misunderstood</italic>’ (Sandra, 55 years), and with all of the participants, which enabled everyone to learn from everyone else (‘<italic>here we were all the same color</italic>’, Vânia, 75 years). They emphasized the benefits of having professionals that did not <italic>just teach</italic>: ‘<italic>there was an exchange between facilitators and participants</italic>’ (Anabela, 60 years). Participants considered the methodology adequate and appreciated the absence of new technologies (e.g. PC, data show) since the sessions became more interactive and the group became more inclusive (among the participants were both graduates and illiterate people).</p>
<p>According to the participants, all of the contents of the programme were important, finding the legal and financial issues the least useful and emphasizing self-care as the most important:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>When I spent a little more time in the coffee shop I felt bad with myself. Now I think: “take your time”</italic>.’ [Manuela, 39 years]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants underlined the relevance of a group of families facing different stages of the disease, since this allowed the sharing of experiences and the anticipation of future difficulties. They also highlighted that it is difficult to involve families who take care of a person with dementia at an early stage:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>If it was 2 years ago I wouldn't have agreed to participate because I felt no need!</italic>’ [Anabela, 60 years]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to involve these families in this type of programme, it is necessary to have someone with experience in dementia caregiving to explain how important these programmes are at the early stages of the disease.</p>
<p>On the role of the volunteers, participants mentioned that their participation in the psycho-educational sessions had been particularly useful. They pointed out that they created friendship bonds with the volunteers and that ‘<italic>it was good for him</italic> [patient] <italic>not to be alone</italic>’ (Paula, 71 years). Participants still do not have an opinion about how helpful the mediators might be, however one of them says that:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>It's good to know that there is a professional who knows our situation and will be available to help us whenever we need!</italic>’ [Sandra, 55 years]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The main benefits centred on the sharing of experiences which attenuated feelings of emotional and social isolation and normalized some feelings and thoughts. Concerning their relationship with the elderly person with dementia, participants highlighted two positive impacts: they learned more patience (‘<italic>as I understand this disease better, I have more patience to deal with it</italic>’, Vânia, 75 years); and they acquired more strategies (‘<italic>now I touch him when he gets stubborn</italic>’, Paula, 71 years).</p>
<p>Some individual impacts include: (i) an increased awareness of the importance of self-care without feelings of guilt (‘<italic>I no longer feel guilty when I take time for myself; first, we have to take care of ourselves and then we take care of them</italic>’, Manuela, 39 years); (ii) the recognition of self-competence (‘<italic>I needed to know if things were being done well; I was never taught how to take care of a person with dementia, but now I know that I am doing things in the right way</italic>’, Anabela, 60 years); (iii) more strength (‘<italic>these sessions give me strength, it was good to meet you</italic>’, Sandra, 55 years).</p>
<p>Concerning the changes felt by the family, participants stated that they learned more about how to deal with emotions and how to communicate better, which improved the quality of family life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1471301211421061"><title>Discussion and implications</title>
<p>proFamilies-dementia seems to respond to the needs of families caring for an elderly relative with dementia at home. Participants considered that this support should be made available immediately after the diagnosis of the dementia. They underlined that those recently confronted with the diagnosis of dementia in a relative are not receptive to this type of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421061">Morgan, Semchuk, Stewart, &amp; D'Arcy, 2002</xref>) because they still hope that the disease is not that severe. Particular efforts should be put into the recruitment of families facing a recent diagnostic of dementia. Probably the team involved in the diagnosis should provide more education and families who have been involved in support programmes could be engaged in recruitment to motivate those families to participate. The strengths of proFamilies-dementia seem to lie in: a collaborative approach in which participants and facilitators develop a relationship based on equality, empathy and inclusion; an integrated approach involving health and social care; community empowerment, since it puts in place formal and informal networks, as well as bringing together volunteers and professionals to support each other. This pilot programme needs to be replicated, involving other community settings and engaging more family members.</p>
