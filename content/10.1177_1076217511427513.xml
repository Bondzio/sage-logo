<p>In the quest for solutions to make school as rigorous and relevant as possible, one particularly vibrant source of information is often omitted: the opinions of our students. Yet, by posing specific questions about curriculum, classroom climate, and teacher competencies and attitudes, a rich database of usable suggestions emerges. The author of this article highlights specific ideas for improving school conditions for gifted children and adolescents, which were gleaned from more than 10,000 individual responses to an online survey of gifted students from the elementary through high school age. Clustering these comments into five categories termed “The 5 Cs of Student Engagement”—<italic>c</italic>ontrol, <italic>c</italic>omplexity, <italic>c</italic>ommon bonds, <italic>c</italic>hoice, and <italic>c</italic>aring teachers—the author invites readers to implement some of the suggestions offered by education’s primary consumers: our students.</p>

<p>“Teachers could like their jobs enough to make us want to like ours.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In verse and in song, we are led to believe that the most essential basics in a child’s education are the “3 Rs”: readin’, ‘ritin’, and ‘rithmetic. While it is hard to argue against these building blocks of learning, there are some elements to student progress that are even more dramatic and fundamental. I label them the “5 Cs of Student Engagement”:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217511427513" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Control</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Complexity</p>

<list-item>
<p>Common bonds</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Choice</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Caring teachers</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Whereas some of these “5 Cs” relate directly to curriculum and instruction, others align more with the attitudes of the teacher and the atmosphere created in the classroom. These “softer” elements that undergird the teaching/learning process are often the ones students themselves regard as the most essential of all. Indeed, we disregard them at our peril.</p>
<p>All manner of educational research exists as to how best to achieve classroom success—and much of it is contradictory. Yet in my 30+ years of experience working with and for gifted children, I have found one source that is reliable and valid over time and in multiple contexts: listening to the children themselves. Gifted students (others, too), the consumers of our lessons and lectures, are the best barometers we have to tell us what works and what does not, to let us know which classroom conditions stimulate learning and which ones stifle it, and to inform us about the distinction between promising practices and timeworn tedium. It is time to let the collective voices of our students be heard and their ideas treated with the respect that they deserve.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217511427513">
<title>Collecting Priceless Insights</title>
<p>To find out what gifted students thought about themselves and their education, a colleague and I began what became a 2-year project in 2004. On a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.giftedkidsspeak.com">www.giftedkidsspeak.com</ext-link>) designed to elicit comments from gifted children, we collected more than 10,000 unique responses from more than 4,000 individual students—indeed, a treasure trove of ideas and suggestions on making education challenging, relevant, and fun. Participants came from virtually every U.S. state and several foreign nations, with the age range of 5 to 63 (some kids never grow up!). Compiling the most common and direct responses into two books, <italic>Smart Talk: What Kids Say About Growing Up Gifted</italic> (for ages 5-11) and <italic>More Than A Test Score: Teens Talk About Being Gifted, Talented, or Otherwise Extra-Ordinary</italic> (for ages 12 and up), gifted students’ voices were going to be heard.</p>
<p>Now, 5 years after the books’ publication and in the midst of yet another era of educational reform, I began to reexamine what gifted students had to say about life in school. That is where the 5 Cs emerged—and that is where the bulk of this article is focused: on listening to gifted students who have much to tell us about engaging them in the learning process. So, let us begin.</p>
<sec id="section2-1076217511427513">
<title>C #1: Control</title>
<p>Seeking “control” is sometimes misinterpreted as being belligerent enough to always want to get your own way. In the context of what gifted kids want from school, though, the meaning is much more benign. In essence, “control” is a request to get your intelligence respected and served in school. For example,</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>School isn’t flexible enough to allow me to grow as an individual. Everything is very structured, and if I ask for any differences I am seen as bucking the system, looking for trouble. (Boy, 11, Ohio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 55)</p>
<p>Teachers should poll students to see what they already know and then not repeat that stuff over and over. (Boy, 9, Illinois; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 62)</p>
<p>Teach us how to study. I can memorize, but that’s about it. I worry that I’ll need to know how to do something else when I come up against a subject I’ve never seen before. What will I do? (Girl, 11, Texas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 63)</p>
<p>I wish my gifted program met more than one day a week. The teacher and activities are wonderful and I get to know more about me in a place where it is all right to <italic>be</italic> me. (Boy, 8, North Carolina; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 68)</p>
<p>In a sense, being creative gets in the way of school in that creative people are forced to choose between creating meaningful things and doing schoolwork. I live to write, but I am forced to choose between doing my homework and writing, because I have no time to do both. Often, school makes me so tired that when I get home, I have no energy left to create. (Boy, 14, Illinois; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 78)</p>
<p>My favorite thing about my gifted program is that I know and like everyone in it. So, when a teacher tells me he is about to assign groups, I can look around the room</p>
<p>and know that there is no one I don’t want to work with. (Girl, 13, Florida; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 97)</p>
<p>I know for a fact that our school gets extra money for having us in this GT class. I have no problem with being gifted, but the class is just a bunch of extra work for no good reason. The administration forces us into this class so the school can make an easy buck. <italic>They</italic> should take this class and see how they feel! (Girl, 14, Texas; Schultz &amp; Delisle, 200, p. 98)</p>
<p>I love being challenged, but sometimes, I just want a break, which I can’t have. Last Wednesday was the first time I can remember in two years when I had no homework due the next day. (Girl, 14, Washington; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 107)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These requests are modest and doable—and the complaints worth looking into! The gifted children cited above seek ways to capitalize on their knowledge while maintaining a sense of control over other elements of their lives. Are we ready to honor their requests by listening to the logic behind them?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217511427513">
<title>C #2: Complexity</title>
<p>Let us be honest: The biggest complaint most parents hear about school from their gifted children is that it is simply too easy. Day after day, gifted students seek information that is stimulating and new to them, and year after year, they are disappointed. When commenting on this dissatisfaction, gifted students can sound bumptious and rude—as in some of the comments below. However, if you take the time to get beneath the dissatisfaction and disappointment, you will find that all gifted children seek is an education commensurate with their abilities. Special treatment? No. Instructional equity? Yes. Give a listen:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Schools need to stop repeating the same thing year after year. I wish they would just move on. I wish the schools would just teach me at <italic>my</italic> level, not <italic>theirs</italic>. I wish I could have learned Latin starting in first grade, but I have to wait until high school. Why? (Girl, 11, Ohio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 57)</p>
<p>Kids who are more intelligent than others shouldn’t be stuck in a class teaching other kids stuff they have already grasped. We need to learn new and more challenging things. (Boy, 11, Kansas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 66)</p>
<p>If I could fix my school, I would make it faster instead of working on something for weeks. I would make the days shorter instead of just filling up my daydreaming tank. (Boy, 11, Iowa; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 74)</p>
<p>On a typical school day, I learn many different things just so I can get tested on them later to see if I was paying attention. (Boy, 13, Nevada; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 65)</p>
<p>My day: 35 minutes of boredom, 6 minutes of mild interest, and the rest of the period doing anything I can without a.) getting into trouble, b.) the teacher noticing me, or c.) aggravating anyone around me. When I get a subject of mild interest to me, I listen and do the work, getting patted on the head for my seemingly effortless results. In sum, a typical school day involves pain, a bit of isolation, and a lot of misery. (Girl, 14, Australia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 65)</p>
<p>My biggest challenge in school is not to become lazy. I see a lot of my friends who used to make really good grades but are now flunking because they won’t do work that is boring to them. (Boy, 15, Colorado; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 73)</p>
<p>Why do teachers assume at the beginning of the year that we have lost all knowledge from previous years? (Boy, 14, New Jersey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 82)</p>
<p>I am now in all accelerated classes in high school and they are a disappointment. They’re designed to prepare us for the ACT instead of teaching us anything interesting. (Girl, 15, Illinois; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 99)</p>
<p>I think that school does not understand my passion for knowledge. For example, we will go over Shay’s Rebellion but we won’t discuss how the Rebellion set a precedent for citizen political expression. We will discuss Sir Isaac Newton, but we will not examine how he influenced not only science in Europe, but also music, art, architecture and even literature. I am worried that I will never be stimulated academically until college. My older sister says “It will get better in high school,” but I am skeptical. When she says “harder” she means more work, not necessarily “more stimulating work.” However, I may be mistaken. (Boy, 14, New York; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 81)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It may be hard, as an educator, to not get defensive when gifted students make comments similar to these. However, their anger is based on years of disillusionment and dreams unfulfilled. This anger may be harsh, but it is neither unexpected nor inappropriate. Wouldn’t you have—haven’t you—felt the same way when your intelligence was neglected?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217511427513">
<title>C #3: Common Bonds</title>
<p>Not everything gifted students notice about school relates to academic content. Indeed, some of their most poignant memories have more to do with style than substance. When a teacher “gets it” and designs a classroom with their needs in mind, gifted kids know it in a heartbeat. And when gifted kids are encouraged to share their thoughts with other gifted students, the true essence of learning is created. Here are some examples.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Gifted programs are a good idea, especially if the teachers were gifted kids themselves. They (the teachers) could give some useful tips to their students about getting along with other kids. (Boy, 7, California; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 65)</p>
<p>I really like my gifted teacher. He seems to be the only teacher that really understands all of us and treats us as individuals. I know some of us have a goofy sense of humor, but with him, we are safe. It is OK to be ourselves. No other teacher seems to accept us this much. (Girl, 11, Ohio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 66)</p>
<p>A gifted teacher has a great sense of humor, a high IQ (so we can connect), a love of learning and a passion for life. (Girl, 10, Illinois; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 73)</p>
<p>A gifted teacher is someone as excited about teaching as I am about learning. (Boy, 11, Idaho; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 73)</p>
<p>My biggest challenge in school is dealing with teachers who run away from extremely bright children. Teachers should embrace students like these, rather than try to form them into 7th grade stereotypes. The next biggest challenge is to find students who can really be my friends. Most kids my age are into how tight their jeans are, not the human response to the unknown. (Boy, 13, New York; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 70)</p>
<p>The most challenging aspect during school is trying not to impress somebody by doing their work for them to show that you are “cool.” Being a gifted student can put a lot of pressure on you to fit in with others. (Girl, 14, Louisiana; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 70)</p>
<p>Every school should have a gifted program because gifted children don’t often share the interests of their peers. By gathering together other children like them, they develop a better understanding of themselves and can express their gifts (as odd as they may be) to <italic>people like</italic> themselves. (Girl, 15, New Jersey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 94)</p>
<p>I have a kindred spirit, a boy my age who lives 600 miles from me whom I visit once a year for a week or so. He is “terminally gifted” as I am and we are interested in the same things. If I could have had classes with kids like that, I think that is what heaven must be like. (Boy, 16, North Carolina; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 96)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead of titling this section “Common Bonds,” perhaps the term <italic>communion</italic> is more appropriate, as the children here who seek to break intellectual bread with others of similar abilities state their message loudly, clearly, and poignantly. Even better, sometimes it is a teacher who helps make this communion possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217511427513">
<title>C #4: Choice</title>
<p>No one argues that gifted students, as all learners, have specific learning styles, strengths, and preferences. Furthermore, many gifted students have mastered grade-level curriculum prior to many of their classmates. In the comments that follow, the issue of “choice” is paramount among these students’ concerns.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A perfect school day is when what the teachers are teaching is taught in a hands-on manner, not just sitting there while the teacher talks. (Girl, 11, New Jersey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 54)</p>
<p>I think playing games or making jokes or relating what we’re learning to something we like makes learning worthwhile. But when you do stuff straight out of a book, it is sooooo boring. (Girl, 11, Ohio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 58)</p>
<p>Teachers could give more options to gifted children. For example, my English teacher told my parents I was welcome to write about whatever I wanted whenever she had given the rest of the class a specific topic. Gifted kids don’t need as many limitations as children that aren’t. (Boy, 12, Maine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 63)</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time working on projects, painting murals and listening to music. I don’t learn anything and wish I could choose what to do. Instead, we get assigned projects and don’t do anything that interests me. (Girl, 9, Indiana; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 70)</p>
<p>Sometimes, creativity can get in the way at school. A lot of times, teachers expect one certain answer that they consider the “right” answer. When a gifted individual comes up with a creative answer or solution, teachers may not take the time to hear you out because they are tied into believing only their own answer. (Girl, 17, Maryland; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 80)</p>
<p>Many teachers are boring because they don’t care about the subject themselves, or they can’t make their kids care, so the kids act up and the teachers blame us. In specific terms, I guess that intelligent class discussions, out-of-class reading, and no pointless worksheets designed for testability make for an exciting education. (Girl, 14, Illinois; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 87)</p>
<p>In middle school, where I was happiest, I tested out of history and English. I was allowed to choose special projects. First, I wrote and directed a film on the French Resistance in WW II, engaging 27 classmates in the production. Also, I did a Civil War project and displayed memorabilia. I had a great leadership teacher who helped me to understand that I was valuable and kept me so busy by having me organize the Special Olympics for my school. When I was in his classes, it felt like home. (Boy, 16, California; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 88)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When “choice” is added to the educational equation, the end result can be something too often lacking in gifted children’s learning: relevance. It takes a brave teacher to loosen the reins from kids who just might gallop away at breakneck speed, but, in doing so, educators offer students the chance to shine.</p>

<title>C #5: Caring Teachers</title>
<p>John Steinbeck observed that his three most memorable teachers shared these qualities:</p>
<p>They all loved what they were doing. They did not tell—they catalyzed a burning desire to know. Under their influence, the horizons sprung wide and fear went away and the unknown became knowable. But most important of all, the truth, that dangerous stuff, became beautiful and very precious.</p>
<p>Steinbeck was right: for when adults recall their favorite teachers, what comes to mind first is seldom the subjects they taught, but rather, the persons they were. Gifted students, who are often keen observers of the human condition, may be especially adept at identifying teachers who truly love their craft and those who are there merely to earn a paycheck—at least that is the case with the following students.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Teachers need to treat students the way <italic>they</italic> want to be treated. We are not all the same, but that is how teachers treat us—like equals—but we are not! I just want to be treated like me! (Girl, 11, Ohio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2006</xref>, p. 62)</p>
<p>A gifted teacher is someone who enjoys teaching, who can get kids under control easily while still having fun, and who has ways to make the classroom “come alive” by their enthusiasm and knowledge. (Girl, 13, Maine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 101)</p>
<p>Gifted teachers are those who aren’t intimidated by kids who are smarter than they are. (Girl, 13, Texas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 101)</p>
<p>Teachers who are hard working and go out of their way to make sure kids are learning are gifted teachers. They have to be excited about what they are doing and they have to have a good attitude toward students. (Boy, 14, Texas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 102)</p>
<p>Teachers are gifted when they are able to learn every student’s personality. Teachers are also gifted if they are able to teach a disabled child without taking away from the learning opportunities of the rest of the class. (Boy, 15, Ohio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 103)</p>
<p>Being able to talk one-on-one with a student as well as to the whole class makes a teacher gifted. I have a teacher I would tell almost anything and I know she wouldn’t tell if I asked her not to. If students have confidence in their teachers, that is a MAJOR plus. (Boy, 16, Pennsylvania; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 104)</p>
<p>There are many people who can be teachers, but only certain people in the world are gifted at teaching. These few just seem able to express themselves and what they are trying to teach more easily. I think of these teachers as the ones that you remember when you get older. Not only do they teach you school lessons, they teach you life lessons. (Girl, 15, Oklahoma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 103)</p>
<p>Teachers could like their jobs enough to make us want to like ours. (Boy, 15, Nebraska; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427513">Schultz &amp; Delisle, 2007</xref>, p. 108)</p>

<p>Our gifted students rely on us for more than imparting information. Indeed, that may be one of our less important jobs. Instead, gifted students consider their best teachers as “life guides,” individuals who care enough to look beyond the confines of curriculum to reach students who truly and naturally want to learn. This is a notion as old as time and as fresh as tomorrow.</p>

<p>As I am putting the finishing touches on this article, changes are awhirl</p>
<p>( . . . again) in education circles. National core standards have been adopted in the majority of states. Federal <italic>Race to the Top</italic> funds are being doled out to states that promise fundamental changes in how students are taught and teachers are compensated. Alternative certification plans are being revised to accommodate a new generation of learners whose teachers need expertise beyond that offered in university pre-service education programs.</p>
<p>. . . and on and on and on. The endless cycle of change and improvement continues as it always has, as it always will.</p>
<p>However, unless our nation’s most capable students are consulted about their own suggestions for making our next generation of teachers competent, engaging, and caring, we will have omitted the most fundamental basic of all: listening to our consumers—our students—and then giving their ideas the legitimate consideration that they deserve. Reaching those we teach takes more than “book knowledge,” and the 5 Cs of Student Engagement seems like a fine place to start.</p>
