<p><bold>Background</bold>: To date, there has been little research into effective strategies for preventing the detrimental effects of stigma on the well-being of people with mental illness.</p>
<p><bold>Aim</bold>: The present research set out to identify adaptive strategies for dealing with the stigma of mental illness.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: On the basis of the responses of 355 people with mental illness (PWMI) a standardized questionnaire assessing 10 identity management strategies was developed. Participants also reported their personal experiences with stigma, depression and self-esteem.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that after controlling for depression and stigmatizing experiences, the strategies of community involvement, humour and positive ingroup stereotyping were related to higher self-esteem. Secrecy, selective disclosure and attempts at overcompensation or disproving stereotypes were related to lower self-esteem. The following strategies were unrelated to self-esteem: comparing the present social position of PWMI with that in the past, normalization of the illness within a medical model, information seeking and selective withdrawal.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: PWMI should be encouraged to seek support within their community and to develop a positive image of their ingroup.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Numerous sources confirm the existence of both structural and individual discrimination against people with mental illness (PWMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010392058">Angermeyer and Matschinger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010392058">Corrigan et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010392058">2004</xref>). It has often been argued that this stigma constitutes an additional burden for recovery because the individual has to cope with additional social stressors on top of their symptoms and the side effects of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010392058">Link et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764010392058">Perlick et al., 2001</xref>). Supporting this assertion, numerous studies find that mental illness stigma has a negative influence on the self-esteem and mental health of those affected by it (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010392058">Link, et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010392058">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010392058">Markowitz, 1998</xref>). In a society that stigmatizes PWMI, stereotypes are also learned by persons who later become mentally ill themselves. This can threaten their sense of self and result in self-stigma and a negative social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010392058">Corrigan and Watson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010392058">Major and O’Brien, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0020764010392058">
<title>Managing a stigmatized identity</title>
<p>Recent research emphasizes that people with a stigma are active managers of their situation and employ a number of strategies that help them to maintain a positive sense of self despite belonging to a low-status group (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764010392058">Miller and Kaiser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010392058">Miller and Major, 2000</xref>). Consequentially, stigma is now researched within a stress and coping framework that aims to identify adaptive strategies for responding to a stigmatized status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010392058">Miller and Major, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Thinking about how PWMI react to public stigma, past research often concentrated on self-stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010392058">Corrigan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010392058">Corrigan and Watson, 2002</xref>) and strategies of secrecy, social withdrawal, and attempts to educate others, all of which turned out to be ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010392058">Link et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010392058">1991</xref>). More recently, the effects of the cognitive strategies of blaming discrimination for negative personal outcomes, comparing oneself to other PWMI rather than to the general population, and devaluing domains where PWMI are stigmatized (e.g. employment), were investigated in a group of people with serious mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764010392058">Rüsch et al., 2009a</xref>). However, none of these strategies was related to better social functioning or better mental health. Nevertheless, some evidence both for PWMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764010392058">Rüsch et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764010392058">Verhaeghe et al., 2008</xref>) and for other stigmatized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764010392058">Frable et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764010392058">Tajfel and Turner, 1986</xref>) suggests that people who hold their group in positive regard, ascribe positive attributes to the group members and associate with them, experience better mental health. Hence, stigmatized groups seem to have developed effective strategies for dealing with their low status, which go beyond what has been researched to date for PWMI.</p>
<p>Discovering these beneficial strategies is the focus of the present study. It is suggested that people employ a number of different strategies to cope with the identity threat that arises from stigma. In this paper, these are called ‘identity management strategies’ (IMSs) to set them apart from coping strategies for acute events of discrimination, such as seeking social support after being harassed. The aim of using IMSs is either to reduce the likelihood of encountering discrimination or to improve personal resources for coping with stigma-related stressors. This study suggests that these strategies can be measured with standardized questionnaires, and the development of the respective measurement model is presented in Part I of this paper. In Part II, the usefulness of the newly developed scale for the prediction of self-esteem is tested. Previous findings that stigma experience predicts self-esteem even after controlling for depression are expected to be replicated. The IMSs are expected to make a contribution to the prediction of self-esteem that is independent of demographic variables (e.g. gender, age, education) and that does not differ substantially between different diagnostic groups.</p>

<title>Part I: Development of the IMS Scale</title>
<sec id="section4-0020764010392058">
<title>Pilot work</title>
<p>Items for the assessment of IMSs were developed with substantial input from PWMI and their accounts about their lives. In a qualitative pilot study, 17 participants with a history of mental illness talked about their experiences with stigma and their reaction to being mentally ill in individual structured interviews. Information about the study was distributed via different sources, including local self-help groups, the <italic>Bundesverband Psychiatrieerfahrene</italic> (a national psychiatry self-help umbrella organization), internet mailing lists, notices at the university and activists in anti-stigma work. Participants contacted the researcher if they were interested in participating. In order to ensure a diverse group of participants, their treatment histories reflected different illnesses (psychosis, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, borderline personality disorder, and panic disorder and agoraphobia) and levels of severity: four of the participants had never been treated in an inpatient setting. During the interviews, participants were asked about their own experiences with stigma and their reactions to those events, their strategy of information management, and their thoughts about being mentally ill. A number of questions were also included to test for the occurrence of strategies that have been reported in the general literature on stigma coping; these strategies were probed if they did not come up spontaneously in the course of the interview (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764010392058">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The interviews were transcribed and the individual narrative sequences were translated into items that could be answered on Likert scales. The item pool was refined with the input of researchers with experience in questionnaire development and three of the interview participants to ascertain that the items were understandable and adequately mirrored relevant experiences of PWMI. A preliminary version of the questionnaire was pilot-tested in an online convenience sample of 217 PWMI. Two exploratory factor analyses (one for cognitive and one for behavioural strategies) were used to obtain an initial outline of the factor structure and to determine if the empirically identified factors matched the qualitatively developed constructs they were intended to represent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764010392058">Table 1</xref>). This procedure reduced the pool to 47 items that constituted the preliminary version of the IMS Scale. The scale measured cognitive evaluations of the group of PWMI (e.g. endorsing positive stereotypes about the group) and behavioural reactions to being mentally ill (e.g. hiding one’s illness). All items were answered on a five-point scale. For the cognitive evaluations, the scale assessed the level of agreement with the statements and ranged from 1 = ‘not true at all’ to 5 = ‘exactly true’. For the behavioural strategies, the scale asked for the frequency of the behaviour from 1 = ‘never’ to 5 = ‘very often’.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using Mplus 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764010392058">Muthén and Muthén, 2006</xref>) for confirmatory factor analysis. The FIML algorithm was used to handle missing data. To develop the measurement model, 200 participants were randomly selected from the sample of 355. Because many participants had reported problems understanding an item that used the word ‘sarcasm’, this item was omitted from further analysis. Two exploratory factor analyses were then performed: one for cognitive and one for behavioural strategies. Items that did not show meaningful loadings or showed substantial cross-loadings on other factors (magnitude of the cross-loading at least half as high as the main loading) were omitted. A confirmatory factor analysis was then conducted with the same subsample of 200 participants to further refine the model by omitting items with substantial cross-loadings or correlating measurement errors. This procedure could not replicate the strategy of devaluation of the stigmatizer and led to the omission of 17 items from the analysis, so that the final scale contained 29 items. Apart from attempting to minimize the residuals, three fit indices were used to evaluate the appropriateness of the specifications in the confirmatory model: the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), which should be larger than 0.90, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), which is considered appropriate if it is less than 0.06, and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), which should be smaller than 0.08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764010392058">Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003</xref>). A good fit was obtained for the model with 10 intercorrelated IMSs with CFI = 0.966, RMSEA = 0.027 and SRMR = 0.055 (χ<sup>2</sup> = 378.653, df = 330, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0334).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020764010392058">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To avoid specifying the model to characteristics of this sample, the model obtained in the first sample was then cross-validated with the remaining 155 participants: χ<sup>2</sup> = 446.542 (df = 330, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), CFI = 0.881, RMSEA = 0.048 and SRMR = 0.065. Although a CFI just below 0.90 suggests an insufficient fit, careful inspection of the results and the residual matrix did not indicate any problems with the model. In light of the other fit indices and the dependency of CFI on sample size (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764010392058">Jackson, 2001</xref>), the cross-validation was considered to be successful. This final measurement model included 10 different IMSs for people with mental illness. The different strategies were only weakly intercorrelated (|r| = 0.01–0.40).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020764010392058">
<title>Scale structure</title>
<p>Coping strategies can be differentiated into problem-centred, emotion-centred, and defensive coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010392058">Greve and Strobl, 2004</xref>). Problem-centred strategies usually imply a specific behaviour, for instance working harder to overcome an obstacle, whereas emotion-centred strategies can include both behavioural strategies (e.g. looking for social support) and cognitive strategies (e.g. downplaying the importance of a stressful event). Defensive strategies aim at avoidance of the stressor, for instance by avoiding a certain environment.</p>
<p>The IMS Scale in this study included three defensive strategies: <italic>secrecy</italic> as the active attempt to keep the illness a secret by providing false information about diagnoses and appointments (e.g. ‘I pretend to have other appointments when I have an appointment with my therapist/psychiatrist’), <italic>selective disclosure</italic> to only those people who are seen as trustworthy (e.g. ‘I only talk about my mental health problems when I know people well enough’) and <italic>withdrawal</italic> from those who display stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours (e.g. ‘If people can’t deal with my illness, I break ties with them’).</p>
<p>The problem-focused strategies include <italic>normalization</italic> by emphasizing the equivalence of mental and physical illness (e.g. ‘Mental illnesses are illnesses like any others’), <italic>community involvement</italic> through association with other PWMI, often in projects that challenge current roles of patients in the psychiatric system (e.g. ‘I join meetings where service users, family members and professionals come together (trialogue)’), <italic>overcompensation</italic> by attempting to disprove stereotypes about PWMI after one’s status has been revealed (e.g. ‘When people know I have had psychiatric treatment, I try very hard to come across as normal in their presence’) and <italic>information seeking</italic> to ‘arm oneself with knowledge’ about one’s illness (e.g. ‘I read books about mental health topics’).</p>
<p>Finally, emotion-focused strategies include <italic>selective temporal downward comparison</italic> contrasting the situation of PWMI today and in the past (e.g. ‘Today, there are fewer reservations about people with mental illness than 20 years ago’), <italic>positive ingroup stereotyping</italic> presenting the ingroup as more authentic, sensitive or intelligent (e.g. ‘Mentally ill people are more caring than others’) and <italic>humour</italic> about one’s situation (e.g. ‘I look upon my illness with a grim sense of humour’).

<title>Results</title>
<p>To understand the influence of stigma and the different IMSs on self-esteem, a set of 10 hierarchical regression analyses, one for each IMS, were conducted. Because depression is known to influence self-esteem, depression was included in the first step of the analysis. The stigma experiences scale was included in the second step to assess whether stigma predicts self-esteem over and above the influence of depression. The IMS was then included in the third step as a further predictor. Finally, to assess whether the influence of the IMS depends on the intensity of stigma encountered, an interaction term between stigma and the respective IMS was included in the fourth step. All variables were <italic>z</italic>-standardized to facilitate interpretation. To check for outliers, the following control was used: Cook’s D to be smaller than the value of the <italic>F</italic>-distribution at df<sub>1</sub> = <italic>k</italic> + 1, df<sub>2</sub> = <italic>n – k</italic> – 1, <italic>α</italic> = 0.50 (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010392058">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). Cook’s D determines the influence of an observation by measuring the change in the parameter estimates caused by deleting each observation.</p>
<p>As expected, there was a negative influence of depression on self-esteem in the first step of the regression analysis (<italic>β</italic> = −0.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In the second step of the hierarchical regression analysis, people with a higher level of experienced stigma had significantly lower self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = −0.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), even after controlling for the influence of depression (<italic>β</italic> = −0.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>If IMSs worked as a shield against stigma experiences, there should have been a significant interaction between stigma experience and the IMS. In that case, the respective IMS should only be relevant for those people who actually encountered stigmatizing experiences in their lives, and should protect them from being hurt by those experiences. However, none of the interaction terms was significant, so it could be concluded that the IMSs did not work as a shield against stigma.</p>
<sec id="section18-0020764010392058">
<title>Which IMSs protect self-esteem?</title>
<p>Because the IMSs did not work as moderators between stigma experiences and self-esteem, the regression coefficients of self-esteem on the IMSs in step 3 of the hierarchical regression analyses can be interpreted. Six strategies were found to contribute significantly to the prediction of self-esteem over and above the effects of depression and intensity of stigma. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020764010392058">Figure 1</xref> provides a first overview of the standardized <italic>β</italic>-coefficients of the IMSs.</p>

</fig>
<p>Three IMSs were found to relate to higher self-esteem. First, those participants who endorsed positive ingroup stereotypes reported higher levels of self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Second, those who were involved in the community of PWMI and participated in group activities also reported higher levels of self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Finally, the largest effect was found for humour, with people who see their illness in a relaxed and humorous way also tending to have higher self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = 0.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>A significant relationship with self-esteem could not be established for four of the observed IMSs. Engaging in selective downward comparison of the current situation of PWMI with their situation in the past did not seem to be a productive strategy for enhancing self-esteem (β = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11). Similarly, searching for information was unrelated to self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = −0.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46). The strategy of embracing a normalizing perspective, emphasizing that a mental illness is an illness like any other, produced a marginally positive regression coefficient (<italic>β</italic> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09). Finally, the effect of withdrawing from those who displayed stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours was also marginally significant. People who tried to avoid stigma by avoiding its origin reported slightly lower levels of self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = −0.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08).</p>
<p>Three strategies were associated with lower self-esteem among those who embraced them. Both being very secretive (<italic>β</italic> = −0.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and being careful about when and to whom to reveal one’s illness (<italic>β</italic> = −0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were associated with significantly lower levels of self-esteem. Also, attempts to overcompensate by trying to disprove existing stereotypes about PWMI through personal behaviour were related to lower levels of self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = −0.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>When the 10 IMSs were included simultaneously in a regression analysis, secrecy, community involvement, positive ingroup stereotyping and humour remained significant predictors after controlling for the influence of depression and stigma experiences; the influence of overcompensation was only marginally significant, while selective disclosure was no longer a significant predictor of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020764010392058">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>With few exceptions, the results remained stable when gender, age and educational level were controlled for, respectively. However, there was an interaction between secrecy and age, with the correlation between the use of this strategy and lower self-esteem increasing with participants’ age (<italic>β</italic> = −0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The strategy of withdrawal is also associated with lower self-esteem if age was controlled for (<italic>β</italic> = −0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0020764010392058">
<title>Severity of illness</title>
<p>Two proxy variables were used to control for the severity of the illness. The first variable referred to the number of past inpatient treatment episodes; the second was the duration of illness based on the difference between current age and age at first treatment. Using hierarchical regression analyses as described above, the number of past inpatient treatment episodes was found not to influence the pattern of results, and there was no interaction between the IMSs and the number of past inpatient treatment episodes. When the duration of the illness was included in the equation, the negative regression coefficient of withdrawal was only marginally significant (<italic>β</italic> = 0.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07). No interaction was found between the IMSs and the duration of the illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0020764010392058">
<title>Diagnoses</title>
<p>To assess whether the effectiveness of the IMSs differs between diagnostic groups, four more sets of analyses were conducted with the largest diagnostic groups: depression, anxiety disorder, substance abuse and psychosis. For each diagnostic group a dichotomous variable was defined (0 = ‘no’, 1 = ‘yes’). It should be noted that 51% of the participants reported more than one diagnosis and are therefore included in more than one of the diagnostic groups. Depression, stigma, the respective IMS and the diagnostic category were included in the first step of the regression analysis, and the interaction term between the IMS and diagnosis was included in the second step. A significant interaction term would indicate that the influence of the IMS differed between those who reported the respective diagnosis and the rest of the participants.</p>
<p>When the self-reported diagnosis of depression was included, no significant effect on self-esteem was found, neither was there a significant interaction with any of the IMSs. Whether or not people reported a history of anxiety or panic disorder did not significantly affect self-esteem. However, a significant interaction was found with information seeking (<italic>β</italic> = 0.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and normalization (<italic>β</italic> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), suggesting that for people with an anxiety disorder, these strategies are related to higher self-esteem. Participants who reported problems with substance or alcohol abuse did not differ from the other participants concerning their levels of self-esteem. However, two significant interactions were found. First, the strategy of overcompensation seems to be related to especially low self-esteem for this group (<italic>β</italic> = −0.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Second, for people who reported problems of substance abuse, information seeking was found to be related to lower self-esteem (<italic>β</italic> = −0.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Significantly higher levels of self-esteem were found in individuals with a history of psychosis in this group (<italic>β</italic> = 0.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Three interactions were also found between IMSs and a history of psychosis. Significant interactions were found for selective temporal downward comparison (<italic>β</italic> = −0.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), normalization (<italic>β</italic> = −0.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and positive ingroup stereotyping (<italic>β</italic> = −0.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), indicating that the positive correlation between these strategies and self-esteem is smaller for people with psychosis than for other PWMI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine which IMSs PWMI use to deal with their stigmatized identity, and to examine the relationship between the IMSs and self-esteem. It was hypothesized that PWMI employ a number of different IMSs that can be measured with standardized questionnaires, and a new questionnaire was developed that allowed the assessment of 10 different IMSs. In addition to the previously known strategies of secrecy, selective disclosure and withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010392058">Link et al., 1989</xref>), the IMS scale allowed the assessment of behavioural strategies of community involvement, overcompensation, humour and information seeking, as well as the cognitive strategies of selective temporal downward comparison, positive ingroup stereotyping and normalization.</p>
<p>This study was able to replicate past findings that stigma experiences predict self-esteem even after depressive symptoms have been controlled for (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010392058">Link et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010392058">Markowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764010392058">Rüsch et al., 2006</xref>). This supports the assertion that stigma constitutes an additional burden to recovery and that the association between stigma and well-being cannot be explained by a general tendency toward negative thinking as a symptom of depression.</p>
<p>Next, the correlations of the specific IMSs with self-esteem over and above the influence of stigma and depression were examined. Partial support was found for Miller and Kaiser’s observation that defensive coping aimed at the avoidance of a stressor has a ‘poor track record’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764010392058">Miller and Kaiser, 2001</xref>: 80). Preventive efforts to reduce stigma by keeping the illness a secret and by being very careful about when and to whom to reveal it were associated with lower self-esteem. In line with that, there was a trend for an association between withdrawing from people who display stigmatizing attitudes and lower self-esteem. Finally, the problem-focused approach of overcompensation was also related to lower self-esteem. There are several explanations for these results. On the behavioural level, keeping the illness a secret reduces the ability to form ongoing friendships based on reciprocity and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010392058">Quinn, 2006</xref>) and therefore reduces the availability of social support. The same holds true for the strategy of withdrawal, which might also lead to smaller social networks. On the cognitive level, information management and overcompensation strategies both require constant self-monitoring and thus increase cognitive load as an additional stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764010392058">Smart and Wegner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764010392058">Steele, 1997</xref>). However, looking at the reverse causal path, it is also possible that people with lower self-esteem are less self-confident when it comes to talking about their mental illness.</p>
<p>The correlations of positive ingroup stereotyping, humour and community involvement with higher self-esteem suggest that a positive, active approach to dealing with mental illness is advantageous. This replicates findings that involvement with other equally stigmatized individuals is especially beneficial for people with concealable stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764010392058">Frable et al., 1998</xref>). The beneficial effects of mutual-help groups on symptoms have been established for quite some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010392058">Pistrang et al., 2008</xref>). The present findings suggest that this form of empowerment not only reduces symptoms, but may also help to improve self-esteem.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, the strategy of normalization of the illness within a medical model did not improve the sense of self of PWMI. This approach has been largely favoured by anti-stigma programmes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764010392058">Sartorius and Schulze, 2005</xref>) with the intention of reducing the responsibility and guilt attributed to PWMI. However, embracing a biological model also turned out to have negative effects for the perception of the dangerousness of PWMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764010392058">Jorm and Griffiths, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764010392058">Read et al., 2006</xref>). More research is clearly needed to understand the way in which beliefs about the causes of mental illness influence PWMI themselves as well as the general public.</p>
<p>Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764010392058">Verhaeghe and colleagues (2008)</xref>, who found that peer support is related to better self-esteem only for those individuals with few stigma experiences, no significant interaction was found between the frequency of stigma experiences and IMSs. Hence, it can be concluded that IMSs do not serve as a buffer between stigma experiences and self-esteem, but have their own independent influence on PWMI’s sense of self. This is consistent with the argument that IMSs do not unfold their impact in specific situations when discrimination occurs, but make an independent contribution to how PWMI view themselves.</p>
<p>Controlling for demographic influences like age, gender and educational background and for severity of the illness did not meaningfully change the findings. However, looking at differences between diagnostic groups, the strategy of informing oneself about mental illnesses appeared to be harmful for people with substance abuse, yet beneficial for people with anxiety disorders. This might be due to the different depiction of these illnesses in the media: whereas people with anxiety disorders might come across reassuring reports about how frequent their problems are and how good the prospects for treatment look, the opposite might be true for people with substance abuse disorders who may face discouraging statements about their outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section24-0020764010392058">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some limitations should be considered. As noted above, all diagnoses were based on participants’ self-reports and not on a standardized clinical interview that would guarantee higher validity. Second, the cross-sectional data do not allow causal inferences to be drawn. As mentioned above, it is also plausible that people with different levels of self-esteem chose different strategies to cope with their illness; experimental or longitudinal designs are needed to be able to establish causality. Finally, it cannot be determined whether the participants were representative of all people with mental illness or if they were different from those people who chose not to participate. Two statistical problems should also be noted. The effect sizes for the regression coefficients of the IMSs on self-esteem were rather small, typically only around 0.10 and despite the considerable number of 355 participants, this does not provide sufficient power to reliably detect such small effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010392058">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a number of analyses were conducted with the same data set, thus increasing the chance of obtaining random significant results. Hence, it is quite possible that the inconsistent findings concerning the harmfulness of withdrawal and selective disclosure are due to lack of statistical power.</p>

<sec id="section25-0020764010392058">
<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>Clinicians and PWMI themselves often face the question of how to deal with mental illness in terms of information management. This study replicated research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010392058">Link et al. (1991)</xref>, who found that keeping mental illness secret can have detrimental effects. However, an association was also found between lower self-esteem and the selective disclosure strategy that is often recommended by clinicians. So while this strategy might be associated with a reduced risk of becoming a target of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010392058">Quinn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764010392058">Schulze et al., 2009</xref>), it also involves some costs for the individual’s sense of self. Furthermore, although some strategies turned out to be related to lower self-esteem, it is conceivable that hiding one’s stigmatized status or attempting to disprove stereotypes might have positive consequences for other outcomes, for instance for success on the employment market. More research with designs that allow causal inferences is therefore needed before any substantiated recommendations can be given on this complex issue.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The positive effects that were found for community involvement provide empirical support for the widely reported positive effects of mutual/self-help programmes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010392058">Pistrang et al., 2008</xref>) for recovery from mental illness. It also seems advisable to encourage PWMI to think about their current situation with a sense of humour and to point out positive images that might also exist about this group. Although there is no wish to imply that the targets of prejudice were to blame for the negative effects of discrimination, there is confidence that the community of PWMI as a group possesses a great deal of power and resources to combat not only the negative effects of stigma but also stigma itself.</p>

<p>At the time of recruiting, 524 inpatients were present on the psychiatric wards. Of these, 445 (85%) met the inclusion criteria and 232 (52%) agreed to participate. The data of four participants had to be excluded from further analysis because of language problems (two participants) or because they only completed very few, selected items and yielded more than 50% missing values (two participants). Among those approached while using counselling services to find employment (<italic>n</italic> = 129), 54 (42%) chose to participate. For the other sources of recruitment, no information is available about the percentage who chose not to participate in the study.</p>
