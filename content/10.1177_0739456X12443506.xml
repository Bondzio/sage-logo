<p>In a perfect world, one might expect to find a smooth and symbiotic relationship between the realms of planning scholarship and planning practice. In that world, scholars would regularly generate new knowledge regarding the nature of human settlements and the processes by which they are planned. Practitioners, in turn, would eagerly consume that knowledge and incorporate it into their daily professional activities, while simultaneously generating still more fodder for research.</p>
<p>In our less-than-perfect world, of course, the roads connecting scholarship and practice are somewhat bumpier. Indeed, the two sets of activities sometimes appear to reflect two entirely different worlds, each with its own distinctive culture. Academia values (and, more importantly, rewards) research that leads to publication in scholarly books and journals. The world of planning practice, on the other hand, features political and professional realities that seem to leave little time and energy for immersion in the writings of university-based scholars. Reflecting these different orientations, practitioners are frequently heard to grumble that the field’s major journals provide little of relevance to their work; scholars, on the other hand, often express the wish that practitioners would pay more attention to the insights they generate!</p>
<p>In reality, the engagement of planning scholarship with planning practice is far more complex and nuanced. Planning scholarship takes many forms, and those forms vary widely in their relevance to practice. Some scholars are deeply interested in practice and structure their research agendas accordingly; some have interests that take them in other directions. And yes, some practitioners regularly read scholarly books and journals. Others, for a variety of reasons, do very little in this regard, preferring to acquire new information and insights largely from interaction with other practitioners.</p>
<p>But what does all of this add up to? What can be said, in a more robust and systematic way, about the current relationship between planning scholarship and planning practice? Is there indeed a problem? If so, what can, and should, be done about it?</p>
<p>This symposium is intended to address these questions in a variety of ways. The coming together of the five papers was largely accidental. Nearly all came to <italic>JPER</italic> without coordination; the topic of engaging planning scholarship with practice must have been (and indeed is) on the minds of many. Heather Campbell’s paper is a good starting point; she provides a perceptive and provocative examination of the relationship between knowledge and action. How, she asks, do we translate knowledge about the world into decisions regarding the actions that should be taken? Or, as she words it, how do we move from <italic>is</italic> to <italic>ought</italic>? Analysis alone does not answer this question; additional steps are needed, and she describes the nature of those steps.</p>
<p>Intended primarily as advice for doctoral students and junior faculty members, Matti Siemiatycki’s paper presents a conceptual framework identifying five different roles that planning scholars customarily assume: the scholar as “independent outsider,” as “public planner,” as “contractor,” as “community-based planner,” and as “activist.” Each is described in detail, complete with its implications for the kinds of goals being pursued, expected audiences, sources of conflict, and even career advancement.</p>
<p>Ann Forsyth’s Commentary also features a classification system. Hers is structured somewhat differently, however, describing four different “cultures” in planning research. These cultures are differentiated by the kinds of problems on which the research is focused, whether work at the “scientific frontier,” dealing with “practical applications,” with “assessment of practice,” or with “the enduring questions of planning.” She notes that conflict—or at least a lack of mutual respect—often characterizes relationships between the cultures, and she argues for greater mutual tolerance.</p>
<p>Bent Flyvbjerg is a strong advocate for—and exemplar of—planning research that has an impact on public policy. Using his research on “megaproject planning” as an example, he focuses on the use of mass media as a strategy for rendering one’s research influential in the public decision-making arena. He describes what he terms “phronetic planning research,” in which “strategic collaboration with media” is an explicit aspect of the methodology, and offers a number of suggestions for those who are attracted to this mode of research.</p>
<p>Finally, Robert Beauregard addresses the symposium’s theme from another angle, arguing that planning scholarship, and theory in particular, all too frequently ignore the importance of the “things,” or physical objects, that constitute the substance of planning activity. Instead, we tend to focus on relationships among human actors—important, to be sure, but insufficient for a full understanding of the planning process. “Things”—a number of examples are presented, ranging from apartment buildings and parking spaces to site plans and computers—“shape planning practice” and are thus worthy of more attention. For purposes of this symposium, of course, the implication is that more attention to the physical objects central to professional activity might indeed help to narrow the gap between scholarship and practice.</p>

<title>A Final Word</title>
<p>With this issue, our term as co-editors comes to an end. It has been an excellent experience for both of us. There are numerous people to be thanked: the many fine planning (and planning-related) scholars who have produced a steady stream of papers for <italic>JPER</italic>’s consideration; the army of hard-working reviewers, without whom the entire enterprise would be impossible; Luci Yamamoto, our Managing Editor, whose diligent efforts on behalf of <italic>JPER</italic> have made our tasks easier in so many ways; Katrin Anacker and Seymour Mandelbaum, our Book Review Editors, without whom no <italic>JPER</italic> issue would be complete; ACSP’s officers, who have been fully supportive at every turn; our Editorial Board, whose members have truly cared for and supported our efforts; Bruce Stiftel and Chris Silver, who volunteered many hours of otherwise summer vacation time to help lead <italic>JPER</italic>’s writing workshops; and the staff of SAGE, who have minded the fine prints so professionally. We also want to thank each other; it has been a smooth operation, with virtually no disagreements!</p>
<p>Our best wishes go to Subhro Guhathakurta and Nancey Green Leigh, <italic>JPER</italic>’s incoming co-editors. We know they will continue to take the Journal onward and upward! It is gratifying to see that they, like all of our predecessors, will devote the time and stewardship needed to ensure the continued growth of <italic>JPER</italic>’s community of scholars.</p>
