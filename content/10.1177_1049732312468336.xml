<p><italic>Method Meets Art</italic> is a cornerstone book within the burgeoning field of arts-based research. For the novice, it would be my recommended first read. Leavy succinctly maps a range of epistemological issues and methodological directions that serve to introduce the complex landscape of this research culture. For the veteran, it summarizes from where we have come, articulating the debates that have taken place throughout the past 20+ years, and provides a foundation upon which future projects can be built. By pairing discussions on six arts-based genres—narrative inquiry, poetry, music, performance, dance/movement, and visual arts—with current research literature, Leavy adroitly blends the theory of arts-based research with its practice, enabling this community of researchers to appreciate the complex interplay of form and content when generating, interpreting, and disseminating any research data. The book is aptly named: <italic>Method Meets Art</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312468336">
<title>The Foundation</title>
<p>In Chapter 1 Leavy lays the epistemological foundation, providing a summary of positivistic, interpretive, and artistic research paradigms. Leavy is able to clarify their distinctiveness and value. Each provides a lens through which to view the world and each has its own internal legitimacy. She claims, “The kind of dialogue promoted by arts-based practices is predicated upon <italic>evoking meanings</italic>, not denoting them” (p. 14, emphasis in original). Throughout the chapter, Leavy provides a rationale for arts-based research while avoiding the temptation to critique other paradigms. In so doing, she models an acceptance of a plurality of research approaches, with each having its own internal consistency and rigor.</p>
<p>In the chapter she discusses concepts of truth, knowledge, authenticity, trustworthiness, ethics, beauty, aesthetics, and quality, among others. She fears not to ask the important questions regarding the value of this genre: “How does this work make one feel? What does the work evoke or provoke? What does the work reveal?” (p. 17). Quoting Leggo (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312468336">Sinner, Leggo, Irwin, Gouzouasis, &amp; Grauer, 2006</xref>), she reframes the debate about quality: “The question shifts from <italic>“Is this good arts-based research?”</italic> to <italic>“What is this arts-based research good for?”</italic> (p. 17, emphasis in original). Although invitational, Leavy encourages those wishing to employ an arts-based approach not to dabble with the art form but to develop a rich understanding of the genre being employed.</p>
<p>In total, the chapter demonstrates respect for the arts, for research, and for hybrid arts-based methods. Not only does it set the stage for an exploration of a variety of arts-based approaches, the chapter is useful for all researchers regardless of paradigm, as it provides valuable epistemological and methodological insights into the practice of research in general. The chapter is well researched, containing references to the many pioneers in arts-based research.</p>
<p>Because Chapters 2 through 7 are devoted to a specific genre of arts-based research, a review of each follows. These chapters are divided into two sections, with Part 1 of each devoted to specific elements of the methodology and Part 2 containing an article written by an arts-based research practitioner. This makes the book the best of both worlds. It is much more than an edited book with chapters written by others, as the first part of each chapter is an in-depth theoretical and methodological discussion. The second part, while being only one specific example of many, does provide a rich representation of the methodology in action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732312468336">
<title>Act 1: Narrative</title>
<p>Strategically, Leavy introduces arts-based research with a written genre: narrative. Music employs the medium of sound, dance the medium of gesture with music, the visual arts the medium of image, and drama encompasses sound, gesture, image, and the spoken word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312468336">McLeod, 1987</xref>). By starting with arts-based genres that employ the written word, Leavy is able to pedagogically move her readers from what is more familiar to what is progressively more out of the norm. The sequencing of the chapters recognizes that arts-based research, while growing in acceptance, is still on the margins. At this present time the greater research community has to be guided to an appreciation of other forms of discourse that employ a range of media. Beginning with “word” is an appropriate choice.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, she links narrative with its other siblings within qualitative research, i.e., case study, biography, autobiography, and autoethnography. Building upon these, Leavy skillfully lays a path from words being used in a positivist fashion with the assumption of validity and trustworthiness in representation to an epistemological stance in which “the use of expressive, contextualized, and vernacular forms of language; the promotion of empathic understanding of the lives of characters; and the creation of a virtual reality” (quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312468336">Kim, 2006</xref>; p. 28) are encouraged and supported. Eventually, Leavy leads to the potential of fiction as a means of problematizing representation. While Leavy does not make a direct connection to Denzin’s concept of “truthful fiction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312468336">Denzin, 1989</xref>, p. 23), other qualitative researchers would support her position on representation, including Banks and Banks, who claimed,<disp-quote>
<p>The opposite of fact isn’t fiction but something like error. The opposite of fiction isn’t truth but something like objectivity or actuality. Any genre or piece of writing that claims to be objective, to represent the actual, is a writing that denies its own existence, as David Lock said. In other words, no text is free of self-conscious constructions: no text can act as a mirror to the actual. . . . The imposition of fiction into the divide between fact and error doesn’t negate the possibility of a real world: all it does is recognize the impossibility for others to be objective. (1998, p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like all six genre chapters, following the discussion about the narrative genre are short sections that contain (a) discussion questions and activities; (b) suggested readings, Web sites, and journals with brief annotations; and (c) the references. The chapter concludes with a representative example of narrative research, a difficult thing to do, as Leavy clearly articulates that there and many approaches to narrative. The exemplar, <italic>What Kind of Mother . . . ?</italic>, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312468336">Karen Scott-Hoy (2009)</xref>, is a both a descriptive and reflective piece about one’s reaction to the events of “911” (September 11, 2001) and its hypothesized aftermath. It is thoughtfully written and brings the reader into the lifeworld of the author as she tries to make sense of the event through her perspective as a mother. It is in keeping with Leavy’s assertion that “[t]hese reflexive writings seek to artistically reveal essence and create resonance between the writer and reader” (p. 51).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312468336">
<title>Act 2: Poetry</title>
<p>Chapter 3 moves from prose to poetry, extending the aesthetic dimensions of arts-based research even further. Leavy claims that poetry “challenges the fact–fiction dichotomy and offers a form for evocative presentation of data” (p. 63). Leavy understands the complex relationship between form and content, the represented and the representation, and the medium and the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312468336">McLuhan, 1967</xref>). She writes,<disp-quote>
<p>The representation of data in poetic form is not simply an alternative way of presenting the same information; rather, it can help the researcher evoke different meanings from the data, work through a different set of issues, and help the audience receive the data differently. (p. 64)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The medium is the message, and each genre, with its own frame, structure, and syntax, produces a different type of story. Richardson claimed,<disp-quote>
<p>Whenever we write science, we are telling some kind of story, or some part of a larger narrative. Some of our stories are more complex, more densely described, and offer greater opportunities as emancipatory documents; others are more abstract, distanced from lived experience, and reinscribe existent hegemonies. Even when we think we are not telling a story, we are, at the very least, embedding our research in a metanarrative. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312468336">1990</xref>, p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chapter 3 could be considered required reading for all beginning qualitative researchers, as it begins to problematize all research by addressing head-on the complexities of representation. In so doing, it demonstrates the importance of making explicit the epistemological and methodological frames of the research.</p>
<p>The chapter provides a brief history of poetry, noting some of the key players. Missing is the pioneering work with found poetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312468336">Butler-Kisber, 2002</xref>) and the early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312468336">Sullivan (2000)</xref>, but one cannot be expected to cover all of the genealogy in a chapter. Leavy does not claim breadth or inclusivity; rather, the chapter and the book provide an introduction and invitation to the growing library stacks of arts-based research. Page 83 provides a useful chart from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312468336">Faulkner (2005)</xref> that lists “scientific,” “artistic,” and “poetic” criteria. While a possible false separation among the three can be debated, as some would contest that arts-based research is scientific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312468336">Barone, 2007</xref>), the lists do articulate some distinctions.</p>
<p>Cynthia Cannon Poindexter’s example, <italic>Research as Poetry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312468336">2009</xref>), begins with a discussion of the methodology before providing the poem and ends with a conclusion. Such an approach is problematic, as is all research framing. The pro is that framing makes the process explicit; the con is that the prose confounds the poetic representation by explaining it. I take more of a middle-ground stance. If all forms of representation are problematic, an integration of expressing and explaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312468336">Reason &amp; Hawkins, 1988</xref>) might better elucidate the salient points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312468336">
<title>Act 3: Music</title>
<p>Unfortunately, music is the weakest chapter in the book, and I would have preferred that it would have appeared later in the sequence. Its weakness comes not from the book itself but from the lack of research being conducted through the medium of sound (music). The chapter provides a good discussion of the role of music in society and its ability to evoke emotion, and accompanied with words can be a political force that “can subvert and resist stereotypical, complacent group thinking (false consciousness), and therefore has resistive capabilities” (pp. 102-103). Connections between social science research and music are made, but these connections are primarily the role music plays “within the larger cultural context” (p. 105). Leavy cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468336">Bresler’s (2007)</xref> work, encouraging qualitative researchers to think musically through the use of musical metaphors (form, rhythm, dynamics, timbre, melody, polyphony, and harmony). Leavy recommends that qualitative researchers explore how these terms can be used in a written format, but the use of actual sounds and musical compositions is missing.</p>
<p>Leavy then moves to Jenoure’s work with <italic>musical portraiture</italic> and <italic>performance collage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468336">Jenoure, 2002</xref>, emphasis in original). While discussed, one is left with the impression that words are still the primary medium and that the music was included to fill the “unfinished” (p. 109) spaces. Leavy admittedly claims, “Although music has a role in social science—one that has not yet been fully realized—there are limitations via music as well” (p. 117). Still, it was necessary to include the chapter. It is an historical record of the present state and a steppingstone to future research. Daykin’s example, <italic>The Role of Music in Arts-Based Qualitative Inquiry</italic>, provides the next stone. She recognizes that, “While music may be incapable of generating direct semantic and semiotic meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468336">2009</xref>, p. 127), it heralds the value of messy texts that
<disp-quote>
<p>avoid the suggestion of linearity and coherence where these may not exist. Furthermore, such texts offer the ability to accommodate multiple identities and voices. Messy texts therefore engage with multiple meanings, covering the whole without invoking totality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468336">2009</xref>, p. 126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468336">Daykin (2009)</xref> clearly articulates a fundamental flaw of the written word. When we communicate with words, we assume denotation and ignore the many connotations that we, as senders, may have, that not only our receivers may not have, but may also have different connotations. Music, and the arts in general, works with metaphors with the recognition that the readers’, viewers’, and listeners’ responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312468336">Rosenblatt, 1978</xref>) will vary. There is no assumption that the message sent would ever be the message received. The weakness of the medium is its strength, as it makes explicit that communication though its medium is problematic.</p>
<p>Daykin describes her own research, in which she asks her participants to “offer particular music that is meaningful to them in the context of the themes emerging from the research interview” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468336">2009</xref>, p. 131). This is a good example of employing the musical knowledge of others to inform their thoughts. Still, I am left searching for sound. Perhaps it is because the medium of sound is difficult to reproduce on the printed page? The book does contain stories, poems, scripts, choreographic descriptions, and black and white photos, but no sounds.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468336">Daykin (2009)</xref> refers to a workshop that she had taken from me at the <italic>Fifth Advances in Qualitative Methods Conference</italic> in Edmonton in 2004. There, I passed out Orff musical instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312468336">Orff, 1977</xref>). There were shakers, drums, bells, hollow wooden tubes, and a variety of other percussion instruments that played only a single note. The participants were invited to simultaneously experiment with their respective instrument, exploring the variety of sounds that it could make. Cacophony ensued as they “played.” They were then asked to recall the events of the day from the manner in which they woke up to the point of their arrival at the workshop. Then, individually, they played their day to those gathered. Feelings of surprise, fatigue, being rushed, and at peace, among others, were evoked through the volume and pace of the presentation. Those listening laughed and nodded as they resonated with the sounds. The session demonstrated how music could “cover the whole without invoking totality” (Leavy, p. 126).</p>
<p>During a class in curriculum theory, a student of mine assembled his jazz band and composed three musical scores inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312468336">Aoki’s (2005)</xref> three curriculum orientations. Recursively, he used music to analyze the literature and the literature to generate music. The piece is referred to in an article of mine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312468336">Norris, 2008</xref>), and can be actually heard by going to the Web site. Modern technology has much to offer in assisting music in achieving its vital role in research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312468336">
<title>Act 4: Performance Studies</title>
<p>Chapter 5 opens with a quote from Denzin: “The performance text is the single most powerful way for ethnography to recover yet interrogate the meanings of lived experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312468336">1997</xref>, pp. 94-95). Leavy is convinced that “performance-based methods can bring research findings to life” (p. 135) that can convey “academic scholarship to a wider audience” (p. 14). While a number of approaches to performance studies are discussed, Leavy makes a clear distinction between script and performance. A script can be disseminated in an academic journal or book using this literary genre without the intension of performance. Therefore, it is important to note the distinction between the two. Later, in the example section, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312468336">Conrad (2009)</xref> provides a script of improvisational scenes based on her doctoral research. She tried to “remain true to the substance of our work, and tried to capture the spirit of the interactions the scripted descriptions depict” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312468336">2009</xref>, p. 171). While these scenes were improvised “in house,” Conrad’s rescripting was for literary, not performance purposes. In comparison, the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312468336">Gray (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312468336">Mienczakowski (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312468336">Norris (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312468336">2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312468336">Saldaña (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312468336">2005</xref>) were all scripted and brought to a series of public performances. Regardless of this distinction, both approaches provide greater variety for the qualitative researcher.</p>
<p>Leavy also makes process and product distinctions among those that are performed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312468336">Saldaña (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312468336">2005)</xref> usually employs a traditional ethnographic approach, translating the data and literature into a script that culminates with performances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312468336">Gray (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312468336">Mienczakowski (1995)</xref> work with their research participants to write and perform their life experiences on the stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312468336">Norris (2009)</xref> uses a form of playbuilding to assist Actor/Researcher/Teachers (A/R/Tors) to research social issues. In this participatory approach the audience members interact with the performance and rewrite the scenes based upon their experiences, thus making live theatre a form of dialogic research dissemination.</p>
<p>In most cases, the discussed performances took a political and/or pedagogical role, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312468336">Denzin (2003)</xref> recommends for all qualitative research. The plays were written and performed to the following, among others:</p>
<list id="list1-1049732312468336" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Be “at the forefront of discussions about hierarchy, collaboration, authority, disclosure, voice, and reflexivity in the knowledge-building process” (p. 148)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“[E]nable the audience to learn about the experience of this particular illness from the perspective of the research participants” (p. 150)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make “explicit the struggles—personal, epistemological, theoretical, practical, and so forth” (p. 152)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“[A]llow silenced persons a space for expression” (p. 156)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allow “for the continued negotiation of meaning” (p. 156)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Leavy recognizes that arts-based research performances go well beyond providing factual information. She believes it has “the potential to continue to cultivate epistemological, theoretical, and methodological innovation” (p. 157).</p>
<p>Conrad provides an example of her research with at-risk youth in a rural community “that is both participatory and performative, presents alternative ways to engage participants in doing research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312468336">2009</xref>, p. 163). Using a “popular theater” format, she assists them in “identifying issues of concern, analyzing current conditions and causes of a situation, identifying points of change, and analyzing how change could happen and/or contributing to the actions implied” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312468336">Prentki &amp; Selman, 2000</xref>, p. 8). The script she provides is an example of a participatory form of theater in which the dramatic action is interrupted and discussed—in this case, the decision to provide money for some “stuff.” Her participants used drama as a means to articulate the social forces that they believed were placed upon them and to reflect on their implications: “The scripts are meant to be expressive and evocative rather than just being explanatory” (Conrad, p. 171), leading the participants to in-depth conversations. Conrad’s is a fitting example of the pedagogical and political purposes of performance. As a process, it is pedagogical in that it assists in a reconceptualization about one’s life, and political in that it gives voice to those involved.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732312468336">
<title>Act 5: Dance and Movement</title>
<p>There has been resurgence in the interest of dance as made evident by a number of popular reality television dance shows. One primarily focuses on the techniques of ballroom, and another contains much choreography that is based on life experiences, the betrayal of a friend, spousal abuse, dealing with cancer, and going off to war. The choreographers draw from the things they know, find appropriate music, and work with the dancers to bring the feelings to life. The audiences and judges are moved, sometimes to tears. Could not such a process be considered research? <italic>Science Now</italic> announces annual “Dance your PhD” contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312468336">Bohannon, 2011</xref>), with candidates across many disciplines presenting entries. Dance is becoming popular as a legitimate way of knowing, and supports Leavy’s claim that “[t]he transcendent and consciousness-raising capacities of dance can be harnessed by qualitative researchers to build methods practices congruent with related research purposes” (p. 181).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like music, the use of dance as research, although somewhat better, still remains scant. Leavy laments that “the low status dance has historically received in academic research mirrors the low status dance enjoys relative to other arts” (p. 182). Chapter 6, like the music chapter, contains discussions about dance research, building an argument for dance “as” research. Referring to Stinson’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312468336">2004</xref>), Leavy believes that “dance teaches a person to feel from the inside, and correspondingly how to use the body as a source of knowledge and locus of meaning” (p. 184). Leavy also touches upon “expressive therapies that can be both <italic>healing</italic> and <italic>validating”</italic> (p. 184, emphasis in original), and cites research that links dance with self-esteem. While a convincing argument is made that the body is (a) itself a source of knowledge, and (b) an expressive communication instrument, the discussions focus primarily on the value of dance for the person and society.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few more methodological examples in the dance chapter than there are in the one on music. Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312468336">Freedman (1991)</xref>, Leavy asks, “Although Freedman’s study centers primarily on dance as data and not as a methodological practice, how can the techniques employed in her study serve methodological practice?” (p. 187). Leavy is well aware that dance as method is in its preliminary stages, but carefully lays groundwork for future research. She discusses studies of interpretive skills in dance, leading the way to how dance is a form of communication. Referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312468336">Snowber (2002)</xref>, Leavy writes that “dance is an expression of our bodies and bodily knowledge and is therefore a valid method for exploring and researching data” (p. 188). Picard’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312468336">2000</xref>) moves closer to dance “as” methodology by asking women to “share what was most meaningful in their lives” (p. 189) through creative movement. Through the use of stimulated recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312468336">Tuckwell, 1980</xref>), participants watch the video-recorded dance piece commenting on the product and the process. The women reported self-discovery, the value of the process, and validated this form of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312468336">1980</xref>, p. 190).</p>
<p>Leavy concludes by discussing the issue of representation through the works of arts-based researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312468336">Bagley and Cancienne (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312468336">Blumenfeld-Jones (2002)</xref>. Blumenfeld-Jones recognizes that while dance is generated by the meanings of the researcher/choreographer/dancer, “art necessarily invites several interpretations at once” (Leavy, p. 191). Cancienne choreographed and performed a dance based upon Bagely’s interview data with families with special needs. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312468336">Saldaña’s (2003)</xref> ethnodrama, which represents data through theater, they used traditionally generated data through interviews and represented it through dance. Being familiar with the works of both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312468336">Cancienne and Snowber (2009)</xref>, I was delighted to find their joint piece as the chosen exemplar. They, along with Donald Blumenfeld-Jones and Carl Bagley, have been leaders in dance “as” research. While the field consists of many other dance researchers, most have focused primarily on researching the art form, dance, not its role in arts-based research.</p>
<p>Leavy chose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312468336">Cancienne and Snowber (2009)</xref> wisely. They refer to themselves as “moving researchers” (p. 198) and compare the art of choreography with the research act: “The choreographer/performer has long known that the choreographic process is one of sorting, sifting, editing, forming, making, and remaking; it’s essentially an act of discovery” (p. 198). They recognize that “[h]ow we conceptualize the body intellectually is different from how we experience through dance the living, breathing, pulsing body from the inside out” (p. 199). They label their work as phenomenological, and I could not agree more. They communicate the lived experience by actually living it, moving (pun intended) research from epistemology to ontology. Dance is a corporeal way of knowing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312468336">Cancienne and Snowber (2009)</xref> reflect on her piece, <italic>Women’s Work</italic>, that explored the social constructions of gender. She describes her artistic rationale, the product, and the underpinning philosophy. Lines are blurred between data and dance, leaving one asking, “Cannot all dance that examines the human condition be considered research?” Cancienne believes that
<disp-quote>
<p>[c]horeography and self-reflexive writing (as shown in this article) allow me to move beyond the constraints of academic writing: By recognizing the culture of my childhood, I can more effectively communicate my research findings while illustrating my ideas and findings to a scholarly audience. “Women’s Work” is one tapestry of childhood influences that I bring to the writing table as an arts-based researcher whose place of discovery is centered in self. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312468336">2009</xref>, p. 206)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My only regret is that <italic>Women’s Work</italic> has only been provided as a partial written description. I long to see the piece performed.</p>
<p>I was, however, fortunate enough to actually observe a performance piece by Snowber and Gerofsky associated with their published article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312468336">1998</xref>). They performed the mathematics of dance and the dance of mathematics, blurring the art/science divide that Leavy discusses in Chapter 8. Snowber discusses this piece in this chapter, claiming that “[t]he dancer catches glimpses of the inexpressible, unknowable elements of lived experience and gives voice to the concern of both mathematicians and dancers” (p. 207). I, as an audience member who had taken graduate courses in statistics, can testify that I never really understood mathematics (as if I do now) until that performance. Snowber claims that she was “surprised to find how much a relationship there was to math and my own background in choreography . . . how deeply embedded it is in the workings of my embodied self. I could make geographic shapes with my body and physically ‘understand’ those shapes” (p. 207). She clearly articulates the importance of embodied knowing and its value to research.</p>

<title>Act 6: The Visual Arts</title>
<p>Presently, the most prolific of the arts-based research genres that use image, gesture, and sound is the visual arts. Perhaps it is because it is often an individual endeavor requiring less collaboration with others, providing a flexibility that those in the performing arts are not afforded. Perhaps it is because the visual is more easily transferred to pages than actual sounds or movements. Regardless of which is the case, this form dominates much of the arts-based research literature.</p>
<p>Leavy begins with the acknowledgment that “visual imagery does not represent a window onto the world, but rather a created perspective” (p. 215). Such can be said of all research, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312468336">Richardson (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312468336">Banks and Banks (1998)</xref> claimed. All research is framed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468336">Goffman, 1974</xref>) by a particular point of view and the medium in which it is represented, whether it is word, number, image, gesture, and/or sound. Even photographs, which appear to “capture” the moment, are constructed realities that involve many artistic decisions. As Leavy claims, “As noted throughout this book, all art regardless of medium is a product of time and place in which it is created, as well as the individual artist who is an embodied actor situated within the social order” (p. 217). There can be no truth, only point of view.</p>
<p>Leavy first links visual imagery to anthropological approaches that use still and moving cameras to record data, thus unearthing some of the early artifacts of arts-based research. Even biologists used drawings to depict the human body, the cosmos, and flora and fauna. Naturalists need to draw well. The visual has a longstanding tradition in research. Leavy claims that the study of art as cultural artifacts can reveal much about a particular time and place, and can be used to identify “identity struggles and social power” (p. 218). Although not referenced, the link to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312468336">Berger’s (1972)</xref> study on how women have been framed through art is an obvious one. Her question, “How can visual art reify or challenge stereotypes?” (p. 219), is an appropriate one. This applies to the analysis of existing photographs and is a challenge to the researcher who plans to take photographs. The lens can be an implicit framing device that also requires analysis. Leavy spends a few pages exploring <italic>Visual Art as a Method of “Aesthetic Intervention”</italic> (p. 219, emphasis in original), moving research to an act of social responsibility.</p>
<p>Referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312468336">Holm (2008)</xref>, Leavy articulates three types of visual images: “(1) subject-produced images, (2) researcher-produced images, and (3) preexisting images” (p. 217). These are important distinctions for arts-based researchers, as they indicate point of view and the tacit power structures embedded within the data. She encourages all researchers to include the visual as part of their research.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many visual art forms are neither discussed nor mentioned, yet their use in research is implied holistically. To include all would be well beyond the scope of this book. Leavy does include a discussion of one marginal art form: collage. Referring to the collages of Crowe, she claims that “visual art can alter our understanding of identity, such as gender identity, while also speaking to the larger dynamic sociohistorical context in which our evolving identities develop” (p. 226). Crowe’s collage <italic>Doll Cake</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312468336">2009</xref>) is on the cover of the book.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312468336">Jongeward’s (2009)</xref> <italic>Visual Portraits: Integrating Artistic Process Into Qualitative Research</italic>, is a strong example. Jongeward clearly articulates the rationale behind her arts-based research, describing “how [she] made visual portraits to represent the uniqueness of each research participant” (p. 239). She first describes a teaching process in which she asks the participants to make marks on paper based on words with strong emotions, such as <italic>anger</italic> and <italic>peacefulness</italic>. She then makes a link from pedagogy to research: “Artists engage in experimental inquiry, finding new ways to explore knowledge and meaning as they create” (p. 241). Like interview data, could not these lines be considered data? I am again left challenging the hegemony of word and number as the only media of research communication. Constructed metaphorical images that are made by research participants contain a type of data that words and numbers miss. We must widen our research perspectives, and Jongeward’s work provides a possible route to explore.</p>
<p>Leavy then discusses the use of visual portraits in research: “The idea to create visual portraits as an alternative way of interpreting and representing my research emerged unexpectedly. I was working on data analysis” (p. 241). She describes her works: “In one portrait, my guiding idea was the synthesis of a geometric pattern with a spontaneous visual image” (p. 242). Jongeward provides black and white photographs of her work, and explains her thinking behind each piece. For those who require the explicitness of word, this assists in demonstrating the implicit rigor of arts-based research. She summarizes this research with a list of five ways in which artistic process supported the research (pp. 248-249):</p>
<list id="list2-1049732312468336" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Integrity of the researcher as artist; artist as researcher</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coherence between visual portraits and the research</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intimacy of relatedness between researcher and participants</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complementarity of visual portraits and data analysis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complementarity of visual portraits and participant profiles</p></list-item></list>
<p>Jongeward concludes with an invitation: “For researchers who seek to access tacit dimensions of their own and their participant’s experiences, visual image-making offers a unique way of bringing into view and transforming meanings embedded in experiences” (p. 250).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312468336">
<title>Bridging the Art–Science Divide</title>
<p>Chapter 8 could have easily been the opening chapter, although the previous seven chapters give its arguments a firm foundation. Leavy fully understands the political realm of research, and claims that while there is movement to interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, “arts-based practices cannot be relegated to the status of second- or third-tier methods. These methods cannot be categorized as “experimental” which serve to undermine and marginalize these practices” (p. 264). She challenges “polarizing and one-dimensional views of artistic practice and scientific inquiry [that] have guided the building of paradigmatic borders” (p. 263). While critiquing the dichotomies, “rational–emotional, subject–object, and concrete–abstract” (pp. 263-264) found in positivistic research orientations, she maintains an appreciation of difference. Her table (p. 256) comparing the approaches of quantitative, traditional qualitative, and arts-based research outlines important parallel distinctions.</p>
<p>Still, Leavy unabashedly heralds arts-based research. She claims that it can reach wider audiences, dismantle stereotypes, access the voices of the marginalized, and promote social change. For Leavy, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312468336">Denzin (2003)</xref>, research must acknowledge its political and pedagogical mandates.</p>
<p>In summary, Leavy has compiled an accurate depiction of the present state of the field, citing many of its key players in each of these arts-based genres. She has provided researchers with a buffet of methodologies, genres, and subgenres from which to choose in their entirety or as a part of their research pallet. Through her epistemological discussion, clear descriptions of the methodologies, and strong examples, Leavy provides credibility to this growing field and support for those who wish to embark on these seas. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312468336">2006, Eisner</xref> asked, “Does arts-based research have a future?” (p. 9). With books like <italic>Method Meets Art</italic>, the response is a resounding, “Yes!” Leavy has played her part in making it so.</p>
