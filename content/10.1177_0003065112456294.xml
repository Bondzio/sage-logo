<body>
<p>Medical practice is at the beginning of revolutionary change. But among health care professionals, feelings leading up to it are mixed. On the one hand, there is a sense of excitement because we are in the midst of momentous scientific advances, but on the other is a profound sense of frustration because we are experiencing accelerating costs and a realization that we in the U.S. are not only inadequately serving our population’s needs but are seeing the quality of our health care declining relative to other industrialized nations. Two years ago, attending my fiftieth medical school class reunion at Columbia, I encountered a remarkable instantiation of similar mixed feelings. Virtually everyone had answered an earlier survey question about career satisfaction with an affirmation (answering yes to the question, If you had to do it over again now, would you again choose a career in medicine?). And although pleased with scientific advances, almost everyone I talked with expressed frustration and discouragement with the impersonalization of medicine that has taken place in recent decades. Complaints included the inappropriate demands of inadequate third-party payer systems and the imposition of technology and procedures that replace talking with patients; these latter were experienced as interferences with the doctor-patient relationship. And where had the learning gone, classmates asked, that we had valued in our medical school years, with its emphasis on taking time with patients for a detailed history and physical exam?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065112456294">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this background, I review three compelling books by leading clinician-scientists in American medicine. Each envisions, with some optimism, a coming much-needed revolution in medical practice, and there is considerable convergence in their visions. Moreover, each reviews the author’s own contributions in the form of a readable and engaging scientific autobiography. As I review these works, I hope to highlight both their science and their insights in a way that will make you want to read them.</p>
<p>A pervasive theme in each of these books is a move toward a greater emphasis on health—which is more than the absence of illness. A fourth book reviewed in this essay concerns health and longevity, bringing conclusions from a landmark study of health in the U.S.—the Terman study—that followed subjects through a lifetime. This book provides a background for longitudinal health studies that are poised to generate significant new knowledge.</p>
<p>Do these works have special value for psychoanalysts? As I review them I will indicate why I think they do, and the end of my essay will summarize opportunities and challenges for our field. A conclusion is that if we choose to participate in the coming revolution in health practice, there are significant opportunities for growth in our profession as we attend to personal meaning and health; if we do not participate and remain isolated, it is likely we will become increasingly irrelevant.</p>

<title>Collins: The Language of Life and Personalized Medicine</title>
<p>Francis S. Collins, now head of the National Institutes of Health and formerly chair of the NIH’s Human Genome Project, is—as the title of his book, <italic>The Language of Life: DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine</italic>, suggests—passionate about the changes he envisions, changes enabled by science that move us toward a personalized medicine. But his book does much more than explain his passion. It provides a wonderful read that includes an understandable introduction to molecular genetics (with a useful glossary of terms in an appendix), a synopsis of the logic and results of the Human Genome Project, and intriguing stories of people, including himself, who have made dramatic use of new scientific advances. In his text he makes effective use of language as a metaphor for the general reader’s being able to grasp the complexities of the new basic sciences of life and their potential applications. Thus, the letters A, G, C, and T represent the four nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) that comprise the 3.1 billion base pairs that make up human DNA. Collins makes use of the language metaphor as he explains how DNA sequencing exerts its effects in cells by means of varying communication systems that, analogous to grammar, are both constrained and change according to context.</p>
<p>The completed sequencing of the human genome, announced in 2003, has brought with it many surprises. One of these is the number of genes. I remember in the 1990s widespread speculation that there must be over a hundred thousand of them. Instead the number in the human genome appears to be around twenty thousand—a number of genes similar to that found in the roundworm and less than that found in rice. How can this be? Answers lie not in the number of genes in comparison with other species, but in the ways genes work. Genes work in complex ways with each other and with the environment, at many levels, over time and across development. I remember another expectation—that many major diseases would be found strongly linked to one or a small number of genetic variants, ones that would convey risk and then lead to a direct understanding of pathogenesis and treatment. Instead most diseases (e.g., hypertension, heart disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are polygenic, with a large number of variants being found to convey risk and presumably involved in etiology. Collins offers a useful discussion concerning the known facts about genetic influences for a range of diseases, from those that are autosomal dominant and strongly linked to a few genes to the majority of diseases, which are presumed or known to be polygenic. Finally, I mention what has been a third surprise to most. It seems that the Human Genome Project and its aftermath have focused more attention on the importance of environmental influences on health and illness than they have on genetic influences. The only way genes exert their influence is through the environment, whether we think of such influence in terms of cellular systems, physiology, or the behavior of individuals in society. Moreover, genes turn on and off across development, as cellular and physiological environments undergo change. Collins portrays these surprises well, indicating their implications for how we think about individuality, health, and the risk of disease. I found his discussion of genetic variants (mutations, alleles, single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), for example, to be the most lucid introduction to the topic I have encountered.</p>
<p>What is personalized medicine? The phrase refers to personalized practice and decision-making based on individual choices about health guided by individual genetic knowledge, rather than on general knowledge from a group. Personalized medicine involves how we think about diagnosis and treatment, but also about prevention. As Collins critically states, with our main focus on disease we have heretofore not had a health care system, but rather a sick care system. Personalized medicine places a strong emphasis on health. It means maximizing personal decisions about healthy behaviors and your health care in the light of what is known about your personal risk for diseases that can cause for you disability and death. It also means being able to tailor drug and other treatments according to a personal genetic profile. What makes this frontier revolutionary, according to Collins, is our accelerating knowledge about genetic influence on disease risk and drug responsiveness, knowledge that can be individually based and will soon be available to patients and health care practitioners. Assessments of one’s personal genome. which several years ago would have cost six figures or more, Collins estimates will soon be available for a cost of under a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Much of the book provides a guide for thinking about individual risk. Discoveries are being made regarding not only the six thousand or so diseases that are strongly influenced by heredity but also common complex polygenetic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and mental disorders, as well as factors relating to health and personality. The advantage of knowing one’s personal risk profiles is not just to anticipate the likelihood of disease. More important, such knowledge gives opportunities to engage in specified healthy behaviors (involving diet, exercise, minimizing risky actions, toxins, etc.) that can reduce the odds of adverse outcomes and to engage in other aspects of appropriate preventive care. Compelling stories in the book illustrate the advantages of doing this, and how specific personalized genetic knowledge has already led to personalized preventive actions.</p>
<p>An enlightening brief chapter concerns “genes and germs.” This includes what is being learned about genes as defenses against pathogens, specified for various diseases such as influenza, HIV, and tuberculosis, as well as a description of the Human Microbiome Project. This last is researching knowledge about the microbes that live on and in us—most with important symbiotic functions that assist in our health. Disruptions of the microbiome may turn out to be quite important for personalized medicine with respect to many diseases. Moreover, matching of drug treatments could benefit from knowledge both of one’s personal genome and those of pathogens.</p>
<p>The book presents a vision of personalized medicine, addressing not only health care providers (who will spend more time in relationships with patients learning about histories and individualizing treatments), but all of us as consumers. Collins strongly emphasizes personal responsibility for health. Chapters end with sections titled “What you can do to participate in the revolution of personalized medicine,” providing website information as well as practical advice regarding health-related behavior.</p>
<sec id="section2-0003065112456294">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Enabled by our advancing knowledge of genes and how they work will allow individuals to lead their lives with specific knowledge of risk for disease and to lower that risk by healthy behavior and adjustments to their life style. Beyond that, Collins envisages dramatic changes in treatment. These are occasioned by matching one’s personalized genomic propensities to the effects and side effects of various drugs, as well as by increasing the use of individualized electronic records. The latter will be necessary to establish a matching with databases of genome-based technologies regarding drugs and infectious agents.</p>
<p>How will this change be effected? Collins expresses optimism that change will happen soon but offers little about how it will happen. It is curious that although he emphasizes individual environmental influences, he does not spend much time on the exciting new frontier of epigenetics, where discoveries are being made about genetic action at molecular levels changed by specific environmental influences.</p>
<p>What are the implications of all this for the psychoanalyst? Certainly learning about biological advances in genetics is valuable in its own right, as is an understanding of the rationale for a movement toward personalized medicine. Collins’s vision also includes a change in practice that will place more emphasis on personal time with patients, on history-taking, on healthy behavior, and on individual meaning. For now, let us earmark that point; after reviewing the other books elaborating this vision, we will return to its relevance for psychoanalysis and vice versa.</p>

<title>Wennberg: Tracking Medicine and Understanding Health Care</title>
<p>John Wennberg, like Collins, is trained in internal medicine, as well as another discipline—in Wennberg’s case sociology and epidemiology. His book, <italic>Tracking Medicine: A Researcher’s Quest to Understand Health Care</italic>, traces his scientific journey of surprises. An Emeritus Professor at Dartmouth Medical School and founder of the Dartmouth Medical Atlas of Health Care, Wennberg arrives at a vision of personalized medicine from advances in our knowledge of variations not in the human genome but in the distribution of health care services in the U.S. Remarkably, a convergence of vision can be seen to arise from his analysis of population data and Collins’s attention to molecular genetic data. Wennberg’s take on the move toward personalized medicine comes from what he concludes to be the necessity of individuals taking personal responsibility in decision-making about their health. Wennberg vividly describes his decades of pioneering research concerning variations. Methods used to generate scientific knowledge in interpreting variations in the distribution of health care services include analyses of Medicare data, records concerning the last two years of life, hospital records, small area interview studies, and naturally occurring health care intervention experiments.</p>
<p>Among the discoveries in this area are widespread unwarranted variations in health care delivery. “Unwarranted” is a designation given to variations unrelated to illness, medical evidence, or patient preference. A consistent theme from his research is that most unwarranted variations occur in the midst of overuse, not underuse, and that more is not better—not only because cost is increased but also because evidence shows that quality of care is decreased. In his opening chapter, Wennberg adumbrates one of his views about coming changes in health care practice. Physician behavior is found to be the cause of much unwarranted variation, but not for the reasons a reader might think. Unwarrented overuse behavior has little to do with profit-making and instead stems from a culture of medical practice wherein “the doctor knows best” and patient decisions are delegated largely to the clinician. This leads Wennberg to a mantra already resonating throughout medical centers, namely, that there needs to be a cultural sea change in the doctor-patient relationship in which <italic>the practice of informed consent is replaced by shared decision-making.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003065112456294">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To highlight some findings, let me follow the book’s conceptual framework. Three categories of care are designated. <italic>Effective care</italic> is necessary care, based on reasonably sound medical evidence, in which services are delivered such that benefits exceed known side effects or unintended consequences. Most of the book, however, is about unwarranted care, and this can be either preference-sensitive or supply-sensitive.</p>
<p><italic>Preference-sensitive care</italic> is care that is elective, where interventions include more than one option and outcomes differ with respect to the options used. Unwarranted preference-sensitive care accounts for some 25 percent of Medicare spending and includes elective surgeries and many cancer-screening tests. To reduce such unwarranted care, more scientific evidence is of course needed about options and outcomes, but just as important, according to Wennberg, is a change in the doctor-patient relationship whereby there is more shared decision-making.</p>
<p>Examples are given where patients are given decision aids and where there is more of a shared decision-making, in contrast to the usual delegated decision-making of informed consent. In such examples patients have an opportunity, <italic>as individuals</italic>, to consider possible discomforts, risks, alternative treatments, and the odds for effectiveness. When this has been done, the percentage of patients choosing elective surgeries and diagnostic procedures has been dramatically lower. Especially poignant examples are given for invasive procedures with respect to the investigation and treatment of cancer, heart disease, and lower back pain.</p>
<p>The discussion of <italic>supply-sensitive care</italic> is in many ways even more compelling. This category refers not to any specific treatment but rather to the frequency of everyday care for patients with acute and chronic illnesses. Here the discovery is that, against what one would think, supply pushes demand. It is a huge problem, for supply-sensitive care is estimated to account for some 60 percent of Medicare spending. Discoveries involve the fact that for Medicare enrollees in traditional fee-for-service care, more care is not better care and in fact may be worse. There is a bigger problem with care overuse in some regions than with care underuse in others. A dramatic example of supply-sensitive care comes not from Wennberg’s national Medicare analyses but from one of the smaller regional analyses he presents. The story of the Boston–New Haven studies is worth retelling.</p>
<p>The communities analyzed in these two cities are served by some of the nation’s leading teaching hospitals, and most patients who are hospitalized there go to one of its academic medical centers (associated with Yale, Harvard, Tufts, and Boston Universities). The communities, according to Wennberg, are similar in demographic features related to health care needs. Yet studies indicate that the number of acute hospital beds used by residents in Boston was 55 percent greater than in New Haven and that hospital expenditures in Boston were twice those of New Haven. Interview studies indicated that physicians in the two cities were unaware that they practiced differently. A subsequent set of studies confirmed the difference in hospital admissions and also found that the lower hospital use in New Haven was not associated with a higher mortality rate. Moreover, patients in Boston were more apt to die in the hospital than at home or in hospice care. Further, in a later cohort study that followed hospital readmissions for identified illnesses, Boston patients were 1.6 times more likely to be readmitted than New Haven patients. This difference occurred in multiple cohorts and did not depend on initial diagnosis or demographic group. Most pointedly, poverty was not associated with increased hospital use.</p>
<p>Wennberg reviews surprising studies indicating that prevalence of illness plays only a minor role in understanding variations in practice in the U.S. Moreover, patient satisfaction, quality of care, and survival tend to be worse in regions where care is more intense. Along with this came the finding that areas with a predominance of medical specialists, as compared with primary care physicians, had lower evaluations for effective care. Why? An understanding emerged that substandard care often occurs when several physicians are involved, with no one person in charge. Not surprisingly, a general finding has been that patients in high-intensity regions tend to spend more time in hospitals, have more doctor visits, see more doctors, and are more likely to be in an ICU at the end of life. Another finding from studies gives us the other side of the picture. Where care systems are organized, where there is more consistent patient-centered care and coordination of services, there is lower care intensity and higher quality.</p>
<p>The last part of Wennberg’s book is taken up with addressing needed change and how to accomplish it. His studies compel the conclusion that we need strategies to decrease the overuse of acute care hospitalizations for the chronically ill, even though the current culture of medicine operates to utilize excess capacity. We must also address the problem of too little coordination between physicians and other health care providers. The health care system in the U.S. is fragmented. Wennberg reviews evidence that organized networks and group practices tend to use fewer resources, have lower costs, and offer higher-quality care.</p>
<p>Two major themes emerge when paths to reform are discussed. The first is promoting organizational capacity and decreasing overuse by encouraging multispecialty group practices and reimbursement schemes that encourage organized systems of care. Compelling examples of contrast are given concerning successes in Sacramento and a paucity of organized care systems in Los Angeles. The other path to reform is to establish shared decision-making and informed patient choice. Physicians are generally not good at understanding patient preferences, taking personal values into account, or explaining the trade-offs involved in medical decisions. Wennberg is adamant in his opinion that there must be a change in the doctor-patient relationship if we are to move toward shared decision-making. Further, in his view every citizen needs a long-term professional relationship with a personal physician who provides guidance and takes responsibility for individual care.</p>
<p>Wennberg does not believe that producing more physicians is an answer to problems of overuse and poorly coordinated care. He chides NIH and academic medicine for having paid too little attention to the science of health care delivery and identifies leaders in organized care. These include the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinics, the U.S. military systems, and the VA. In an epilogue he mentions “medical home” projects while calling for a national all-payer database.</p>
<sec id="section4-0003065112456294">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Wennberg, like Collins, envisions a major change in medical practice as he addresses health care consumers, practitioners, and policy-makers. Here we are given a rationale for personalized medicine coming from a different scientific data source, namely, from the emerging science of health care delivery. Changes are envisioned to reduce unwarranted variations that come with lower quality and higher costs. Emphasis is placed on shared decision-making that requires the practitioner’s attention to an individual’s values and more time spent in a consistent relationship. Additionally, emphasis is placed on better communication among health care practitioners, not only by sharing electronic records, but also by sharing within organized systems of care.</p>
<p>What are the implications for the psychoanalyst? As with the personalized medicine of Collins, we can see opportunities for contributing to consultation, as well as for advancing our knowledge. As noted, individualized decision-making depends on understanding meaning—what is valued in a nondefensive way and is adaptive. Further, enhancing communication within helping relationships, over time, exists as a central aspect of psychoanalytic work and supervision. These opportunities, as well as the formidable challenge presented to psychoanalysts by the move toward organized systems of care, will be taken up once we have benefited from the other authors to be reviewed.</p>

<sec id="section5-0003065112456294">
<title>Bortz: Next Medicine and Health</title>
<p>Walter Bortz’s vision of a move toward personalized medicine centers on the maintenance of health. A clinical professor of medicine at Stanford, he has been a national leader in the practice of geriatrics, and his <italic>Next Medicine: The Science and Civics of Health</italic> provides a lively and scholarly background for his vision. Like Collins and Wennberg, he speaks in a voice that is direct, engaging, and seasoned with personal experience. His message? In recent times the practice of medicine has gone astray: there has been too much emphasis on illness and treatment and not enough on health; physicians need to become more involved with their patients in health-related behavior and prevention, while patients (and all of us) need to take personal responsibility for our health.</p>
<p>In the book’s first part, he highlights the many threats to health that need addressing. In addition to excessive costs, these include health illiteracy, inequities in medical care, overuse of hospitalization, diagnostic, and surgical procedures, and insurance abuse and inefficiency. He invokes the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care to document huge U.S. variations that represent problems, and he advocates an appropriate framework for helping, one in which prevention supersedes cure. He endorses Wennberg’s emphasis on shared decision-making and also decries a U.S. overemphasis on specialization.</p>
<p>The book’s second part is titled “Next Medicine: The Assertion and Assurance of Human Potential.” Next medicine will emphasize health maintenance alongside repair and cure, promoting self-efficacy and individual responsibility over time. One of the most impressive aspects of the book is the discussion of the dynamics of regulation governing physiology and behavioral health—with a familiar inverted U curve as key. I have long thought that a basic life function of regulation can be represented by an inverted U curve where activation is on the Y axis and performance is on the X axis. On this curve, adaptive performance lies in a middle zone between not enough and too much activation. This is reminiscent of the ancient “golden mean,” a middle zone between not enough and too much. Bortz shows how this applies to a “science of health,” in which a “golden mean of energy” lies in a middle zone between underuse, as in “use it or lose it,” and overuse, as in “use it <italic>and</italic> lose it.”</p>
<p>Further, Bortz reviews evidence that our usual functioning occurs in a 70 percent range, with a 30 percent threshold value for depletion across a range of metabolic systems where disease and disorder can become apparent. Citing a range of studies demonstrating the benefits of conditioning on metabolic processes, he documents that the older we get the more important physical fitness becomes. In prevention, we can do a lot in problems stemming from disuse and exercise deficiency; he illustrates this in discussions of preventing heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and bone diseases. From his standpoint as a geriatrician, he applies this to considerations of health across the life span and concludes that human lives should, with health maintenance, average a hundred years.</p>
<p>Studies of populations where people live long lives reveal common factors: continual moderate physical activity, no smoking, plant-based diets, and social connectedness. Working longer is associated with healthy aging, as is sexual activity. In an interesting discussion of “frailty,” a term apparently used in geriatrics, Bortz discusses how it is largely reversible and preventable, and is mainly the result of muscle weakness brought on by prolonged disuse. In many ways, Bortz believes that the legs are the most important part of an old person’s body.</p>
<p>In a chapter on “healthy death” he shares his experience in a single year in which ninety-seven of his patients died. A good death is one with no tubes, no pain, and no loneliness, and it should be inexpensive. He recommends, as a strategy for those at the end of life and wanting to die, the cessation of eating and drinking.</p>
<p>His penultimate chapter deals with policy. To save money as well as lives, we need a transition to health medicine and prevention, with a “civics of health,” as in his subtitle. In the next medicine there needs to be a single-payer universal system. The medical marketplace has not worked. Even today there are community action programs for health and fitness and organized systems of care that can serve as paradigms for the next medicine. These are characterized by a centrality of primary care physicians, the disappearance of fee-for-service, and decreased roles for specialists and subspecialists. Electronic records are important as we move toward more self-care as well. Bortz recommends the use of fitness profiles to incentivize in the health care system, with education and economic links to lower costs.</p>
<p>Most of all, he draws attention to the importance of personal responsibility, stating that in medical schools health promotion curricula should have equal status with molecular biology.</p>
<sec id="section6-0003065112456294">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The vision of Bortz is for a needed change to a personalized medicine focused on health maintenance and enhancing individual responsibility. While advocating for the shared decision-making recommended by Wennberg, he brings an evidence-based emphasis to the role of fitness and the golden mean of energy for health and longevity—stating rather dramatically as a geriatrician that there is no reason the average human life span, with attention to health, should not reach a hundred years. For psychoanalysis this brings attention to the fact that our patient population is older, and that many have chronic diseases. Consequently, psychoanalytic practice and consultation will increasingly engage older persons in the midst of recovery as well as in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112456294">Kandel 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112456294">Emde 2011</xref>). Attention to the later years of life also brings to mind what we know about health over the life span. This provides a segue to the fourth book under review here.</p>

<title>Friedman and Martin: Longevity and Health</title>
<p>In 1921 Lewis Terman, then a professor of psychology at Stanford, began a study of gifted children that eventually included some fifteen hundred subjects. The participants, born around 1910, were followed throughout their lives. After Terman died in 1956, they continued to be studied by others, including Howard Friedman and Leslie Martin, the authors of <italic>The Longevity Project: Surprising Discoveries for Health and Long Life from the Landmark Eight-Decade Study.</italic> Psychologists at the University of California at Riverside, they focus on the participants’ final years and tell us what correlates with long-term health and longevity.</p>
<p>The book, written for a wide general readership, connects with the movement toward personalized medicine and health care in an interesting way. Although it repeatedly shows that variations in personality, exercise, diet, and exposure to stress are related to health among the Terman participants <italic>as a group</italic>, a pervasive point is that in many ways paths to health <italic>varied from one individual to another</italic>. Terman had a particular interest in personality variables and devised rating scales for them that Friedman and Martin have used. To motivate readers in thinking about personal health attitudes and characteristics, they provide self-quizzes scattered throughout the book, quizzes similar to the ones Terman provided his participants. Presumably a reader could construct a personal profile and make comparisons with the Terman group in the course of reading. At this point a caveat is in order, one that may already have occurred to most readers. This study covered lives in a particular place and time in the near past, with highly selected individuals who were largely Caucasian and economically advantaged; thus, how we generalize the study’s findings to today’s circumstances is uncertain. Moreover, the findings are correlational, and one cannot infer cause from association. Thus, the reader must be cautious about applying the findings to one’s own health or taking the general advice the authors at times dispense. Still, this is a hugely valuable longitudinal study, with prospectively and carefully gathered information over the lifetimes of a substantial number of people, some of whom are identified and well known. Aside from historical interest, we can glean useful hypotheses about what leads to what under what circumstances and for whom and how—and we can make comparisons with other ongoing lifetime health studies.</p>
<p>At the book’s beginning, the authors put forward a major consistent finding, namely, that the best predictor of health and longevity—from childhood and through adulthood—was conscientiousness. Not surprisingly, this personality variable, indicating a careful and consistently well-organized individual, was associated with doing more to protect health, avoid risky behavior, and get into advantageous situations and relationships. A somewhat surprising finding was that sociable children did not live longer. It seemed that this personality characteristic was double-edged, in that some were more likely to succumb to social pressure and to engage in risky behavior such as smoking and drinking. Another surprising finding, somewhat related, was that cheerful and optimistic children were less likely to live to old age; the authors speculate that they may have been hiding some troubles or did not appreciate the dangers around them. Not surprisingly, those who were coded earlier as pessimistic and more likely to generalize from bad happenings, tended to die sooner, and more likely from accidents or violence.</p>
<p>Aside from personality, however, it seemed clear that those who had a large social network lived longer, and that doing things with others with a sense of helping was connected with health. Activity data were collected on the sample from the earliest days. A finding was that energetic children became energetic adults and that this was associated with health and longevity; yet consistent physical activity patterns did not hold into aging.</p>
<p>Family divorce, if it occurred during the childhood years, appeared as a substantial correlate of decreased longevity. The authors interpret this as explained in part by the more heavy drinking and smoking characteristic of many in this subgroup. As would be expected, women lived longer than men. But other findings regarding gender were not necessarily expected. More feminine characteristics in women <italic>and</italic> men seemed associated with longer life, while more masculine characteristics in both genders were associated with earlier mortality. The authors connect these findings with a feminine quality of more social connectedness and a masculine quality that often included less caring for health. Here again, however, the authors make the point that the relations between personality and external factors (e.g., loss and stress) are complex, and that understanding comes chiefly from looking at individual life paths over time.</p>
<p>In a study of 720 Terman participants who were alive at seventy in the 1980s, the sense of productivity mattered more than a sense of happiness, and this had been true earlier in life, when they would also have been assessed as being more conscientious. Staying engaged and pursuing goals was important. Thus, the authors reflect, being intelligent is not a ticket to a long life; instead it matters what you do with your gifts toward productive achievement.</p>
<p>A conclusion of the book is that those who consistently engaged in physical activity and social connectedness, and were conscientious from childhood on, fared better with health in later life. Throughout the book, however, examples of resilience are presented, where paths changed, most often when these qualities were enhanced after a deficit and goal-directed activities were resumed.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Prospective human life span studies can provide invaluable information about individual development. Hypotheses can be generated and assessed about different adaptive paths through adolescence and midlife, for example (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112456294">Emde 1985</xref>), and resilience can be appreciated after adversity and stress. The Terman study is unique in its provision of lifetime data regarding a highly selected advantaged population and in its focus on personality. Still, the psychoanalyst reader will wonder: can we at all generalize findings from another time and place with respect to the role of conscientiousness and health? Two major longitudinal lifetime health studies, still ongoing, suggest we might, and provide an entrée to other data now and in the future that will be of significance. The Hawaii Personality and Health study cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112456294">Hampson et al. 2006</xref>) also found that the personality trait of conscientiousness assessed in childhood was associated with health behaviors and self-rated health forty years later, in midlife. In a related vein, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study found that childhood assessments of self-control predicted health and less criminal offending at thirty years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112456294">Moffitt et al. 2011</xref>). Importantly, those children who improved in self-control after childhood also had better adult health and adaptation outcomes. The Dunedin study is important to follow as it goes forward, since it has been genotyping its cohort of 1,037 children born in the New Zealand city in one year, has made multiple health assessments across age, and has had a remarkable participant retention of 96 percent. Both studies are making increasing use of assessing biomarkers in relation to adversity and adaptation.</p>

<title>The Role of Psychoanalysis in Personalized Medicine</title>
<p>Collins sees personalized medicine in terms of individualized diagnosis and treatment, Wennberg as individual-based shared decision-making within organized systems of care, and Bortz as individualized responsibility for health maintenance and ensuring human potential. In a change that brings a greater focus on engaging behaviors related to health and prevention, all point to the significance of the doctor-patient relationship. As a background to this, the Terman study indicates that the characteristics of conscientiousness and of being active, goal-directed, and socially connected are associated with health and longevity. The question then arises, to what extent can psychoanalysis participate in the changes toward a medicine that is more personalized?</p>
<p>Let me highlight three reasons arguing for collaborative opportunity. First, at its core psychoanalysis deals with personal meaning. It deals not only with unconscious conflict and defensive struggles involving sexu-ality and aggression but also with developmental changes and healthy solutions. Adaptation, and hence health, is one of its central concerns. Second, psychoanalysis offers expertise in understanding and working within helping relationships, over time, and in identifying an individual’s adaptive values as distinct from the conflicted, unrealistic ones that can arise within such relationships. Third, psychoanalysis itself is changing. It is becoming a “trans-discipline,” with professionals entering it from many clinical disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry, social work, pediatrics, nursing, and medicine, as well as from nonclinical disciplines such as anthropology, history, law, and literature. The psychology of psychoanalysis is now recognized as dyadic as well as individual, and the field is vitally interested in connecting with advances in the neurosciences, developmental psychology, and other treatment modalities.</p>
<p>Thus, one could say that in addition to opportunities for clinical consultation there are opportunities for collaborating in theoretical integration concerning advances in prevention and therapeutics. Further, there are opportunities for collaborating in multidisciplinary research and education.</p>
<p>Now we come to the challenges, and they are significant. Despite the changes I have noted, psychoanalysis has a history of isolation from other disciplines and from research and critical thinking, particularly in its institutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112456294">Kernberg 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065112456294">Wallerstein 2007</xref>), and this history has been difficult to get beyond. An even greater challenge, however, is that of overcoming the isolated nature of psychoanalytic practice. The books reviewed here envision a movement not only toward personalized medicine but toward organized systems of care, with the sharing of information from specialists within a medical home or to a primary care physician—and including a common electronic medical record that is available to the patient. Questions inevitably arise. To what extent can psychoanalytic practitioners share privileged communications with others? Even with patient permission and request, how much can go into an electronic record? To what extent can the culture of psychoanalytic practice be changed so that priority may be given to consultation with colleagues to the overall benefit of the patient? To what extent can psychoanalytic practitioners, applying therapies other than psychoanalysis, participate in organized systems of care without charging a direct fee for service?</p>
<p>The changes in medical practice envisioned in these books are propelled by dramatic advances in scientific knowledge and technology, as well as by socioeconomic changes and the need to maintain health within a population that is living longer. What seems clear to me is that psychoanalytic practice, if it is to have a meaningful role in the future, must find ways to actively participate in the coming advances, both to benefit from them and to contribute.</p>
