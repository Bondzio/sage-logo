<abstract>
<p>In this article the argument is that in order to find women who participate in the design of IT, it is not enough to analyze gendered divisions of labor in terms of professional belongings but also to analyze the practices behind the professional categories that are involved in IT design. The purpose of the article is to explore how actors in various ways were configured during an IT design project. The article is based on an IT design project, and the empirical material for the study was gathered through the use of ethnographic methods, and analyzed diffractively. This analysis showed that the boundaries between actors shifted, that the actors were placed in several different positions, and that what was done in practices did not always fit with the formal positions. The analysis made it possible to see that in this IT design project, women were important participants on which the whole project depended. If this project is representative also for other IT design projects, the problem of women as outsiders of IT design could be rephrased, and the problem is no longer that women are not included in IT design, but that their participation does not always become visible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article addresses the issue of women’s involvement in IT design; much interest in the issue of gender and information technologies is fuelled by the notion that women are rather absent from the arenas where information technologies are designed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243911409957">Wajcman 2007</xref>). The rationale behind this interest is in part the recognition that the design of information technologies is about the shaping of realities—that information technologies have far-reaching consequences for societies and for individuals, and is thus a practice with ethical, moral, and political consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243911409957">Beck 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911409957">Bratteteig 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243911409957">Lindblad-Gidlund 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911409957">Löwgren and Stolterman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243911409957">Stolterman 1995</xref>). The issue of women’s inclusion in IT design is consequently a question of who is included in these processes of shaping the world in which we live. Wajcman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243911409957">2010</xref>, 151) writes: “Drawing more women into design … is not only an equal opportunity issue, but is also crucially about how the world we live in is shaped, and for whom.” Her argument is that women too have the right to participate in the shaping of the world in which they live—basically a democratic argument. However, the issue of whether women can be considered included in, rather than excluded from IT design, is contested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911409957">Faulkner and Lie (2008</xref>, 173) argue that “there is a persistent gender gap within computer specialisms and professions designing ICTs.” A similar argument is made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243911409957">Wajcman (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243911409957">2010</xref>) who writes that women are “largely excluded” from IT design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243911409957">Wajcman 2010</xref>, 145). These arguments seems to be based on labor market statistics of professional belongings and educations, but the question of whether women can be considered insiders or outsiders of IT design also has to do with how “IT design” is defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243911409957">Elovaara 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243911409957">Mörtberg and Elovaara 2010</xref>). If IT design is defined as activities such as programming, software engineering, and information systems architecture, women are in minority, but they are not absent,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243911409957">1</xref>
</sup> and if IT design is defined also as activities such as the analysis of use practices, another reality emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243911409957">Sefyrin 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I will problematize the story of women’s absence from IT design, and my argument is that in order to see the women who participate in the design of IT, it is not enough to analyze gendered divisions of labor in terms of professional belongings, but it is important to also analyze the practices behind these professional categories.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162243911409957">2</xref>
</sup> My argument is illustrated empirically with the help of a case study of an IT design project conducted in a Swedish government agency, and the purpose is to explore how actors in various ways were configured during an IT design project. This argument is inspired by Suchman’s work (2002) about how categories such as “users” and “designers” make invisible the intricate and multiple agencies and relations that are involved in systems design. Her argument is that these labels make invisible a world which is more complex than indicated by the categories. This indicates that what people do in their work practices are not always the same as what is written in their job descriptions, and that the boundaries dividing various professions may be transgressed, expanded, and reconfigured. This issue is also discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911409957">Markussen (1996</xref>, 131), who writes about how “[i]n the design process, the boundaries between the participating groups are blurred, but in the accounts of the work, they tend to be revived.” Her argumentation implies that IT designers are aware of the complexities but that these are simplified in written accounts of IT design.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243911409957">Suchman’s (2002)</xref> argument points to how in IT design a range of actors are involved, a central point in participatory approaches such as Participatory Design (PD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911409957">Bratteteig 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243911409957">Greenbaum and Kyng 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911409957">Kensing and Blomberg 1998</xref>). The PD points to the value of involving not only formal IT experts in IT design but also those actors who will be affected by information technologies. These actors are, for instance, the practitioners who will use the technologies (often referred to as “users”). These practitioners are the experts of the use practices and contexts in which the technologies will gain their meaning and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911409957">Bratteteig 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243911409957">Greenbaum and Kyng 1991</xref>, 1998). With this definition of design, not only those who work in positions formally defined as IT professions are involved in IT design but also other actors such as business experts and analysts, and practitioners from a range of professions. A consequence of this is an expanded notion of IT design which includes also activities such as the formulation of visions and dreams of an alternative future, the analysis of current work or use practices (e.g., in the form of business analysis), and the formulation of better practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243911409957">Sefyrin 2010</xref>). Lately, PD have increasingly focused on these early phases of IT design, when the basic decisions about visions and objectives with IT design projects are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243911409957">Sanders and Stappers 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured in the following way: The introductory section is followed by a second section concerning feminist technoscience. The third section provides a presentation of the IT design project, the project organization, and the business analysis method. The fourth section concerns the research methodologies, followed by an analysis of the empirical material, and finally the article is concluded with a discussion of the analysis.</p>

<title>Feminist Technoscience</title>
<p>In the article, I have used feminist technoscience as the theoretical point of departure. Feminist technoscience can be understood as a critical approach—in terms of an interest in power relations and in questioning what is taken for granted—with an interest in feminist concerns, applied to technoscience practices (such as, for instance, IT design). Feminist technoscience<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162243911409957">3</xref>
</sup> is sometimes called feminist science and technology studies (STS; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243911409957">Suchman 2008</xref>), and is closely connected to STS. Feminist technoscience uses feminist research—foremost feminist science critique—as a resource in order to critically explore and intervene in problematic technoscientific practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162243911409957">Trojer (2002)</xref> emphasize that feminist technoscience focuses on technoscience practices as such, on theories, methods, approaches, and knowledge processes. In feminist technoscience (as in PD) it is central “to talk and exercise participation that enables and allows different realities, experiences and knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243911409957">Elovaara, Igira, and Mörtberg 2006</xref>, 113), so an important issue is the inclusion of multiple voices. Also the listening to silences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243911409957">Mörtberg and Stuedahl 2005</xref>), and the inclusion of absent actors is central (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243911409957">Wajcman 2000</xref>). With feminist technoscience as a point of departure various phenomena and categories—such as users, designers, business analysts, and IT design—are understood as constructed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243911409957">Haraway 1997</xref>, 35ff). As a consequence an important issue is to explore how such phenomena come into being in enactments, and what consequences they bring about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911409957">Barad 2007</xref>; Butler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911409957">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243911409957">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162243911409957">Suchman 2007</xref>). These phenomena are separated by boundaries, and these boundaries are not set once and for all, but come into existence through locally, situated and temporary practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911409957">Barad 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911409957">Haraway 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911409957">Haraway 1992</xref> [2004]). Based on these points of departure, I have focused on how women were present and participated in IT design practices, rather than on their absence from these practices. Another focus was to explore how various positions in the IT design project came into being through the enactment of boundaries in locally situated practices and doings.</p>

<title>The IT Design Project</title>
<p>The stories that will be told here are based on events which took place in an IT design project in a government agency in Sweden (here referred to as The Insurance Agency, or TGA). At the time of the fieldwork (2005-2006), TGA had approximately 320 employees, and its main business was the administration of a part of the Swedish public social insurance system. The project started in September 2005 and was titled “Project IT support for administrative officers.” The project was part of an effort to turn TGA into a public eAdministration (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243911409957">Grönlund 2004</xref>). There were two different objectives associated with the project. One project objective was to provide an IT support for the administrative officers for their case administrating tasks, and the other was to design an automated system for case administration. The administrative officers represented the largest professional group in TGA; they constituted 200 out of the total of 320 employees, and of these 80 percent were women, so these administrative officers were an important occupational group at TGA.</p>
<p>The project was in some respects inspired by participatory approaches. The focus was on work practices, and some representatives of the administrative officers who worked in the organization were engaged as experts of the administrative process and implicitly as future end users—although this term was not used in the project. These (women) became central actors in the project. Furthermore, graphical user interface prototypes were used as a method for formulating business requirements. Various forms of prototyping are central in the PD toolbox, as they are useful for promoting interaction and mutual learning between IT designers and users (Björgvinsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243911409957">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911409957">Bødker, Kensing, and Simonsen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243911409957">Greenbaum and Kyng 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The project was conducted as a regular business development project—it was not run by researchers. I followed the project mainly during the business process analysis. Business process analysis is an early activity in IT systems design which consists of analyzing work practices and business processes. This precedes any planning of the technical aspects of an IT system. The project was conducted in-house, and there was a project organization consisting of a project team, a project manager (Ingrid<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0162243911409957">4</xref>
</sup>), a customer, and a project steering committee. The customer had delegated his tasks to a representative, a delegated customer (John). The customer was supposed to determine how to allocate the project resources and what the result of the project would be, and the project steering committee was acting as advisors for the customer. The project team consisted of a number of people with various competencies, and some of these were the business analysts. These were:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Sonja, an administrative officer.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Maria, an administrative officer.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Tekla, as an administrative officer (who left the project after about 3 months).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ulf, a “business client.” He was supposed to act as a link between the business part of the organization and the IT part.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Jacob, an expert in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Hans, an expert in the business process analysis method, who was leading the day-to-day work of the business analysts.</p>
</list-item>
</list>All of the persons in the list above were labeled business analysts in the project context, but as can be seen, they also had other professional belongings, so in the group of business analysts there were several different competencies and organizational positions. As will become clear these positions were not unimportant in the project work but were central for the (re)configuration of the actors as more or less influential or competent in various project contexts. Consequently the business analysts Sonja, Maria, and Tekla were administrative officers, and in the project they were implicitly considered user representatives and experts of the use context—the current administrative system and practices. Thus, they had several different positions and competencies in the project contexts, and these were all interwoven.</p>
<sec id="section4-0162243911409957">
<title>The Business Process Analysis</title>
<p>The project was considered a business development project which included also IT design, and the first part of the IT design was the business process analysis. These business processes that were analyzed can be understood as work practices or administrative practices. The business process analysis was divided into three more or less consecutive steps; today, tomorrow (5 years ahead), and the future (20 years ahead). Hence, the current work practices were analyzed, and ideas for a better administrative system for tomorrow and for the future were formulated. The business analysts' first task was to analyze the administrative process of today, in order to understand how it worked, and to identify the associated problems. The focus in this part of the business process analysis was on current work practices, and this focus made the knowledge of the administrative officers fundamental in the business process analysis; in fact the whole project depended on their knowledges. As a consequence two to three administrative officers participated in the business process analysis work as business analysts, experts of the work processes to be analyzed, and as user representatives. They were the only ones who knew about the current administrative system and the problems with this, and who were qualified to make requirements for improvements of this. In other words, the business process analysis was a fundamental first step in the IT design, and the administrative officers were central in this endeavor.</p>
<p>The TGA was organized in line management and human resources management, and all of the business analysts were employed by the line management. However, in the project the most important boundary seemed to be the one between “business” on the one hand and “IT” on the other. However, the definitions of these concepts were not entirely self-evident. “Business” seemed to be everything that was included in the core activities in TGA (it is uncertain whether this included both line management and parts of the human resources management), while “IT” seemed to mean the IT-department, which was part of the human resources management. This boundary is relevant here because in the organizational division of labor, business was supposed to formulate business requirements, and IT was supposed to come up with the technical solutions to these requirements. In other words “IT” as part of the human resources management was expected to serve the rest of the business. The boundaries between business and IT were part of TGA’s organizational structure, and constituted a basis for divisions of labor in the project too. Representatives of business (for instance, the business analysts) were supposed to formulate requirements from a business perspective, while representatives of IT were suppose to propose technical solutions to the problems experienced by business. Furthermore, the idea was that the business analysts should not (have to) care about whether their business requirements were possible to carry through from a technical or economical point of view. Thus, all of the business analysts were considered part of the business, and as such they were expected to formulate business requirements without consideration of the technical or economical feasibility of these requirements. However, these boundaries were not entirely self-evident.</p>

<sec id="section5-0162243911409957">
<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>For the collection of empirical material I worked with ethnographic methodologies, since I wanted to explore how IT design was done in everyday practices (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243911409957">Bruun Jensen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243911409957">Henriksen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243911409957">Marcus 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243911409957">Newman 1998</xref>). Consequently I observed and recorded project meetings, discussions, workshops, etc. with an MP3 recorder. At those times I wrote field-notes, occasionally took some photos, and gathered a lot of project documentation. Furthermore, both formal and informal interviews with various actors in the project were conducted. Usually I spent about 2 to 3 days or part-days per week for about half a year. The business analysts and the business process analysis were the main focus of my interest. I did not participate as a business analyst but was mostly present and listened and took notes. Every now and then, when I did not understand (and there were many such occasions) I asked questions when there was a coffee break or a pause in the work. At times (mostly after the meetings) I also talked to the method expert Hans in order to better understand what was going on, and I also had frequent discussions with the project manager Ingrid. The project participants were all very helpful and did their best to answer my curious questions about TGA, the business analysis process, and their everyday work practices. These ethnographic studies started in October 2005 and ended in March 2006.</p>
<p>Haraway’s feminist figuration<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162243911409957">5</xref>
</sup> diffraction (2000, 1992 [2004]) is the basis for the analysis of the empirical material. As a feminist figuration diffraction can be used as an alternative to reflection as a critical research practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911409957">Haraway 2000</xref>). The concept diffraction comes from physics, and refers to how waves of various kinds—such as water or light—behave when they move through passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911409957">Barad 2007</xref>). As an optical phenomenon diffraction is what happens when light waves pass through slits, and are broken up. If light waves are sent through slits, and a screen on the other side of the slits records what happens with the light, a record of the history of the light’s passage through the slits is obtained. The result is interference patterns, and these patterns change depending on the sizes, shapes, and placements of the slits (ibid.). If diffraction is understood as a metaphor for research, the empirical material is the light, and the slits in a screen are research practices, such as the practice of formulating the purpose and research questions of an article, practices for gathering empirical material, the situatedness of the researcher, the choice of theories and the methods, and the format of the text. Hence if these are changed, so does the interference pattern that is the result of the diffraction. When diffraction is used as a research methodology the result may be that alternative patterns become visible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911409957">Haraway (2000</xref>, 104) writes that: “this is an apt way to discuss your methodology—seeing both the history of how something came to ‘be’ as well as what it is simultaneously.” In this way diffraction has similarities with Foucault’s genealogical method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243911409957">1983</xref>), but it also has to do with avoiding oversimplification: “[i]t’s simply to make visible all those things that have been lost in an object; not in order to make the other meanings disappear, but rather to make it impossible for the bottom line to be one single statement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911409957">Haraway 2000</xref>, 105). In this way diffraction can be a way to analytically deal with messy realities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911409957">Law 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Diffraction is a methodology rather than a method, and can be used in several ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243911409957">Alander 2007</xref>). I have used diffraction as a method to ask for several stories, interpretations, angles, or perspectives, and to look for complexities and richness in the empirical material, for several layers of meanings and realities. More specifically, this meant that I looked not only for the dominant story of women’s absence or marginalization in the IT design project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243911409957">Sefyrin 2010</xref>) but also for counter stories; that is, how they were participating. This meant looking deeper than professional positions, into practices of how actors came into being as specific actors in the various project contexts. Thus, I went through my notes, recordings, project documentation, and transcriptions with the following questions in mind: Which formal occupational positions were involved in the business process analysis? Which other positions were configured and how were the boundaries between these drawn? I looked for how the actors and the boundaries between them were configured and reconfigured in how actors talked or did not talk about themselves, others, and in configurations of “we,” “us,” and “you” but also in practices and doings. So it is the division of actors in the project into seemingly clear and stable categories that is diffracted or broken up.</p>

<title>Diffracted Design Stories</title>
<p>In the following analysis, I will present project work meetings in which specific actors were configured, and various boundaries were drawn. These meetings were usually rather open discussions in which the participants from their respective knowledges, perspectives, and positions in the project negotiated how to understand the current system, and how to make possible improvements of this. The walk through these meetings will show how these actors were configured and reconfigured.</p>

<title>: Project meeting with the business analysts</title>
<p>Present during this meeting was the business analysts Hans, Maria, Sonja, Tekla, Ulf, me, and my MP3 recorder.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0162243911409957">6</xref>
</sup> The meeting was part of the business process analysis in which the existing system was analyzed. The business analysts discussed how an automated system would sense the complexity of cases, and then distribute the cases that were too complex for the automated system to handle to the administrative officers for manual administration. At one point in the discussion Hans said to the other business analysts:<disp-quote>
<p>Hans: … but, the complexity one could think about if, if it [the system] would be able to sense, that (.) that this is a complex case</p>
<p>Sonja: but who is it that [inaudible] today then?</p>
<p>Hans: the system, if we decide what the system should say</p>
<p>Sonja: yes, but how will it know that?</p>
<p>Hans: yes, if one says that it is an AP [a specific kind of case], it might be easy, or an EP [another specific kind of case] is easy or not, one could classify it, if we want to, we can think now that we want this, and the others can say that it is not possible to carry this through, but, we can say that, and provide these descriptions, of an, of an incoming application, that this is complex or easy, it is the simplest (.) two variants, if the information exists, and if there is something strange, no then it is, then we will classify it as simple</p>
<p>Maria: but this allocation should not have to happen until after, after it is controlled, where it says ok yes or no, one doesn’t have to allocate a mechanical case?</p>
<p>Hans: no but if, no, that’s quite possible</p>
</disp-quote>It is not easy to understand this short section of a longer discussion, and it could certainly be interpreted in several ways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0162243911409957">7</xref>
</sup> Here, I will focus on how boundaries between various actors were enacted, and on the consequences of this in terms of how these actors were configured and reconfigured. When John said “if we want to, we can think now that we want this, and the others can say that it is not possible to carry this through,” this “we” referred to the business analysts as a group. “The others” referred foremost to the IT representatives who were supposed to supply the technical solutions but also to those who were economically responsible, like the customer, the steering group, and the other higher directors in TGA. These “others” were not present in this meeting. The main point with Hans's statement was to underscore that the business analysts' job was to formulate business requirements of a new and better system without any considerations of technical or economical feasibility. In other words, Hans tried to keep the business analysts on the track of only thinking about business requirements, and not to care about whether these would be feasible to carry through. Nevertheless, Hans draw boundaries between the business analysts on the one hand, and the IT representatives and the economically responsible on the other. Thus, the boundaries between business and IT were reproduced.</p>

<title>: Project meeting with the business analysts</title>
<p>Present at the meeting were Jacob, Hans, Sonja, Maria, Ulf, me, and my MP3 recorder. This was also a meeting in which the present system was analyzed, and ideas for a future and better system were discussed. Paper prototypes in the form of sketches of screen images were used as a technique to formulate business requirements. The prototypes were used in order to concretize ideas of a future and better administrative system. The discussion developed into a dialogue between Jacob—the GUI expert—and the administrative officers Sonja and Maria. Jacob asked questions of how they worked presently, and suggested ideas of how the system might be changed. They talked about how presently Sonja and Maria while talking to a customer over the phone used to write down the details for that specific case on post-it notes. Jacob suggested that telephone calls might instead be recorded in a (new) system through the placement of a button in the form of a telephone icon. At one point in the discussion, Maria said to Jacob:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Jacob: one could do something like that instead of having kind of a general, in a text field</p>
<p>Maria: but things like that, you can solve</p>
<p>Sonja: yeah</p>
<p>Jacob: no … I don’t think so (.) but that is to say</p>
<p>Maria: [laughs a little] yes</p>
<p>Sonja: <italic>yes</italic>
</p>
<p>Hans: but it’s not a demand to</p>
<p>Sonja: [jokingly] button!</p>
<p>Hans: but <italic>is</italic>n’t it so that, when you start to see it more concretely too then, in some sort of paper Prototype</p>
<p>Maria: cause we, I mean I speak about that I have to be able to <italic>write</italic> there</p>
<p>Jacob: // yes but</p>
<p>Maria: if I talk to someone</p>
<p>Jacob: maybe you have a need for something else than for writing free text</p>
<p>Maria: mm</p>
<p>Jacob: that is, maybe you feel that it’s uncomfortable as it is today, that everything is collected in a free text field …</p>
<p>Maria: but, but what I want, it’s to be able to write, and then, if someone finds out how it should be carried <italic>out</italic> in that, that is to say, that it will be rows or fields or phone and some will automatically</p>
<p>Hans: mm</p>
<p>Maria: I mean that the more simplified it is, I only want to write exactly what we’ve said</p>
<p>Hans: mm</p>
<p>Maria: everything else around it I don’t care, it, it (.) it’s only good if it’s solved in some other way</p>
</disp-quote>Again, a number of issues can be read from this text, but I will focus on the enactment of boundaries between the actors. Thus, when Maria said to Jacob “things like that, you can solve” she constituted Jacob as someone who can “solve” things and present solutions. This position was accepted—even initiated—by Jacob. Jacob did not seem to be restricted to the formulation of business requirements in the same way as the other business analysts but was allowed to talk about technical solutions. In the end of this section, Maria said: “it’s just good if it gets solved in another way,” and by this she underscored how she did not want to be involved in creating solutions. Thus, in the discussion Sonja and Maria came into being as requirements formulators, while Jacob became someone who presented solutions. Consequently the boundaries that had previously been drawn between IT and business were now drawn in between the business analysts—or rather between Jacob on the one hand and Sonja and Maria on the other. Furthermore Jacob assumed that Maria had needs as an administrative officer (“maybe you have a need for,” “maybe you feel that it’s uncomfortable as it is today”), and thus configured Maria as an administrative officer and as a user of the future system. Maria also configured herself as an administrative officer using the system-to-be (“what I want, it’s to be able to write”). Consequently Maria was placed—and placed herself—in several positions in this short discussion. Another possible interpretation is that Maria focused on “getting the work done” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243911409957">Jansson, Mörtberg, and Mirjamdotter 2008</xref>). From her point of view, “getting the work done” would mean not to get stuck in technological details but to stay on a more general level of business requirements.</p>

<title>: Project meeting with the business analysts</title>
<p>At this meeting Jacob, Ulf, Maria, Sonja, me, and my MP3 recorder were present. The business analysts were discussing how to design a new system, and the business client Ulf suggested that a certain process could be designed in several steps, with different “sheets.” This was a rather technically oriented suggestion, and the administrative officers Sonja and Maria did not understand what he meant with this:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria: make an example, it is so hard with these pictures [the GUI paper prototypes], it’s so good then when you come and then you look and <italic>yes</italic> and then one might get an idea</p>
<p>Jacob: [inaudible] (.) no but one can’t do it like that, one has to make some kind of basic construction that</p>
<p>Maria: but I was thinking [points to something?], if you perhaps have something that we do not see? [laughs lightly]</p>
<p>Jacob: noo</p>
<p>Sonja: but like</p>
<p>Jacob: but if one says that, if one says a status picture that, from, the registering of a case, an, AP, so we get it to, and there we can stop it at any time, we can change the from date at any time maybe then, then the question is how we should</p>
<p>Sonja: I don’t think it works I (.) I think it, I, but like it [Ulf och Jacob laugh]</p>
<p>Jacob: do you work on IT or what? [laughs]</p>
<p>Sonja: no but [laughs]</p>
</disp-quote>In previous discussions, Sonja had said that she did not want to care about solutions, and that she was too lazy to do so. Here Sonja was not lazy but took the right to talk about solutions (“I don’t think it works”). In doing so, she challenged the boundaries that defined her agency as a business analyst. In response to this, Jacob indicated a boundary (“do you work on IT or what?”); as a business analyst and an administrative officer Sonja did not belong to the IT department but to the business, and as such her comments about IT did not have to be taken seriously. Jacob’s reply could be interpreted as an innocent and friendly joke, but he was nevertheless pointing to a boundary to her agency as a business analyst. She was not supposed to care for technological or economical issues, was not expected to, and was not even allowed to do so. Thus, the restrictions to only deal with business issues meant different things for the business analysts: for Jacob (who was also a GUI expert) it was sometimes accepted to talk about solutions, but for Sonja (who was an administrative officer) this was a definite boundary.</p>

<title>: Workshop with the business analysts and representatives of the IT department</title>
<p>This was the second of three workshops with the IT department, and quite a lot of people were present. There was Ingrid (the project manager), and the business analysts Jacob, Hans, Maria, Sonja, and Ulf. There was also Simon, the overall IT architect in TGA, Peter (a systems administrator for the existing system), Lars (IT architect for the mainframe computer environment on TGA), Anne (who formulated requirements about documentation from an administrative perspective), Karl (a systems architect), Helga (who would later be in charge of the systems requirements formulations), Sven (a systems administrator), and me (and my MP3 recorder). The discussion was about how a new system might be technologically feasible. At one point Peter said:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Peter: // there is kind of, some basic stuff there and that is that one payment comes in one month, before</p>
<p>Hans: mm</p>
<p>Ingrid: yes, but that can be reconstructed</p>
<p>Peter: mm, it does of course (.) but</p>
<p>Ingrid: like that time interval one could develop if one wanted</p>
<p>Peter: yes, but the question is how much one should</p>
<p>Hans: yes precisely (.) yes we only got to wish here we</p>
<p>Peter: yeah</p>
<p>Ingrid: // just as well as, as that limitation on the number of benefits per individual can also be increased (.)</p>
<p>Hans: like in BA [business analysis], in the BA work we don’t have any such limitations</p>
<p>Peter: no</p>
<p>Hans: but, and that you others can say, well, this might not be worth the changeover and adaptation</p>
<p>Sonja: it might cost too much</p>
<p>Hans: yes, precisely (.) the, the priority might be this then, yes, we let this go for now, in that we (.)</p>
</disp-quote>When Hans said “in the BA work we don’t have any such limitations” he referred to the business analysts, and when he said “you others can say, well, this might not be worth the changeover and adaptation,” this “you others” referred to the (now present) IT representatives. With Hans' statements the boundaries between “business” and “IT” were cited and reproduced again. Recall that in the transcript from 051026, the boundaries were drawn between the business analysts and the (absent) IT representatives. In the transcript from 051117 the boundaries were instead drawn in between the business analysts, or more specifically between Jacob and the administrative officers. However, in this last transcript from 060213, the boundaries were reconfigured again. Now the boundaries were drawn between the business analysts and the (present) IT representatives (as in the transcript from 051026). This shows how the boundaries between various actors came into being and shifted in different project contexts, as results of the actors' doings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the article was to explore how actors in various ways were configured during an IT design project, and I have shown diffracted stories of how actors in the project were placed in different positions depending on the project contexts. My argument is that by looking not only for formal or professional belongings but also for practices and doings, women might become visible as insiders in IT design. In this IT design project, a number of actors in various positions were engaged, and often one specific actor had access to and was placed in a range of positions at different times in the project context. My focus was on a group of actors who in the project context were considered business analysts, but whom outside of the project context were employed and working as administrative officers, GUI experts, business clients, and experts of the business process analysis. Furthermore, there were also more informal positions, and the administrative officers were also the central experts of the current administrative system and practices, as well as implicit user representatives. In different project contexts these various positions came into being as more or less prominent and important. Thus, at times boundaries were drawn between the business analysts and the IT representatives, and at other times in between the business analysts, and then again between the business analysts and the IT representatives. Sometimes the main position of Jacob was that of an IT representative—in the discussions with Sonja and Maria—while at other times he was mainly a business analyst. Likewise, at times Sonja and Maria were positioned as experts of the administrative process, while at others they came into being as administrative officers and future users of the system-to-be. At yet other occasions, they were positioned simply as business analysts. The business analysts were restricted to deal only with business issues, but this restriction was unevenly applied to the business analysts, and while Jacob was sometimes allowed to talk about solutions, this was not an option for the administrative officers Sonja and Maria, who were not expected or allowed to talk about solutions at all. When Sonja did talk about solutions, it was questioned and she was not taken seriously. But even though Sonja and Maria were not allowed to talk about technical solutions, the business analysis was a fundamental part of this IT design project, and they were both central actors in the business analysis, as experts of the current administrative system and practices, and the whole project depended on their expertise.</p>
<p>With the point of departure that the notion of IT design includes also the early phases of IT design (such as business analysis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243911409957">Sanders and Stappers 2008</xref>), this has important consequences for the understanding of women’s involvement in IT design. The analysis shows how women may be involved in IT design on central positions, even when they do not work in professional positions as IT experts. Sonja and Maria were not employed as IT designers, and were not involved in programming, software engineering, information systems architecture, or other activities that are often the basis for definitions of IT design. However, their expertise in the current administrative practices was a cornerstone in the business analysis, which was crucial in the project, and hence they were central actors in this IT design project. If the decision to consider women as insiders or outsiders in IT design depends on their formal professional employment, Sonja and Maria would be defined as outsiders. However, when looking for the practices behind these professional belongings, it becomes clear that they were deeply involved in IT design practices, and as such they were clearly insiders in IT design. Consequently in this IT design project it is reasonable to argue that women were indeed insiders.</p>
<p>Obviously within (some) IT design projects people do things that are not included in their work descriptions, and that they are not educated for, and the boundaries between various positions are not as static as one might believe but rather permeable and shifting. This suggests that IT design practices do not necessarily fit with the professional positions but is more multilayered and complex that that. In this way, the analysis of this IT design project supports Suchman’s argument (2002) that behind categories such as “users” and “designers” is a more complex world than indicated by these simplified categories. Instead of simplifying the relations between the participating actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911409957">Markussen 1996</xref>), I have tried to show the complexities of the practices in which they were involved.</p>
<p>This opens up for the possibility to see the doings of actors who might otherwise be invisible in IT design practices, and who are thus not recognized as participants. This conclusion is based on one single IT design project in a Swedish government agency. However, Swedish public sector is an important employer for women (see Swedish statistics), and if some of these women participate in IT design projects in a similar manner as Sonja and Maria, they too could be considered included in IT design practices. If this is the case, it is not self-evident to consider women (in Sweden) excluded from IT design. Could it be that a multitude of women are participating in IT design right in front of our eyes—and we just have not seen them? The answering of this question requires more studies, both in Swedish and in other contexts. However, if this is the case, the problem of women as outsiders of IT design need to be rephrased, and the problem is not that women are excluded from IT design but that their participation does not become visible. This reformulation opens up for other questions and issues. If women become recognized as participants in IT design, and thus as cocreators of technoscientific practices and realities, they also become (at least partly) accountable for these, and this should be discussed too.</p>

<p>Swedish labor market statistics show that both women and men work in technological and IT professions (see Swedish Statistics), but that men are in majority. In 2009, in Sweden, women constituted 21 percent of the computer technicians, while among data systems designers and programmers 21 percent were women. Among other computer specialists 30 percent were women, and among qualified engineers specializing in electronics and tele-technology women constituted 17 percent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162243911409957">Sveriges Officiella Statistik</xref>).</p>

<p>The approach that is used in this article could in some respects be compared to other studies about boundary making in IT design and use. Much important and interesting research has been done in this area, sometimes with a focus on gender (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162243911409957">Oudshoorn, Rommes, and Stienstra 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162243911409957">Rommes 2002</xref>), and sometimes without (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243911409957">Kline 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243911409957">Laegran 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911409957">Lindsay 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162243911409957">Woolgar 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162243911409957">Wyatt 2003</xref>). Most of these studies focus on the boundaries between users and designers, and explore how technology and users are coconstructed in a mutual process. However, in this article other actors in IT design are in focus, partly because the term “user” was not explicitly used in the project context, and partly because my aim was to make visible more actors than these two categories.</p>
