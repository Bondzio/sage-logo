<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to analyze the consequences of emotion during narrative writing in accordance with Hayes’s model. In this model, motivation and affect have an important role during the writing process. Moreover, according to the emotion-cognition literature, emotions are thought to create interferences in working memory, resulting in an increase of cognitive load. Following Cuisinier and colleagues, fourth and fifth graders were instructed to write autobiographical narratives with neutral emotional content, positive emotional content, and negative emotional content. The results did not indicate an effect of emotional instructions on the proportion of spelling errors, but they did reveal an effect on the text length. However, a simple regression analysis showed a correlation between working memory capacity and the number of spelling errors in the neutral condition only. The potential influence of cognitive load created by emotion on the writing process is discussed.</p>

<p>The effect of emotion on complex cognitive processes is becoming a frequent topic of research. What is emotion? It is important to clarify the different terms used throughout this article. According to the American Psychological Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741088312458640">Van den Bos, 2006</xref>), <italic>affect</italic> “refers to the experience of feeling or emotion” (p. 26). An emotion is a complex process including feelings of pleasure or displeasure, facial/body expression components, and particular action plans and activation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088312458640">Frijda, 1993</xref>). Previous research on the interaction between emotion and cognition refers to <italic>emotion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088312458640">Blanchette &amp; Richards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312458640">Fredrickson, 2001</xref>), <italic>affect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741088312458640">Isen, 2002</xref>), or <italic>mood</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088312458640">Westermann, Spies, Stahl, &amp; Hesse, 1996</xref>) to describe the mental states manipulated during the research. It seems that the terms <italic>emotion, affect</italic>, and <italic>mood</italic> are used as synonyms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>). In this paper, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088312458640">Blanchette and Richards (2010)</xref>, we use the term <italic>emotion</italic> to generally refer to affective contents or states. In this view, to refer to a text with an affective content, we use the term <italic>emotional content</italic>, and to refer to writing instructions that lead to text production with a specific emotional content, we used the term <italic>emotional instructions</italic>.</p>
<p>Several studies have observed numerous associations between emotion and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312458640">Bless et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312458640">Bower, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Ashbrook, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088312458640">Isen, Shalker, Clark, &amp; Karp, 1978</xref>), particularly the relationship between emotion and working memory (WM) capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312458640">Derakshan &amp; Eysenck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312458640">Gotoh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741088312458640">Kesinger &amp; Corkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312458640">Vieillard &amp; Bougeant, 2005</xref>). Previous research has suggested that emotion can be characterized as a resource-consuming secondary task, increasing the load on limited-capacity WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312458640">Gotoh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312458640">Martin &amp; Kerns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312458640">Oaskford, Morris, Grainger, &amp; Williams, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312458640">Vieillard &amp; Bougeant, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The influence of emotion on cognitive processes is a common topic of research interest, but relatively few studies have investigated these effects using young participants. The existing studies in children have shown effects of emotion on learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088312458640">Masters, Barden, &amp; Ford, 1979</xref>), memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088312458640">Bartlett, Burleson, &amp; Santrock, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312458640">Bartlett &amp; Santrock, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088312458640">Duncan, Todd, Perlmutter, &amp; Masters, 1985</xref>), photography evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741088312458640">Stegge, Terwogt, &amp; Koops, 1994</xref>), mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088312458640">Efklides &amp; Petkaki, 2005</xref>), visual problem solving (e.g., performance in a block design task; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312458640">Rader &amp; Hughes, 2005</xref>), and drawing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088312458640">Burkitt &amp; Barnett, 2006</xref>). However, the potential influence of emotion on specific educational tasks has not been widely investigated in children.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312458640">Cuisinier, Sanguin-Bruckert, Bruckert, and Clavel (2010)</xref> found that emotion affected fifth graders’ orthographic abilities during a dictation task, finding an increase in the number of spelling errors when the dictation was from a text with emotional content. The authors concluded that the positive and negative emotional content within the dictation led to interference. In other words, when children are implicated in an emotion, there is a decrease in their processing capacity and, consequently, an increase in the number of spelling errors. Emotions seem to indirectly affect cognitive capacity in loading WM capacity. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes (1996)</xref>, who considers WM to feature several components as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088312458640">Baddeley’s (1986)</xref> model, the limited capacity of WM plays an important role during all writing processes (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312458640">Kellogg, 1996</xref>). Hayes contends that through motivational and affective components, emotions can fundamentally influence writing processes. WM capacity has been shown to be central to the development of writing processes during childhood, playing an essential role in acquisition of writing expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312458640">Berninger &amp; Swanson, 1994</xref>). Learning to write a text is a long and complex activity, and more than 10 years of practice are necessary to become an expert (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741088312458640">Chanquoy &amp; Alamargot, 2003</xref>). The development of WM capacity would permit more efficient information retrieval and storage via more effective cognitive resource allocation and sharing during writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312458640">Berninger &amp; Swanson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088312458640">Chanquoy &amp; Alamargot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312458640">Swanson &amp; Berninger, 1996</xref>). Additionally, certain processes become automated, and control becomes more proficient, freeing attentional resources for other activities. Concerning spelling abilities, because the rules and procedures are not yet automated, cognitive processing is important, and certain weakly automated orthographic skills may be easily perturbed by cognitive overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312458640">Fayol, Hupet, &amp; Largy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088312458640">Totereau, Thevenin, &amp; Fayol, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Because emotional content is able to destabilize orthographic processing during a dictation task, as revealed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312458640">Cusinier et al. (2010)</xref>, it is possible that it may also affect narrative writing, a task that is well known to be resource consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741088312458640">Kellogg, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312458640">1996</xref>). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088312458640">Chenoweth and Hayes (2003)</xref>, who observed an increase in spelling errors with a resource-consuming secondary task, emotional content that appropriates WM capacity during a sentence production task might also lead to an increase in the proportion of spelling errors.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study was to analyze the effect of emotional content on writing skills in children. The induction of positive, negative, and neutral emotions was achieved through written production of an autobiographical recollection. Indeed, autobiographical recall is a method shown to effectively induce emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088312458640">Baker &amp; Guttfreund, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088312458640">Westermann et al., 1996</xref>), and many studies have used it to induce emotion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312458640">Bless et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741088312458640">Goodwin &amp; Williams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088312458640">Jallais &amp; Corson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether emotion causes a cognitive overload in WM during a writing task, three experimental conditions were proposed. Participants were instructed to write a text with (1) positive emotional content, (2) negative emotional content, or (3) neutral emotional content. Texts were evaluated in terms of length (measured by the number of words) and spelling accuracy (the proportion of lexical and grammatical errors) according to writing condition and grade level.</p>
<p>In accordance with previous studies that consider emotion to be resource consuming in WM (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Ashbrook, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312458640">Gotoh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312458640">Oaskford et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312458640">Vieillard &amp; Bougeant, 2005</xref>) and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes’s (1996)</xref> model that specifies the importance of affect during the writing process, we hypothesized that there would be an effect of emotion on text length and orthographic accuracy. More precisely, as the writer’s predispositions (i.e., motivation and affect component; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes, 1996</xref>) and WM resources seem to be modified by the induced emotion, the writing process should suffer from such dynamics. Specifically, we predicted that length should vary as a function of the emotional content and that texts written under positive or negative conditions should contain more spelling errors than texts written under the neutral condition. Writing about an emotional event should necessitate some attentional resources to manage the induced emotion, consequently provoking a decrease in cognitive resources allocated to spelling processing. Additionally, concerning the vocabulary used in the different texts, we hypothesized that children should use more emotional and affective words (positive or negative) in the case of emotional instruction and that there should be differences in the use of verbs (factive and stative), pronouns, and subjective adjectives. We hypothesized that texts written under positive or negative emotional instructions should contain more stative verbs, first-person pronouns (<italic>je</italic> = I) and subjective adjectives, whereas texts written under the neutral condition should contain more factive verbs, plural pronouns (e.g., <italic>on</italic> and <italic>nous</italic> = we), and fewer subjective adjectives. This representation reflects the idea that writing about an emotional event should be more personal and more compelling.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0741088312458640">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study was carried out using fourth and fifth graders from a school in Draguignan, South of France. The participants were 20 fourth graders (11 boys and 9 girls; mean age, 9 years 10 months; range, 9 years to 10 years 10 months) and 19 fifth graders (11 boys and 8 girls; mean age, 10 years 10 months; range, 10 years 4 months to 11 years 6 months) without any learning difficulties. All parents gave written consent for their children to participate in the experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741088312458640">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Two tests were used. First, the spelling test from the ECS–Cycle 3 scale (a global assessment for the latter years of French elementary school, elaborated by Khomsi in 1998) was used to estimate each participant’s initial spelling level. This test evaluates both lexical and grammatical aspects of spelling. Second, each participant’s WM span was measured with the Working Memory Index of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (fourth edition, French version; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088312458640">Wechsler, 2005</xref>). This index is composed of two subtests. In the Digit Span test, children are orally given sequences of numbers and asked to repeat them, either as heard or in a reverse order. In the Letter-Number Sequencing test, children are provided with a series of numbers and letters and asked to repeat them back in a predetermined order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741088312458640">
<title>Procedure and Text Analysis</title>
<p>All the tests and the writing tasks were performed during March and April 2011. During the first session, the spelling test was collectively administered to the children within the classroom. Participants were then asked to produce a written text in one of three conditions during three successive weeks (one text per week, counterbalanced within each grade). The maximum length of time for each writing session was approximately 45 minutes. The texts were produced on a sheet of paper, and children were instructed to write about the happiest day of their life (positive emotional instruction), the saddest day of their life (negative emotional instruction), and what they had done during the previous morning in the classroom (neutral condition).</p>
<p>The WM tests were individually administrated in parallel in a quiet room elsewhere in the school.</p>
<p>After the number of words in each text was evaluated, spelling correction was made for both grammatical errors (<italic>j’ai <underline>était</underline> triste</italic> instead of <italic>j’ai été triste</italic> [I’ve been sad]; <italic>j’allai<underline>t</underline></italic> instead of <italic>j’allais</italic> [I went]) and lexical errors (<italic>sc<underline>ult</underline>er</italic> instead of <italic>sculpter</italic> [to sculpt]; <italic>gi<underline>rr</underline>afe</italic> instead of <italic>girafe</italic>). Both types of errors were counted, and an error percentage was computed by dividing the total number of errors by the total number of words in each text. It was possible to find multiple errors in one word if there was a lexical error and a grammatical error, such as in <italic>les d<underline>a</underline>n<underline>t</underline></italic> (instead of <italic>les dents</italic> [the teeth]).</p>
<p>Finally, writing analysis was conducted using the Emotaix-Tropes software, a tool built by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741088312458640">Piolat and Bannour (2009)</xref> for analyzing the French emotional and affective lexicon. This software can also identify different grammatical categories complementary with emotional and affective vocabulary, such as verbs, personal pronouns, and adjectives. This provides a novel type of qualitative analysis for children’s written productions. We combined analysis of the emotional lexicon (positive versus negative) with the presence of two types of verbs—factive (e.g., <italic>faire</italic> [to do]) and stative (e.g., <italic>être</italic> [to be])—three different personal pronouns—<italic>je</italic> (I), the French nondefinite pronoun (<italic>on</italic>, a more general or impersonal variation of <italic>nous</italic> [we]), and <italic>nous</italic> (we)—and only the subjective adjectives, which are usually used to express feelings and sensations such as happy, bad, or funny. For the positive versus negative emotional vocabulary, the mean number of words in each category was calculated. For the other grammatical categories within the emotional lexicon (verbs, pronouns, and adjectives), the mean percentage of words falling within each category was calculated. For instance, if there were 10 verbs in a text, 3 stative and 7 factive, the percentage was 30% and 70%, respectively. Types of words that were not considered, including declarative verbs, pronouns (<italic>vous</italic> [you] or <italic>elle</italic> [she]) and adjectives, were not included in the analyses.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741088312458640" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Several analyses were conducted to examine the results. The first two analyses concerned spelling and WM tests, and they were designed to determine if differences existed among pupils between the two grades or within each grade. The second analysis was carried out to confirm that participants followed the experimental instructions for each of the texts. The next analyses considered the main dependent variables: mean number of words and percentage of grammatical and lexical errors. Simple regression analyses were subsequently conducted to examine the relationship between spelling errors and WM capacity. The last analysis consisted of assessing the emotional vocabulary found in the texts using the Emotaix-Tropes software.</p>
<sec id="section6-0741088312458640">
<title>Orthographic and WM Tests</title>
<p>Analysis of the spelling test results (ECS-Cycle 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312458640">Khomsi, 1998</xref>) revealed that fourth graders had normal spelling abilities, with a mean of 19.70 (in the scale, the value of the 50th percentile was 19). Conversely, the fifth graders’ spelling level was 22.84, slightly below the mean (25th percentile = 20, 50th percentile = 27). Despite this difference, an analysis of variance did not reveal any significant effects regarding grade level (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>The computation of the Working Memory Index from the Wechsler scale (2005) showed that both grade levels performed within normal ranges for their respective age groups. The fourth graders’ mean score was 88.75 and the fifth graders, 89.11. A comparison of the scores before any mathematical transformation revealed a small difference between the two grades (fourth grade = 28.55, fifth grade = 30.32), but this was not significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741088312458640">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Qualitative Analysis</title>
<p>Qualitative analysis of each text showed that participants from both grades respected the writing instructions for each condition. The positive emotion instruction led to autobiographical texts featuring positive emotions, states, or events. Five principal themes emerged from the narratives (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741088312458640">Table 2</xref>). Two pupils related many positive autobiographical events such that it was impossible to categorize their texts within one theme; these responses were placed in the <italic>other</italic> category. The negative emotional instruction led to autobiographical texts featuring such emotions, with seven main topics in this condition. Finally, for the neutral instructions, all participants wrote about events surrounding their morning in the classroom in varying degrees of detail.</p>

However, regardless of positive or negative instruction, there was no significant effect of WM capacity on the proportion of grammatical spelling errors. With positive or negative conditions, it seems that there is interference with spelling processing and, in these cases, children’s capacity become less predictable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of different emotional instructions on texts written by fourth and fifth graders. Writing is one of the most important learning activities for children, and developing writing expertise is fundamental for academic achievement. Through observing students’ writing, teachers can evaluate many abilities and competencies; the effects of emotional instructions on spelling control, text fluidity, and vocabulary may have interesting implications in the field of education.</p>
<p>The study of the consequences of emotion on cognition, specifically on WM capacity, is an important field of research. As a large number of higher-order cognitive processes fall under the control and constraints of WM, it is important to determine if emotion might compete with cognitive activities for limited WM resources during performance of a task. Several prior studies have shown effects of emotion on WM capacity in particular contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Ashbrook, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312458640">Gotoh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312458640">Martin &amp; Kerns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312458640">Oaskford et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312458640">Vieillard &amp; Bougeant, 2005</xref>). Text writing, a classic grade school activity, employs specific language processes, such as planning, sentence generation, and revision, and these processes may largely depend on the development and availability of WM resources. Consequently, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of emotional instruction on some of these writing processes through an autobiographical recall task. Though we did not observe a direct effect of emotional instructions on the proportion of spelling errors, our results indicate there may be specific connections between emotion and some aspects of writing.</p>
<p>Contrary to the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312458640">Cuisinier et al. (2010)</xref> with a dictation task and opposite to our hypothesis, we did not observe an effect of emotional instruction on the percentage of spelling errors. There were no differences in performance between the two grade levels (fourth and fifth) or among the three writing conditions (neutral, negative, and positive). One interpretation of this result might be that dictation and narrative or autobiographical writing involve different types of cognitive processes and have different effects on WM resources. Writing requires manipulation of rhetorical and pragmatic aspects, such as the reader or the topic, as well as cognitive and metacognitive processes associated with writing and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088312458640">Hayes &amp; Flower, 1980</xref>). During a dictation, the necessary knowledge must be retrieved rapidly and efficiently in a stressful context, and children often perceive this kind of exercise negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312458640">Cuisiner et al., 2010</xref>). Text writing is less constraining in terms of rapid resource mobilization, and it affords more freedom in terms of time management. The amount of time allotted for a writing task is generally longer than for dictation, and during a writing task, children can choose vocabulary and syntax and are able to revise their texts.</p>
<p>One result that may support our original hypothesis is the relationship between WM span and orthographic test results and the proportion of spelling errors in neutral texts. It may be that a relationship between WM span and spelling capacity exists but disappears when emotional content is introduced. Though a decrease in attentional resources during “emotional” writing is thought to interfere with orthographic processes, it is possible that the emotional content could have allocated only a few cognitive resources in this experiment. Two interpretations can be proposed. First, it is possible that the load associated with the emotional topics was not sufficient to interfere with orthographic processing. This could explain why the proportion of spelling errors did not significantly change. A second explanation could be a low level of emotional intensity induced by the experimental context. Though the participants wrote emotional narratives in accordance with the provided instructions, this may not have induced a sufficiently strong emotional state to affect WM resources or lead to spelling difficulties.</p>
<p>However, these results allow for a discussion of the relationship between emotion and cognition. Our regression analyses are consistent with previous research suggesting that emotion consumes cognitive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312458640">Gotoh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312458640">Martin &amp; Kerns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312458640">Oaskford et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312458640">Vieillard &amp; Bougeant, 2005</xref>). Indeed, it seems that the introduction of emotional content during writing has interfered with the processing of this activity and modified associated underlying processes. Only grammatical spelling errors were affected by the possible load induced by the emotional instructions in this study, and it is well known that grammar is more sensitive to cognitive overload, as demonstrated in French studies by Fayol and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312458640">Fayol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088312458640">Totereau et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of the number of words revealed a decrease in writing fluidity with negative emotional instruction. Several explanations for this result can be proposed. First, researchers interested in the relationship between emotion and cognition usually report an inhibitory effect of negative emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312458640">Bless et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312458640">Bower, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312458640">Ellis &amp; Ashbrook, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088312458640">Isen et al., 1978</xref>). Thus, emotional content could have different effects depending on the types of cognitive abilities being exploited. It could be possible that grammatical spelling is affected by positive and negative emotional instructions, whereas verbal fluidity is affected only by a negative emotional instruction. Similarly, it is possible to interpret the decreased number of words seen in the negative emotional instruction as a lack of motivation caused by the topic itself. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes (1996)</xref>, the role of affect and motivation on writing processes is very important. Perhaps the text length is shorter in the negative emotional instruction because participants have paid more attention to the content of their writing. This could be one explanation for why a negative emotional instruction would reduce writing fluidity.</p>
<p>Concerning our hypothesis about the emotional lexicon, children used more emotional and affective words (both positive and negative) when given emotional instructions. The results show that even when emotional vocabulary was rare in texts, the types of words used matched the given instructions. In accordance with the literature, this suggests that autobiographical recall is a good method to induce a congruent emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088312458640">Baker &amp; Guttfreund, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088312458640">Westermann et al., 1996</xref>). Concerning the nature of the vocabulary used in the different texts, our hypotheses on the use of factive or stative verbs, personal pronouns (<italic>je, on, nous</italic>), and subjective adjectives were confirmed. Texts written under positive or negative conditions led to the use of more stative than factive verbs, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for neutral texts. Emotional instructions engaged children to be more expressive about themselves and their feelings. For pronouns, we hypothesized that emotional instructions should lead to an increase in the use of the first-person pronoun. The results show that there was an increase in the use of <italic>je</italic> and a decrease in the use of the indefinite pronoun <italic>on</italic> and the plural-person pronoun <italic>nous</italic> with negative instruction. It seems that when writing about a negative topic, children were more implicated (more <italic>je</italic>) than when they wrote about neutral or positive topics (more <italic>on</italic> or <italic>nous</italic>). Negative topics seem to imply a greater personal responsibility, though the writer is included in a collective pronoun such as <italic>on</italic> and <italic>nous</italic>. Finally, as hypothesized, subjective adjectives were more frequent in emotional instruction texts than in neutral ones. Globally, the lexical analysis revealed a difference between fourth and fifth graders: Fifth graders seem to use more personal and subjective vocabulary words than fourth graders, possibly because they were more aware of the emotional instructions and felt more personally implicated in their texts. These results reinforce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes’s (1996)</xref> perspective that affective influences on writing should be researched.</p>
<p>To broaden the implications this work and its results, further studies must be carried out. First, it is important to confirm the specific vocabulary phenomena that occur with negative instruction in terms of grammatical categories. Second, researchers should investigate whether all types of negative instructions lead to the same effects. In our study, children were instructed to write about their saddest day, but it could be possible to write about a day that was the most frightening or annoying.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312458640">Hayes’s (1996)</xref> model regarding motivation and affect, it would be useful to study text writing while manipulating writing goals and motivations. In his last model, once again <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741088312458640">Hayes (2012)</xref> underlined that motivation can indeed influence writing. This could aid in the understanding of whether instructions concerning a personal or emotionally significant event lead to the shortening of the produced texts because of a reduction in writing fluency or increased specificity in vocabulary choice compared to texts written about impersonal events. It seems that emotion and motivation are closely related; as a consequence, they need to be studied together.</p>
<p>In conclusion, because emotions have effects on writing processes, it is important and informative to analyze the relationships between emotions and other educational activities, such as reading and problem solving. Writing is certainly not the only high-level cognitive activity affected by emotion, and further research is necessary to precisely determine the effect of emotion on WM capacity in children.</p>
