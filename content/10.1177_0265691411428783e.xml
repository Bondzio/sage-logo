<p>Francisco Bethencourt’s <italic>The Inquisition: A Global History, 1478–1834</italic> is a revised edition and English translation of his <italic>L’Inquisition à L’Époque Moderne: Espagne, Italie, Portugal XVe-XIXe siècle</italic> (Fayard, 1995). The work retains the same structure, organized in 10 chapters according to themes; the updated bibliography and consideration of new work are incorporated into those same themes. The result is a valuable synthesis and ‘systematic macroanalysis’ (28) of three inquisitions – the Spanish, Portuguese and Roman – which also manages to engage in quite a bit of careful and detailed analysis.</p>
<p>While the Spanish, Portuguese and Roman Inquisitions were all ecclesiastical tribunals authorized by the pope to prosecute heresy, and therefore shared the same inquisitorial procedure of investigation and punishment, there were, as Bethencourt emphasizes, significant variations between them. It is through his comparative examination of these tribunals’ variations and commonalities ‘across time and space’ – according to the same themes of rites and etiquette, organizational forms, strategies of action, and systems of representation – that Bethencourt explores the ‘emergence, development, and decline of a major ecclesiastical power’ (29) in early modern Europe, accounting for as many localized permutations and adaptations as the sources will allow.</p>
<p>Bethencourt’s chapters devoted to ‘The visits’ (Chapter 6) and ‘The <italic>auto-da-fé</italic>’ (Chapter 7) are most indicative of the major differences between the Roman Inquisition and the two Iberian Inquisitions. The Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions each had a system of visitation in place to inspect tribunals’ activities, while the Roman Inquisition sent visitors (rarely) as needed in response to particular complaints. Spanish and Portuguese tribunals also arranged the spectacle of the <italic>auto-da-fé</italic>, in which a significant number of the penitent would ritually process to a carefully designed and managed public space where they would be reconciled, perhaps accompanied by a much smaller number of the recalcitrant to be executed. Such occasions, as Bethencourt explains, elaborating upon one of the major themes of his work, gave Spanish and Portuguese tribunals the opportunity to publicly assert their power and prestige, with the symbolic support of political elites – growing more elaborate as the tribunals entered a state of gradual decline, the better to argue for continued relevance to society, before finally retreating to less public space in the eighteenth century. (Whether that message of power and utility was unilaterally accepted by the spectators, Bethencourt acknowledges, is much more difficult to discern.)</p>
<p>The Roman Inquisition’s more quotidian abjuration process, usually undertaken in churches with small groups of penitents transported there without public fanfare, was indicative of that inquisition’s more conflicted relationship to secular power, particularly in states such as Venice. The Congregation of Cardinals in Rome, which led the Roman Inquisition’s activities in the north-central Italian peninsula after 1542, had to negotiate with the secular officials of independent states, who often viewed the papal-sponsored tribunals as representative of a rival political power. Therefore the Roman Inquisition could only act uninhibitedly in the Papal States, the pope’s own political territory. The political conflict, rather than relative unity (as on the Iberian Peninsula), was reflected in the distinct lack of spectacular <italic>autos-da-fé</italic>.</p>
<p>The book’s other chapters also elaborate upon this distinction. While serving as an inquisitor or member of a tribunal was an extraordinarily good career path for churchmen in all three inquisitions (‘Appointments’, Chapter 4), each inquisition’s different relationship to the political sphere, according to Bethencourt’s work, often accounted for variations between each inquisition’s internal power structures. In Spain and Portugal, there were fewer tribunals, but each tribunal had two or three inquisitors, and those inquisitors had more opportunities to make decisions independently of each inquisition’s central council. The Roman Inquisition had more tribunals, with only one inquisitor each, who often was required to consult with the Congregation in Rome, leading Bethencourt to describe the Roman Inquisition as, in general, ‘weaker’ at the intermediate level in organizational form. The Roman Inquisition’s vicars, however, could act more independently than their counterparts in Spain and Portugal, the commissars, when assisting inquisitors with investigations, giving vicars an advantage in the ability to take action.</p>
<p>Bethencourt’s coverage of all three inquisitions is so comprehensive that only touching upon the common themes will be possible here. But it is Bethencourt’s examination of such details that allows him to explore the outer limits of his evidence very creatively, and note what sources are available and what areas of study are in need of more research. Finally, it is through his examination of more symbolic forms of representation, in addition to trials, inquisition manuals, edicts and correspondence that Bethencourt argues for the inquisitions’ longevity and eventual abolition. According to Bethencourt, it was the tribunals’ ability to involve local elites, even the nobility in Spain despite initial prohibitions to the contrary, which accounts for their longevity (at the price of being subject to some manipulation by those very elites). And while the public argument for service to the community eventually was interpreted according to a different set of values prizing religious tolerance, Bethencourt argues that what ultimately shut down tribunals were political authorities making the decision that the inquisition, as an institution, was no longer useful.</p>
