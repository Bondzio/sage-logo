<title>Protection of cultural heritage: Principles of Engagement</title>
<p>At its meeting in April 2012, the IFLA Governing Board has endorsed Principles of Engagement in library-related activities in times of crisis, conflict or disaster. The Principles are part of IFLA's Key Initiatives 2011–2012 programme: Cultural Heritage Disaster Reconstruction Programme – Culture is a basic need, a community thrives through its cultural heritage, it dies without it. </p>
<p>The recent turmoil in Syria and Mali, the earthquake in Haiti or the earthquake followed by a tsunami in Japan, IFLA is deeply concerned by the great loss of cultural heritage in recent years due to armed conflicts, crises and natural disasters. The principles aim to encourage safeguarding and respect for cultural property especially by raising awareness and promoting disaster risk management and to strengthen cooperation and participation in cultural heritage activities through UNESCO, the libraries, archives, museums, heritage buildings and sites group and the International Committee of the Blue Shield initiatives and activities. </p>
<p>They advise IFLA and its members on how to monitor areas at risk, advocate for and raise awareness about prevention. In the event of a conflict or disaster, the Principles of Engagement will guide activities in recovery situations and advise IFLA and its members if and how to engage in a particular recovery situation within IFLA's strategic directions. They establish criteria to guide decisions on whether IFLA and its members would become engaged in post-conflict/disaster recovery and the terms under which it would do so. </p>
<p>To strengthen these efforts and to prevent future damage of cultural heritage, IFLA is currently developing an online ‘at risk register’ of countries and sites where there is a risk for armed conflict or natural disasters. Within the register, libraries with significant cultural heritage items will be identified. </p>

<title>Orphan Works and Legal Deposit</title>
<p>Through its Key Initiatives 2011–2012, IFLA is working collaboratively to build a legal, technical and professional base that enables libraries to play a major role in collecting, preserving, and offering wide access to all types of physical and digital materials. Thus, IFLA developed and endorsed Statements on Legal Deposit and Orphan Works.</p>
<p>The Statement on Legal Deposit outlines benefits of and considerations for print and electronic legal deposit whether in a mandatory or voluntary system of legal deposit. IFLA believes that legal deposit is critical for the preservation of and access to a nation's documentary heritage.</p>

<p>The Statement on Orphan Works encompasses issues to be considered in promoting the public interest in access to such works while protecting owner's rights and countering the risk of infringement, which is particularly applicable for mass digitization.</p>

<title>De Gruyter Saur IFLA Research Paper Award 2012</title>
<p>De Gruyter Saur and IFLA are delighted to announce that the winner of the De Gruyter Saur IFLA Research Paper Award 2012 is Adam Girard with his paper “E-books are Not Books: The Challenges and Chances in the New Media Context”. The author is Ph.D. student at the School of Information and Library Studies, Unversity College Dublin (Ireland).</p>
<p>The author receives prize money of EUR 1.000 donated by De Gruyter Saur and is invited to attend the President's Lunch at the Annual IFLA World Library and Information Congress in Helsinki, Finland in August 2012.</p>
<p>This year's topic of the De Gruyter Saur IFLA Research Paper Award was: “Libraries and eBooks, challenges and chances”. The jury – assembled by IFLA Governing Board member Paul Whitney, Harald Müller (Expert member of the IFLA Committee on Copyright and other Legal Matters (CLM)), Stuart Hamilton (IFLA's Director of Policy &amp; Advocacy) and Ingeborg Verheul (IFLA's Director of Communications &amp; Services) – unanimously agreed on their selection: “Girard's paper is clearly on topic and provides a well-researched and thoughtful overview. By classifying e-books not as books but as new media, it opens up new ways of thinking for librarians, publishers and other stakeholders, in providing access to e-books in the near future.”</p>
<p>The award is aimed at encouraging research and publication by those relatively new to the profession. Adam Girard has worked as metadata librarian at Northwestern University Evanston, IL (USA) and as audiovisual librarian Highland Park Public Library, Highland Park, IL (USA). His awarded paper will be published by De Gruyter Saur. </p>

<title>Annual conferences fees</title>
<p>
<bold>IFLA response to the petition for reducing annual conferences fees for members and speakers</bold>
</p>
<p>Thank you to all those who contributed to the discussion on the Petition to reduce the registration fees for the IFLA World Library and Information Congress.</p>
<p>IFLA is constantly working to open up the Congress to a wider audience. The IFLA Governing Board welcomes all comments such as those in response to the petition. The IFLA Congress Advisory Committee and the Board considered these comments at the April Governing Board meetings.</p>
<p>The IFLA WLIC is a flagship event that brings together the whole of IFLA once a year. In 2009–2010 the Board undertook a significant review of the Congress, including consultation with stakeholders, and in mid-2010 implemented the new congress model, which will come into full effect with the 2012 Congress in Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0340035212456141">
<title>Continuous improvement</title>
<p>The IFLA Governing Board has a continuous improvement approach to the WLIC. This includes for each year a survey of delegates, meetings with exhibitors and sponsors, improvements in use of ICT, developments with the professional programme, increasing opportunities for strategic engagement with other organizations, exploring new exhibitor markets. In addition the IFLA Headquarters, National Committee and PCO [KIT] work together to introduce new aspects to each congress, which may be carried through to forthcoming congresses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0340035212456141">
<title>Financial management</title>
<p>The WLIC is a EUR 2 million high risk and resource intensive venture that requires very careful management and oversight to ensure we meet the aims of the congress within reasonable costs. Less than half the funds required come from registration fees. The funds from other sources, such as sponsorship, exhibition and government subsidies are not provided in a way that would be transferable to subsidize registration fees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0340035212456141">
<title>Next major review</title>
<p>As part of the congress review by the IFLA Governing Board in 2009–2010 it was agreed that an extensive review of the congress structures and operations be scheduled for 2015/2016 at which time all of IFLA's regions will have participated in the new congress process.</p>
<p>Any changes resulting from the review would be implemented in a timely way to avoid disruption to future congress planning. This review will include but not be limited to: the 7 year WLIC cycle; host selection process; governance; financial management; and the roles of IFLA, the host national committee and PCO; and would include wide consultation, with IFLA members and professional units, and representatives from each participant stakeholder group such as national committees, delegates, sponsors, exhibitors, corporate partners. </p>
<p>The proposal that was made in the petition would result in a loss of income for the congress of several hundred thousand euros and to accommodate this would require major changes and cuts to the congress. This is not a position IFLA can take without such a consideration being part of the comprehensive planned review.</p>
<p>We look forward to the input of IFLA members and congress delegates at the time of the congress review.</p>

<title>Background paper on e-lending</title>
<p>As part of its work on the 2011–2012 Key Initiatives, the IFLA Governing Board appointed a working group to draft a background paper on digital lending. At its April meeting the IFLA Governing Board endorsed this paper, and we are now pleased to present a version for download.</p>
<p>The paper attempts to:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Provide an overview of the issues relating to eBooks in libraries;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Summarize the current positions of publishers in both the scholarly publishing and trade publishing sectors;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Summarize the differences in the way that academic/research libraries and public libraries address the issue of digital collections;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Address the legal context for eLending and library principles that must be upheld in any suitable models;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Provide a detailed legal analysis of e-Lending</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The e-Lending environment is changing rapidly at this point in time, and the paper will be reassessed in the coming months in light of any significant developments. Revisions of the paper may take place in light of any assessment.</p>
<p>IFLA continues to work in this area and has been liaising with EBLIDA, the ALA and others as we seek to understand the implications for the delivery of high quality library services in the 21st century. Considering just how important any developments in this area are for libraries around the world, IFLA encourages interested individuals or institutions to share experiences, information or reports with our e-Lending working group. Any information can be sent to Stuart Hamilton, Director of Policy and Advocacy, at IFLA HQ: stuart.hamilton@ifla.org.</p>

<p> In a networked and globalized world of information the form of national bibliographies may have changed, however their major function remains unchanged: to inform about a country's publication landscape, its cultural and intellectual heritage. Subject access offers a major route into this landscape providing information about the dispersion of publications in specific fields of knowledge and topics contained in a particular national publishing output. The <italic>Guidelines for Subject Access in National Bibliographies</italic> give graded recommendations concerning subject indexing policies for national bibliographic agencies and illustrating various policies by providing best practice examples.</p>

<title>Open Access Agreements and Licenses Task Force</title>
<p>The Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) is pleased to announce the formation of the Open Access Agreements and Licenses Task Force. </p>
<p>This is a multi-stakeholder Task Force initiated and supported by COAR (Confederation of Open Access Repositories), with members representing a number of different types of organizations (libraries, licensing agencies, library associations, and open access groups) with a common interest in promoting sustainable and effective practices for open access. The Task Force aims to review and assess the growing number of open access agreements being implemented between publishers and research institutions.</p>
<p>As the momentum for open access grows, publishers and libraries are developing new mechanisms to support open access. “In this rapidly evolving environment, it can be challenging to keep up with the range of open access agreements available”, says Kathleen Shearer, Canadian Association of Research Libraries and Chair of the Task Force. “We hope that this Task Force will help the scholarly community gain a better understanding of the current landscape and assist them in making the best choices when considering entering into open access agreements with publishers.”</p>
<p>The Task Force aims to have preliminary recommendations available for October 2012. More information about the Task Force is available on the COAR website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coar-repositories.org/working-groups/repository-content/licenses-task-force/">http://www.coar-repositories.org/working-groups/repository-content/licenses-task-force/</ext-link></p>

<p>Between 1988 and 2004, four sites in Mali were chosen to become part of the UNESCO World Heritage List, thus standing as international representatives of the nation's cultural and natural heritage: the world-renowned city of Timbuktu, home to the prestigious Koranic Sankore University and other madrasas; the Old Towns of Djenné, inhabited since 250 BC, a market centre and important link in the trans-Saharan gold trade, and a 15th and 16th century centre for the spread of Islam; the Tomb of Askia, with its world-renowned 17-metre pyramidal structure built in 1495 by Askia Mohamed, Emperor of Songhai, bearing witness to the power and riches of the empire that flourished during the 15th and 16th centuries; and the Cliff of Bandiagara, with its landscape combining cliffs, sandy plateaus and architectural achievements, living home to ancient regional traditions. Furthermore, six cultural practices and expressions found in Mali have been inscribed since 2008 in the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage List, bearing witness to its rich living traditions.</p>
<p>The risks incurred by the people of Timbuktu and other cities in the country, and the precious manuscripts conserved here, are cause for great apprehension. The Blue Shield calls on all parties concerned by the protection of cultural heritage, specifically archives and documentation, to protect these fragile witnesses of Mali's, and the world's, history and evolution, both cultural and scientific.</p>
<p>The Republic of Mali has been a State Party to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and its First Protocol since 1961, the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property since 1987, and the 1972 World Heritage Convention since 1977. These conventions, as well as customary international law, impose on all nations the obligation to protect their cultural heritage in times of armed conflict. The Blue Shield requests that all parties to the military strife in Mali fulfill these obligations and protect the country's outstanding cultural assets.</p>
<p>Mali's national legislation specifically addresses the issue of protection of cultural heritage in times of conflict. The 2001 Penal Code, states that “deliberate attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, arts, science or charitable activities, provided that such buildings are not used for military purposes,” constitute a war crime in international armed conflicts. Furthermore, according to the 1979 Army Regulations, soldiers in combat must “spare buildings dedicated to religion, art, science or charitable purposes, and historic monuments, provided they are not being used for military purposes”.</p>
<p>The Blue Shield's mission is “to work to protect the world's cultural heritage threatened by armed conflict, natural and man-made disasters”. For this reason, it places the expertise and network of its member organizations at the disposal of their colleagues working in Mali to support their work in protecting the country's heritage, and if necessary, providing assessment for subsequent recovery, restoration, and repair measures.</p>

<title>Blue Shield – 2nd Statement on Syria</title>
<p>The recent events are great cause for apprehension for the world heritage community. Both the tragedies suffered by the people of the Syrian Arab Republic and the dangers faced by heritage sites and institutions give reason for distress.</p>
<p>Syria's cultural heritage is endangered on several levels. Information on the besieging of the ruins of Palmyra, recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980, alongside the numerous worrisome reports concerning other important sites and the alleged looting of museums in Daraa, Hama, Homs and Idlib, have rendered obvious the need for a greater commitment to heritage protection by all those involved in this conflict. This also highlights the necessity for more concrete and detailed information regarding the extent of the damages already incurred and the risks faced by the country's archaeological, architectural and urban heritage.</p>
<p>The Blue Shield's concern for Palmyra also extends to other Syrian World Heritage Sites, monuments, ancient cities, archaeological sites, museums and other important repositories of movable cultural heritage. These sites and institutions conserve and provide insight into the country's historical and cultural identity, introducing national and international visitors to Syria's cultural wealth. The destruction and disappearance of artefacts greatly impoverishes humankind's collective memory.</p>
<p>The escalation of the conflict situation gives reason for concern and anguish to all those involved in the protection of heritage, rendering evident the precariousness of the situation for collections of cultural institutions and dangers to the integrity of sites and monuments. The protection of cultural heritage is required by international law, in addition to being a shared responsibility. The Blue Shield urges all those concerned to act responsibly, safeguarding the testimony of Syria's unique history for the enrichment of future generations of its people and of all of humanity.</p>
<p>The Syrian Arab Republic was a signatory of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and its First Protocol since 1955, and since 1974, of the 1972 World Heritage Convention. Signatories of these conventions acknowledge and commit to the necessity of protecting and preserving their cultural heritage in the case of armed conflict. The Blue Shield calls on all parties associated with the situation in Syria to fulfil their responsibilities in protecting the country's precious cultural heritage sites and institutions.</p>
<p>The Blue Shield also calls on the Syrian Arab Republic to abide by its Antiquities Law of 1963, which states that “The establishment of […] military installations shall be prohibited within half a kilometre of registered non-moveable archaeological and historical property”.</p>
<p>The Blue Shield's mission is “to work to protect the world's cultural heritage threatened by armed conflict, natural and man-made disasters”. For this reason, it places the expertise and network of its member organizations at the disposal of colleagues working in Syria to support their actions in protecting the country's heritage, and if necessary, in assessing subsequent recovery, restoration, and repair measures.</p>

<title>Yerevan: World Book Capital 2012</title>
<p>Yerevan (Armenia) is the twelfth city to be designated World Book Capital after Madrid (2001), Alexandria (2002), New Delhi (2003), Antwerp (2004), Montreal (2005), Turin (2006), Bogotá (2007), Amsterdam (2008), Beirut (2009), Ljubljana (2010) and Buenos Aires (2011).</p>
<p>The city of Yerevan was chosen for the quality and variety of its programme, which is “very detailed, realistic and rooted in the social fabric of the city, focused on the universal and involving all the stakeholders involved in the book industry”, according to the members of the selection committee.</p>
<p>Each year, UNESCO and the three major international professional organizations from the world of books – the International Publishers Association (IPA), the International Booksellers Federation (IBF) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) – designate a city as World Book Capital for one year, between two consecutive celebrations of World Book and Copyright Day (23 April). This initiative is a collaborative effort between representatives of the main stakeholders in the book industry, as well as a commitment by cities to promote books and reading.</p>
<p>During the opening festival on the 22 April, special attention was also given to the 500th anniversary of book printing in Armenia.</p>

<bold>The hidden history of South Africa's book and reading cultures. </bold>Archie L. Dick. University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division © 2012. 208 p. ISBN 9781442642898. $55.00.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Hidden History of South Africa's Book and Reading Cultures </italic>shows how the common practice of reading can illuminate the social and political history of a culture. This ground-breaking study reveals resistance strategies in the reading and writing practices of South Africans; strategies that have been hidden until now for political reasons relating to the country's liberation struggles.</p>
<p>By looking to records from a slave lodge, women's associations, army education units, universities, courts, libraries, prison departments, and political groups, Archie Dick exposes the key works of fiction and non-fiction, magazines, and newspapers that were read and discussed by political activists and prisoners.</p>
<p>Uncovering the book and library schemes that elites used to regulate reading, Dick exposes incidences of intellectual fraud, book theft, censorship, and book burning. Through this innovative methodology, Dick aptly shows how South African readers used reading and books to resist unjust regimes and build community across South Africa's class and racial barriers.</p>
