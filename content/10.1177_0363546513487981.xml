<title>Background:</title>
<p>Patellofemoral instability is a well-recognized problem, but there are currently no published patient-reported quality of life outcome measures that are disease specific for the treatment of this population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513487981">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To establish the content validity, initial construct validity, and initial reliability of the Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513487981">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513487981">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The content of the BPII was validated using a modified 3-stage Ebel procedure and analysis of floor and ceiling effects. As a measure of internal consistency, the Cronbach α was utilized to assess how reliably the 32 items of the questionnaire measured a similar construct. Test-retest reliability of the BPII was calculated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Construct validity was evaluated on 150 questionnaires completed by patients with a confirmed diagnosis of patellofemoral instability. A one-way between-group analysis of variance was employed to determine if the BPII was able to differentiate between patients presenting at the initial orthopaedic consultation relative to patients presenting at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513487981">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Content validity was clearly established as each item in the BPII achieved a minimum of 83.3% agreement (range, 83.3%-100%) for relevance among the expert panelists. The average agreement was 96.9%; 24 items achieved 100% agreement. There was no evidence of floor or ceiling effects. Reliability (internal consistency) of the BPII was established at the initial orthopaedic consultation (α = .91), 6 months postoperatively (α = .97), and 12 months postoperatively (α = .97). Test-retest analysis resulted in an ICC of 0.98 between tests. Construct validity was established as there was a statistically significant difference in BPII scores at the initial orthopaedic consultation and 6-month and 12-month postoperative appointments (F<sub>2,146</sub> = 75.62; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The BPII demonstrates content validity, strong initial reliability, and a statistically significant level of construct validity in patients with patellofemoral instability. This population includes patients with recurrent patellofemoral instability as well as surgically stabilized patients.</p>

<p>Patellofemoral instability is a well-recognized problem. It includes primary and recurrent dislocations, traumatic and atraumatic dislocations, and subluxations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513487981">1</xref></sup> Despite the significant body of literature focused on patellofemoral instability, the incidence, patient characteristics, prognosis, and optimal treatment have not been clearly established. The incidence of primary patellofemoral dislocations varies widely depending on the diagnostic criteria and population assessed, ranging from 5.8 to 77 per 100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487981">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513487981">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513487981">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513487981">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513487981">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513487981">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patellofemoral dislocation results in significant morbidity and functional impairment. Arthroscopic assessment of patients who have sustained a patellofemoral dislocation has demonstrated that a patellofemoral osteochondral injury is found in up to 95% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513487981">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513487981">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487981">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513487981">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513487981">37</xref></sup> After sustaining the first dislocation, more than half of all patients will suffer a redislocation or ongoing episodes of instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487981">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487981">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513487981">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513487981">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513487981">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513487981">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487981">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513487981">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513487981">34</xref></sup> Patients with a history of recurrent dislocations are also 7 times more likely to have further dislocations than patients with a first-time dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513487981">11</xref></sup> The ability to return to sport and activity after patellofemoral dislocations is limited, with fewer than half of all patients able to return to preinjury participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513487981">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513487981">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513487981">37</xref></sup> In addition to chronic instability and reduced activity, longer term studies demonstrate that up to three quarters of patients suffer ongoing knee pain secondary to their patellofemoral instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513487981">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513487981">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487981">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with patellofemoral instability exhibit a diverse range of characteristics. These patients demonstrate a wide range of pathoanatomy and differ in their ability to activate their neuromuscular system. Smith et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513487981">33</xref></sup> reviewed the self-administered outcome measures commonly used in this population and concluded that “it appears that there is no specific outcome measure pertaining to patellofemoral instability which is clinically meaningful.” There are currently no outcome tools designed specifically for the population with patellofemoral instability that are valid across the spectrum of disease, including the unstable knee and the postsurgical knee. Various outcome tools are employed in patellofemoral instability studies, but unfortunately, none of these tools was designed specifically for patients with patellofemoral instability, with the exception of the Fulkerson knee instability scale. Both the Fulkerson and Kujala scores have their place in the assessment of patellofemoral disorders; however, neither has undergone further testing to improve their validity and reliability or has been tested for validity and reliability in the knee after stabilization. Therefore, the validity of these instruments may be in question for patients with patellofemoral instability. A valid and reliable outcome measure designed specifically for the population with patellofemoral instability that encompasses the range of presentations and treatments is necessary.</p>
<p>For a self-reported quality of life instrument to be clinically meaningful, it is important to establish its validity and reliability in a highly structured, sequenced, and stepwise fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513487981">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513487981">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, validity and reliability work together to establish the overall validity of an instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487981">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513487981">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513487981">35</xref></sup> An instrument can possess reliability without being valid, but it cannot be valid without being reliable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513487981">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Validation of a health measurement scale involves addressing the following question: “Does the instrument measure what it is supposed to measure?” There are a number of types of validity that should be addressed in instrument development: face, content, construct, and criterion validity. Face validity is a measure that answers the following: “Does this instrument appear to be able to measure what it is intended to measure?” Content validity is distinct from face validity in that it requires a more systematic approach to obtaining expert consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487981">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref></sup> Content validation is considered one of the first steps in creating a valid instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref></sup> It is frequently overlooked by researchers because it involves subjectivity and expert consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref></sup> Consensus from clinical experts who have treated a specific condition such as patellofemoral instability is an excellent mechanism to establish the content validity of an instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487981">10</xref></sup> Another form of validity that is important to establish with a new instrument is construct validity. In the case of self-reported quality of life measurements, ideally, the instrument should respond in such a way that if a successful treatment or intervention is administered to patients, the overall score should improve between pretesting and posttesting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487981">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487981">16</xref></sup> Assessment of criterion validity is a further step to assess how effectively an instrument or procedure predicts performance in a real-life situation. This type of validity is often divided into the subtypes of “concurrent” and “predictive” validity. Robust instrument development requires that some level of validity is established before extensive reliability testing or further validation.</p>
<p>Reliability is the overall consistency of a measure. A measure is considered to possess high reliability if it produces similar results under consistent conditions. Internal consistency, a form of reliability, is an important assessment to establish the underlying construct of an instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487981">9</xref></sup> Internal consistency assesses the extent to which questionnaire items correlate to each other and therefore measure a similar construct. The underlying construct of interest in this study is quality of life for patients who suffer from patellofemoral instability. Test-retest reliability, another form of reliability measurement, ensures the consistency and stability of the instrument over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487981">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487981">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the content validity and initial construct validity of the instrument have been established, further reliability and validity testing of the instrument should be completed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487981">9</xref></sup> This should include exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to build on the construct validation. Instrument refinement will improve the evaluative nature and predictive value of the outcome measure. The purpose of this study was to establish the content validity, initial construct validity, and initial reliability of the Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII).</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546513487981" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>To establish the initial validity and reliability of the BPII, a structured instrument development and evaluation sequence was completed. Face validation was followed by expert content validation and assessment of floor and ceiling effects. Reliability was calculated via internal consistency and test-retest analyses. After these steps were completed, construct validity was assessed. The study received ethics approval from the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board and Child Health Research Office.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546513487981">
<title>Content Validity: Face Validation</title>
<p>Patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency and patellofemoral instability have similar histories including, but not limited to, the mechanism of injury (valgus, external rotation, deceleration) and recurrent episodes of knee instability. As a result, it was theorized that an already established, valid, and reliable outcome tool for the ACL-deficient population could be applied to the population with patellofemoral instability. The Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QOL) is a 32-question, self-administered quality of life outcome measure that has been shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487981">23</xref></sup> The ACL-QOL was modified for use with patients with patellofemoral instability but preserved the following items and sections: symptoms and physical complaints, work-related concerns, recreational activities and sport participation/competition, lifestyle, and social and emotional considerations. “ACL deficiency” was replaced with “patella instability” or “knee injury” (see Appendix 1, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). The authors examined the modified questionnaire and assessed whether the content of each item would apply to the population with patellofemoral instability. The authors are experts who see approximately 200 patients with patellofemoral instability and 1000 patients with ACL deficiency each year.</p>

<sec id="section9-0363546513487981">
<title>Content Validity</title>
<p>Content validation of a health outcome measurement scale requires expert consensus or judgment using a systematic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref></sup> There were 2 types of content validation included in this study: experts who evaluate and manage patients with patellar instability regularly and patients who suffer from patellar instability.</p>
<p>A modified Ebel procedure, which has been described in detail,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487981">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513487981">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513487981">18</xref></sup> was employed to gather opinions from expert physicians as to whether items in the questionnaire apply to a patient with patellofemoral instability. This was a 3-stage process consisting of (1) simple or face validation by a local group of experts, (2) review and acceptance from an international group of experts, and (3) face-to-face discussion by the international experts on items that do not achieve 80% agreement. This procedure has been successfully employed with a number of health measurement scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487981">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513487981">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513487981">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513487981">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Twenty experts, each having between 10 and 22 years’ experience assessing and treating patellofemoral instability, were surveyed electronically. These experts were selected based on their involvement in patellofemoral education sessions at national and international meetings in the year before the questionnaire’s distribution. The experts were asked to score the overall relevance of each item in the BPII using a 3-point scale: (1) extremely relevant, (2) somewhat relevant, or (3) not relevant at all. The questionnaire item was retained if 80% of the experts agreed that the item was either extremely or somewhat relevant. Effort was made to include experts from multiple continents, adult and pediatric specialists, as well as surgical and nonsurgical physicians. The first 12 questionnaires that were returned were used in the final analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The other experts used for content validation of the BPII were the patients with patellofemoral instability who completed the instrument. Data from the initial consultation (n = 83) and the 6-month (n = 36) and 12-month (n = 31) postoperative appointments were grouped, and the floor and ceiling effects were calculated. Floor and ceiling effects were measured by determining the total percentage of patients who responded with the lowest raw score on the BPII (floor) and the highest raw score on the BPII (ceiling).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513487981">36</xref></sup> Floor and ceiling effects are thought to be present if more than one third of the scores appear as either the lowest recorded raw score (floor) or the highest recorded raw score (ceiling).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487981">29</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513487981">
<title>Reliability: Internal Consistency</title>
<p>Patients with recurrent patellofemoral instability were referred to the Banff Sport Medicine clinic by sport medicine–trained physicians. These patients had failed nonsurgical management including physical therapy, bracing, and activity modification. The diagnosis of patellofemoral instability was confirmed by 1 of 3 treating orthopaedic surgeons (L.A.H., S.M.H., or G.M.L.B.), based on history, clinical examination, and radiological findings. Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of patellofemoral instability was not confirmed at the initial consultation. All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of patellofemoral instability were asked to complete the BPII at the initial orthopaedic consultation. Patients who underwent surgical management completed the BPII at their 6-month and/or 12-month postoperative appointments. The study sample was 73% female and 27% male, with an average age of 22.5 years. In terms of age distribution, the 15- to 19-year age group represented the largest demographic with 31% of the study patients, while 28% were in the 20- to 25-year age group.</p>
<p>The Cronbach alpha (α) reliability coefficient was employed as a measure of internal consistency. For data analysis, the patients were stratified into 3 subgroups: (1) those who answered all 32 items, (2) those who answered all items except items 5 to 8, and (3) those who answered all items except items 18 to 20. Items 5 to 8 of the BPII are work related, and items 18 to 20 are specific to contact sports; patients who did not work or participate in contact sports were able to indicate that these items were “not applicable.” Three patients were completely removed from the sample because they did not fall into one or both of these groups (ie, items 5-8 and 18-20) and they did not answer the question about competitive needs (item 27). The Cronbach α was calculated for each questionnaire completed at the initial orthopaedic consultation, 6-month postoperative appointment, and 12-month postoperative appointment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513487981">
<title>Test-Retest Reliability</title>
<p>Seventeen patients were randomly selected from the initial consultation group (n = 62) for assessment of test-retest reliability. These patients were selected during a 3-month period, representing 47% of the patients with patellofemoral instability who were assessed at the initial consultation. Test-retest reliability is an important component to test the reliability (or consistency) of a patient-reported outcome measure. It speaks to the ability of the instrument to reproduce similar results over time with the same participants. Seventeen patients completed the questionnaire in the week before their initial orthopaedic consultation and again on the day of their initial consultation. A test-retest reliability analysis was completed to assess whether the questionnaire was reliable, stable, and consistent. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2, k), assessing two-way random average measures of consistency and absolute agreement, was employed to measure the reliability of the BPII. The ICC 2, k was selected as it is recommended for test-retest assessment when the subjects are randomly selected and the measures (in this study, BPII scores) are an average of the entire item pool. Using this method enables the results to be generalized beyond the group that was measured in the study.</p>

<p>Construct validation is employed when there is no established gold standard but when there is an underlying trait or construct to be measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513487981">8</xref></sup> If an instrument has the ability to discriminate between patient subsets with a specific construct (ie, quality of life in patients with patellofemoral instability), the instrument is determined to have a level of construct validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513487981">30</xref></sup> The BPII was administered to patients with a diagnosis of patellofemoral instability presenting to the Banff Sport Medicine clinic between January 2010 and October 2011 at an initial orthopaedic consultation (n = 83), at 6 months postoperative (n = 36), and at 12 months postoperative (n = 31). At the time of the initial consultation, the orthopaedic surgeon discussed treatment options with each patient; those patients who proceeded to surgical treatment also completed the questionnaire postoperatively. Surgical patients were treated with one of the following: medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction, MPFL imbrication, or tibial tubercle osteotomy in combination with one of the MPFL procedures. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine the difference in BPII mean scores for patients at the initial orthopaedic consultation and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The mean score of the BPII was a percentage score, as some patients did not answer items 5 to 8 or 18 to 20 if they were not applicable to them. The percentage score was calculated based on the appropriate denominator for each patient based on the number of items they answered.</p>

<p>The authors acted as the group of local experts in the first stage of the modified Ebel procedure to validate the questionnaire. Each item of the BPII was examined, and there was 100% agreement among the authors that each item made sense and that the content applied to the population with patellofemoral instability.</p>

<title>Content Validity</title>
<p>Consistent with the methods described by Lynn,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref></sup> the first 12 returned surveys from the experts were used for content validation. These 12 experts were adult orthopaedic surgeons (n = 9), a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon (n = 1), and sport medicine physicians (n = 2) from North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. Every item in the BPII achieved a minimum of 83.3% (range, 83.3%-100%) agreement for extremely or somewhat relevant among the experts. The average agreement was 96.9%, and 24 of the 32 items achieved 100% agreement. The experts agreed on the relevance of all 32 items to measure quality of life in patients with patellofemoral instability.</p>
<p>Data from the initial consultation and the 6-month and 12-month postoperative appointments were grouped, and the floor and ceiling effects were calculated. The lowest possible score for the BPII is 0, and the highest possible score is 100. In this study, scores of the BPII ranged from 6.16 to 98.94. There was less than 33% at the lower end of the instrument’s responses (BPII raw score of 6.16) or the top end of the instrument’s responses (BPII raw score of 98.94). Therefore, we determined no evidence of floor or ceiling effects existed in the dataset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487981">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two accepted methods of developing multi-item health measurement scales are clinimetric and psychometric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513487981">21</xref></sup> Assessment of the BPII in this study utilized a psychometric or mathematical model of development through the content validation procedure and the measurement of internal consistency. A clinimetric development process was applied through the test-retest analysis and the construct validation of the questionnaire. Using psychometric and clinimetric strategies in tandem, this study has established the content validity, construct validity, and initial reliability of the BPII.</p>
<p>The ability to practice evidence-based medicine is dependent on the availability of valid and reliable outcome measures that are specific to an injury type or patient population. Paxton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487981">29</xref></sup> compared both self-administered and examiner-administered outcome measures (modified International Knee Documentation Committee form [IKDC], Kujala anterior knee pain scale, Fulkerson knee instability scale, Lysholm knee scoring scale, Tegner activity level scale) in patients after an acute patellofemoral dislocation. These outcome measures evaluate patellofemoral pain, patellofemoral dysfunction, or activity levels, but none is sufficiently comprehensive for the assessment of quality of life in patients with patellofemoral instability. Furthermore, Smith et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513487981">33</xref>(p260)</sup> performed a systematic review of outcome measures for patellofemoral instability and concluded the following: “The majority of the outcome measures have been constructed for ‘patellofemoral’ pain syndrome or knee ligament injury populations. It appears that there is no specific outcome measure pertaining to patellar instability which is clinically meaningful. We recommend that a patellar instability outcome measure be developed and evaluated for this group.”</p>
<p>The BPII was developed and evaluated specifically for patients with patellofemoral instability. Content validity of the BPII was established, as the group of experts indicated that all 32 items were relevant for use in a scale designed to assess quality of life in patients with patellofemoral instability. Sport medicine physicians and adult and pediatric orthopaedic surgeons contributed to the BPII’s content validation. Critically, undertaking this content validation ensured that the authors focused on assessing what it was they were attempting to measure. Another strength of the BPII is the generalizability of the instrument as experts were drawn from North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that the BPII covers the spectrum of content for quality of life assessment (symptoms and physical complaints, work-related concerns, recreation and sport concerns, lifestyle concerns, and social and emotional concerns) for patellofemoral instability.</p>
<p>Content validity is considered an important step in the overall validation of any health measurement scale but not sufficient in itself to claim the scale is valid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513487981">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513487981">35</xref></sup> Reliability analysis must be completed, and the combination of validity and reliability testing is more likely to produce a valid instrument. However, reporting the reliability of an instrument without having established its validity is a common mistake in the literature of medical instrument development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513487981">7</xref></sup> In other words, an instrument can be reliable without being valid or measuring what it is supposed to measure. The current instrument has demonstrated content validity, construct validity, internal consistency, and reliability, thereby exhibiting important attributes toward its overall validity.</p>
<p>Paxton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487981">29</xref></sup> assessed the reliability of instruments used to evaluate this population and demonstrated good initial reliability in a population with an acute first-time patellofemoral dislocation (modified IKDC, 0.84; Kujala, 0.82; Lysholm, 0.71; Fulkerson, 0.70). Unfortunately, none of these tools were designed specifically for patients with patellofemoral instability, with the exception of the Fulkerson knee instability scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513487981">12</xref></sup> This scale was developed for patellofemoral instability and has been validated in first-time dislocations but has not been validated for recurrent instability or in postsurgical patients. Paxton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487981">29</xref></sup> concluded that the high correlation between the Lysholm, Fulkerson, and Kujala scores was evidence that these tools are measuring the same construct. However, there has been a lack of published content validation studies addressing the function, quality of life, and instability constructs. The BPII overcomes this specific weakness by concomitantly providing content validation and reliability. Furthermore, the BPII was sufficiently sensitive to measure differences between the initial orthopaedic consultation and 6-month and 12-month postoperative subsets.</p>
<p>Validity and reliability work together to establish the overall validity of a scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487981">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513487981">35</xref></sup> Streiner and Norman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513487981">35</xref></sup> indicate that optimal reliability coefficients for instruments should be between 0.70 and 0.90. The Cronbach α reliability coefficient used to measure the internal consistency of the BPII was very high at all stages of data collection (α = .91-.98). Those instruments that possess reliability coefficients greater than 0.90 would definitely be measuring the same construct (in this case, quality of life in patients with patellofemoral instability). These high reliability coefficients are convincing for item content but do not eliminate the possibility that there may be some item redundancy. This is a similar message to anecdotal evidence provided by the international group of experts who helped establish the content validity of the BPII. Further development of the BPII will include factor analysis to determine the domains that are being measured and demonstrate greater construct validity and potentially permit the reduction of redundant items.</p>
<p>Instrument development should be considered iterative whereby content validity and reliability testing is completed early in the overall process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487981">9</xref></sup> Therefore, establishing the content validity and initial reliability was the priority of this study. This study represents the first steps to develop a reliable and valid outcome measure for patients with patellofemoral instability. The introduction of the BPII with content validity and initial reliability fills a void in outcome measures with a disease-specific instrument that can be applied across the treatment spectrum for patellofemoral instability. Furthermore, the use of an academically rigorous and clearly defined method for development of the BPII further enhances its strength as a tool. The BPII can now be used as an objective clinical evaluation instrument to assist in the management and treatment of patients with patellofemoral instability. As further instrument development occurs, it may be possible to use the BPII to predict successful management and/or treatment outcomes, adding another level of validation.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study was that some patients were unable to complete the entire questionnaire and answered “not applicable” to the work or contact sport items. This can be explained by examining the patient demographics. Those who did not answer the work items were young and were therefore not yet in the workforce. Those who did not answer the contact sport items indicated that they were unable to participate in contact sport because of their knee instability. The 3 patients excluded from the analysis did not complete at least 2 of the questionnaire items relating to work, contact sport, or competitive needs. More thought must be given to the patients who do not work, who do not play contact sports, and who do not participate in competitive activities. This issue may be resolved in the future with item reduction.</p>
<p>The BPII demonstrates content validity, strong internal consistency, excellent reliability, and a statistically significant level of construct validity in the population with patellofemoral instability. This population includes patients with patellofemoral instability as well as surgically stabilized patients. Future research will focus on construct validation of the BPII with the goal of confirming the underlying constructs and on factor analysis to reduce the total number of items. Once a shorter version of the BPII is established, further test-retest reliability testing will be completed to ensure the stability of the instrument. This study represents the initial validity and reliability assessments with additional steps planned for future studies to further enhance the psychometric and clinimetric soundness of the instrument.</p>
