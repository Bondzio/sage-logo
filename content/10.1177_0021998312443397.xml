<p>We report a two-step process for the fabrication of copper (Cu) matrix composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In the first step, a homogeneous mixture of copper nanoparticles and CNTs was prepared using the molecular-level-mixing followed by ball milling the mixture using a high energy ball mill. CNTs/Cu composites were fabricated in the second step using the powder metallurgy process in which the composite powders were first cold pressed at 550 MPa and then sintered in the range of 550–900°C for 2 h under a vacuum of 10<sup>-2 </sup>Torr. Composites fabricated via this method showed significant improvement in mechanical properties over CNTs/Cu composites produced earlier either using only ball milling or molecular-level-mixing. Further, a high dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix was observed in the present system as revealed by the microstructural analysis of CNTs/Cu composite powder using scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312443397" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the recent years, much attention has been paid on the fabrication of metal–matrix composites for various industrial applications. In most of these composites carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used as the reinforcement material because of its outstanding properties such as large aspect ratio (1000–10,000),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312443397">1</xref></sup> low density, high rigidity (Young’s modulus of the order of 1 TPa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312443397">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312443397">3</xref></sup> and high tensile strength (up to 60 GPa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312443397">4</xref></sup> In addition, the thermal conductivity of CNTs was found to be &gt; 3000 W/mK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312443397">5</xref></sup> making them suitable candidate for the fabrication of composites with improved properties. In the area of metal–matrix composites, Al composites have been paid great attention due to their use in automobile and aerospace industries because of their lightweight, high strength and good corrosion resistance. However, no major breakthrough has yet been made on CNT-reinforced Cu matrix composites. Interest in Cu nanoparticles arises because of their high thermal and electrical conductivity and its potential applications for various electronic systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312443397">6</xref></sup> electrode materials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312443397">7</xref></sup> catalysts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312443397">8</xref></sup> and gas sensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312443397">9</xref></sup> However, the composites of pure Cu have limited applications because of its inferior strength and other mechanical properties. Therefore, the mechanical properties of Cu is improved by reinforcing it with CNTs using a number of methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312443397">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312443397"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312443397"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312443397">13</xref></sup> Most of the researchers have used traditional powder metallurgy process to fabricate CNTs/Cu composites, which consists of mixing CNTs with copper powder by ball milling followed by sintering or hot pressing. However, such processes have failed to produce composites in which CNTs have been homogeneously dispersed in Cu matrix. This is mainly due to the strong agglomeration of CNTs in the powder form. The Van der Waal’s forces of attraction between the CNTs cause them to attract each other forming agglomerates rather than homogeneous dispersions. A molecular level mixing method has also been reported for the preparation of CNTs/Cu composites powders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312443397">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312443397"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312443397">16</xref></sup> The composites were fabricated by consolidating the CNTs/Cu powders by spark plasma sintering. Although the molecular-level-mixing resulted in the formation of Cu nanoparticles, the homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in the metal matrix is still a challenge. In the present study, we have used a combination of molecular-level-mixing with high energy ball milling to produce a homogeneous mixture of CNTs/Cu. Using this method an enhanced degree of dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix was observed as revealed by scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The CNTs/Cu composites were fabricated using the traditional powder metallurgy process.</p>

<p>The starting materials used in the present investigation were copper sulphate, ethylenediaammine tetraacetic acid, sodium borohydride, sodium dodecyl sulphate, sodium hydroxide (M/s Fisher Scientific), and multi walled carbon nanotubes (Nanocyl, Belgium diameter 15–25 nm; length 1.5 µm with specific area of 250–300 m<sup>2</sup>/g). In order to have better adhesion of CNTs with Cu matrix, their surface needs to be modified. Surface modification of the CNTs can be done by a number of methods reported e.g. ball milling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312443397">17</xref></sup> plasma functionalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312443397">18</xref></sup> or acid functionalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312443397">19</xref></sup> The key point of the present study is to improve the dispersion of CNTs in the Cu matrix. In order to achieve this target, it was necessary to attach some functional groups (−COOH, −OH, −NH<sub>2</sub>, etc.) on to the surface of CNTs so that they form a strong covalent bond at the interface between Cu ions and functionalized CNTs. We have employed acid functionalization in the current work. Acid functionalization of the CNTs was carried out by refluxing with a mixture of 3 : 1 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> at 80°C for 4 h, followed by washing with distilled water and drying in vacuum at 100°C for 12 h. By this treatment −COOH and −OH groups were attached on to the surface of CNTs thereby providing a site for the attachment of CNTs to the Cu matrix. Various functional groups attached on to the surface of CNTs was studied using Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) studies. Cu nanoparticles were synthesized by the reduction of the copper sulphate by a suitable reducing agent, (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) along with NaOH, which provides a basic environment and speeds up the reaction. For this purpose, a suspension of acid functionalized CNTs is firstly made in water. The electrostatic repulsion provided by the functional groups helps overcome the Van der Waal’s forces of attraction between the CNTs and helps in the formation of a stable suspension within the solvent. Secondly, a salt containing copper ions namely copper sulphate was added to the CNTs suspension. Further, sonication assisted in the formation of a homogeneous mixture of copper and CNTs. In order to avoid the oxidation of the synthesized Cu nanoparticles, a chelating agent, namely ethylenediamine tetraacitic acid (EDTA) was also added to the solution. The concentration of EDTA was found to be very effective in preventing the oxidation of Cu nanoparticles. Thus the effect of conc. of EDTA on the oxidation of Cu nanoparticles was also studied in the present work and varied from 0.1 M to 1.0 M. The CNTs/Cu composite powder was filtered and repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol to remove unwanted products and finally dried in vacuum. The CNTs/Cu composite powder prepared as above was further ball milled at 250 rpm for 3 h in a stainless steel jar with steel grinding balls using a Retch PM 100 high energy (Germany) planetary ball mill. The balls to powder weight ratio was kept constant at 10:1. It is expected that this treatment provided the grain refinement and also prevent the formation of any agglomerates. Finally the composite powder was dried at 60°C for 2 h under a vacuum of about 10<sup>−2 </sup>Torr. CNTs/Cu composites of various shapes and sizes in accordance with ASTM standards were fabricated by cold pressing the powders containing different wt.% of CNTs at 550 MPa followed by sintering in the range of 550–900°C for 2 h under a vacuum of 10<sup>−2</sup> Torr.</p>
<p>The dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix was studied out using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, model LEO 440) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, model Oxford link ISIS 300). An FEI model Technai G<sup>2</sup> F30 STWIN, 300 kV machine was used to carry out high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) studies on CNTs/Cu composite powder prepared in the present work. The effect of concentration of EDTA on the formation of Cu nanoparticles was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The XRD analysis was performed on a Rigaku Miniflex II desktop X-ray diffractometer using CuKα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation at room temperature. The microhardness measurement of CNTs/Cu composites was carried out on a Zwick 3212 microhardness tester under a load of 100 g with a dwell time of 15 s. For this purpose, the composites were polished well using a diamond paste in order to obtain a mirror like finish on the surface of the composite so that the indent could be seen clearly. Microhardness measurements were carried out at least at four different points of each sample and the average value was reported. Other mechanical properties such as the compressive strength and flexural strength of CNTs/Cu composites was measured using a Universal testing (Instron: Model 4104) machine. All measurements were done in accordance with the ASTM standard.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998312443397"><title>Results and discussions</title>
<p>The FTIR spectrum of pure and acid functionalized CNTs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312443397">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312443397">Figure 1</xref> shows the FT-IR spectra of (a) acid functionalized CNTs and (b) pure CNTs. It can be seen that there is modification of the spectra after acid treatment. Acid-treated CNTs show extra peaks at 1110 and 1706 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which are assigned to C–O–C and carbonyl group (C=O), respectively; bands at 1406 cm<sup>−1</sup> is due to hydroxyl group in carboxylic and phenolic acids, and (−OH) hydroxyl group peak is at 3400 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The presence of functional groups on to the surface of CNTs also provide electrostatic repulsion and help in overcoming the Van der Waal’s force of attraction between the CNTs, thereby increasing their dispersion in metal–matrix. In order to make a homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix, a number of methods are reported in the literature. One of the most promising methods is the use of high energy ball milling as reported by Esawi and Morsi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312443397">20</xref></sup> for the dispersion of CNTs in Al powder. Although this method has been found to be very effective for obtaining a uniform distribution of CNTs in any metal powder, the main drawback in this method is the damage of CNTs structure during high energy ball milling. Also, because of the cold welding of metal particles, it is very difficult to produce nanoscale metal powders. Thus, efforts are being made to synthesize Cu nanoparticles using the chemical reduction of some copper salts with sodium borohydride, ethylene glycol, amorphous carbon, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312443397">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312443397"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312443397"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312443397"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312443397"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312443397">26</xref></sup> However, one of major problems in these methods is the surface oxidation of Cu nanoparticles because Cu oxide phases are thermodynamically more stable than pure Cu. Also, Cu nanoparticles tend to agglomerate severely and, therefore, need proper protection. Thus, although the use of various protecting agents such as polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312443397">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312443397">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312443397">27</xref></sup> and organic ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312443397">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312443397">28</xref></sup> have been reported in the literature, formation of an oxide layer on Cu nanoparticles could not be completely avoided. In the present work, all these problems have been taken care in order to obtain Cu nanoparticles with minimum oxide contamination and in situ formation of CNTs/Cu composite powder with a high dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix. Our process involves suspending CNTs in a solvent by surface functionalization, mixing Cu ions in the CNTs suspension followed by reduction in the presence of a chelating agent to control or prevent the oxidation of Cu nanoparticles. The presence of functional groups on the surface of CNTs produce metal–oxygen bonds and such Cu–oxygen bonds at the interface in the CNTs/Cu composites are generated between the Cu ions and functionalized CNTs surface and, are the origin for an optimized CNTs/Cu interface.

</fig></p>
<p>It must be mentioned that in the present system mixing of Cu salt and CNTs was carried out in solution rather than in solid form as in traditional methods reported earlier, thereby, giving homogeneous distribution of CNTs in Cu matrix. A strong covalent bond results between functionalized CNTs and Cu nanoparticles, strengthening the interfacial bonding and decreasing agglomeration or bonding between the CNTs. However, it was found that even in solution, the complete oxidation of Cu nanoparticles was unavoidable resulting in the formation of CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles. In the present work, oxidation of Cu nanoparticles was avoided with the help of a chelating agent namely ethylene diaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) and a surfactant namely sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in order to disperse functionalized CNTs in the solvent. EDTA<sup>4−</sup> is a member of the polyamino carboxylic acid family of ligands. EDTA<sup>4−</sup> usually binds to a metal cation through its two amines and four carboxylates. In the present work we have investigated the effect of EDTA on the formation of CNTs/Cu composite powder as a function of concentration of EDTA. EDTA lets the metal ions remain in solution but greatly diminishes their activity, hence reducing their chances of being oxidized. This is an essential part in the formation of the CNTs/Cu composite powder. Copper nanoparticles have higher aspect ratio and hence show better interfacial bonding with CNTs. SDS is a well-known surfactant and dispersant. SDS promotes the dispersion of CNTs in the aqueous medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312443397">29</xref></sup> and is essential for the formation of a homogeneous CNTs/Cu nanocomposite. A schematic diagram showing chelation mechanism of EDTA and the d<bold>is</bold>persion effect of SDS is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312443397">Figure 2</xref>. Cu nanoparticles produced at the nanoscale showed difference in color from those of the Cu particles at micron level. A red/purple coloured powder is obtained due to the surface plasmon resonance effect. Both EDTA and SDS have been chosen as they are non-toxic and are already used commercially. The main advantage of the present method over other methods reported earlier is that it does not require the reduction in H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 400°C,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998312443397">31</xref></sup> which requires highly careful handling conditions. Our method is simple and effective for the synthesis of CNTs/Cu composite powder.

From this figure it is seen that with the use of 1 M EDTA the XRD peak intensity due to Cu<sub>2</sub>O (111) could be minimised. Cu in the (110) phase is in the highest abundance. For CNTs, generally the peak associated with the (002) diffraction is located at 2θ = 26.0°. Copper nanoparticles show characteristic peaks at 2θ = 43.2°, 50.4° and 73.2° corresponding to the fcc phase of copper.

The sites of agglomeration as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312443397">Figure 4(a)</xref> act as sites for the formation of cracks which propagate throughout the matrix, thereby, resulting in decrease of mechanical properties of composites.

Such a high dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix leads to improved interfacial bonding between Cu matrix and functionalized CNTs.

<p>CNTs/Cu composites (with 0.5–1.5 wt% CNTs) of various shapes and sizes in accordance with ASTM Standard were fabricated by cold pressing the powder in a steel die at a pressure of 550 MPa for 5 min followed by sintering at temperatures ranging from 550°C to 900°C for 2 h under a vacuum of 10<sup>−2 </sup>Torr. For most of the experiments 1.5 wt% loading of CNTs was used as already optimized for Al composites reinforced with functionalized CNTs in our earlier work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998312443397">32</xref></sup> At higher concentration of CNTs (3 wt%), they were found to be re-agglomerated in the composites thereby decreasing mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998312443397">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Microhardness measurement were carried out using a Zwick 3212 microhardness tester under a load of 100 g in accordance with ASTM standard E-384. Polishing of the samples with a fine diamond paste is essential for a mirror like image to ascertain the indentation mark. Also the hardness was measured at four different points and the average hardness values are reported. The compressive strength of the composites fabricated in this work was carried out on a Universal Testing Machine (Instron Model 4104) with a strain rate of 0.5 mm/min at room temperature. Cylindrical specimens for the compressive test were prepared having a diameter of 6 mm and length of 9 mm as prescribed in ASTM E9 Standard. Lubrication of the compressive samples was ensured to minimize frictional effects. At least 5 to 6 samples were tested for each composite to ensure repeatability and reliability of the method. The flexure strength of CNTs/Cu composites was carried out in accordance with ASTM standard E399-90S. The flexure strength was determined using the standard formula: Flexural strength (σ) in MPa = 3<italic>FL</italic>/2<italic>bd</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312443397">2</xref></sup>, where <italic>F</italic> is the load at the fracture point (Newton), <italic>L</italic> is the length of the support span, <italic>b</italic> the width and <italic>d</italic> the thickness of the specimen in millimeters.</p>
<p>Various mechanical properties of CNTs/Cu composites containing different wt% of functionalized CNTs and fabricated by cold pressing the composite powder at 550 MPa followed by sintering at 900°C for 2 h under a vacuum of 10<sup>−2 </sup>Torr are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312443397">Table 1</xref>. From this table it is seen that the relative density of CNTs/Cu composites decreased slightly with the increase of CNTs loading, from 93.4% to 91.8% for 0.5 wt% CNTs to 1.5 wt%, respectively. However, the other mechanical properties of CNTs/Cu composites produced with 1.5 wt% loading of CNTs showed significant improvement. This table shows the mechanical properties of CNTs/Cu composites produced in this work compared with values obtained by other researchers. From this table it is seen that a highest values of hardness (∼130 kg/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312443397">2</xref></sup>), compressive strength (∼995 MPa) and flexural strength (∼306 MPa) were obtained for CNTs/Cu composites (containing 1.5 wt% CNTs) and produced using a combination of molecular-level-mixing and high energy ball milling. It has been reported that the maximum tensile strength for nanostructured CNTs/Cu composites loaded with 1.0 wt% could be in the range of 1400–1600 MPa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998312443397">33</xref></sup> These values are much higher to the composites produced by simple ball milling and most other methods reported earlier. Such high compressive strengths can be attributed to the fact that copper shows a high level of ductility and load transfer to the CNTs. CNTs/Cu composites processed at lower temperatures (<italic>T</italic> &lt; 900°C) showed decrease in mechanical properties to those produced at 900°C and, are therefore, not reported.

<p>The composites with best mechanical properties were produced at a sintering temperature of 900°C. Composites processed at a lower temperatures showed diminished mechanical properties as those processed at 900°C at the same concentration of CNTs. The increase in mechanical properties can be attributed to the increase in density at a higher sintering temperatures. Porosity of the material is also expected to decrease and better interfacial bonding between the CNTs and Cu matrix is achieved. Enhanced mechanical properites can be attributed to the fact that there is transfer of load from Cu matrix to the CNTs which can withstand higher load capacities. For the efficient transfer of load it is important to have interfacial bonding between the Cu matrix and CNTs. Interfacial bonding is aided by two main factors, namely acid functionalization of CNTs resulting in active sites of attachment of CNTs to the metal matrix and secondly to the homogeneous distribution of CNTs allowing for better load sharing.</p>
<p>In order to further evaluate the mechanical properties of CNTs/Cu composites fabricated under the present work, wear test was performed on few copper composites reinforced with 1.5 wt% acid functionalized CNTs and sintered at 900°C for 2 h under a vacuum of 10<sup>−2 </sup>Torr. In these composites, the CNTs/Cu composite powder was prepared by a combination of molecular-level-mixing followed by high energy ball milling. The tests were carried out on samples of cylindrical shape of size 6 mm diameter and 10 mm length on a “pin on disc” method under a constant speed of 200 rpm. A load of 2 kg was applied for 5 min and the wear loss in each sample was measured. From these tests it was found that the wear was almost negligible in case of Cu composites loaded with 1.5 wt.% CNTs in comparison to those observed for pure Cu composites and processed under similar conditions. The good wear resistance observed in case of CNTs/Cu composites could be attributed to the good interfacial bonding between Cu and CNTs, a high relative density and uniform distribution of CNTs in the copper matrix, realized by molecular-level mixing followed by ball milling. In case of these composites, the Cu grains are not peeled from the worn surface by the pinning of homogeneously implanted CNTs across Cu grains in CNTs/Cu composites. At the same time, the CNTs exposed to the worn surface during the wear process can act as a lubricating carbon film owing to its low friction coefficient. Therefore, the wear loss of CNTs/Cu composites is remarkably decreased due to the effect of homogeneous distribution of CNTs in Cu matrix and low friction coefficient of exposed CNTs on the worn surface.</p>

<p>In the present method, the current CNTs/Cu composite powder was prepared using a combination of molecular-level-mixing followed by high energy ball milling. This method results in the enhancement of dispersion of CNTs in Cu matrix as revealed by HRTEM. The present method is not only a fast and efficient method but also leads to the enhancement of various mechanical properties of CNTs/Cu nanocomposites over previously reported methods, and hence is a method which can be utilized for facile synthesis of CNTs/Cu nanocomposites.</p>
