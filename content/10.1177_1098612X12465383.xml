<title>Overview of the problem</title>
<p>The AAFP supports the welfare of all cats, and strongly supports public education and efforts to promote responsible care of unowned, abandoned and feral cats. The numbers of free-roaming, abandoned and feral cats in the United States are estimated to range from 70 to 100 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12465383">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12465383">2</xref></sup> Ignoring this population has implications for the welfare of the cats themselves, public health, wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1098612X12465383">
<title>Welfare considerations</title>
<p>Compared with owned cats, the welfare of these cats is significantly diminished. The mortality rate of kittens born in an outdoor environment can approach 75% by 6 months of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12465383">3</xref></sup> Their life expectancy is often less than 5 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12465383">3</xref></sup> during which time they may have a poor quality of life.

<title>Public health</title>
<p>Unowned free-roaming cats pose important threats to human health.

<title>Wildlife ecology and ecosystem disruption</title>
<p>Free-roaming cats are responsible for considerable wildlife destruction and ecosystem disruption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12465383">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12465383">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12465383"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12465383"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098612X12465383"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12465383"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12465383">9</xref></sup> Free-roaming cats are efficient predators, resulting in significant mortality of small mammals, reptiles and birds in a wide variety of ecosystems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12465383">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus it is clear that all of the above populations (ie, the public, wildlife and feline) stand to benefit from the reduction in population of free-roaming, feral and abandoned cats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1098612X12465383">
<title>Positive efforts directed at population reduction</title>
<p>The AAFP strongly supports reducing the numbers of unowned, free-roaming, abandoned and feral cats through humane capture (with placement in homes where appropriate) by local health departments, humane societies and animal control agencies in accordance with local and state ordinances.</p>
<p>State and local agencies are encouraged to promote public policies that:</p>
<list id="list1-1098612X12465383" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Require rabies vaccination for all cats.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Require sterilization of all cats adopted from humane organizations and animal control agencies, wholesale and retail pet suppliers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Require sterilization of privately owned cats prior to sale or adoption if they are not intended for breeding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Require microchip identification of all owned cats (2008 AAFP Position Statement on Identification of Cats).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Require keeping owned cats indoors, in an outdoor enclosure, or on an attended leash (2007 AAFP Position Statement on Confinement of Owned Indoor Cats).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prevent the establishment of managed cat colonies in areas where cats pose a threat to protected wildlife.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prohibit the abandonment of cats.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1098612X12465383">
<title>Non-lethal strategies</title>
<p>The AAFP supports non-lethal strategies to promote population reduction of free-roaming, abandoned and feral cats. All public, private and non-profit humane organizations must make every effort to promote adoption of acceptable unowned cats.</p>
<p>Permanent, enduring solutions to the problem of free-roaming, abandoned and feral cats will be achievable when:</p>
<list id="list2-1098612X12465383" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>State and local agencies provide significantly increased funding to animal control agencies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Concerted and sustained public educational campaigns aimed at highlighting the problems associated with unowned cats and the solutions to these problems are in place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An environmentally safe and effective non-surgical contraceptive is developed.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Until such permanent solutions are achieved, alternate humane solutions exist.</p>
<sec id="section8-1098612X12465383">
<title>Managed cat colonies</title>
<p>The AAFP supports appropriately managed cat colonies. Humane alternatives to the destruction of healthy cats for animal control purposes should be actively pursued by veterinary, humane and wildlife organizations. The goal of colony management should be the eventual reduction of the colony through attrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098612X12465383">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098612X12465383"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098612X12465383"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098612X12465383">13</xref></sup> The AAFP opposes placement of managed cat colonies on public lands (except by lawful permit), in areas where at-risk wildlife could be threatened, or in areas where they pose a significant disease risk to wildlife and the public.</p>
<p>The AAFP recognizes that managed colonies are controversial;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12465383">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12465383">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12465383">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12465383">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12465383"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098612X12465383">10</xref></sup> however, properly managed programs promote the quality of life of cats through nutrition, vaccination, decreasing the numbers of unwanted litters, euthanasia of sick and debilitated cats, and adoption of healthy kittens. Appropriately managed colonies also significantly decrease the risk to public health, wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098612X12465383">
<title>Cooperative efforts aimed at population reduction of free-roaming, abandoned and feral cats</title>
<p>The AAFP recognizes a mutual goal between humane groups and wildlife conservation entities for reducing the number of free-roaming, abandoned and feral cats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12465383">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12465383">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12465383">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098612X12465383">14</xref></sup> and therefore supports cooperative efforts by all stakeholders in developing solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>The AAFP strongly supports widespread education of the public about the negative implications of feeding of non-sterilized free-roaming cats, since this behavior is an important contributor to the problem.</p>
<p>Continued abandonment of cats perpetuates the problem, and the public should be educated about the adverse effects of this behavior on wildlife, ecosystems and feline welfare.</p>
<p>Since a ‘do nothing’ approach is non-productive, positive public involvement should be encouraged to help develop solutions and direct public behavior towards existing alternatives.</p>

<title>Microchipping in cats</title>
<p>The accurate and permanent identification of pet cats is both important and desirable, and has been regarded as an essential component of cats’ welfare. Having this information is vital in reuniting cats with their owners should a cat ever stray, escape or get lost. While collars with tags can be used to identify cats and carry contact information, these are not ideal as they can sometimes cause serious and life-threatening injury and/or can be broken or separated from the cat.</p>
<sec id="section11-1098612X12465383">
<title>Microchips for cats</title>
<p>ISFM is in agreement with both the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) in affirming that microchipping of dogs and cats is safe and very rarely associated with any significant problems.</p>
<p>A permanent microchip conforming to the internationally recognised ISO Full Duplex standard (numbers ISO 11784 and 11785) is the best option for the identification of cats. These are available from a wide range of manufacturers/ suppliers and the standards ensure the microchip can be widely identified throughout the world by using a suitable ISO-compatible scanner.</p>
<p>The microchip itself is a tiny implant, typically about the size of a grain of rice, inserted under the skin and is usually implanted in a very similar way to administering a vaccine. The microchip is then linked to a central database (eg, the National PetLog Database) that holds all the details of the pet and the owner. Should the cat become lost or separated from its owner, a microchip scanner can be used to identify the cat and the owner. Both veterinary clinics and rescue shelters routinely use microchip scanners to identify pets, including cats, that have become separated from their owners.</p>
<p>Importantly, in addition to being able to identify lost cats, the use of microchips allows the results of tests (eg, genetic tests for certain diseases) to be stored alongside a cat’s unique microchip number. For such purposes, samples (eg, cheek swabs or blood samples) should be collected and submitted to a testing laboratory by a veterinary surgeon, who checks and certifies the microchip number at the same time.</p>

<title>Safety concerns with microchips</title>
<p>While the procedure should cause little or no discomfort, it is important that only a veterinary surgeon or other properly trained individual administers the microchip, as the incorrect placement of a microchip can have severe consequences. Significant complications from the appropriate implantation of microchips in cats appear to be exceptionally rare. Data reviewed by the WSAVA suggest microchips are a safe and effective means of identifying pets. They also state that, of the many millions of animals that have been microchipped, only a tiny proportion have had any type of problem reported (and usually simply related to movement or loss of the chip).</p>
<p>The Microchip Advisory Group (MAG) monitors adverse events associated with microchipping in the UK. Between 1996 and 2011 a total of 431 adverse events had been reported in all species (dogs, cats, exotics, etc), representing an average of approximately 27 each year. The most common adverse events reported were:</p>
<list id="list3-1098612X12465383" list-type="bullet">

<p>The British Small Animal Veterinary Association (BSAVA) released a report from the MAG in 2004 which documented that adverse events had been recorded in a total of 235 dogs from an estimated 2.3 million that had been microchipped (ie, in approximately 0.01% of microchipped dogs). In the same data there had been 36 adverse events reported in cats.</p>
<p>Concern has been raised by some about the potential for implanted microchips to cause some types of cancer at the microchip site (eg, fibrosarcomas), and this has been suggested as a reason to avoid microchipping. However, if microchips ever cause the formation of tumours in dogs and cats, the risk appears to be incredibly low. Data from the MAG show that from 1996 to 2011 there were just three reports, across all species, of a tumour developing possibly as a result of the microchip. Currently in the published literature we are also aware of two case reports of cats and two case reports of dogs developing tumours at, or adjacent to, the site of a microchip. However, in none of these cases could the formation of the tumour be directly linked to the microchip itself.</p>
<p>If microchips are a cause of certain cancers in either dogs or cats, this appears to be exceptionally rare, and the benefits of microchips in providing permanent identification of cats (and dogs) vastly outweigh any potential risks. Nevertheless, where adverse events are suspected, it is important that these are always documented and notified to the appropriate authorities.</p>

<title>Bite-sized reviews</title>
<p><bold>Feline dentistry – oral assessment, treatment and preventative care</bold></p>
<p>1st ed. J Bellows. Wiley-Blackwell, Ames, Iowa, 2010. Hardback, 304 pages. Price £65.95. ISBN 978081381613-5.</p>
<graphic id="img10-1098612X12465383" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1098612X12465383-img10.tif"/>
<p><bold>Positives</bold> This book is extremely well illustrated with an abundance of clinical photographs, sketches and radiographs. It is easy to read and each chapter provides a step-by-step outline from making a diagnosis to formulating a treatment plan. Good detail is given about equipment required for treatment and guidelines on how to perform procedures.</p>
<p><bold>Negatives</bold> There are no references and the text contains many unsubstantiated claims as well as numerous inaccuracies. An extensive further reading list is given at the end of each chapter but is not referred to in the text itself.</p>
<p><bold>Target audience</bold> General practitioners with an interest in feline dentistry.</p>
<p><bold>Comment</bold> This is a useful book as a reference for oral assessment and treatment in cats, courtesy of the high number of illustrations. As a sole text on feline veterinary dentistry it leaves the reader short but, as Professor Colin Harvey says in the preface, this has created material that others can build upon. The concept and what the author sets out to achieve would have been excellent had a bit more effort gone into referencing the text, which would have given a more scientific feel to the book. The glaring errors and unsubstantiated text would steer any veterinary diploma student away from this book.</p>

<p><bold>BSAVA manual of canine and feline rehabilitation, supportive and palliative care</bold></p>
<p>S Lindley and P Watson, eds. BSAVA, Gloucester, 2010. Paperback, 416 pages. Price £78.00. ISBN 9781905319206.</p>
<graphic id="img12-1098612X12465383" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1098612X12465383-img12.tif"/>
<p><bold>Positives</bold> This manual addresses the complex and often subjective area of rehabilitation and patient care using a refreshingly new approach. This involves assembling a group of contributors with a very wide range and depth of experience across the whole subject field, and tasking them with collaborating to provide a global approach to many common clinical problems. The unique team approach, with many gems of information imparted along the way, is maintained throughout. The experience and common sense shines through in the case discussions, combined with a full understanding and knowledge of how current state-of-the-art practice can best be employed. Another refreshing element is the amount of feline information. No progressive practice should be without this book.</p>
<p><bold>Negatives</bold> It is very difficult to find any real negatives with this work.</p>
<p><bold>Target audience</bold> Any care professional interested in an integrated approach to progressive health care including veterinary practitioners, specialists, nurses, physiotherapists and hydrotherapists.</p>
<p><bold>Comment</bold> Practice teams will be reaching for this book again and again to improve the way that they can provide additional clinical benefits to the cases they are treating. The case approach works extremely well to bring out the complexities in case management and the decision-making process. Its focus on evidence-based techniques in this area is commendable. The manual is very easy to read and is well illustrated. It is also very simple to refer to when faced with a problem in a particular area. The style is repetitive but I feel that this establishes a common approach.</p>

<p><bold>Positives</bold> This book has an engaging question and answer format, useful for those studying or interested in small animal orthopaedics. The format is such that you can pick up the book and read it from any page. There is impressive theoretical content for such a small book.</p>
<p><bold>Negatives</bold> Some images, particularly of radiographs, could be clearer. The book is a reprint with no new content over the fourth edition. References for statements in the answers are not included.</p>
<p><bold>Target audience</bold> Undergraduate students, postgraduate certificate or diploma candidates and veterinary surgeons with an interest in small animal orthopaedics.</p>
<p><bold>Comment</bold> This book is a valuable addition to the library of a student, undergraduate or postgraduate interested in small animal orthopaedics. The format is similar to ‘spot tests’ in final year, certificate and diploma examinations and the book is an incredibly useful resource for testing your knowledge prior to those important examinations.</p>
