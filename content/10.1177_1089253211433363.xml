<abstract>
<p>Aortic aneurysms have been recognized since at least the 2nd century. However, little progress in their treatment was made until the early 1800s, when surgical ligation of these lesions sometimes proved successful. Until the mid 20th century, the most widespread approach was indirect treatment to provide palliation and prevent rupture. Such treatment involved introducing foreign materials into the aneurysm to promote blood coagulation or wrapping the aneurysm with plastic film to stimulate periarterial fibrosis. In 1888, Rudolph Matas introduced endoaneurysmorrhaphy, in which the diseased portion of the aorta was removed and a tunnel was constructed through the remaining healthy portion. This approach was widely used until the 1950s, when the advent of synthetic grafts allowed modern, direct repair. Emphasis began to be placed on excising aortic aneurysms and restoring pulsatile distal flow. In the 1980s, however, most surgeons reverted to the endoaneurysmorrhaphy technique—this time relining rather than removing the diseased portion of the aorta—thus bringing the history of aortic aneurysm surgery full circle. Today, an increasing number of aortic repairs are being achieved with endovascular methods, which offer new hope to patients at high risk for traditional aortic surgery.</p>

<body>
<p>Aortic surgery largely involves the management of aneurysms, which have been known as potentially ominous lesions since ancient times. The first true description of an aneurysm was given by Galen of Pergamon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253211433363">1</xref></sup> in the 2nd century. Around the same time, Antyllus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253211433363">2</xref></sup> a Greek surgeon, proposed that aneurysms were due to clotting. For aneurysms of peripheral vessels, he ligated the artery above and below the lesion to remove the clot, but this procedure did not gain widespread use. In 1555, the Flemish surgeon Vesalius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253211433363">3</xref></sup> became possibly the first to describe thoracic and abdominal aneurysms. His contemporary, Ambroise Paré, of Paris, stated that opening an aneurysm would result in fatal bleeding and that “the aneurysms which happen in the internal parts are incurable.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253211433363">4</xref></sup> A major milestone occurred in 1728, with the publication of <italic>De Motu Cordis et Aneurysmatibus</italic> by Lancisi,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253211433363">5</xref></sup> who described the etiology and pathology of aneurysms and presented relevant case studies.</p>
<sec id="section1-1089253211433363">
<title>Early Modern Treatments</title>
<p>In the late 18th century, the English surgeon John Hunter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253211433363">6</xref></sup> began to treat aneurysms of the peripheral vessels directly by means of ligation. In 1817, Hunter’s pupil Astley Cooper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253211433363">7</xref></sup> became the first to use this method for managing an aortic aneurysm. Ideally, ligation would result in thrombosis and eventual obliteration of the lesion. Distal ligation proved unsatisfactory, however, as it entailed considerable risk and had only moderate palliative value. Likewise, proximal ligation resulted in a high incidence of cerebral complications, aneurysmal recurrence, and necrosis at the ligation site with resultant hemorrhage. Combined proximal and distal ligation was somewhat more successful, but it involved a risk of ischemic damage. No wonder Sir William Osler stated in 1900 that “[t]here is no disease more conducive to clinical humility than aneurysms of the aorta.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253211433363">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Between the late 1800s and early 1950s, physicians also used a variety of indirect approaches to provide palliation and prevent rupture. One such approach involved introducing foreign materials into the lesion to promote blood coagulation. The most successful of these materials was wire. In 1864, Moore and Murchison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253211433363">9</xref></sup> inserted silver wire into a thoracic aneurysm to induce clot formation. Fifteen years later, Corradi used the same method but also passed a galvanic current through the wire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253211433363">10</xref></sup> Although electrolysis was practiced for several decades, its results were not generally impressive until 1938, when Blakemore and King<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253211433363">11</xref></sup> devised an accurate means for electrothermic coagulation of aneurysms. Meanwhile, in 1903, Colt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253211433363">12</xref></sup> had pioneered the use of a small wire umbrella, which was inserted through a cannula and then expanded inside the aneurysm―foreshadowing current endovascular therapies.</p>
<p>Surgeons also attempted to manage aneurysms of the thoracic aorta and its major tributaries by stimulating periarterial fibrosis, which induced scarring and reinforced the aneurysmal wall. The preferred technique, introduced in 1943 by Harrison and Chandy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253211433363">13</xref></sup> was to wrap the aneurysm with cellophane, which contains the irritant dicetyl phosphate. Later, Poppe and De Oliviera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253211433363">14</xref></sup> used various types of polythene plastic films for this purpose. The results were unpredictable, but numerous physicians reported successful treatments. Today, these methods are interesting only from a historical standpoint.</p>
<p>The most important breakthrough in the management of aneurysms occurred in 1888, when Matas introduced endoaneurysmorrhaphy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253211433363">15</xref></sup> This procedure evolved into 3 forms: obliterative, restorative, and reconstructive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253211433363">16</xref></sup> The reconstructive approach involved removing the diseased portion of the aorta and constructing a tunnel through the remaining healthy portion. It was widely used in treating aortic aneurysms for more than half a century. Although endoaneurysmorrhaphy was abandoned in the 1950s after the advent of synthetic grafts, it was reintroduced in the 1980s by myself and other surgeons who desired a more physiologic repair (see section Current Aortic Treatment).</p>

<title>Modern Direct Repair</title>
<p>In the mid 20th century, with the advent of aortic substitutes, the emphasis began to shift from indirect, palliative treatments to direct repair. The groundwork for this shift had been laid by Carrel and Guthrie,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253211433363">17</xref></sup> who experimented with homograft aortic substitutes and vascular anastomoses in the early 1900s. Most of the first attempts at excising aortic lesions involved cases of coarctation. In 1944, Alexander and Byron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253211433363">18</xref></sup> successfully removed a descending aortic aneurysm associated with coarctation but did not try to restore aortic continuity. Other pioneers during this period included Crafoord and Nylin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253211433363">19</xref></sup> who performed an end-to-end anastomosis to restore aortic continuity after resecting a coarctation of the thoracic aorta; Shumacker,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253211433363">20</xref></sup> who completely excised a small aneurysm along with the coarcted segment and then anastomosed the aortic ends primarily; Swan et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253211433363">21</xref></sup> who used an aortic homograft to bridge the defect that remained after a similar excision; and Gross,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253211433363">22</xref></sup> who used preserved homografts to treat aortic coarctation. Successful excision of aortic aneurysms not associated with coarctation was first reported by Ochsner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253211433363">23</xref></sup> and Meyer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253211433363">24</xref></sup> who used a technique suggested earlier by Tuffier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253211433363">25</xref></sup> for restoring aortic continuity. Other pioneers of homograft aortic replacement included Hufnagel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253211433363">26</xref></sup> Gross et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253211433363">27</xref></sup> Bahnson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253211433363">28</xref></sup> Oudot,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253211433363">29</xref></sup> and Dubost et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1089253211433363">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The shift toward direct treatment coincided with my surgical training period. I first became involved in the treatment of aortic aneurysms in 1949, when I was a resident at Johns Hopkins. One day, I was assisting Dr Grant Ward in removing an infected metallic prosthesis from a patient who had previously undergone resection of an osteochondral sarcoma of the manubrium. As the prosthesis was withdrawn from the sternum, blood suddenly gushed from an underlying pseudoaneurysm. Dr Ward suffered from brachial plexus paralysis related to syringomyelia. He had to wear a right shoulder splint, so his right arm was partially disabled. To control the bleeding from the patient’s pseudoaneurysm, he thrust his left hand and index finger into the opening. Because this maneuver left him helpless, he asked me to repair the ascending aorta. I applied a pectoralis muscle patch, and the patient survived. This repair attracted a lot of attention in the medical community. It convinced me that surgeons should be able to cut out aneurysms and reconnect the remaining, healthy segments of the vessel.</p>
<p>I would soon test this theory when my chief, Dr Alfred Blalock, left me in charge of his practice while he went to Hawaii as a visiting professor. In his absence, a 32-year-old man was admitted with a large aneurysm of the right subclavian artery, which was on the verge of rupturing. Two months earlier, Dr Blalock had repaired an aortic coarctation in this patient. Although the subclavian aneurysm was present at that time, Dr Blalock decided to delay treatment. Now that the aneurysm had enlarged, it needed to be treated. I performed a “trap door” sternotomy, with an intercostal and supraclavicular approach, and excised the lesion by ligating the subclavian artery proximally and distally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253211433363">31</xref></sup> The patient did well and was soon back at work. When Dr. Blalock returned, he was astounded by the successful repair.</p>
<p>In 1951, I joined the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine, where Dr Michael DeBakey headed the Department of Surgery. My first day on the job, during morning rounds with Dr DeBakey and his staff, one of the patients was a 46-year-old man who had a large aneurysm of the innominate artery and aortic arch. The aneurysm threatened to rupture through the chest wall. As Dr DeBakey reviewed the patient’s chart, he said, “We have a new staff man here today. Maybe he has an idea. Dr Cooley, what do you consider ought to be done?” When I responded that I thought the aneurysm should be surgically removed, he was skeptical but suggested that I give it a try. The next morning, I took the patient to the operating room and occluded the base of the aneurysm with a large Crafoord clamp. I then opened the lesion, ligated the distal common carotid and subclavian arteries, and sutured the aortic opening. This technique, reported as a tangential excision and aortorrhaphy, was possibly the first aneurysm repair of its kind.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253211433363">31</xref></sup> It soon became the recommended treatment for sacciform aneurysms of the thoracic aorta. Within a few weeks, Dr DeBakey and I performed 4 more such procedures. Later in 1951, he presented those 4 cases and my first 2 Hopkins cases at a meeting of the Southern Surgical Association. The presentation was met with great acclaim, and it changed the minds of many surgeons regarding the preferred treatment for aortic aneurysms. Emphasis began to be placed on excising these lesions and restoring pulsatile distal flow.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, I repaired a ruptured abdominal aneurysm—the first time this had ever been attempted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253211433363">32</xref></sup> Although the patient survived the operation, he died of kidney failure 5 days later. I soon repaired 4 more ruptured aneurysms. In 1952, Mike DeBakey and I became the first to use a homograft in repairing a large aneurysm of the thoracoabdominal aorta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253211433363">33</xref></sup> Later, we successfully replaced the ascending aorta (1956)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253211433363">34</xref></sup> and the aortic arch (1957)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1089253211433363">35</xref></sup> with aortic homografts.</p>
<p>Definitive treatment of aortic aneurysms was advanced by the introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass in 1953 and by the subsequent advent of synthetic grafts and improved suture materials. Aortic homografts were in short supply and were vulnerable to early and late complications. Moreover, synthetic aortic substitutes were essential for the restoration of distal peripheral flow in patients with extensive sacciform and especially fusiform lesions involving most of the circumference of the aortic wall. Aided by textile engineers, surgical investigators experimented with tube grafts made of nylon, Vinyon-N, Teflon, Orlon, Ivalon, and polyester. With all these fabrics, however, durability remained a problem. Some fibers deteriorated rapidly in the body, and others failed to form a strong bond with surrounding tissues. Eventually, Dacron polyester proved superior to all the others. Later, velour knitted grafts were introduced by Sauvage et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1089253211433363">36</xref></sup> DeBakey et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1089253211433363">37</xref></sup> and my own team at the Texas Heart Institute.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1089253211433363">38</xref></sup> Standardization of porosity was an important factor in the development of clinically suitable grafts. For fully heparinized patients, particularly those undergoing cardio pulmonary bypass, tightly woven, low-porosity grafts were essential, whereas in patients needing peripheral grafts in which the caliber is smaller and long-term healing important, knitted velour grafts were preferred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1089253211433363">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1089253211433363">40</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-1089253211433363">
<title>Current Aortic Treatment</title>
<p>Currently, the preferred surgical approach to the repair of aortic aneurysms is endoaneurysmorrhaphy, originally described by Matas. By relining, rather than removing, the diseased portion of the aorta, surgeons achieve a more physiologic repair. Also, the aneurysmal wall remains intact, so blood loss and trauma to surrounding tissues are minimized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1089253211433363">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Protection of the spinal cord and brain from ischemic injury during aortic cross-clamping remains a major challenge. At the Texas Heart Institute, we have achieved excellent results by using a method of exsanguination, or open distal repair,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1089253211433363">42</xref></sup> made possible by the advent of rapid autotransfusion. We place a single cross-clamp proximal to the aneurysm and allow the intercostal and lumbar arteries to drain freely during aortic occlusion. This approach shortens the induced ischemic time and lowers the cerebrospinal-fluid and central venous pressures. With its use, our average distal ischemic time during graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta is 22.4 minutes.</p>
<p>Today, the endovascular approach—based on balloon angioplasty and stent grafting—is being increasingly used in the treatment of aortic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1089253211433363">43</xref></sup> By eliminating the need for an extensive incision, this approach reduces postoperative pain, shortens hospitalization, and speeds recovery. Although its long-term results are unknown, endovascular treatment offers hope for patients who, because of advanced age or comorbidity, are at high risk for traditional surgery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These days, the direct repair of aortic aneurysms is so taken for granted, it is easy to forget that this type of surgery has such a brief history. Looking back over my long career, I am gratified to have been able to witness, or participate in, so many of the advances that made this lifesaving surgery possible.</p>
