<p>This slender volume is written in a ruggedly economical and direct style that reminds me a little of Aristotle’s <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic>. The book also contains more value than all but the best bioethics books of two or three times its size. This value is in both its contents and its methods of ethical inquiry.</p>
<p>Wilkinson’s topic is acquisition of human organs. He consequently discusses allocation of such organs only when doing so substantially bears on acquisition. It has such a bearing when the issue is conditional organ donation or giving allocative priority to donors. The book also focuses on clinical and public policy more than on professional−client interaction.</p>
<p>Wilkinson first sets out some core facts, especially on the nature and size of organ shortages and on whether they are avoidable. Chapter 2 argues for the centrality of moral rights, especially those of bodily integrity and of personal sovereignty, and also argues that these underpin the significance of informed consent. Chapter 3 argues that it is possible for individuals to be harmed or benefited posthumously, and it spells this out in terms that draw on and develop leading work by George Pitcher and by Joel Feinberg. Wilkinson puts his account of posthumous interests to work in Chapter 4 by connecting it to rights of personal sovereignty and by examining its significance for the acquisition of organs from the dead.</p>
<p>Wilkinson next examines contentious issues about organ acquisition: the role of the individual’s family in decision-making about organ acquisition (Chapter 5); the role of the dead individual’s wishes and consent when it is uncertain what these wishes were (Chapter 6); the conscription of organs (Chapter 7); living-donor organ acquisition (Chapter 8); conditional organ donation (Chapter 9); and the sale of organs (Chapter 10). He argues for many significant conclusions, including that: a form of family veto of the dead individual’s informed consent to donate can be justified (pp. 76f.); the personal sovereignty of the now-dead person whose wishes are not known is best served by following the best guess as to what those wishes were and is not best served by requiring consent (pp. 82f.); conditional organ donation can be justified if the result is more organs for some and no worse access for anyone, even if the donor sets racist conditions (pp. 148f.); and one should be legally allowed to sell one’s organs because disallowing this infringes one’s rights over one’s own body and no rival factors are more weighty than this (pp. 168f.). In every chapter, Wilkinson’s constructive arguments are clear, sophisticated and powerful, and his politely plain-speaking critical arguments offer his peers a good deal to re-think.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, ‘The dead and their families’, Wilkinson argues for all of the following: if delegated this authority by the individual, the family may decide whether to permit or prevent retrieval of her or his organs; the family does not have a justified claim in its own right to any such role; one’s general consent to donate does not imply that one consents to this being done even if one’s family objects or is distressed; a right to offer one’s organ does not imply any right that anyone accept this offer; and overriding the family’s objection or distress would reduce the supply of organs by causing poor publicity and other bad effects. Wilkinson argues from these and other considerations to the conclusion that if faced with family resistance, medical staff may legitimately turn down the individual’s offer of an organ by citing justified fear of bad publicity and a consequent fall in the supply of organs, and that they can do this without infringing any right of the potential donor (p. 79).</p>
<p>As always, the Chapter 5 arguments are nuanced, original and weighty. They saw me change my mind on several central issues. Even so, I was not moved to Wilkinson’s overall conclusion. I hope that in further work he will also consider the following thoughts: in general, a transplant clinician who declines an organ for fear that acceptance would have bad consequences does infringe the individual’s right to offer her or his organs <italic>to suitable potential recipients</italic>, because it prevents the individual from making that offer; a particularly powerful consequence-based case is needed to justify such a rights infringement; Wilkinson’s consequence-based case is shallow and contingent by his own lights, because it is not based on any justified family claim to a role in the matter; and the effects of overriding family wishes here depend heavily on the actions of the responsible clinicians.</p>
<p>Take a few more steps beyond the last point above. Suppose practice changes, such that one’s informed consent to donate now includes consent to do this even if one’s family objects or is distressed. Suppose also that a clinician does accept such a donation, and then front-foots the news media roughly as follows: ‘We know Bill’s informed wish was to donate his organs even if his family objects, and we know there are sick patients who are willing to consider Bill’s offer. My first responsibility is to my patients: to those who speak their wishes clearly – as Bill has done, and to those who cannot speak for themselves – as Bill now cannot. I helped Bill to make his potentially life-saving offer to other patients who are in need. In doing so I acted on my core responsibilities as best I see them. This also caused distress to Bill’s family. I am sorry for this, and I am sorry for the loss of Bill. I also believe I did the right thing.’ If this were the practice, and if this were the leadership the clinicians offered to the public, why think there would be bad publicity or fewer organs donated?</p>
<p>Turn now to matters of method. The Wilkinson method of practical ethics involves an ethically informed setting-out of key facts on the practical matter in question. It also involves thorough analysis of the core ethical factors. In transplantation, these factors are especially but not only: rights of personal integrity and bodily sovereignty; harms and benefits; and distributive justice and fairness. Part of the work is in the content and scope of each ethical consideration. For example, Wilkinson argues that the scope of harm and benefit includes posthumous instances and that the scope of personal sovereignty rights over one’s body includes a right to offer one’s organ but not a right to have that offer accepted. His method also sometimes involves working out the basis of the relevant ethical considerations. For example, he carefully considers whether rights of personal sovereignty are based on agency or instead on interests, as well as the differences this might make to his target practical issues. Where there is relevant divergence in reasonable ethical views, Wilkinson also in effect seeks points of potential consensus that respect this fact of reasonable diversity. He does this, for example, when he canvasses justice-centred issues about conditional organ donation.</p>
<p>Wilkinson is alive to the fact that even when all is said on the nature and limits of each ethical factor, in various settings some might conflict with others in certain ways. In that event, he assesses the comparative stringency of the conflicting ethical factors. For instance, he considers whether personal sovereignty rights conflict with other ethical factors, and where they conflict he considers whether they yield or override. He does this in broad general terms at p. 22, and with concrete nuance and sophistication in each applicable practical setting throughout the book.</p>
<p>Wilkinson’s methods of ethics are emphasized above. He does not emphasize his methods himself, and this is a pity. First, their wide use in bioethics would be fruitful. Second, there is a risk that this innovation of his might be misunderstood or even missed altogether. There is already some evidence of this.</p>
<p>Writing in <italic>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</italic> (28 May 2012), Robert Veatch responds as follows to Wilkinson on acquisition of organs from those whose wishes are not known: ‘The chapter is frustrating for its failure to explore adequately whether there is a fundamental lack of parallel between … taking without explicit permission … and failing to take.’ This reviewer’s remark is itself frustrating for its failure to engage with Wilkinson’s explicit and sophisticated account (‘No safe side to err on’, pp. 87−90) of these matters, and also of the difficulties in the rival accounts of Veatch and others. With a larger target, Veatch also writes: ‘What is glaringly missing in the chapter on sales and throughout the volume is any careful analysis of the limits on the right of personal sovereignty … Any defender of directed donation and markets in organs bears the responsibility for explicating what those limits are.’</p>
<p>One wonders about the responsibilities of reviewers. The present review has argued that Wilkinson offers a first-rate account of the nature and limits of personal sovereignty as it bears on the family’s role in organ-acquisition decisions. He does the same on every topic he discusses. On directed donation and markets in organs, for example, he need only argue that rights of personal sovereignty apply and that their force is not overridden in either setting by any other factors. This is what he does.</p>
<p>I conclude by endorsing an overall point also made by Robert Veatch: ‘This small book puts forward the best … analysis yet available of the grounds for donating and otherwise supplying organs for transplant.’</p>
