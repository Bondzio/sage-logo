<p>Drs Michael Jaff and Christopher White, experts in the field of vascular medicine, have combined to edit an authoritative resource illustrating the diagnosis and management of common as well as lesser known vascular disorders. The individual chapters within <italic>Vascular Disease: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches</italic> are authored by knowledgeable, practicing vascular medicine, cardiovascular, interventional cardiology and vascular surgery physicians.</p>
<p>The book is constructed in eight sections. Part 1 focuses on the evaluation of patients with peripheral vascular disease. Parts 2 through 5 comprehensively detail the evaluation and management of arterial vascular disease. Part 7 discusses common and uncommon venous disorders. Parts 6 and 8 complete the spectrum of vascular disorders covering non-atherosclerotic vascular disease as well as thrombophilia and other less commonly managed vascular disorders.</p>
<p>There are 26 individual chapters highlighting the editors’ and authors’ expertise amongst the 582 pages. Most chapters begin with a discussion on the epidemiology, evaluation, clinical and imaging diagnostic strategies for the disease and conclude with an up-to-date and appropriate discussion illustrating the medical management, available endovascular or interventional therapy and, when appropriate, the surgical considerations for the disease process. Each chapter uses clinical images, diagrams and drawings to illustrate both clinical and diagnostic findings as well as therapeutic considerations. Tables and diagnostic algorithms are used to convey important diagnostic and management information.</p>
<p>This book is well suited for its intended audience of students, physicians-in-training, and practicing clinicians. Almost all medical and surgical subspecialties, including internal medicine, primary care, cardiology, and general and vascular surgery, routinely encounter vascular disease in their practice and would benefit from such a concise reference source. The basic yet thorough review of the diagnosis and medical management of vascular disorders coupled with discussions of endovascular and surgical management would also be appropriate for vascular medicine fellows or vascular surgery residents in training.</p>
<p>While all of the individual chapters are well written and thoroughly referenced, some deserve particular notice. Chapter 1 covers the basic history and physical examination findings in both arterial and venous disease. Chapter 3 provides a basic understanding of peripheral angiography without providing overriding detail, making it particularly suitable for the general audience. Chapter 5 nicely illustrates the authors’ and editors’ approach for the textbook: using a general approach to epidemiology and diagnosis yet completing the chapter with a focus on the contemporary issues of endovascular therapy in the management of carotid disease. The inclusion of hemodialysis access intervention, Chapter 7, is an important and increasingly prevalent clinical issue that is frequently omitted from many basic vascular texts. Chapter 18 reviews the most common vasculitides seen in clinical practice. Finally, Chapter 24 provides a comprehensive review of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency that is a must-read. There is no dedicated chapter on lymphatic disease; however, several chapters do cover the basic examination, clinical findings and treatment of lymphedema.</p>
<p>In summary, physicians in all specialties encounter patients with vascular disease on a regular basis. The clear and concise approach utilized in this text, with respect to the diagnosis and management of both common and uncommon vascular disease, makes this a useful educational resource for practicing physicians. This book should be a welcomed addition to a wide variety of hospital and personal libraries alike.</p>
