<p>By approaching the concepts of time and labor as emergent historical phenomena, Cynthia Negrey provides an interesting critical perspective on our contemporary notions of work time and leisure time. Just as importantly, however, Negrey’s work is an excellent example of good sociological analysis which illuminates the underlying social characteristics of dominant institutions.</p>
<p>Beginning with a look at the dynamics of labor and leisure time in early hunter-gatherer societies, the book first disabuses us of the notion that labor time made up the bulk of one’s daily life. Instead, we are provided with research that suggests humans of the period devoted a greater amount of time to rest and leisure than their contemporary counterparts. Negrey also traces the emergence of church/medieval time and its eventual commodification in the face of industrial time-discipline. Negrey then devotes a portion of the text to discussing the various conflicts that emerged in the public realm over issues of working hours, as well as the problems of time management faced by working families. In addition, the text provides a wide array of data on domestic and global labor hours, productivity, and non-standard work and work schedules. All of this culminates in a critical discussion on the emergence of digital workplaces and the continued emphasis of labor hours over productivity in a labor market dominated by task-oriented and service-based jobs (as opposed to time-oriented, Fordist-style production).</p>
<p>Because Negrey’s book covers such a wide range of topics, some scholars may find the work to be cursory. Regardless, Negrey presents an interesting thesis and then musters evidence across a variety of disciplinary boundaries to demonstrate her point in a manner that is both engaging and accessible. Thus, <italic>Work Time</italic> is a wonderful book for undergraduate courses in sociology, labor studies, or gender studies. Not only is it easily accessible to a general audience, it is organized in such a fashion as to provide an excellent framework for classroom discussions. Furthermore, Negrey’s book provides students with an example of well-written and methodologically diverse sociological analysis. As the book touches upon a wide array of interest areas, it would be remiss to only recommend this book to labor scholars. Instead, any student with an interest in the complex interweaving of time, labor, production, and gender should make an effort to read this book.</p>
