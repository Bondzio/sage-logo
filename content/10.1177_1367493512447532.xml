         <abstract>
            <p>Previous research suggests that boys are at a greater likelihood of exhibiting externalizing behaviors throughout their childhood than girls. In addition, previous research suggests that children who are born into impoverished conditions are more likely to exhibit externalizing behaviors than their peers who are born into higher socio-economic conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the trajectory of externalizing behaviors between boys and girls. In addition, the effects of poverty on externalizing behaviors by gender were also investigated. The findings suggest that in the sample used for this study, boys and girls were virtually equal in externalizing behaviors from 2 years old through 5th grade. In addition, analyses revealed that time spent in poverty predicted a greater occurrence of externalizing behaviors over time for girls, but not boys. These findings suggest that what has previously been assumed about externalizing behaviors in boys and girls may be less concrete than was once thought. Implications and future research directions are discussed.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Early in children’s development there tends to be a greater occurrence of externalizing behaviors than later on in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512447532">Blatt-Eisengart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>). Many have attributed this occurrence to the likelihood of children initiating conflict in response to obtaining an object or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512447532">Rubin et al., 2003</xref>). For most children, these aggressive interactions often occur at a high rate until they are around 5 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512447532">Gilliom and Shaw, 2004</xref>; Owens and Shaw, 2003). Around the age of 5, most children’s externalizing behaviors begin to decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>; Rubin, et al., 2003). It should be noted that some children do not present the typical downward slope of externalizing behaviors and continue to exhibit these behaviors through adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493512447532">Shaw et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>Research suggests that boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing behavior in early childhood through early adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512447532">Blatt-Eisengart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512447532">Dodge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512447532">Miner and Clarke-Stewart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512447532">Rubin et al., 2003</xref>). Specifically, boys start out with an initially higher occurrence of externalizing behaviors and this difference is often maintained into adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512447532">Miner and Clarke-Stewart, 2008</xref>). Numerous variables associated with boys’ increased likelihood for externalizing behaviors (e.g. temperament, maternal relationships, gender-valued peer interactions) have been identified by various researchers in the literature base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447532">Cillessen and Bellmore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512447532">Marchand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512447532">Owens and Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512447532">Rubin et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>A major predictor of increased externalizing behaviors found in the literature is low socio-economic status (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512447532">Knapp et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, children who live in poverty for an extended amount of time are at a greater risk of displaying externalizing behaviors than peers who spend less or no time in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512447532">Brooks-Gunn and Duncan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512447532">Mistry et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512447532">Duncan and colleagues (2007</xref>) suggest that the earlier a child experiences impoverished conditions the greater the likelihood is that the child will exhibit greater externalizing behaviors. It is evident that economic hardship plays a role in a greater likelihood of externalizing behaviors.</p>
         <p>Literature investigating the role of gender as a moderator in the relationship between poverty and externalizing behaviors is not prominent in the literature base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512447532">Mrug and Windle, 2009</xref>). The literature base is split on the differential effects of poverty on externalizing behaviors in relation to gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512447532">Beyers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512447532">Mrug and Windle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512447532">Mrug et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512447532">South, 2001</xref>). Beyers and colleagues research suggests that boys from impoverished conditions were more likely to exhibit externalizing behaviors than their female counter parts. However, Mrug and Windle found no difference in the prevalence of externalizing behaviors for boys and girls living in low SES settings. These findings suggest that more research is needed to identify the moderating effects of gender on the relationship between poverty and externalizing behavior.</p>

         <title>Current study</title>
         <p>The current study investigates the relationship between poverty and externalizing behaviors by gender. Specifically, the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation dataset allows us to look at the role prolonged time spent in poverty plays in children’s prevalence of externalizing behaviors. A latent growth curve analysis will be utilized to identify the relationship between these variables. From the current literature base, the following hypotheses were created and tested.</p>

         <title>Method</title>
         <p>This study used data collected as part of the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project (EHSRE), which was funded by the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF). The EHSRE project is a cross-site national study with the main objective to investigate and assess the impacts of Early Head Start (EHS) on family and child outcomes. Participants in the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, recruited between July 1996 and September 1998, were families who applied for Early Head Start services and were screened to determine if they qualified for the program. Each Early Head Start site was allowed to determine their own criteria, with income (using the federal poverty guidelines) as the primary factor in determining eligibility. A total of 3001 families were originally recruited for the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512447532">Administration on Children, Youth and Families, 2002</xref>).</p>

            <title>Participants</title>
            <p>Data for this study were taken from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project (EHSRE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512447532">Administration on Children, Youth and Families, 2002</xref>). Participants included in this study were 1067 children from the longitudinal EHSRE study. Participants in this study were included if they had Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) data at the 24-month, 36-month, pre-kindergarten, and 5th grade data points. Of the children included in the study 52.9 percent were male and 46.8 percent were female. The children’s ethnic background broke down as follows: 37.8 percent white or Caucasian; 32.1 percent African American; 23.9 percent Hispanic; and 4.3 percent identified as ‘other’. The vast majority of caregivers at the first measurement point were mothers (99%), with a small amount identifying as ‘grandparents’ (4.8%) by the 5th-grade measurement. A thorough description of the participants’ demographic information can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512447532">Table 1</xref>.</p>

For this study the externalizing scales of CBCL 1.5 years to 5 (CBCL/1.5–5) years was used for the 2 year, 3 year, and pre-k measurement points, while the CBCL 4 years to 18 years (CBCL/4–18) was used for the 5th grade measurement. Items on the CBCL use a 3-point Likert scale, with item ratings ranging from ‘1 = Not true’ to ‘3 = Often true’. The CBCL/4–18 was normed on a nationally representative sample of 2368 children.

               <title>Poverty</title>
               <p>Annual income was collected from participating families at each of the measurement points: baseline (point at which families entered study), 24 months, 36 months, pre-kindergarten, and 5th grade. The US Census Bureau calculates poverty thresholds based on a family’s income and the number of adults and children living in the household. For this study, poverty was calculated by taking an average of the US Census Bureau’s poverty guidelines over the three years that measurements were taken for each assessment time point and comparing it to what each family listed for their income and number of people living in their household. For example, data for the pre-kindergarten measurement point were taken between 2002 and 2004. An average poverty threshold was created by adding the US Census Bureau’s poverty threshold for number of people living in household by income for the years 2002 to 2004 and creating an average for the 3-year period. A dichotomous variable was coded for each data point, where families falling below the poverty line were given the value of one and families falling above the poverty line were given the value of zero. These dichotomous variables were added together for each assessment time point to generate an overall poverty score ranging from zero to five. A greater score on the overall poverty variable signified that a family spent a greater amount of time in poverty.</p>

         <p>Initially a latent growth curve model was created for externalizing behaviors measured at the 2 year old, 3 year old, pre-kindergarten, and 5th grade measurement points. Gender was utilized as a grouping variable for this model. The fit indices for this model were as follows; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = .072, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = .052; and χ<sup>2</sup> (10) = 37.6. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512447532">Hooper, Coughlin and Mullen (2008)</xref>, these statistics all fall into the ‘acceptable fit’ range.</p>

            <title>Hypothesis 3: As time spent in poverty increases, so will the slope of externalizing behaviors across the measurement periods, for boys and girls</title>
            <p>The constructed poverty variable was added as a predictor variable to the externalizing behavior model. The fit indices for this model were as follows; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) =.058, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) =.045; and χ<sup>2</sup> (14) = 39.5. These indices suggest that adding poverty as a covariate improved the fit of the model to the data.

However, the relationship of poverty on the slope of externalizing behaviors for each gender was different. For females a significant relationship was found between time spent in poverty on the slope of externalizing behaviors (<italic>b</italic> = 2.06; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that for every additional time point spent in poverty a 2.06 point increase on CBCL scores could be expected. For boys, the relationship between time spent in poverty and externalizing behaviors was not significant (<italic>p </italic>= .195). In addition, there was not a significant relationship between the time spent in poverty and the intercept of externalizing behaviors for females (<italic>p </italic>= .067) or males (<italic>p </italic>= .788). These findings are counter to our hypothesis that both genders’ externalizing scores would be positively related to time spent in poverty.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>It is hypothesized that the typical decrease of externalizing behaviors seen in children is due in part to the development of communication skills and increased interaction with peers where appropriate behaviors are learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447532">Cillessen and Bellmore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512447532">Tremblay, 2000</xref>). The findings of this study support the prevailing theories, as group marginal means for externalizing behaviors decreased slowly between 2 years to 3 years, and decreased at a steeper rate from 3 years to pre-kindergarten, then displayed the largest drop from pre-kindergarten to 5th grade. The results suggest that externalizing behaviors for children in this sample decreased as they aged, which coincides with the development of communication skills in the general population (2 years to pre-kindergarten) and children’s interactions with peers becoming more skilled (pre-kindergarten to 5th grade) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447532">Cillessen and Bellmore, 2004</xref>).</p>
         <p>A small difference between girls and boys in initial levels and change of externalizing behaviors was observed in this study. Previous research has demonstrated that boys traditionally exhibit a greater occurrence of externalizing behaviors early (2–3 years old) in their development compared to girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512447532">Gilliom and Shaw, 2004</xref>). However, in the current study, girls showed a larger occurrence of initial levels of externalizing behaviors (e.g. 0.45 points higher than boys at 2 years).</p>
         <p>The decrease in externalizing behaviors observed in the present study for both boys and girls is consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512447532">Prinstein and La Greca, 2004</xref>). However, the convergence of externalizing behaviors scores for boys and girls at 5th grade (nearly the same group mean score at 5th grade) is not consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512447532">Bongers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512447532">Prinstein and La Greca, 2004</xref>). As a result, the novel finding of this analysis is the fact that girls’ and boys’ externalizing scores were so close initially (the girls’ group mean was slightly higher than the boys) and remained close throughout the study. This is contrary to the body of literature that suggests boys are more likely than girls to exhibit externalizing behaviors early in their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512447532">Gilliom and Shaw, 2004</xref>).</p>
         <sec id="section15-1367493512447532">
            <title>Poverty, gender and externalizing behaviors</title>
            <p>When poverty was added as a predictor it was found that the longer a female spent in poverty, the greater the likelihood an increase in externalizing behaviors over time would be observed. This was not the case for boys included in this study. Members of the sample for this study were eligible for Early Head Start services. This most likely means that poverty was a major factor in their everyday life. The mixed literature on the relationship between gender, poverty, and externalizing behaviors suggested that greater time in poverty may predict a greater likelihood for externalizing behaviors in boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512447532">Beyers et al., 2003</xref>). Or, that neither boys nor girls differ in the role time spent in poverty plays on the occurrence of externalizing behaviors (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512447532">Mrug and Windle, 2009</xref>). However, we could not find a study that suggested girls would be at a greater risk for externalizing behaviors the longer they spent in poverty. As a result, this is another novel find.</p>
            <p>It is most likely that poverty in and of itself is not causing the increased occurrence of externalizing for girls. It is most probably that the poverty is affecting something within the child’s life circle that is, in turn, impacting the occurrence of externalizing behaviors for girls. One such possibility is the relationship of poverty to parent mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety) and parent mental health’s relationship to externalizing behaviors cited in the research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512447532">Malik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512447532">Owens and Shaw, 2003</xref>). Though we could not find specific research suggesting that maternal depression leads to a greater occurrence of externalizing in girls specifically, there is sufficient evidence to suggest disturbances in parental mental health are related to externalizing behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512447532">Malik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512447532">Owens and Shaw, 2003</xref>). Unfortunately, testing multiple mediators of the relationship between poverty and externalizing behaviors is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>

            <title>Limitations</title>
            <p>Though we feel the findings of this study are quite relevant, it is not without its limitations. The poverty variable for this study was constructed through the use of caregiver reports of monthly income and number of household occupants. Income reporting by participants can often be incorrect because families’ occupations may change frequently. Social desirability may also play a role in reporting higher incomes than participants make. Participants for this study were eligible for Head Start services, meaning at the time of inclusion in the study almost all families were at or below 125 percent of the poverty line (Administration on Children, Youth, and Families, 2002). As a result, most participants in the study did live at least some time in poverty, but a more objective measure of income (e.g. pay stubs, income tax forms) would have been a more ideal way to assess poverty.</p>
            <p>The sample selected for this study is a unique sample drawn from a specific sub-population (EHRSE participants). This sample may not be representative of all families living in poverty across the United States. The sample may deviate from US residents living in poverty on demographic variables (i.e. ethnicity) or the externalizing behaviors. Care should be taken when generalizing findings of this study to the greater US population.</p>

         <sec id="section17-1367493512447532">
            <title>Future research</title>
            <p>The major implication of these findings is that they open up to inquiry a long-held belief about externalizing behaviors. That is not to say we are suggesting that girls are now showing higher levels of externalizing behaviors than boys; but that the context in which children grow up, affects children’s likelihood of exhibiting externalizing based on their gender more than was previously supposed. As stated in the literature review, research on the relationship between poverty and externalizing behaviors by gender is sparse. This suggests that researchers should make a concerted effort to test and report findings in this area.</p>
            <p>The practical implications of these findings suggest that it is important for healthcare professionals, human service works, and educators to recognize that the long-held belief that boys are more prone to externalizing behaviors may be shifting to a paradigm where both sexes are equally likely to exhibit externalizing behaviors. Diagnosis of externalizing disorders (e.g. Oppositional Defiant Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyper-Activity Disorder) is skewed largely towards males, resulting in a large amount of research on early externalizing behaviors and later disorders focusing primarily on boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512447532">Greene et al., 2002</xref>). However, recent research suggests that girls with higher levels of externalizing behaviors coupled with additional environmental (e.g. poverty) and other health concerns (e.g. ADHD) are likely to exhibit more severe mental health issues (e.g. major depression, conduct disorder) in the future than typically developing girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512447532">Biederman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512447532">Maughan et al., 2004</xref>). As a result, it is important that research be conducted on effective identification and practices for addressing early externalizing behaviors in both boys and girls. In addition, professionals working with children who exhibit externalizing behaviors (specifically those working in high-risk areas) should be trained in these effective practices.</p>
            <p>These findings also warrant the investigation of the differential influence (on gender) of variables that mediate the relationship between poverty and externalizing behaviors. More plainly put, efforts should be made to investigate gender differences in how poverty affects variables such as maternal depression, attachment, peer interactions, and how these relate to the development of externalizing behaviors. These findings may suggest different interventions for boys and girls based on what is affecting children’s externalizing behaviors.</p>
