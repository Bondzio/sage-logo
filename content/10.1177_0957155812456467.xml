<p><italic>French Cultural Studies</italic> was saddened to learn of the death on 30 June 2011 of Larry Schehr, Professor of French at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Larry was an exceptional interdisciplinary scholar, whose interests encompassed nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature, contemporary literature and popular culture, gender studies and queer theory. He published extensively in these areas, using his expertise in one area to inform scholarship in another, and was the author of many respected monographs and edited volumes, as well as a vast body of journal articles. Among his most influential books were <italic>Figures of Alterity: French Realism and its Others</italic> (2003), <italic>French Gay Modernism</italic> (2004), <italic>Subversions of Verisimilitude: Reading Narrative from Balzac to Sartre</italic> (2009), and his most recent work <italic>French Post-Modern Masculinities: From Neuromatrices to Seropositivity</italic> (2010). The latter in particular testified to both his intellectual range and critical complexity, drawing together literature, film, politics and art in a polemical assessment of the representation of masculinity in contemporary French cultural production. Larry was the General Editor of the journal <italic>Contemporary French Civilization</italic>, in which he enthusiastically promoted the work of early-career researchers, and of which he edited three special issues during his tenure. He was a familiar figure at disciplinary conferences around the world – the USA, UK, Ireland, France, Australia, Canada – where he presented his work with vigour and generosity of spirit. He was an eloquent speaker and a sensitive respondent. It was always a joy to meet up with him at the annual 20th/21st Century French and Francophone Studies Colloquium in the USA, and to be party to the intellectual energy and social buzz that surrounded him.</p>
<p>Although Larry had been suffering from health problems for some time, his sudden death nevertheless came as a great shock to his colleagues, students and many friends. We take comfort in the peerless body of work he leaves behind, and in the many ways in which our scholarship has benefited from his wisdom, his erudition, and his humanity. It was a privilege to know him.</p>
