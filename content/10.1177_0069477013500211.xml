<title>Rhabdomyolysis</title>
<p>A 44-year-old female patient with a history of attention deficit disorder and Crohn’s disease presented to the emergency department with progressive and worsening lower back pain that began 3 hours after taking dextroamphetamine (dose not reported). The patient took the medication 1 hour before participating in strenuous exercise and began experiencing the muscle pain 3 hours later after consuming 3 alcoholic beverages. The patient had never taken this medication prior to strenuous exercise but had consumed alcoholic beverages after participating in strenuous exercise. Physical exam findings included severe tenderness along the paraspinal muscles bilaterally between T10 and S1 vertebrae and decreased cutaneous sensation overlying the muscle tenderness in this area. Pertinent laboratory values on admission included increased serum sodium (141 mEq/L), decreased serum potassium (2.9 mEq/L), decreased bicarbonate (18 mEq/L), an anion gap of 17, and elevated creatine kinase (16 169 IU/L), moderate blood in the urine, but without red blood cells. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis based on the aforementioned findings. Normal saline (rate not reported) and potassium replacement (dose not reported) were given in addition to intravenous hydromorphone (dose not reported) and cyclobenzaprine (dose not reported). creatine kinase levels remained elevated throughout the admission, peaking at 52 520 IU/L. The patient was discharged after 8 days once her pain became manageable with oral medications, and the creatine kinase level was around 10 000 IU/L. At a follow-up visit, the patient reported continued, but improved back pain.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that dextroamphetamine was associated with rhabdomyolysis in the presence of multiple risk factors such as exercise, dehydration, and alcohol consumption. This is the first report to link nontoxic doses of dextroamphetamine and rhabdomyolysis (without the use of other metabolically active agents). More research is needed to investigate the potential association between rhabdomyolysis and amphetamine medications in patients with multiple risk factors.</p>

<title>Cardiac Arrhythmia</title>
<p>A review and analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data before and after the publication of a 2002 report describing the association between methadone and arrhythmias (QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes) was conducted to examine the frequency in which arrhythmias associated with methadone use is reported. Drug names were matched to corresponding entries in the database and then were linked to the corresponding adverse event report. Comparative data sets were created for amiodarone, sotalol, and dofetilide as they are all associated with torsade de pointes through the same mechanism as methadone. Morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone were also assessed as opioid comparators. The adverse events QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes were combined as an endpoint, as well as cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmias. A total of 11 015 cases reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System involved methadone. Of these, 1646 (14.9%) involved ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest and 379 (3.4%) involved QTc prolongation or torsade de pointes. After 2002, when the report was published linking fatal ventricular arrhythmias to methadone, ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest was the most commonly reported adverse event for methadone. The average number of reports of QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes between November 1997 and September 2002 was 0.3% of all reports. This increased to 3.4% from October 2002 to June 2011. Death occurred in 80.9% of ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest cases. The most common primary suspects among all reports of QTc prolongation or torsade de pointes were dofetilide (n = 359), methadone (n = 211), and sotalol (n = 119).</p>
<p>The number of arrhythmia-related adverse events associated with methadone has increased since the publication of the 2002 report describing the association between high-dose methadone and torsade de pointes. Ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest are currently the most frequently reported adverse event for methadone. The authors concluded that ventricular arrhythmias are an important contributor to methadone-related morbidity and mortality. Since the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System is voluntary, actual incidence cannot be judged based on the results of this study. The authors propose that a methadone-specific Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program developed to reduce arrhythmia may be needed.</p>

<title>Fatal Overdoses in US Women</title>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed rates of fatal drug overdoses in US women from 1999 through 2010 using data from the National Vital Statistics System and the Drug Abuse Warning Network. In 2010, a total of 15 323 deaths related to drug overdoses were reported in US women, demonstrating a 9.8/100 000 population rate. Opioid-related fatal overdoses accounted for 71.3% of the reported deaths. Deaths from opioid analgesics increased 5-fold from 1999 to 2010 in women. The rate for opioid related overdose deaths (4.2/100 000 population) was 4 times the rate for cocaine and heroin deaths combined. The rate for drug overdose deaths in women were highest for those aged 45 to 54 years (21.8/100 000 population).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that more women died from drug overdoses than motor vehicle accidents.</p>

<title>Simvastatin, Amlodipine No. 196</title>
<sec id="section8-0069477013500211">
<title>Thrombocytopenia</title>
<p>A 78-year-old female patient developed severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia on 3 separate occasions after taking amlodipine and/or simvastatin. The patient had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, stable angina, bronchial asthma, ischemic stroke (14 years prior to presentation), and chronic nephropathy. She had a permanent pacemaker implanted 2 months prior to presentation. Concomitant medications included gliclazide, fosinopril, furosemide, and an ipratropium bromide/fenoterol hydrobromide inhaler. The patient had previously been taking simvastatin (20 mg daily) for dyslipidemia but had stopped it at the time of pacemaker implantation. On admission she was found to have multiple bruises and bleeding gums. Laboratory tests were unremarkable with the exception of platelets (1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), serum creatinine (328 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (15 mmol/L), total cholesterol (6.7 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.5 mmol/L), and triglycerides (2.8 mmol/L). Prednisolone (69 mg) was initiated and the patient received platelet transfusions (7 units). The amlodipine was stopped 3 days after admission and her platelet count increased to 12 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L the day after stopping and to 126 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. She was discharged home 17 days after presentation with a normal platelet count (165 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Two weeks after discharge, the patient restarted simvastatin (20 mg daily). Less than 30 minutes after ingestion, the patient presented to the emergency department for generalized pruritus and was found to have generalized urticaria and thrombocytopenia (98 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Simvastatin was discontinued and the patient received intravenous corticosteroids and H1 and H2 blockers (drugs and doses not reported) for 1 day. Her platelets continued to decline over the next 2 days (85 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) but recovered and remained stable over the next few months (226 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). The patient subsequently took a dose of amlodipine (10 mg) several months later by mistake and sought immediate medical attention. Her platelets were 32 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L on presentation and later normalized without treatment.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that amlodipine and simvastatin were associated with drug-induced thrombocytopenia in this patient. George’s clinical criteria indicated clear evidence of a causal link between amlodipine and thrombocytopenia and also indicated a probable level of evidence for simvastatin as the cause of thrombocytopenia. Combination therapy with simvastatin and amlodipine may increase the risk of drug-induced adverse reactions and may make the identification of the causal drug(s) difficult.</p>

<title>Acute Renal Failure</title>
<p>A 32-year-old male patient was hospitalized with anorexia, yellow colored sclera, and dark-colored urine shortly after taking boiled henna for chronic bloating and constipation. On admission, the patient was conscious and jaundiced. Abnormal laboratory values included hemoglobin (8.8 g/dL), increased serum creatinine, and elevated liver function tests. The patient was transferred to intensive care for supportive treatment, which included the administration of packed red blood cells and hemodialysis. Hemoglobin values eventually stabilized and the patient was discharged on hospital day 13. Hemodialysis was continued for a total of 17 days. Full recovery was noted at 6-week follow-up.</p>

<title>Severe Hemodynamic Instability</title>
<p>A 41-year-old male patient with <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> bacteremia developed acute hemodynamic instability with hypotension and bradycardia 10 minutes after the start of an anidulafungin infusion (200 mg). The patient with no pertinent medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit for septic shock and given broad spectrum antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g) every 8 hours and clindamycin (900 mg) every 8 hours. The patient also required vasopressor therapy with norepinephrine, vasopressin, and dobutamine (doses not reported) for hemodynamic stabilization. Blood cultures taken on the day of admission grew coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient further declined and antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem (1 g) every 8 hours and tobramycin (360 mg) once daily. Subsequently, fluconazole (200 mg) daily was added on day 13 along with hydrocortisone (250 mg) daily as a continuous infusion. The patient improved and norepinephrine was discontinued. On day 23, a culture of a central venous catheter tip grew <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> resistant to fluconazole. On day 28, therapy was switched to anidulafungin. Ten minutes after the start of the infusion, the patient developed severe hypotension with a systolic blood pressure of 40 mm Hg and bradycardia of 40 bpm. The anidulafungin infusion was stopped immediately and the patient developed shock requiring 20 minutes of advanced cardiac life support. Concomitant medications included ornithine aspartate, pantoprazole, metoclopramide, hydrocortisone, midazolam, clonidine, fentanyl, insulin, and meropenem. The patient slowly recovered with the use of norepinephrine (dose not reported). An echocardiogram was performed that ruled out cardiac decompensation and pericardial effusion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hypoxia and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient died on day 41.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that anidulafungin was associated with severe hypotension and bradycardia. The Naranjo causality criteria indicated that anidulafungin was the probable cause. Rare adverse events such as flash pulmonary edema during anidulafungin have been reported in literature, but there have been no reports on cardiotoxicity, except in some animal studies. The authors state that further studies are needed to fully examine the cardiotoxic potential of echinocandins.</p>

<title>Neutropenia (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477013500211">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 90-year-old woman developed neutropenia after being treated with ceftaroline (600 mg twice daily) for pneumonia complicated by methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureas</italic> bacteremia and possible vertebral osteomyelitis. Concurrent medications included acetaminophen, aspirin, bumetanide, cholecalciferol, donepezil, doxepin, escitalopram, esomeprazole, furosemide, hydrocodone/acetaminophen, lactulose, lorazepam, nitroglycerin, potassium, pregabalin, solifenacin, spironolactone, and multivitamins. She was transferred to a hospital due to a progressively worsening cough, with whitish, blood-tinged sputum production. No history of fever, night sweats, diaphoresis, weight loss, or recent travel was noted. The physical exam was unremarkable; however, the patient was disoriented to time and place and could not answer all questions appropriately. Her complete blood count on admission included a baseline hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 27.7%, platelets of 235/uL, white blood cell count of 32 000/uL, with a differential of 92% neutrophils, 2% lymphocytes, and 6% monocytes. There were no eosinophils, basophils, or bands. Her basic metabolic panel and liver function tests were normal. Her chest X-ray showed a possible left lower lobe infiltrate. Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureas</italic> grew in the anaerobic bottle of 1 of 2 separate sets of blood cultures obtained at admission. Sputum cultures grew methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureas</italic> with similar susceptibility patterns. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no definite vegetation on the aortic or mirtal valves. The patient had sustained a compression fracture of her 12th thoracic vertebrae 3 weeks prior. She began treatment with vancomycin empirically and was transitioned to linezolid and daptomycin after 3 days. After 4 days of linezolid and daptomycin, she was switched to ceftaroline. Her leukocytosis resolved and she remained afebrile. She was discharged back to her nursing home on ceftaroline, with a peripherally inserted central catheter to receive infusions. Her complete blood count showed a normal white blood cell at discharge, which was 11 days after initiation of ceftaroline. A repeat complete blood count 25 days after ceftaroline was started showed a low white blood cell (2100/uL) and an absolute neutrophil count of zero. The complete blood count was repeated 9 days later (34 days after starting ceftaroline), resulting in white blood cell of 2200/uL and an absolute neutrophil count of zero again. Ceftaroline was discontinued, and no other medications were changed. Five days after ceftaroline discontinuation, a repeat complete blood count showed a white blood cell of 4000/uL and an absolute neutrophil count of 100/uL. Three days later, the white blood cell was 5600/uL and the absolute neutrophil count was 2400/uL. The patient remained stable while neutropenic.</p>
<p>While neutropenia is a class-wide adverse effect of cephalosporins, the authors reported the first case of neutropenia specific to ceftaroline. Most cases of neutropenia and agranulocytosis are acquired via decreased granulocyte production or increased granulocyte destruction.</p>

<sec id="section20-0069477013500211">
<title>Drug Interaction: Decreased Concentrations of Tramadol</title>
<p>A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, which enrolled 12 healthy subjects, was conducted to determine the extent of interaction of rifampin and tramadol. All study participants were Caucasians of Finnish origin and classified as extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers. Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 into 24 metabolites, the most pharmacologically active and abundant being <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol. Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and an organic anion-transporting polypeptide inhibitor and inducer. Participants were randomized to receive either rifampin (600 mg daily) or matching placebo for 7 days. On day 6, intravenous tramadol (50 mg once) was administered in the first part of the study, and oral tramadol (100 mg once) in the second part. There was a 2-week washout period between each of the 4 crossover treatment sessions. The geometric mean ratio of the AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> for intravenous tramadol and oral tramadol was decreased to 0.58 (90% confidence interval = 0.53-0.64; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and 0.41 (90% confidence interval = 0.36-0.46; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), respectively, by rifampin when compared to placebo. The geometric mean ratio of the AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> for <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol after intravenous tramadol was decreased to 0.42 (90% confidence interval = 0.36-0.48, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and to 0.46 (90% confidence interval = 0.43-0.50, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) after oral tramadol by rifampin when compared to placebo. Clearance of intravenous tramadol was increased by rifampin by approximately 70% (90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio = 1.57-0.90, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Pharmacodynamic effects were slightly decreased in the rifampin group; however, results were not significant. There were no differences in 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that use of rifampin or other potent CYP inducers may contribute to decreased analgesic effect of intravenous and oral tramadol. They recognize that further studies are warranted to study the effects of other active metabolites, like M2. They go on to recommend that concomitant use of CYP inducers and tramadol should be avoided in clinical practice.</p>

<title>Severe Hepatitis</title>
<p>A 62-year-old male patient with rheumatoid arthritis was hospitalized with new-onset progressive jaundice and pruritis approximately 3 months after starting tocilizumab (8 mg/kg/month). Concurrent medications included metformin, methylprednisolone, esomeprazole, pregabalin, and rosuvastatin (no dosages provided). Abnormal laboratory levels included elevated liver function tests. Laboratory screenings for infectious etiologies were negative. Percutaneous liver biopsy revealed acute hepatitis with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, focal bile stasis, and focal hepatocyte necrosis. The patient was discharged on a prednisone taper. Liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes normalized after 10 and 50 weeks, respectively.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced severe hepatitis related to tocilizumab based on the temporal relationship between the adverse event and the administration of the drug.</p>

<title>Gingival Overgrowth</title>
<p>A 47-year-old male patient developed gingival overgrowth after 5 years of treatment with nifedipine (40 mg daily) for hypertension. Concurrent medications other than metformin (500 mg daily) were not mentioned. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes approximately 2 years prior with the development of gingival overgrowth, which remained uncontrolled with a hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%. On physical examination, overgrown gingiva at all intradental gingival papillae were observed with a generally fibrotic and erythematic appearance. The diagnosis was of severe generalized chronic periodontitis with gingival overgrowth associated with nifedipine. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels were also thought to have exacerbated the inflammation. A collaborative dental–medical treatment plan was created including dietary changes, increasing metformin (750 mg daily), implementing oral hygiene and supragingival scaling, as well as initiating a different antihypertensive (enalapril maleate, 10 mg daily) with the discontinuation of nifedipine. After 6 months of treatment, the hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.9%, gingival overgrowth gradually subsided, and oral hygiene improved. When the hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.5%, the 7 teeth that were judged to be a loss were removed and replaced with prosthesis. At the 1-year mark, clinical parameters were significantly reduced and periodontal surgery (flap operation) was carried out with no postoperative healing adverse events. The patient was then placed on supportive periodontal therapy consisting of oral hygiene instruction and professional plaque control once a month with continued improvement in clinical parameters. With the commencement of supportive periodontal therapy, gingival inflammation resolved and the hemoglobin A1c ranged from 6.3% to 6.5% for the remainder of the follow-up period (10 years).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth. It has been hypothesized that glucose-mediated advanced glycation end products can increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators, thereby playing a crucial role in periodontal pathogenesis. Thus, the authors suggest that control of blood glucose levels with periodontal treatment can improve periodontal outcomes in diabetic patients.</p>

<title>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</title>
<p>A 75-year-old male patient developed cognitive impairment and expressive dysphagia approximately 10 weeks after starting ruxolitinib (20 mg twice daily) for the treatment of refractory myelofibrosis. No other medications were mentioned. Symptoms progressed, including ataxia and gait instability. A magnetic resonance imaging revealed brain changes indicating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Screenings for infectious etiologies were negative. Ruxolitinib was gradually tapered and discontinued; symptoms progressed. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging and brain biopsy suggested progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p>

<title>Deaths in Children Receiving Therapeutic Doses</title>
<p>Three cases of codeine-related deaths in pediatric patients treated in the home are described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1.</italic> A 10-year-old overweight (44.5 kg) female patient was found dead in the home after receiving 2 doses of codeine/acetaminophen (20-40 mg codeine) after postoperative discharge. The patient had a history of cerebral palsy, probably obstructive sleep apnea, reactive airway disease, and was tolerant to benzodiazepines. The first dose was administered in the afternoon, and the second dose was coadministered with diazepam (2-4 mg) at bedtime. The child was found unresponsive at 1:30 <sc>am</sc>, and despite resuscitative methods, she did not respond. Autopsy results found no cause of death and severe pulmonary edema. Postmortem codeine and morphine concentrations were in the toxic range at 0.78 mg/L and 0.15 mg/L, respectively. It was concluded that the combined sedative effects of the opioid and benzodiazepine were the most likely cause of respiratory depression. Obstructive disease and sleep apnea may have also been contributing factors.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2.</italic> A 6-year-old overweight (44.9 kg) female patient was found dead in her bed the morning after receiving 3 doses of a cough syrup (guafenesin/codeine: 100 mg/10 mg per 5 mL) the previous day. The patient had a history of myocarditis and developmental delay. An antibiotic was also prescribed (azithromycin) but no other medications were mentioned in this report. A medication error was involved as the cough syrup prescription was written for 1 to 2 teaspoons every night but was labeled as 1 to 2 teaspoons every 4 hours as needed. Despite resuscitation efforts, the child was pronounced dead at the emergency room the next morning. Postmortem codeine and morphine concentrations were in the toxic range at 0.17 mg/L and 0.08 mg/L, respectively.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3.</italic> A 4-year-old obese (59 kg) female patient was found dead in her bed the morning after receiving 4 doses of a liquid codeine/acetaminophen (12-17 mg of codeine every 4 hours as needed for pain) the previous day. The patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, limb spasticity, and absence seizures. Concurrent medications included valproate. Despite resuscitation efforts, the child was pronounced dead at the emergency room the next morning. Postmortem examination did not reveal an anatomic cause of death, but the patient was identified as an extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer (normal) phenotype. The death was attributed to accidental codeine toxicity.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these 3 cases of codeine-related death occurred in overweight children who had received doses within the recommended dosage range (0.5-1 mg/kg/dose every 4 hours as needed). They recommended that codeine should not be used in children as it has a poor analgesic effect and carries the risk of opioid toxicity and oversedation.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Communication: Sprue-Like Enteropathy</title>
<p>On July 3, 2013, the FDA notified health care professionals regarding new safety data linking sprue-like enteropathy with olmesartan medoxomil use. The FDA identified 23 serious cases in the MedWatch database presenting as late-onset diarrhea with significant weight loss and, in some cases, with intestinal villous atrophy on biopsy. All patients improved clinically after discontinuation of olmesartan. Positive rechallenge was seen in 10 of the cases. In addition, Mayo Clinic researchers published a case series of sprue-like enteropathy associated with olmesartan in 22 patients with similar symptoms. A possible mechanism of action had not been clearly established.</p>
