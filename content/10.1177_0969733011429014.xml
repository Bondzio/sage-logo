<abstract>
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 is a genetic neuromuscular disease in children that leads to degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons. This sometimes results in severe muscular paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation to sustain the child’s life. The onset of SMA type 1, the most severe form of the disease, is during the first year of life. These children become severely paralysed, but retain their intellectual capacity. Ethical concerns arise when mechanical ventilation becomes necessary for survival. When professionals assess the resulting life for the child and family, they sometimes fear it will result in unreasonably excessive care. The aim of this article is to present an analysis of ethical arguments that could support or oppose the provision of invasive ventilation in this population. This examination is particularly relevant as France is one of the few countries performing tracheotomies and mechanical ventilation for this condition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease. In children, SMA corresponds with an international classification which divides the disease into three main categories based on severity and age of onset: type 1, type 2 or type 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011429014">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

<p>Owing to a genetic disorder on chromosome 5, SMA leads to degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons. Signals from the brain cannot be adequately transmitted to muscles, resulting in severe muscular paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0969733011429014">Figure 1</xref>). When respiratory muscles (intercostal, abdominal, diaphragm) are affected, ventilatory therapy is required to ensure adequate ventilation and the child’s survival.<sup>

</sup> The earlier the age at onset, the more severe the disease will be. SMA type 1 is the most severe form; approximately 30 new cases per year are reported in France.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011429014">5</xref>
</sup> Despite motor dysfunction, these infants retain their intellectual capacities.</p>

<p>In France, two distinct categories of SMA type 1 are recognized:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>severe – symptoms appear between birth and the third month of life, which is characterized by the child never having held up his or her head; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>intermediate – symptoms appear between the ages of 3 and 6 months, during which time the child has been able to hold up his or her head.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In the pathology’s severe form, questions will surface within the first year regarding the patient’s potential for survival and the necessity of performing a tracheotomy. In the pathology’s intermediate form, the question of tracheotomy placement arises much later.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011429014">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>

</sup> Ioos et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that this option could be avoided; tracheotomy had to be performed on only 20 (57%) out of 35 children affected with SMA type 1 intermediate disease. Invasive ventilatory support raises ethical questions as children will be dependent on a ventilator and significantly disabled in the most severe forms. Therefore, depending on the situation, only non-invasive ventilatory assistance may be used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011429014">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011429014">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011429014">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In Europe, the majority of treatment centres do not recommend tracheotomy to parents whose children have the pathology’s severe form because of the severity of the disability and consequent poor quality of life. This view is also widely shared in other continents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011429014">10</xref>
</sup> The 2005 <italic>Consensus Statement for Standard of Care in Spinal Muscular Atrophy </italic>also recommended against tracheotomy for SMA type 1, while stressing the need to use non-invasive ventilation in the context of palliative care. On the other hand, in Japan, some centres have been known to perform tracheotomy in the severe SMA type 1 group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011429014">11</xref>
</sup> Tracheotomy of these children raises an ethical debate, not only between different cultures but also sometimes within the treating team itself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011429014">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011429014">10</xref>

</sup> In fact, the writing of this article was motivated by situations where there were opposing views regarding the care of this population in our clinical service as well as in our discussions with parents and healthcare professionals (HCPs) at other hospitals. For example, we have frequently heard HCPs say, ‘It’s a type 1 intermediate, we <italic>have</italic> to tracheotomize the child.’ We want to avoid the use of dogmatic views toward clinical ‘labels’ by shedding light on the different types of situations that can be encountered.We have also seen situations where parents express their feelings to the nursing team but not with the physicians. One mother confided to a nurse, ‘You [referring to the clinical service] have forced me to do a tracheotomy on my daughter [an 18-month-old child], I didn’t have a choice.’ Such reflections have challenged us to question our practices and examine the overall context: family, social and cultural, which are shaped in part by external factors, such as government policies regarding the care of disability. This is also the reason that we have based our discussion predominantly in the French setting.</p>
<p>If these questions are difficult for the HCPs who face them, we will see how demanding they can be for families, as demonstrated by the story of one young man and his mother.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to examine, from the French context, arguments and counter-arguments regarding the tracheotomy of a child with SMA type 1, in light of recognized ethical standards. This analysis may highlight answers or new lines of thought for other clinical teams facing tracheotomy decisions for children with neuromuscular conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733011429014">
<title>Where does the ethical debate arise?</title>
<p>Some of the disabilities associated with this disease can give rise to concerns for HCPs as there can be conflicts among ethical principles or values. A tracheotomy will most likely ‘save’ the child from death, but is this decision in the child’s best interests? An ethical debate arises as some recognized ethical principles may directly conflict with each other, such as non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy and justice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011429014">20</xref>
</sup> Non-maleficence requires that HCPs avoid actions that may be detrimental to the patient. Beneficence implies that the good of the patient should be sought. Respect for autonomy calls for the respect of decisions made by independent agents, or their recognized surrogate decision-makers. Justice requires fair decisions and actions, with an equitable allocation of limited resources.</p>
<p>A conflict between non-maleficence and beneficence can arise for HCPs, in relation to tracheotomy for SMA type 1. HCPs generally think that poor quality of life justifies withholding therapy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011429014">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011429014">13</xref>
</sup> and thus deciding not to perform a tracheotomy would appear best for these children. In France, SMA severity is used as a criterion in deciding whether or not to perform a tracheotomy; some HCPs think that tracheotomy is unacceptable for the severe category but acceptable for the intermediate. Such a criterion can reduce the child solely to a pathology, without examining broader considerations.</p>
<sec id="section3-0969733011429014">
<title>Quality of life</title>
<p>Poor quality of life for patients is discussed often in the literature as a central argument for avoiding invasive ventilatory support. This is referred to in France as an <italic>abstentionist</italic> argument.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011429014">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011429014">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011429014">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011429014">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011429014"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011429014">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011429014">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011429014">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011429014">21</xref>
</sup> However, HCPs, especially those who are not used to caring for these patients, very often do not have a clear understanding of the quality of life for children with neuromuscular conditions. Moreover, HCPs project their own views onto their understanding of the child’s quality of life with SMA type 1; understandably considering such a life to be unbearable and imagining oneself as quadriplegic for the rest of one’s life. Consequently, HCPs’ understanding can be distorted. This is accentuated by a lack of knowledge about the disease, as demonstrated by Bach et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011429014">18</xref>
</sup> Moreover, in an intensive care setting, HCPs meet children in difficult or painful situations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011429014">14</xref>
</sup> (i.e. when the child is severely ill), and consequently can conclude that a tracheotomy should not be performed for any case of SMA type 1, based on the non-maleficence principle, as life is already too difficult for these children. The circumstances under which HCPs meet these children raise emotional responses among HCPs, which can impede them from having a neutral view. Some HCPs may disregard the adaptive capacity that some children may have. SMA type 1 is a genetic pathology that is noticeable within the first year of life, without a ‘pre’ and a ‘post’, contrary to an accident, in which case it can be very difficult to cope with the changes after the accident. A child with SMA type 1 only knows life as it is. The idea of quality of life with SMA as projected by HCPs can be distorted and out of line with these children’s realities.</p>
<p>Quality of life for these children depends largely on the quality of care received. It is therefore imperative that they be under the care of a specialized team familiar with this population’s needs. This will help ensure that, for example, the child has the required equipment, such as a tracheotomy tube, a motorized wheelchair, a laptop ventilator and a corset, among other things. It will otherwise be difficult for the child to establish a social life (e.g. school enrolment may be impeded if the child does not have the equipment required for the school setting).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733011429014">
<title>The meaning of life in extreme situations</title>
<p>The difficult question of tracheotomy in these children leads to questions about the meaning of life in extreme situations. <italic>The Story of My Life</italic> (published at the end of the 19th century) by Helen Keller, who was deaf, mute and blind<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011429014">22</xref>
</sup> can significantly enrich our insight into the experiences of these children. Nowadays, these three disabilities could justify treatment withholding or withdrawing in an intensive care unit. Such a life may seem devoid of meaning for some. Yet, Helen Keller has explained how she loved her life and never thought that death might have been a better solution for her. She had a very active social life, which helped her to realize that she was important for others. Her social life was made possible by her ability to communicate with the surrounding world. She understood her interlocutor if he was using the manual alphabet; otherwise, she read lips by placing her fingers on the lips of the person who was speaking to her. She read and wrote braille, and ultimately learned to talk at around 10 years of age.</p>
<p>A conclusion that can be drawn is that, in spite of the difficult circumstances in which some people may live, the important thing for them is to find meaning in their life; such as the love that they can give and receive, which enables them to experience their life as precious for themselves and for others. This validates other testimonies about the meaning of the life in dire situations. For example, Viktor Frankl (psychiatrist and philosopher, founder of logotherapy) asserted that, in any circumstance, he could ‘rise above his fate’ and find meaning in his life thanks to, among other things, spiritual freedom (not to be understood in a religious sense).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011429014">23</xref>
</sup> This was based on his own experience as a deported Jew during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Nietzsche asserted ‘[he] who has a “why” which serves as a goal, a purpose, can live with any “how” ’. He insisted that one was still capable of self-determination despite the circumstances in which one lives. This self-determination corresponds with spiritual freedom; that is, freedom to think and make choices in the circumstances of one’s own life, relating to a Kantian sense of autonomy, that is freedom of thought – the capacity to advance one’s own understanding, as cited by the French National Ethics Consultation Committee.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011429014">24</xref>
</sup> As we stated above, the other (for whom a human being knows that his or her life has significance) can answer the ‘why’ of life. Some may argue that spiritual freedom can be better developed in severely physically disabled patients than among the ‘able-bodied’; because their bodily mobility is limited, they may engage more fully in the ‘autonomy of their thought’ or in ‘spiritual freedom’. Marcel Nuss, with SMA type II, affirmed that ‘autonomy is not a matter of freedom of movements but of intellectual capacities and adaptability’ (translated from the French original). Frankl, quoting Schopenhauer, also recalled that there is ‘negative happiness’ – meaning an absence of pain – to which a person with SMA type 1 may be very receptive, but which a person without a disability may not be conscious of.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733011429014">
<title>Why and when should we not perform a tracheotomy? That is the question</title>
<p>A criterion that some argue can justify not performing a tracheotomy is the impossibility of any expressive communication with one’s surrounding world; no oral or any other form of communication. Owing to ocular motility disorders that further limit the use of communication technologies, this can be the case with the severe form of SMA. It is a sort of locked-in syndrome from the beginning of the patient’s life, perpetuated through life-sustaining intensive care, as the non-expressive child may be able to sense communication from his or her environment.</p>
<p>In the intermediate form of the disease, despite the significance of the disabilities, the child will be able to communicate with the world because he or she will not have ocular motility problems. Some may even be able to communicate orally.</p>
<p>This does not imply, however, that tracheotomy is necessarily right for all children with intermediate forms of the disease.</p>
<p>Treatment decision-making for children, such as tracheotomy, should be based on the child’s best interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011429014">25</xref>
</sup> Article 3 of the United Nations International Convention on the Rights of the Child defends the recognition of the child’s rights by all, that is society, parents and HCPs. In assessing the child’s best interests, the risks and benefits of all treatment options need to be weighed up, considering the principles of non-maleficence and beneficence. Given the ‘locked-in’ state that can result from severe SMA, some would argue that it would be justified to prevent the ‘locking in’ of a child into a state of permanent impossibility in communicating with others, and thus avoid a tracheotomy. This <italic>abstentionist</italic> approach is practised by many centres that work with this population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011429014">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011429014">10</xref>
</sup> Although it is understandably difficult to recognize as a preferable option, the degree of disability associated with severe SMA can justify the withholding of invasive interventions, such as mechanical ventilation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011429014">26</xref>
</sup> This can sometimes be considered to be in the child’s best interests. The child and family, however, should not be abandoned – palliative care should ensure comfort for child and family, including family follow-up after the death of the child.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011429014">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011429014">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For children with intermediate SMA type 1, there are more divergent views regarding treatment approaches. It is important to resist rapidly classifying the child into a category because this can compromise an individualized approach. Rather, it is important to openly consider the different clinical trajectories that each child may evolve towards.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011429014">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In France, it is not rare for children with intermediate SMA type 1 to have a tracheotomy performed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429014">6</xref>
</sup> It is important to highlight the availability in France of programmes for children with disabilities that enable them to pursue various social and school activities despite their disabilities. For example, parents are not responsible for the costs of medical care for the child, enteral feedings, ventilatory or orthopaedic devices, medications or school or ambulance transport. Moreover, a <italic>school life assistant</italic> is provided, who accompanies the child to school, as demonstrated in the case of Yohan below. Parents can also receive approximately 1000 euros per month from the state, which can be combined with other financial support, to assist with, for example, housing costs. Training is provided to parents for the care that they will be providing (e.g. tracheotomy or gastrostomy care) to facilitate the child’s reintegration into the home. Although this financial support can help families manage, the significant difficulties that families can face in caring for a child requiring highly specialized care at home, and the potential consequences that can result, should not be underestimated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011429014">29</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011429014"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011429014">31</xref>
</sup> A recent Norwegian study, reporting similarities with France in terms of state support for disability (e.g. school life assistant, financial support for caring for one’s ventilated child at home), described that in addition to feeling irreplaceable for the disabled loved one, there are additional difficulties arising from system insufficiencies, for example very difficult bureaucracies, insufficient competence and continuity among HCPs and gaps between their expectations and available services,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011429014">32</xref>
</sup> which have been reported by French families as well. It is nevertheless interesting to note that study participants did not regret their commitment, a finding that is also supported by another study.<sup>

<p>However, considering the severity of the disabilities involved, it should not be presumed that all children with intermediate SMA type 1 should be systematically tracheotomized or that this decision can be made unilaterally by the treating team; there has been a long-standing practice of ‘beneficent paternalism’ in French paediatric medicine that regards the physician as the decisional agent for children.<sup>

<p>Another justification cited in France relates to preventing parents from bearing the responsibility for decision-making in life-threatening situations.<sup>

</sup> However, there has been a call for change from families of patients, with the support of influential parent association networks (i.e. a prominent form of advocacy in France) that have gradually fostered a greater role for parents in decision-making, favouring the principle of autonomy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011429014">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011429014">34</xref>
</sup> over traditional French paternalism. But this development remains slow; parents sometimes state that HCPs make them feel compelled to tracheotomize their child despite their initial explicit refusal. French medicine, it seems, has had difficulty developing palliative approaches to respiratory decompensation, because HCPs are accustomed to employing invasive interventions. Throughout a hospitalization, parents become exhausted and eventually resign themselves to ‘accept’ what they initially opposed. Many HCPs believe that parents should not be responsible for life-or-death decisions for their child because they worry that parental refusal of decisions such as providing or withholding a tracheotomy can sometimes make them feel like bad parents, and they can feel guilty over the death of their child.</p>
<p>Some parents change their minds and they become accepting of a tracheotomy and ventilation, despite their being initially opposed. They are heavily involved in the care of their child with SMA and adapt their home and family to bring their child home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When parents do not have the wish or strength to look after their severely disabled child, it is sometimes argued that it might be better not to perform a tracheotomy. This is a difficult and sometimes controversial decision. A child is vulnerable and in need of protection. In the context of health care, HCPs need to assess that parents do not favour their own personal interests over those of the ill child.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733011429014">49</xref>
</sup> It can be uncomfortable to examine the child’s interests in relation to the parents’ interests, given the gravity and severity of the situation – yet this is necessary.</p>
<p>As the child gets older and acquires the ability to communicate, he or she should then also contribute to determining what is best, through a triangular relationship including the child, parents and HCP. Moreover, we have noted (i.e. at Raymond Poincaré Hospital in Garches, France) that as a result of non-invasive nasal ventilation, the need to perform a tracheotomy on these young patients can be delayed and sometimes avoided because some children maintain adequate ventilation without invasive assistance.<sup>

<title>Yohan’s story</title>
<p>Many times at Raymond Poincaré Hospital, we have spoken about tracheotomies with parents of children affected with SMA type 1. A patient in his mid-twenties wanted to discuss this subject. His mother had been contacted for an ongoing study that was approved by the Ethical Council of the Necker Hospital for Sick Children. As he was directly concerned by the subject (the tracheotomy), Yohan (fictitious name) wished to discuss it himself. Like his mother, he signed an informed consent form. To ensure confidentiality, all detailed information has been excluded.</p>
<p>Yohan’s illness was diagnosed at the age of 3 months and he was tracheotomized when he was between 6 and 10 years old. He is totally ventilator dependent.</p>
<p>He lives alone in an apartment with the help of a strong community organization, established with the help of his parents, who live nearby. He is a postgraduate student. The interview took place at his home in the presence of his mother, who repeated what could not be understood because of the difficulties he has with oral communication.</p>
<p>Yohan remembers the months preceding his tracheotomy very well. Clearly, he did not want it:<disp-quote>
<p>… initially I did not much want the tracheotomy and neither did my mother. I thought it would be hell. We were told (speaking to other tracheotomized people, their families and also some doctors) it would be very hard. We were told that it would not be possible to go out anymore because of bulky and heavy equipment, as well as medical procedures that would be difficult to learn. Basically it would be the end of my social life. So, I was not at all inclined to abruptly stop all the activities I had. I went to school, I met other children, I played wheelchair football, I invited friends over, we went out normally. I didn’t realize that I was thinking in terms of my social life at that time, but in fact, I was. I was thinking about seeing my friends, until the day breathing became laborious, difficult and life threatening. We didn’t do an emergency tracheotomy because it was caught early enough so that it was not last minute, but still it was close. We did it by necessity, by obligation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>His mother had also not been in favour of the tracheotomy:<disp-quote>
<p>… I had a hard time telling him there was this vital need. I knew he could die and he knew it too. But I couldn’t verbalize this and tell him: now, if you don’t have a tracheotomy, you won’t live. We said we wouldn’t burden him. But that was silly because a child at that age is just as discerning as an adult in understanding these things, especially when it’s about his life …What was unfortunate was that those who did not support the tracheotomy didn’t clearly tell him he would die.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both remember having received two opposing discourses:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>one favourable view, held either by families whose child was suffering from the same pathology and already receiving invasive ventilatory support or by HCPs accustomed to working with patients with SMA; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the other ‘non-favourable’ view, also held by families or by HCPs who, in contrast, were unfamiliar with the illness and did not provide care for this kind of patient.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In such stories, it is clear that death is frequently a taboo subject, avoided by parents as well as HCPs, regardless of their views towards invasive ventilatory support. Everyone keeps silent to protect others. It is true that 15–16 years ago, when Yohan’s respiratory status deteriorated, HCPs had less training and were less comfortable than now in discussing palliative approaches to care. When it is decided not to use invasive ventilatory support, it is important that parents and children know they will always be accompanied and supported, and that children will receive quality care. This must be explained to them clearly.</p>
<p>Speaking of his hospital stays, Yohan described some very positive moments where ‘concrete’ problems were solved (e.g. refitting a corset that became too small). However, he also has memories of great distress:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt terrorized by the idea that they were not my parents. I felt in danger of death because my parents were not there. It was not incompetence that I dreaded from the staff, but each case is unique. At the hospital, a doctor will know all the general aspects of a disease, but he doesn’t live 24/7 with a patient. So in spite of his good intentions, and all his skills, he won’t know any particularities which are learned about the patient over time. I could not communicate what was wrong and it was hardly noticeable to someone who had almost never seen me and hardly knew me. In the presence of my parents, I was much more confident against all doctors and medical staff because I knew right away that my parents could make adjustments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The word ‘terrorized’ seemed a bit too strong so we asked Yohan if speaking about fear or anxiety, which are more moderate, would be more appropriate. He maintained that the word was entirely suited to what he felt at that time. His parents could easily understand problems of choking, congestion or painful position, which even the best-intentioned staff would detect only after a longer period. It is interesting to note the paradox, that the child felt ‘in danger of death’ while he was hospitalized in a monitoring unit. His mother said she respected the rules of the unit, which imposed ‘visiting’ hours. For children struggling to express themselves (as is the case for those with SMA type 1), the presence of parents should not be categorically limited, but should be adapted to the child’s and parents’ needs. This is particularly important in view of the child’s vulnerability, compounded by communication difficulties.</p>
<p>Yohan’s testimony demonstrates that in extremely difficult situations such as these, the patient’s social life is an important source of comfort, nurturance and safety. HCPs should facilitate patient contact with their social supports.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have not examined justice as an ethical principle in this article, even though it is an important consideration. The French health insurance system – admittedly producing results which are good but extremely expensive, and therefore lead to further budgetary deficit – allows even low-income families to provide life support to their severely disabled children. State-funded health care may well have influenced some decisions relating to invasive ventilatory support. However, in some situations of significant disability, as described in this article, social inequities can become more evident. Despite the various subsidies that a family may receive (from associations or public funding), parents from the upper socioeconomic classes will have fewer difficulties than a low-income family in accommodating the needs of a severely disabled family member. Greater family financial resources can help improve housing conditions, obtain necessary equipment (e.g. electric wheelchair with multiple functions, adapted automobile, etc.) and allow parents to educate their children more easily. A low-income family can have greater difficulty in addressing these needs, which can have serious consequences on the children’s lives. We can see here the importance of relating social policy as well as the healthcare insurance system developed within a country. France has been defined as a ‘welfare state’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733011429014">50</xref>
</sup> and it gives HCPs substantial means to offer care. Two paediatric neurologists recently disclosed to the first author (BR) that when they propose procedures or devices for their young patients (e.g. a tracheotomy, a gastrostomy or a corset) they never worry about the costs because parents will not need to pay any of them. Such devices can improve patients’ quality of life, and allow them a more fulfilling social life, as we saw in Yohan’s case. From the perspective of parents, they do not ask about the cost of these devices either because they know that they will be paid for. On the other hand, when these paediatric neurologists care for young patients arriving from other countries, where little or no support is available, one of the first questions raised by their parents when these assistive devices are proposed is how much it will cost. The absence of state support for this population also deters these paediatric neurologists from speaking about tracheotomies to families from these countries. This is because they know that once they return home they will not be able to care for their child, nor maintain the technologies required to sustain life. This would put these families in an absolutely intolerable situation.</p>
<p>This case study helps us to understand that decisions regarding tracheotomies for children with SMA type 1 are not to be based exclusively on medical considerations. There is also a complex interplay between family, state and society, which must be pondered. Although this article focused on the French context, we believe our analysis will foster further interdisciplinary studies of the ethical issues involved with the care of this population in other settings.</p>
