<p>Taking Jürgen Müller’s (2012) article <italic>The sound of history and acoustic memory: Where psychology and history converge</italic> as a starting point, we make a critical reflection about the way in which sound has been represented in history and the many ways in which the intersection between sound and history has been understood. We centre our critique on two components of Müller’s work. The first of these is a bias according to which the past is seen as a reality that can be accessed directly, as if one could travel back in time. The second is the mixture of different aspects in the definition of the historiography of sound, including levels, methods, objects and very disparate subjects under study. We suggest that the experience of the past is necessarily mediated by the conditions of the present, and the work of historiography is always subject to certain intentions.</p>

<body>
<p>In his interesting article about acoustic memory and history, Jürgen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456718">Müller (2012)</xref> rightly claims that historiography should take full advantage of sound. He restores the resource of sounds as a tool to better understand the past. He underlines the fact that most historians only recur to texts, and more recently to images. Against this, Müller defends that the use of acoustic memory allows for a more trustworthy and complete image of the past. In this sense, he asks that better historiographic attention be paid to sounds, understood in diverse forms: as soundscapes from different times and places, as tools to produce emotional effects and feelings of identity in audiences, as part of a historical ethnomusicology, etc. Potentiating this type of investigation could generate, according to the author, a historiographic “aural turn” that he considers enriching and therefore desirable.</p>
<p>However, Müller’s article provokes many uncertainties with respect to the way in which the historiographic relevance of sound is understood. Among these uncertainties, we have chosen to focus on two: his realist conception of history and his lack of historiographic precision.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1354067X12456718"><title>The time machine, echoes of the past and the myth of historical authenticity</title>
<p>From our point of view, the argument of Müller’s article reveals a conception of history that is very close to what Patrick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354067X12456718">Gardiner (1961)</xref> called “the time machine fallacy”. It is the idea that we could consider the past exactly as it was if only we had a time machine to travel back to it. It supposes that the past, in some way, is out there floating on an imaginary stage and we could directly access it if only we could enter into that stage. We could intimately enter into past events and take the place of its protagonists just as the classical hermeneutics of Schleiermacher aimed.</p>
<p>At least, this idea of the authenticity of history can be debated. In the case of sound, what comes to us from the past is a kind of echo that is irremediably mediated by the artefact in which it is transported (for example pewter plates or magnetic tape), the conditions in which it was recorded and the reason why this was done (Müller himself refers to the discourse of William II recorded in a studio months after it “really” happened).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354067X12456718">1</xref></sup> It is as if Müller had a nostalgic interest in having “an immediate and authentic impression of the original sound of history”, in such a way that sounds –as opposed to texts – became the <italic>via regia</italic> to access the past without mediations. This attitude recalls the classic and undying suspicions Plato and Socrates had against written tricks in the interest of the purity of face-to-face communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X12456718">Havelock, 1986</xref>). In fact, a few years ago, this debate was renewed precisely because of the proliferation of new audio/visual technologies and the unrest produced by their uncertain moral, psychological or ideological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456718">Langham, 1994</xref>). Behind this debate is the idea that the spoken word is more authentic and true than the written word. This is because oral communication is predominated by emotional dimensions that are supposed to be closer to the “true nature” of the speaker, the message or the situation.</p>
<p>The relation between paralinguistic or emotional traits and the authenticity of the phenomenon that is under study is also seen in Müller’s article. He seems to be more concerned with the possibility of recovering and experimenting with the authentic sound of the past than with the methodological and analytical conditions implied in the handling of the sound sources. He mentions, for example the use of sounds in tourist attractions – church bells or steam engines – as way to introduce the sensorial experiences of our ancestors into the present. In some way, Müller shows a nostalgic or aesthetic fascination for these experiences and because of this forgets that they are stripped of their context when they are recreated. The original experience, which was vital and integral, cannot be reproduced in present subjects. The same thing happens when he alludes to the soundscapes of other times. To recreate them with fidelity, based on textual and visual sources of information that we already have would be like rewriting the lost works of Aristophanes based on the works we already have.</p>
<p>As a consequence of Müller’s aesthetic and nostalgic attitude, the historiographic implications of the loss of historic sounds are exaggerated. Without a doubt, the private recordings of Nixon provide valuable information about the politics of America 40 years ago. Also, it cannot be denied that the dialogues of Hitler or Churchill had a decisive historical influence. Nevertheless, there are as well crucial historical consequences related to “textual events” such as the publication of <italic>Principia Mathematica</italic> by Newton, <italic>Don Quixote</italic> by Cervantes, <italic>The Origin of Species</italic> by Darwin or the work of coding and decoding around the Enigma machine during World War II. For the same reason, we should take the inviability of listening to the soundscapes of Ancient Greece or the Middle Ages with a grain of salt. The destruction of the Library of Alexandria also deprived historians of irreplaceable resources. When we read that the impossibility of listening to past sounds implies “a severe limitation to our understanding of historical events and processes”, in such a way that “our understanding of the past must remain fragmentary and deficient”, we feel the same as if someone tells us that the fact that we do not have wings constitutes a severe limitation on our ability to fly like birds. With respect to what, exactly, does our understanding of the past remain fragmented and deficient with? The fallacy of the time machine consists precisely of thinking that objective – real or imaginable – references exist that can be compared to our understanding of the past. In fact, it is debatable that historians can be distinguished from other investigators because they “have no immediate access to what has happened”. No investigator has immediate access to a truth or intrinsic reality about his or her object of study. All investigators construct their objects through different classes of mediations. It is not the past that creates the memory; rather it is the opposite.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fallacy of the time machine is intimately tied to historiographic realism. This is a variant of epistemological realism, that is to say, the belief in an objective reality that can be captured and represented cognitively if only we apply the correct methods. The concept of memory – whether it is personal or historical – that best fits with this realism is that of a repository of information. It assumes that there is, or was, an objective world that is captured by individual memory and which historical memory tries to recapture. In both cases, the memory is treated like a data archive filled with information taken from the outside. Contrary to this, in our point of view, memory is not a register of facts. Facts can only be defined within a determined context of use and in relation to other meanings and artefacts implied in them. Aristotle himself considered that the physical memory trace is defined by the act of remembering and not the other way around. Despite this, the literal interpretation of the metaphor of memory trace has had a long history. For example, cognitive psychologists still study echoic memory understood as a transitory store of sensory information received from the outside. Memory is understood spatially and it is considered to be the place where things are stored or where they happen. This presupposes the belief in an external world, apart from our activity, that provides the material stored in that place. Nevertheless, during the two seconds that echoic memory is supposed to last, the subjects are doing something. They are solving a task. For this, they are putting into action a system of habits that functionally readjusts according to what is demanded from the task. In the same way, the historians put into practice a series of concepts and skills that adapt to the purpose of whatever they are studying. Neither the experimental subjects nor the historians face an external reality that provides raw information or tells them how to act. In the same sense, our memories do not literally correspond to episodes of our lives, but rather depend on frameworks and the contextual demands of the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354067X12456718">Halbwachs, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X12456718">Middleton &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>). When we talk about collective, formalized memory, as is the case with history, we also have to take into account the objectives of the group doing the study, which reconstruct this memory. It is they who define the meaning and value of the historical event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X12456718">Hobsbawm &amp; Ranger, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A good alternative to the metaphor of the time machine is the well known metaphor of the foreign country with which Leslie Poles Hartley begins his novel The Go-Between: “<italic>The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354067X12456718">Hartley, 1953</xref>). In this sense, the historian is not so much a traveller in time as a traveller in space. Because of this, she or he should behave like a kind of tourist or anthropologist. It is, in a way, to visit a place whose inhabitants have different customs that need to be interpreted. Of course, actual historians cannot move from their workplace in time or in space. It is their tools and the conditions of their own context that influence their experience of the past. These tools and conditions can be utilized – sifting through the remains of the past – to give form and sense to a convincing historical narration. Furthermore, even if we were able to construct a time machine, we would still have the same problems as an anthropologist who visited an exotic tribe and expected to understand the natives. A voyage through time would not give us substantial epistemological advantages. Being in the past does not guarantee that we would be closer to the facts for the simple reason that facts do not exist as such, apart from our mediated experience. Whether we are observers or participants, being in the past does not free us from selecting facts, interpreting and inserting them in a significant narrative. The result is the construction of an historical narrative that will enjoy more or less success depending on its coherence, its rhetoric virtues, its scientific value, how well it fits into a particular set of ideas, etc. But this success will not depend on whether it is faithful to the past. The faithfulness to the past, that is, that the audience receiving the narration feels that the events actually happened as it is told, is a consequence and not a cause of the success of the historical construction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1354067X12456718"><title>Too much noise: How can we reconcile sound with our historiographic theory?</title>
<p>It is difficult to precisely identify the “scope” of Müller’s article, that is, what its specific historiographic purpose is with respect to the use of sounds by the historian. He argues in favour of the primal importance of sound – in a phylogenetic, ontogenetic and historio-genetic sense – and the wide range of sound experiences in our species. In this way, he underlines the evolutionary importance of listening, the non-existence of human societies without sounds, the presence of oral traditions before writing and the early embryonic development of hearing. It seems clear that Müller uses these (debatable) examples in order to justify the historiographic interest of sound. In the same vein, he affirms that historians “must learn to listen to the sound of history and thereby avail themselves […] of the opportunities which acoustic experience and acoustic memory offer for a deeper understanding of the actions and decisions of men and women in the past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456718">Müller, 2012</xref>, p. 458). Nevertheless, this affirmation can be understood in many ways. In fact, Müller himself sums up works that deal with such disparate matters as the reconstruction of soundscapes of historically relevant times and places, the rhetoric, emotional and identity effect of the discourses of great statesmen, the musical experience of the opera, the acoustic conditions of certain settings, the musical archaeology, the phenomenological reconstruction of some sound experiences, the history of listening, etc. It is true that, at the end of his article, he tries to put some order to this disparity of topics and to offer specific proposals. However, in his proposals, he continues mixing different elements – that only share their common acoustic condition – under the same common category.</p>
<p>For instance, he does not make a basic differentiation between oral, musical and merely audible sources. He does not distinguish between methods (the use of archives) and topics (soundscapes, sound producers, acoustic torture, communication effects, etc.) either. In the same way, he uses a generic idea of “communication” without discriminating between possible levels of analysis of communicative phenomena. Thus, he does not consider the distinction between denotational – the meaning, semantic or cognitive – and connotational or paralinguistic – pragmatic, prosodic, emotional – aspects of communication. He also does not pay too much attention to the difference between the emission of sound and the supports that transport it. Perhaps this explains his excessive emphasis on the contrast between the lack of acoustic registers before the 20th century and the conservation of paintings and texts from ancient times. In our judgement, these visual relics can be understood not only as information but also as supports that transport it to the present. Because of this, it would be more relevant to compare these visual relics to the mnemonic, poetic and rhetoric practices that enabled ancient societies – oral, preliterate or mostly illiterate – to remember.</p>
<p>These practices ordered the temporal becoming and allowed for its conservation by way of recurring verbal figures. Understood in this way, oral techniques have been preserved to this day. We can recognize them in many current strategies of versification and creation of rhythm such as what comes out of religious worship or the radio transmission of football games – apart from those traditions that still exist in contemporary preliterate societies. The last example in which Müller confounds vehicle and transmission is found in his comparison of the sound of ancient musical instruments and the human voice. From his point of view, instruments can still bring us closer to the true music of the past, while the human voice cannot be recovered. With this affirmation, he does not take into account that the human sound making apparatus, which was established in long past philogenetic times, can itself be considered a musical instrument. Without doubt, the human voice emits sounds that are very similar to those that our furthest ancestors could. In any case, we insist that elements of the past that are transported to the present through whatever vehicle (paintings, texts, mnemonic practices, musical instruments, vocal apparatus, etc.) take part in an experience that is already different from our ancestors’.</p>
<p>From our perspective, the importance of sound in itself is something that is too vague and general to give some sort of unitary meaning to that plethora of material, topics, levels and methods. Nevertheless, it seems that, for Müller, such importance is itself reason enough to justify the attention of the historian. In his article, there are no references to the role of the hypothesis, theoretical framework or methodological strategies that should guide our attention to sounds. We think that he does not notice that the relation between sound and history is just as non-specific as the relation of history to any other subject matter. The use of any historical subject matter – sounds, texts, images or whatever – is pertinent only in function of the objectives of the specific historical investigation that is being carried out. In a given investigation, it could be relevant to ask about the emotive effects of the paralinguistic aspects of one of Hitler’s discourses, while in another investigation one could focus on the metamorphosis of the official written communications in the Third Reich. In the same way, the theoretical-ideological framework of the historiographical work can determine which type of material is pertinent to use in each case. For example, according to some perspectives, the use of oral history has been defined as “from below” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X12456718">Fraser, 1993</xref>), that is to say, a way for the common man or oppressed peoples to make up for a history based on “great men” or “great events” (the analysis of the recordings of Bismarck or Martin Luther King would be perfectly compatible with the last). That being said, contemporary oral history has not come to us by way of an “aural turn”, but rather a “linguistic turn” and a postmodern anthropology that leads the <italic>emic</italic> perspective to its ultimate consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456718">Palti, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To sum up, what does the historiographic use of sound consist of? Which historiographic sensibility does it serve, if in fact it serves one more than another and not all of them equally or not at all? There are many disparate possible combinations between sound and history. In our opinion, it is not important to fall back on sound, but the purpose of our historical research. Like Müller, we believe that the richness of primary sources is in itself positive. It is better to have more sources of historical information, and all the better when more sensorial organs are affected; but what is important is what we do with these sources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1354067X12456718"><title>Historiographic messianism and morals</title>
<p>We would like to conclude with a note about the last intention of Müller’s article. When he denounces the forgetting of sounds by historians and suggests a historiographic “aural turn”, is not he exaggerating this forgetting and adopting a slightly messianic attitude towards the near future that is reinforced by this attitude? Müller himself goes over works by historians who adopt different perspectives and have contributed to clarify the role that sound has carried out in different times and situations. Two of the references are more than 40 years old, specifically from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456718">1908–1913 (Friedlaender)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X12456718">1967 (Wille</xref>). Oral history, in turn, has been in use for centuries. The preoccupation with oral traditions and acoustic memory was also very present amongst historians, folklorists, linguists, ethnologists and psychologists of the 19th century, who wanted to conserve what was produced in a popular culture that was usually pre-literate and based on oral traditions. They were conscious of the fact that, in contrast to an urban culture based on writing, oral traditions favoured the disappearance of myths, songs and legends. The register of these products was saved through transcriptions before they could be recorded. Therefore, the historiographic forgetting of sound is relative and should at least be nuanced.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone is liable to fall into the trap of rhetorical excess that we attribute to Müller, perhaps because it is not easy to give another form to the morals of our narrations. It is common to find texts in which the history of a discipline or an area is reconstructed in such a way that an unsuitable oblivion is condemned, the signs of a correction are detected and a commitment to take this into the future is made. However, these reconstructions are often too indebted to their ends: to persuade their audience to adhere to a cause that is presupposed to be noble. If it is “incontestable that a greater attention to the importance of sound and listening will considerably enhance our knowledge of history”, who with a sound judgment would not follow suit and not contribute to the progress of history by joining the “aural turn”?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are a little more complicated than that, we are afraid. Some of the reasons for this complexity have already been pointed out throughout this paper. We will now attempt at summarizing and organizing them with a view to making a specific proposal on the functions and objectives that, in our opinion, should be met by any history of sound.
<list id="list1-1354067X12456718" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. A historiographical product is not a “picture” or direct retrieval of the past. It consists of a construction from relics. Historiographical activity should therefore be understood in terms of a complex mediated experience in which a number of components take part. These components include at least 1) the “prejudices” of the historian (his or her purposes, theoretical framework and methods, ideology, etc.); 2) the instruments used in his or her research (archives, books, dating tests, pictures, recordings, etc.); and 3) the use of relics (which are not something self-evident, but also a result of construction).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2. Oral history is the only historiographical domain where the use of sound can be considered to be specific and essential. The aim of oral history is to reconstruct the meanings of the past throughout anonymous agents, regardless of the official historical conception or the actions of great men. Thus, the human voice stands out as the most important primary source – or even the only one. Of course, oral productions of interviewees are to be inserted into the historical narrative constructed by the historian.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3. Beyond oral history, the interest in sound alone is not enough to sustain a full historiographical construction or perspective. For the interest in sound, when not serving a historiographical purpose or theory, is absolutely nonspecific, or merely aesthetic. To hear the alleged soundscape of a late 19th-century town, for instance, may be surprising or even exciting. But, why exactly would we wish to reconstruct such soundscape? Sound is just one primary source among many others: it may be used to achieve our historiographical aims, but has no more or less importance than they may have.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>4. Due to the disparateness of sound sources, a classification of those available for historiographical study would be necessary for methodological reasons. Such classification should include, at least, registers of the human voice (speeches, oral history and others), recorded music (instrumental and vocal), and other sounds and noises (background noise, machine and animal noise, etc.), as well as mixed registers. In addition, different possible levels of analysis should be distinguished within each of these categories (for example, linguistic and paralinguistic components; locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary acts; articulatory, acoustic and perceptive levels; intensity, duration, tone and pitch; and so on).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Anyway, we would like to end by emphasizing the virtues of Müller’s proposal. One of these, of course, is that it provides reason for discussion and this is good in itself. But Müller’s proposal is interesting too because it serves to remember that the plurality of historiographic sources of information is valuable as a way to support the construction of new historical accounts. Acoustic memory is a fundamental element in certain classes of historical narrations; for example, in the history of everyday activities, sociological history, cultural history or genealogy (in the sense of Nietzsche and Foucault). Acoustic memory reminds us that human experience is plural and has multiple dimensions. It also warns us against fetishism in writing and a kind of decrepit humanism that is based, according to Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X12456718">Sloterdijk’s (2009)</xref> metaphor, on an uninterrupted epistolary chain that connects us with the ancient Greeks. Of course, what we have just said presupposes theoretical and historiographical choices, and that is what we have missed in Müller’s article, which seems to accept following the old naive concept of history as an access to the past. In any case, we would like to have contributed to the broadening of this debate.</p>

<fn id="fn1-1354067X12456718"><label>1</label><p>The different historical moments and situations in which the techniques of oral communication and the artefacts of sound recording appear need to be taken into account. Mnemonic techniques, writing, printing press or audio visual recordings have taken with them historical changes in our psychological functions. They condition the vital experiences and expectations of the subjects in each moment and sociocultural context. This includes the historians themselves. One reason why we believe that the sounds of that past are relevant as a source of historical information is, precisely, the fact that we are immersed in an audiovisual culture. For this same reason, one should be cautious when considering the deficiencies of the written word as a source of historiographic information. Writing has also decisively influenced the way people have lived. The importance of newspapers in popular culture at the end of the 19th century conditioned life in this era in the same way that the mnemonic, poetic and rhetoric practices were fundamental in the lives of the ancient Greeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X12456718">Havelock, 1986</xref>).</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
