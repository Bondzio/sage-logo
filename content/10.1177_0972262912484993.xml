<abstract>
<p>The case presents a situation wherein an investment company based out of US wants to increase returns to its investors and how it chooses to invest in emerging markets. Then the case proceeds with a unanimous decision by the management to invest in Indian economy. It shows how the fund manager goes about selecting the valuation technique namely, Relative valuation for decision making. There is a comparison being shown of relative valuation versus discounted cash flow (DCF) technique and why relative valuation is chosen over DCF. Further, it shows how the fund manager analyzed various sectors based on price multiples. The sectoral analysis of 18 sectors of BSE 500 Index has been done for a total period of 1990–2010 and three sub-periods. The case also highlights the importance of normality test before making decisions on the basis of summary statistics of price distributions. Finally, the case provides a decision situation to students in which they have to decide which sectors to choose for the investment and they are also required to provide a rationale of their choice.</p>

<title>Turmoil in International Financial Markets</title>
<p>It was the morning of 10 July 2011 and Barbara Hall, CEO Arctic International LLC, was engaged in meeting with her Fund Managers. Arctic International, an investment company with its head office located at New York, has over $1 billion assets under its management and has presence in matured markets mainly in US and Europe. However, looking at the turmoil in US and European markets, it was becoming difficult for the company to generate abnormal returns for investors. The entire developed world was facing the worst economic and financial crisis of the century. The crisis emanated from US as a result of bust of housing boom which led to the one of the worst financial crisis seen by US after the great depression. The impact of the crisis was so severe, that it led to the credit crunch not only in US but also in other parts of world including the entire European region. The unemployment rate in US and Europe was at its peak, liquidity was completely sucked out of the financial system and there were no investment opportunities available in mature markets.</p>
<p>The agenda of the meeting was to explore new opportunities outside matured markets to increase return for investors. Barbara was looking quite restless as she talked to her Fund Managers, ‘It’s been quite disappointing show. In the last two quarters we have not been able to perform well due to market conditions. What should we do to increase returns for our investors?’ James Rodricks, Vice President- Arctic International LLC- suggested, ‘Why not go in for investments in emerging markets? No doubt they are volatile but that’s where returns are.’ After deliberating for about three hours, it was unanimously decided in the meeting, that looking at the crisis in western world and immense opportunities available in developing world, the company would explore opportunities in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Barbara asked James to submit a report within a week’s time with regards to investment in emerging economies. After doing preliminary research, James came out to the conclusion that they should invest in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. To support his argument he deliberated, ‘these economies are the fastest growing economies with a combined GDP of around $15 trillion’. He further quoted, ‘as per an estimate given by Goldman Sachs, these countries will become the most prominent by 2050 leaving behind G7 countries which include US, UK, Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Italy’. James was confident that if the money is invested in these economies, the company will be able to maximize returns for its investors. On the basis of James’ report it was decided that the company would go for investment in emerging economies. Barbara delegated the task of investment in emerging markets to James.</p>

<sec id="section2-0972262912484993">
<title>Focus: India</title>
<p>James proposed the name of Alok Singh who had successfully managed funds worth $200 mn for European region. Alok Singh, an IIT Kharagpur graduate and an IIM Alumuni with work experience of over 15 years, had been working as Fund Manager with the company since past seven years. Before Arctic, Alok worked at different positions in investment banking, mutual fund and equity research firms in India for about eight8 years. Looking at the accomplishments of Alok in European markets and his initial experience in Indian capital market, unanimous decision was taken to give him the responsibility to handle funds for emerging markets. Alok was very excited at being selected for the task. However, Alok suggested that considering his experience and the growth opportunities available in India, it would be appropriate if they explore the Indian economy for investment opportunities. James agreed to his request and Alok was given the task to find out viable investment opportunities in Indian markets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0972262912484993">
<title>Valuation Technique Decision</title>
<p>As a starting point, Alok had to decide about the way he should go about valuing companies and sectors in the Indian market. Being out of India for over a decade, he did have a broad idea about equity markets in India, but he had not regularly followed Indian companies and sectors. So, he decided to understand the Indian markets at macro level by analyzing various sectors. Alok had to make a choice between the two predominant valuation techniques i.e. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Relative valuation for valuing various companies/sectors. He recognized that DCF is one of the most accepted technique used for valuation but it requires a lot of assumptions about various inputs like growth, cashflows and risk. Relative valuation on the other hand is easy to perform as compared to DCF. It finds out the value of a company’s share by comparing it with other firms in the same industry. Alok thought it is better to start looking at companies through their price multiples.</p>
<p>Since, Alok was entering the Indian equity market after a significant time gap, he wanted to study the behaviour of price multiples before using them for valuation. He selected two predominantly used price multiples viz. Price to earnings (P/E) and Price to Book Value (P/BV) for his analysis.</p>
<p>In order to understand the time series behaviour of the above mentioned price multiples; he wanted to study the distributional properties of price multiples at sector level. Since, he was trying to analyze Indian equity market at sectoral level; he wanted to select as many sectors as possible. To understand the Indian economy at macro level, he decided to go with sector classification of BSE 500 index,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0972262912484993">1</xref></sup> a broad based market index of Bombay Stock Exchange. He selected CMIE Prowess Database<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0972262912484993">2</xref></sup> to extract information about the price multiples. While exploring the database he found that he could get relevant information from 1990 onwards. Out of the 20 sectors of BSE 500 index, he finally picked 17 sectors (omitting diversified and miscellaneous as they don’t connote anything and media &amp; publishing due to lack of sufficient data). Finally, he selected 17 sectors to analyze them over a period of 21 years, that is, 1990–2010.</p>
<p>Alok appointed another Indian, Krishna, in his team as research analyst to analyze Indian economy. In order to analyze the 17 sectors, Alok divided the total time period of 21 years (1990–2010) into three sub-periods viz. 1990–1996, 1997–2003 and 2004–2010 due to their economic relevance in the context of India. Along with sub-periods Alok decided to study the price multiples for total period, that is, 1990–2010, in order to understand the robustness of price multiples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0972262912484993">
<title>Data Analysis: Need for Caution</title>
<p>Alok asked Krishna to undertake the analysis of distributional properties for the total period and three sub-periods and submit report within a week’s time. After doing a lot of number crunching, Krishna submitted a report to Alok containing distributional characteristics viz. the mean and standard deviations of various sectors for all the periods. Krishna looked very excited while submitting the report and informed Alok,
<disp-quote>
<p>Sir, we are getting very interesting results for different sectors. One trend I have noticed is that sectors which are having high (low) P/E for total period also have high (low) P/E for sub periods. Another interesting trend is that generally price multiples of all the sectors of BSE 500 are showing declining trend from sub period 1 to sub period 2.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Looking at the report Alok giggled and asked Krishna, ‘I assume that while giving such interesting results, you have tested the distributions for normality test before quoting results?’ After listening to Alok, Krishna realized his mistake and requested to give extension of two days to conduct normality test. Krishna employed a One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) using 5 per cent level of significance to test normality both for total period and three sub-periods and provided results to Alok (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0972262912484993">Table 1</xref>). He observed that none of the sample companies exhibited non-normality for sub-period data as well as for total period and that’s why the results submitted earlier were fine.</p>

<p>Once the normality was established, Alok looked at the distributional properties (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912484993">Table 2</xref>) of P/E and P/B for various sectors. He found that there were few sectors which were low P/E ratio sectors even in bull phases and few sectors whose P/E ratio was very high even in bear phases. Agriculture, Textiles and Transport equipment to name a few were the sectors for Indian economy which were low P/E sectors, while IT and Housing Related were sectors whose average P/E was quite high. Even in sub-period 2 when all the sectors showed a declining P/E trend IT sector was having very high P/E ratio. He found similar results for P/B ratio for various sectors in different time periods.</p>

<p>Apart from studying the distributional properties, Krishna also provided an analysis of the relationship between the mean values of price multiples and their volatility. He tried to analyze the association between volatility as described by standard deviation and the price multiples using Spearman ranked correlation coefficient for all the sectors during different sub periods as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0972262912484993">Table 3</xref>. After looking at the results both Alok and Krishna found that sectors that had high mean price multiples also had high standard deviations for all the periods. It gave further clarity to Alok in regards to selection of various sectors.</p>
