<abstract>
<p>This article analyzes violence within the framework of power relations and social conflict, aiming to comprehend the different dynamics that lead to escalation of violence or its containment by opening political space for representation. It distinguishes between the violence of dominant and non-dominant groups and explores the conditions of effective resistance that facilitate recognition and negotiation. The Israeli–Palestinian case provides an opportunity to explore the dynamics of resistance and violence and their relation to politics. The goal is to explain the contradictory reactions to the First and Second Intifada in order to analyze options for the future. The article argues that the First Intifada opened up political space for recognition and negotiations but since the Second Intifada there has been only violence, no politics. The First Intifada demarcated the borders of the Israeli state and the imagined Palestinian state, while the second blurred them. Palestinian resistance is in a catch: when it uses violence it is oppressed, and when it uses diplomatic negotiations it is ignored. Given the absence of recognized borders and the imbalance of power between Israelis and Palestinians, international intervention is required both in the form of pressure on Israel and in the form of peace troops.</p>

<p>Cet article analyse la violence dans le cadre des relations de pouvoir et de conflit social avec pour but de saisir les différentes dynamiques qui mènent à une intensification de la violence ou à son endiguement en ouvrant un espace politique de représentation. Il fait la distinction entre la violence des groupes dominants et des groupes dominés et il explore les conditions d’une résistance efficace qui facilite la reconnaissance et la négociation. Le cas israélo-palestinien offre une chance d’explorer les dynamiques de la résistance et de la violence et leurs relations avec la politique. L’objectif est d’expliquer les réactions contradictoires à la première et à la deuxième intifada afin d’analyser les options pour l’avenir. L’article argumente que la première intifada avait ouvert un espace politique de reconnaissance et de négociations mais que la deuxième intifada n’a engendré que de la violence et aucune discussion politique. La première intifada avait délimité les frontières de l’État d’Israël et de l’État palestinien imaginé, alors que la deuxième les a brouillées. La résistance palestinienne est prise au piège: lorsqu’elle use de violence, elle est opprimée quand elle use de diplomatie, elle est ignorée. Étant donnés l’absence de frontières reconnues et le déséquilibre de pouvoir entre Israéliens et Palestiniens, une intervention internationale est nécessaire tant sous la forme de pressions sur Israël que sous la forme de forces de la paix.</p>

<p>Recent events in the Middle East have uncovered a conceptual lacuna in democratization theories as they relate to violence. The question is: when is civil society mobilization recognized as legitimate, and when does it lead to increasing state repression?</p>
<p>I argue in this article that in order to comprehend the dynamics of democratization it is necessary to make a distinction between repressive violence of the dominant groups and the state, and the violence of civil society, the latter being necessary for recognition of rights and claims. The violence of the subordinated may open up political space to their representatives for dialogue, while state violence is designed to ensure non-recognition and prevent political negotiations. The violence of subordinated groups seeking recognition will be termed <italic>resistance</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392112456506">1</xref></sup> The investigation of resistance aims to expand the analytical concept of political space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>: Ch. 2) in order to comprehend the complex relations between politics and violence. This expanded research project aims at exploring the conditions that facilitate the opening of political space by acts of resistance, and understanding the conditions under which resistance leads to more repression and escalation of violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392112456506">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the analytical toolkits suggested here may contribute to understanding the differences among democratization processes in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Libya and other countries in the region, my analysis focuses on the Israeli–Palestinian dynamic power relations. The peculiar test case of Palestinian resistance and the different state reactions will help us examine the theory of dynamic opening and closure of political space. This process will be framed as a question of unilateral imposition of Israeli military rule vs. ambivalent Palestinian strategies, oscillating between popular resistance and organized violence designed to oppose Israeli military rule, on the one hand, and diplomatic negotiations, on the other. In other words, the Israeli–Palestinian case provides an opportunity to explore the dynamics of resistance and their interrelation with politics.</p>
<p>In order to explore the conditions for violent repression or political recognition this article compares two apparently similar moments of popular mass protest, with opposite outcomes: the First Intifada that broke out in December 1987 and the Second Intifada that started in September 2000. While the first culminated in mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in September 1993, the second spiraled into escalating violence, brought diplomatic efforts to an end and led to a stalemate characterized by unilateral moves.</p>
<p>The comparison of the two Intifadas will help us define the conditions for effective resistance, namely such that leads to recognition of the subordinated groups and negotiations between the dominant and dominated elites. The article attempts to explain why Palestinian resistance is constantly neutralized by the State of Israel, even after bilateral negotiations and recognition of legitimate claims. The article concludes that without international pressure on Israel the Palestinians will continue to pursue their ambivalent strategy, oscillating between resistance and violence, without achieving any concrete political results.</p>

<title>Politics vs. violence: The dynamics of political space</title>
<p>Politics and violence are two distinct forms of power relations and domination. They are usually interpreted as a continuum and not as contradictory forms of power. In Hanna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392112456506">Arendt’s (1969)</xref> discussion of violence she argues that the state, as the main institution of power, uses violence only when it has lost its political power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392112456506">3</xref></sup> The dominant elites’ most important form of power is political power, namely the citizens’ recognition of their legitimate rule, while the use of violence in order to rule is the last resort, used when popular support has dwindled.</p>
<p>Violence is a form of power based on unilateral imposition by physical force and coercion. Political power is based on symbolic recognition, consent and legitimacy. Usually domination combines elements of both forms of power: no unilateral rule can subsist only by coercion, and no legitimate regime is completely free of some level of coercion. However, when a regime has lost its legitimacy rulers tend to escalate violent coercion.</p>
<p>To understand the tendency to use violence and historical moments when violence is perceived as illegitimate, ineffective, or undesirable, I have suggested elsewhere to reframe the question within a dynamic theory of political space. According to my analytical conceptualization political space is a social construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>: 11–12), a field of symbolic representation of social forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456506">Bourdieu, 1992</xref>), that shrinks or expands in the political arena. Politics is a specific sphere of power relations that is distinct from civil society and the state, a dynamic arena of contestation and containment of social conflicts within constantly changing opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392112456506">Collier and Collier, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392112456506">Linz and Stepan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011392112456506">Tarrow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011392112456506">Tilly and Tarrow, 2007</xref>). Political space is differentiated from social forces and state institutions, but is nevertheless framed and determined by them, and the capacity of actors to open it up depends on a certain balance of power between state institutions and civil society, and between dominant and dominated social groups.</p>
<p>The political space is symbolic while violence is physical and concrete. Violent repression requires the presence of perpetrators and victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456506">Mann, 2005</xref>), while the most important condition of politics is the absence of the actual groups in conflict, and their representation by mediators, namely the political actors. From this perspective politics is an act of symbolic representation, while violence is an act of physical presentation of power. When a conflict of interests arises between a dominant and a subordinated group, the dominant group has two basic options: direct unilateral coercion – namely violence – or recognizing the legitimacy of the dominated group’s claims, leading to negotiations and bilateral compromise – namely politics. Here lies the dynamic feature of political space: it may be opened by recognition and closed by violence. The dynamic is possible because political space is symbolic, constructed and determined by the changing power relations between dominant and dominated groups.</p>
<p>The absence of representation is the starting point of every resistant movement seeking the opening of political space. Historically, democratization processes institutionalized rules of the game that facilitated the dynamic opening of political space for the containment of social conflicts through representation, mediation and compromise. Political space emerged in Western Europe as a sphere of mediation due to the increasing tension between civil society and the state following the empowerment of the urban bourgeoisie and working class by capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392112456506">Andrews and Chapman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392112456506">Moore, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011392112456506">Rueschemeyer et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Democracy, however, cannot be installed by democratic means, it is rather the outcome of struggle of subordinated groups, which use physical presentation of power (i.e. violence) to challenge the regime and open up political space to their demands and representatives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392112456506">Offe, 1998</xref>). My interest in resistance focuses on negotiated transitions whereby rulers recognize the legitimacy of the subordinated groups and the ineffectiveness of their repression. These processes are typical of the third wave of democratization in Latin America and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392112456506">Linz and Stepan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392112456506">O’Donnell and Schmitter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456506">Przeworski, 1991</xref>). I include Israel/Palestine in this analytical framework given the two groups’ territorial contiguity, as opposed to the colonial case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 1994</xref>), which tends to provoke violent struggles of liberation.</p>
<p>Democratic processes, however, are unable to resolve conflicts across the geographic borders of the state or the symbolic boundaries of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392112456506">Offe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011392112456506">Stepan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011392112456506">Taylor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011392112456506">Zakaria, 1997</xref>). In the absence of agreed and recognized borders, the formal democratic regime fails to contain social and political conflicts. Without borders, politics is replaced by violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011392112456506">Tilly, 1992</xref>). Inclusive borders are a fundamental precondition for the opening of political space. However borders separating ethnic groups in conflict also facilitate the containment of conflict by opening two separate political spaces, within two nation-states.</p>
<p>Settler societies lack both inclusive borders and balance of power, therefore democracy does not act as a container of conflicts. On the contrary, it is liable to exacerbate them and lead to violence by the dominant settlers against the indigenous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456506">Mann, 2005</xref>). As we shall see below, the Israeli–Palestinian relations are a peculiar case of settler society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392112456506">Ganim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392112456506">Kimmerling, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392112456506">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011392112456506">Shafir, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011392112456506">Yiftachel, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article I attempt to expand the concept of political space by exploring the conditions of effective Palestinian resistance. It is important to emphasize that the Palestinian Intifadas were waged against a military regime in a claim for independence rather than for inclusion within the borders of the Israeli state and equal rights like in South Africa. Borders can include sides to a conflict or separate them. The most complex situations that provoke violence occur under conditions of blurred physical borders, mixed populations and interpenetration of social groups in a power struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456506">Mann, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Resistance vs. violent escalation</title>
<p>Given the contradiction between politics and violence it is important to comprehend the political role of the military given its capacity to use violence not only against external enemies but also, and more importantly for our purposes, against the population within state borders. Military elites can use their power manipulatively to create a sense of uncertainty, insecurity and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011392112456506">Tilly, 1985</xref>), thereby neutralizing political elites and becoming political actors in their own right, closing the political space for representation. However, when military elites realize that public opinion (including soldiers’ and officers’ opinions) will oppose the escalation of violence, they may support the opening of political space as a means to contain conflict. In order to open political space for negotiations political actors are required. In the absence of political legitimacy to negotiate and compromise, military elites may take political power directly, or some military leaders may become political leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392112456506">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The opposed interpretation of the First and Second Intifadas led to opposite reactions by the military elites and soldiers. The comparison of the two cases shows that the dynamics of political space are much more complex and subtle than the simple distinction between politics and violence. In order to comprehend the dynamic process we need to expand the original binary opposition between politics and violence and introduce two ‘intermediate’ concepts: (1) symbolic violence used by the dominant groups and (2) physical resistance to power used by the subordinated. These concepts are intermediate in the sense that they contain elements of both, politics and violence: symbolic violence is not physical but constitutes unilateral imposition of the will of the dominant groups by non-recognition and closure of political space of the dominated; while resistance is not a unilateral attempt to impose the will of the weak but a physical demonstration of presence seeking recognition and the opening of political space for representation and negotiation.</p>
<p>As aptly critiqued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456506">Bourdieu (1992)</xref>, the symbolic power of social elites is their power to silence and marginalize other social groups. I refer here as symbolic power to the capability of the dominant social and political elites to determine what are the legitimate cultural codes, behavior and language. Their values, language, behavior and rules of the game are defined as legitimate, and are anchored on state legislation implemented by bureaucratic apparatuses. Symbolic power stratifies social groups along their capacity to behave according to the cultural codes of the dominant social group. The symbolic power of the dominant elites pretends to represent society as a whole, and in so doing exclude subordinated social groups that are unable to speak and behave according to the cultural codes of social elites.</p>
<p>Symbolic power exerts symbolic violence on the social groups that are denied the basic equal nature of human beings, hence neglecting their equal rights. Symbolic violence is grounded in the ability of holders of symbolic power to ignore, not recognize or misrecognize the dominated groups, humiliating them. The symbolic violence of the dominant provokes physical violent reactions of the dominated, aiming to demonstrate their presence and claim recognition. I call resistance the collective action of dominated groups in reaction to the physical and symbolic violence exerted on them by the dominant groups. The question is, therefore, when does the violence of the subordinated constitute effective resistance obtaining recognition, or an expression of rage and anger, seeking revenge or even military victory liable to provoke escalating violence?</p>
<p>The fundamental political asymmetry between dominant and dominated groups stems from the fact that while the former can ignore the latter, the opposite is impossible: the dominated cannot ignore the dominant. The dominated react to symbolic violence by manifestations of presence, claiming visibility and voice by physical presence, because they realize that without acts of presence they will never be recognized. Acts of physical presence, however, range widely from small and quiet to large-scale and violent demonstrations or protests, from localized to general strikes, and from sporadic vandalism to widespread armed struggle and terrorist acts. I suggest here a distinction between acts of resistance and violence according to their goal.</p>
<p><italic>Resistance</italic> is an act of physical presence by subordinated groups seeking recognition, while <italic>violence</italic> is an act of war seeking to force the adversary to surrender. Violence as acts of war can be exerted both by the dominant and dominated groups. However, neither the dominant nor the dominated are homogeneous groups: some groups and organizations may be willing to open political space for dialogue while others may insist on violence. Theories of transition to democracy have pointed to the interaction among the resulting four subgroups of moderate and extremist elites as crucial actors that shape the transition process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392112456506">Linz and Stepan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392112456506">O’Donnell and Schmitter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456506">Przeworski, 1991</xref>). Successful negotiated transitions occur when the moderate elites of both dominant and dominated groups manage to govern the transition process through compromises and agreements which neutralize the extremists who prefer unilateral imposition of their will.</p>
<p>This dynamic of four competing political elites also took place in the Israeli–Palestinian negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">2010</xref>). In this article, I focus on the question of violent repression, the political role of the Israeli military and the Palestinian strategies of resistance employed against the dual regime of military/democratic domination. This peculiar regime separates the Palestinians living on both sides of the pre-1967 border (the ‘Green Line’) into those included (although discriminated) within democratic rules of the game, and those dominated by a military regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These two subordinated populations have different positions vis-a-vis the Israeli state, as well as different political goals, strategies of struggle and forms of resistance. This article focuses on the struggle by the Palestinians under military occupation. However, the participation of Palestinian citizens in the Second Intifada and the blurring of the 1967 border were a crucial element in the interpretation of Palestinian resistance as a ‘War’. I examine here the two fundamental factors shaping the dynamics of political space: balance of power and the demarcation or erasure of inclusive or exclusive borders. As discussed below, both the political construction of events and the fundamentals of political space played a decisive role in the opposite reactions to the First and Second Intifadas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011392112456506">
<title>The First Intifada: The case for recognition</title>
<p>The 1980s were years of political opening of Israeli society and internal struggles over the question of how to react to Palestinian resistance: by unilateral repression or recognition? Following the peace agreement with Egypt, Israelis imagined the possibility of open borders, travel in the Middle East and living in peace with their neighbors. However, the agreements with Egypt left the relations with the Palestinian people unresolved. Although the legitimate claims of the Palestinians were recognized in the ‘Framework for Peace in the Middle East’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392112456506">Bar-Siman Tov, 1994</xref>), the proposal to establish autonomous authorities for a five-year interim period was very vague, and never implemented.</p>
<p>Opposition to the unilateral implementation of the 1978 Camp David Accords fueled the Palestinian non-violent resistance movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011392112456506">Younis, 2000</xref>). This civil society movement gained prominence especially after a cease-fire agreement signed indirectly between Israel and the PLO in July 1981, because the agreement did not include the Palestinian struggle under military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392112456506">5</xref></sup> For almost one year no armed struggle against the occupation took place, and almost all protests took the form of non-violent civil resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011392112456506">Younis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This period came to an abrupt end in June 1982 with the occupation of South Lebanon by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and its siege of Beirut. The Lebanon War was the first war lacking broad Israeli popular consensus, destroying the security myth that Israelis fight only when they have ‘no choice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392112456506">6</xref></sup> Israeli public opinion was highly critical of the pretext for the war,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011392112456506">7</xref></sup> the siege of Beirut and the intention to occupy it. After the massacre of Sabra and Shatila hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Tel Aviv against the IDF’s cooperation with Christian Phalanges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392112456506">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Lebanon War provoked acts of protest not only of the civil society, but also within military society: some senior career officers made their criticisms and refusals public,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392112456506">9</xref></sup> and a movement of reservist soldiers and officers refusing to serve in Lebanon was organized (called <italic>Yesh Gvul</italic>, ‘There is a limit!’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392112456506">Helman, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392112456506">10</xref></sup> The articulation between the civil society opposition and the critics of the war within the military was done by a peace movement called Peace Now, initiated by reservist soldiers, which organized mass mobilization and the largest demonstrations ever in Israel<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011392112456506">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011392112456506">Reshef, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The war and three years of occupation of South Lebanon (1982–1985) were the immediate political context for understanding the Israeli reaction to the First Intifada. Two additional consequences of the war are particularly relevant to the outbreak of the Intifada. The first is the inability of the PLO to attack Israel directly due to its distant location in North Africa, which empowered the non-violent resistance strategies and Palestinian civil society in the Occupied Territories (OT). The second consequence was the growing criticism within Israel’s civil as well as military society<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0011392112456506">12</xref></sup> regarding the use of the IDF not for defensive purposes but for offensive and aggressive purposes, mainly aiming to maintain the occupation and expand the settlements in the OT.</p>
<p>The Intifada<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0011392112456506">13</xref></sup> was organized and directed by a local civil society leadership and political parties. Intifada activists did not use firearms and their main form of violence was throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails in mass demonstrations. They started organizing civil society at the turn of the 1980s in protest against the Camp David peace agreements with Egypt and Israel’s attempt to unilaterally impose a civil administration. This organization was initiated by the PLO and the Communist Party, and it included trade unions, student and youth movements, women’s organizations and refugee camp popular committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392112456506">Nassar and Heacock, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011392112456506">Younis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal of the Intifada was limited: to push the Israelis out of the OT, not from all Palestine. The occupied population sought self-rule, even at village and town level, with soldiers and Jewish settlers kept out. Economic independence through boycotting of Israeli products was part of this strategy, and soon enough all Israelis felt the economic impact of the Intifada and reacted by criticizing military repression and upholding liberal principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456506">Ezrachi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011392112456506">Shafir and Peled, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The Intifada was located strictly in the OT, the demonstrations demarcated the borders of Israeli occupation and by default, the borders of the sovereign State of Israel. This crucial element was emphasized by the Palestinian National Council Resolution which <italic>de facto</italic> recognized the State of Israel by declaring an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (15 November 1988). The demarcation of borders and the absence of additional territorial claims by the Intifada leadership facilitated the interpretation of the Intifada as a political opportunity rather than an existential threat.</p>
<p>The first clear voice was heard from the military, when Chief of Staff General Dan Shomron declared that ‘there is no military solution to the Intifada, only a political solution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011392112456506">Shalom and Hendel, 2011</xref>). In other words both Israeli civil and military societies interpreted the Intifada as a <italic>legitimate</italic> struggle. Paraphrasing Brecht it can be argued that the IDF has very sophisticated weapons, but no soldiers to use them and no officers to command.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0011392112456506">14</xref></sup> That was the crucial point: since the military could not respond with all its might, politicians had to enter the space opened between the Palestinian civil society and the military, starting mediation and political negotiations. The most appropriate leader to do it was the political leader of the military, Minister of Security Yitzhak Rabin.</p>
<p>Rabin initiated political plans for negotiations in 1989, while he was still the Minister of Security, but only after his party left the government and joined the opposition in 1990, did he present an alternative plan for direct negotiations with Palestinian representatives immediately after his election in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>). The recognition of the PLO and signing of the Declaration of Principles with Yasser Arafat were the crowning achievements of the Intifada: both sides undertook to resolve all disputes by means of negotiation rather than violence.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the relative balance of power created by the Intifada was insufficient to open up political space for recognition and negotiation. The pressure exerted by the Bush (Senior) administration on Shamir’s government was crucial to balancing the power between Israel and the Palestinians. Without international support the Palestinians remained weak compared to Israel, even after having been recognized as negotiation partners, as was shown during the Camp David Summit in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392112456506">Clinton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392112456506">Hanieh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392112456506">Malley and Agha, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011392112456506">Ross, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>The Second Intifada: Violent escalation and closure of political space</title>
<p>The peace negotiations that began secretly in Oslo reflected the power relations between Israelis and Palestinians and did not produce a peace treaty ending the occupation. The Declaration of Principles (DoP) in September 1993 evaded all the difficult issues (borders, settlements, Jerusalem and the holy places, refugees and water) and postponed them for five years of negotiations. The opposition Palestinian movements interpreted the DoP as surrender, and expanded their armed struggle against Israeli occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456506">Hass, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The internal Palestinian strife during 1994–1996 created a split in their strategies vis-a-vis Israel: the moderates (mainly Fatah) negotiated interim agreements, while the extremists carried out violent attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0011392112456506">15</xref></sup> This violence was interpreted by moderate Israelis as an attempt to sabotage the peace process, namely as directed against the agreements accorded between the moderates on both sides; and by the Israeli extremists as a proof that concessions will only lead to more violence. As both societies were divided in relation to one another, Israeli and Palestinian acts of violence during this period failed to derail the negotiations between the moderate sides.</p>
<p>The violent acts of the Palestinian opposition led to confrontations with the newly established Palestinian Authority (PA), which peaked in April 1996, after three suicide attacks on buses in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem killed 80 Israelis in a single week. In response, the PA arrested more than 2000 opposition activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011392112456506">Usher, 1999</xref>). However, the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister in June 1996 led to a national reconciliation with the establishment of a joint Palestinian organization (‘National Dialogue’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011392112456506">Usher, 1999</xref>), and the formulation of a joint strategy of non-violent resistance while diplomatic efforts continued. This internal agreement led to the almost complete cessation of suicide bombing attacks within Israel from April 1996, and the renewal of non-violent mass demonstrations in September 1996.</p>
<p>The non-violent resistance strategy was very effective in maintaining the internal divisions within Israeli society, including the IDF’s support of continued negotiations. In a sense we can say that the initial structure that balanced the power relations in the years 1988–1993 – internal division of the Israelis and unified strategy of the Palestinians – was reconstructed at the moment Netanyahu was elected. Consequently, after two and a half years new elections were held in Israel and Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak won by a significant margin (56 to 44%). Barak’s election as Prime Minister facilitated the resumption of direct negotiations and created new and higher expectations for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. However, the disappointment was in direct proportion to the high expectations, which peaked in the run-up to the Camp David Summit negotiations between Clinton, Barak and Arafat in July 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392112456506">Meital, 2006</xref>). The failure of the summit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0011392112456506">16</xref></sup> and the mutual accusations created the tense atmosphere that foreshadowed the Second Intifada.</p>
<p>One of the key outcomes of the buildup to Camp David and its political interpretation was the reconstruction of national solidarity and the erasure of internal disputes on both sides. Almost all Palestinians supported Arafat’s accusations of Israel, and almost all Israelis supported Barak’s accusations of Arafat. The problem was seen as ‘their’ inflexibility and unwillingness to compromise, compared to ‘our’ flexibility and willingness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0011392112456506">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, in the political context of seven years of negotiations and the immediate disappointment of the Camp David Summit public opinion on both sides was mobilized for confrontation. The Palestinians’ mass demonstrations were politically interpreted by Israelis as extremist acts against ‘peace’ negotiations despite Israel’s ‘willingness to compromise’, while their violent repression by the IDF was interpreted by the Palestinians as proof of Israel’s unwillingness to give up and end the occupation.</p>
<p>The clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli military quickly deteriorated into uncontrolled violence, fueled by rage, despair and vengefulness. Media hype exacerbated the situation and enflamed public sentiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456506">Dor, 2004</xref>), and when moderate civil and military leaders attempted to contain the escalation they failed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0011392112456506">18</xref></sup> Suicide bomber attacks within the borders of Israel only began five months after the beginning of the demonstrations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0011392112456506">19</xref></sup> however, this fact was forgotten and most Israelis believe that violent suicide attacks were part of the Second Intifada right from the start.</p>
<p>Two strong sentiments in Israeli public opinion were crucial for the support of intensive repression. The first was the feeling that the military was unable to contain the Palestinian mobilization, namely unable to protect Israelis. The second was that the Palestinian violence had no political aim but was simply intended to kill Jews. This interpretation was deliberately propagated by military spokespersons and the mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456506">Dor, 2004</xref>), despite the fact that in most cases the military provoked the escalation of violence by disproportionate use of firepower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456506">Harel and Issacharoff, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The widespread feelings of fear and insecurity in Israeli society were intensified by the blurring and interpenetration of borders, which destroyed one of the two fundamental requirements for opening the political space. Three days after the beginning of the Palestinian demonstrations in the OT, week-long demonstrations by Palestinian citizens inside Israel shocked Israeli public opinion. These demonstrations expressed frustration and rage – main highways within Israel’s pre-1967 borders were blocked and youngsters threw stones at the police. The police imitated the military repression in the OT, and snipers shot civilians, killing 13 young demonstrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011392112456506">Orr, 2003</xref>). The only difference between the Palestinians on the two sides of the 1967 borders was that after seven days there was a political agreement between the government and the political leaders of the Palestinian citizens on stopping the demonstrations in return for a committee of inquiry to establish responsibility for the killings.</p>
<p>Despite the political ability to contain the violence within Israel sovereign borders compared to the inability to do so in the OT, the impact of the demonstrations within Israel on Jewish public opinion was decisive. The feelings of insecurity and mistrust promoted a reframing of the Second Intifada as a ‘War for the Homeland’, as it was defined by the military propaganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456506">Dor, 2004</xref>). The fact that Palestinians were now demonstrating in the heart of Israel, with the military seen as incapable of defending Israel’s citizens, led to the urgent demand to repress the demonstrations violently.</p>
<p>The First Intifada demarcated the borders of Israel, and in so doing it also demarcated the borders of the Palestinian claim for independence, facilitating the imagination of a political compromise and opening space for negotiations. The blurring of borders at the beginning of the Second Intifada produced the opposite effect: the closure of political space for negotiations given the inability to imagine a political compromise.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the Palestinian demonstrations as war, as a total threat, provided the military with the broad-based support required to use increasing violence, from snipers to tanks, warships and helicopters. Israeli violence provoked more reactive Palestinian violence, and led to non-recognition of Palestinian political claims, delegitimization of their leadership, and rejection of the need to contain violence by negotiations. The only legitimate and appropriate response to Palestinian mobilization was violence, because their protest was interpreted as illegitimate – not a matter of resistance but sheer violence in a war where both sides seek ‘victory’. Within this war framing, continuation of negotiations with Palestinian leaders was interpreted by IDF leaders as an intolerable Palestinian victory. IDF representatives demanded to end the negotiations and to close political space to the Palestinians, but also to Israeli moderates; since then, Israelis calling for negotiations have been branded as traitors and backstabbers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0011392112456506">20</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0011392112456506">
<title>Comparing the two cases: Dynamics of resistance and violence</title>
<p>As we have seen, similar events led to very different interpretations and diametrically opposed political outcomes. Despite the fact that both Intifadas started as spontaneous mass demonstrations against the Israeli occupation, the reaction to them was very different. In the first case there was recognition of legitimate political claims and of the need to negotiate and compromise with their representatives. In the second the Palestinian claims were framed as illegitimate and political negotiations were suspended. In the First Intifada the military argued that there was no military solution and called upon the politicians to step in. In the Second Intifada the military demanded a military solution and called upon the politicians to step out. The slogan was ‘let the IDF win’. Victory was the goal, and when no victory was achieved more violence was demanded.</p>
<p>Comparing the two Intifadas may help us to understand the conditions that led the Israelis to interpret the violence of the first as legitimate resistance, as opposed to an existential threat that must be met with violence of the second. The different interpretation of the Intifadas was shaped by three sets of factors. The first two sets are internal and a matter of contingency and political construction, while the third is interactive and also influenced by structural factors. The first set has to do with the dominant groups themselves, their internal power relations and their agreement or disagreement on how to treat the claims of the dominated groups. The second set is related to the dominated groups, their unity or division, their objectives vis-a-vis the dominant and the means to achieve them. The third set of factors encompasses the interrelations between dominant and dominated, and how they shape what I have previously called the ‘fundamentals’ of political space dynamics, namely recognized borders and balanced power relations.</p>
<sec id="section6-0011392112456506">
<title>Internal factors in the dominant groups</title>
<p>Towards the beginning of the First Intifada Israeli society was deeply divided. Despite the National Unity Government that represented both leading parties, political divisions were reflected also by internal rifts in the government. These internal struggles started during the protracted occupation of Lebanon in 1982–1985. The high death toll intensified the political debate. The difficulties of left–right cooperation were seen in the refusal of 17 Knesset members from the Labor Party to join the National Unity Government in 1988, and the breakup of the coalition in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392112456506">Barzilay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2007</xref>). The Labor Party saw the First Intifada not only as legitimate, but also as an opportunity for negotiations, mutual recognition and compromise. In that, it represented Israel’s military and economic elites and secular middle classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456506">Ezrachi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456506">Levy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011392112456506">Ram, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011392112456506">Shafir and Peled, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011392112456506">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Towards the Second Intifada Israeli public opinion was reunited by Barak’s short-lived government (1999–2000) and the interpretation of his ‘generous offers’ made at Camp David (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">2010</xref>). Despite the fact that the coalition was completely shattered by July 2000,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0011392112456506">21</xref></sup> the reaction to the Camp David debacle was unanimous: the Israeli public blamed the Palestinians’ ‘rejectionist’ attitude.</p>
<p>Although the right wing was critical of Barak’s concessions they were only too happy to blame the Palestinians for rejecting them. Thus, Barak’s offers provided the right-wing parties with a solid proof that there was no partner for peace, and helped reconstruct all Palestinians, moderate and extremists alike, as enemies. Without a partner, it was now easy to evoke the old national myth of ‘no choice war’, and reunite the left and right around the need to repress the enemy in ‘self-defense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>: 140–143).</p>
<p>Through this prism, the Palestinian mass demonstrations were constructed as an existential threat, with no legitimate claims. This interpretation of the Second Intifada was mainly the product of a joint effort by the military elites and the media in a very favorable political context. They were supported by the prevailing sense of threat in Israeli society, and succeeded in neutralizing political efforts to contain the violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456506">Dor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392112456506">Drucker and Shelah, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456506">Harel and Issacharoff, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Internal dynamics in the dominated groups</title>
<p>The First Intifada broke out after the military defeat of PLO troops in Lebanon and their deportation to Tunis. The new strategy was designed by Palestinian political parties and civil society organizations in the OT, based on the assumption that there was no chance to succeed militarily. Mass demonstrations by the entire population sought not to defeat the IDF but to delegitimize the occupation and repression of non-violent demonstrators.</p>
<p>The struggle was fought out in the densely populated Palestinian towns, cities and villages. Young activists would hurl rocks and Molotov cocktails, and only later did some organized groups initiate violent attacks on soldiers and settlers outside the areas inhabited by Palestinians, and only after 1990 did some individuals begin to cross the 1967 borders to stab Israeli civilians in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. This sequence of events is very important, because violent attacks and infiltrations across the border started only <italic>after</italic> the First Intifada was politically constructed as legitimate resistance.</p>
<p>In this situation the Palestinian violent acts were not interpreted as an existential threat, but as an escalation due to the absence of negotiation, namely legitimate resistance seeking recognition. During the First Intifada the Palestinians were united under the leadership of a clandestine executive committee that represented all parties and succeeded in controlling and disciplining the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392112456506">Klein, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392112456506">Mishal and Aharoni, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392112456506">Mishal and Sela, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011392112456506">Younis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The Second Intifada broke out in the context of deep strategic divisions among the Palestinian political actors, not only between the Islamic opposition and PLO leadership, but also between Fatah local activists (<italic>Tanzim</italic>) and their own leadership. Both the Islamic opposition and Tanzim activists suspected that Arafat and his close aides were ready to compromise with Israel due to corruption and for their own personal interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456506">Bishara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011392112456506">Usher, 1999</xref>). Under this situation the Islamic opposition and Tanzim activists sought a new Intifada to take the lead from Arafat’s diplomatic aides. However the objectives of these two factions were far from similar. The Fatah activists’ goal was to improve the negotiating position of Arafat and prevent exaggerated Palestinian concessions, while the Islamists sought to replace the secular Palestinian national leadership, halt the negotiations and force Israel out by violent means.</p>
<p>In addition to these three factions in the OT a fourth Palestinian group now joined the struggle: Palestinian citizens of Israel who felt excluded from the Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, but also from Israeli internal politics. While their parties had played a critical role during Rabin’s term, Barak excluded them from coalition negotiations, despite the fact that 95% of the Palestinian citizens had voted for him. Palestinian citizens took to the streets not only to express solidarity with the Palestinians in the OT, but also to demonstrate their own presence and claim recognition within Israeli politics.</p>
<p>Although these demonstrations only lasted one week they were sufficient to blur Israel’s borders and create mutual hostility and fear. They made Jewish Israeli citizens feel that the borders of their country were being penetrated, and that the struggle was not about recognition of legitimate claims in the OT, but rather an ethno-religious national war. To conclude, the internal divisions among the Palestinians were a crucial factor in the weakening of the Palestinians vis-a-vis the Israeli state.</p>

<title>Interrelations: The political construction of reality</title>
<p>The opening of political space is facilitated by a balance of power and the existence of recognized borders. These generalizations are borne out by the comparison of the two Intifadas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the present analysis also sheds light on the dynamics of power relations and the demarcation of borders. These dynamics are shaped by the interpretation of the historical and political context by the dominant and dominated groups, the sequence of events and the interests and views of the dominant military and economic elites.</p>
<p>We also find that power relations between dominant and dominated are shaped by a combination of internal struggles within each side over their relation to the other. During the First Intifada the Palestinians were united in their strategy and tactics, while the Israelis were divided. This situation created some balance of power, because the Israeli military did not have the internal legitimacy to repress the Palestinians. Legitimacy to use physical coercion is the fundamental condition for exerting violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456506">Mann, 2005</xref>), and when it is absent the need for politics appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 2010</xref>). In the Second Intifada the opposite was true: the Palestinians were divided in their goals and tactics, while Israelis were united in relation to the legitimacy of using military power. In this situation the military received full support to escalate violence ‘until victory’.</p>
<p>The political construction of Palestinian violence as legitimate resistance or not was shaped by the goals and interests of the Israeli elites and their interpretation of the benefits of recognition (in 1988) or repression (in 2000). During the First Intifada the Israeli economic elites wanted to participate in the neoliberal opening of markets while the military elites were influenced by the liberal discourse within its own ranks and the aftershock of the Lebanon War. By the time the Second Intifada broke out the economic elites had already been integrated in the global economy, while the IDF had manage to recruit members of new underprivileged social groups who proved more willing to participate in violent repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456506">Ezrachi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456506">Levy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392112456506">Peres, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011392112456506">Ram, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011392112456506">Shafir and Peled, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of natural physical boundaries the demarcation or blurring of borders is a matter of mutual relations between the social groups in conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0011392112456506">22</xref></sup> Both sides may recognize and respect symbolic and physical borders, but it is sufficient for one side to penetrate the borders in order to create feelings of fear and threat among members of the other. During the First Intifada the Palestinian demonstrations demarcated the borders of their political claims by using violence exclusively in the OT. Even when individuals penetrated these borders after 1990, the Israeli reaction was to close the Green Line and prevent the entrance of Palestinian workers, namely demarcation of borders by the IDF. The awareness of a concrete border facilitated the imagination of a political compromise based on a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392112456506">Grinberg, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392112456506">2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0011392112456506">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Second Intifada blurred the borders from the very beginning. Although this was not the Palestinians’ intention, it created feelings of fear and threat that contributed to Israeli citizens’ support for escalating military repression. The borders were blurred by both Palestinians and Israelis. The Palestinian demonstrations in the heart of sovereign Israel made it clear to the Israelis that Palestine is more than the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The police reacted to these demonstrations similarly to the reaction of the military in the OT, and in doing so created the feeling that, in practice, there was no difference between Palestinian citizens and non-citizens, and between the territories on the two sides of the Green Line.</p>

<title>Conclusions and future perspectives</title>
<p>Mass mobilization against a unilateral regime is always an act of violence, an act of physical presence of the excluded from the political arena. However the political construction of mass mobilization as either legitimate resistance or violent threat depends on the reactions of the ruling elites and their interaction with the subordinated groups. In other words, resistance is a contingent political construction of the meaning of the power struggle between dominant and dominated.</p>
<p>The comparative analysis of the dynamics of political opening or violent escalation in Israel/Palestine may help us understand other cases like the processes in Egypt and Tunisia as they compare with Libya and Syria. While Egypt and Tunisia have symbolic borders that include all citizens as part of the nation, Libyan and Syrian societies are divided along religious, ethnic and tribal lines. These divisions affect the conflicting reactions of the ruling elites in those countries: while in Egypt and Tunisia the military had no legitimacy to repress violently and thus had to accept the opening up of political space to dominated social groups, in Libya and Syria the ruling elites demanded and legitimized repression, sensing an existential threat from the opposition. In these cases the struggle of the subordinated groups took the form of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0011392112456506">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>I would like to emphasize here that such feelings of existential threat are more than just a political manipulation by the ruling elites in Libya, Syria, or Israel; they always also have an authentic and genuine basis that facilitates the political construction of repression as legitimate ‘self-defense’. The reaction of the international community to the repressive violence of military regimes and its ability to prevent the escalation of violence are of crucial importance. When a military establishment is confident in the legitimacy of repression it will be able to force its rule because it is always better organized and equipped than the subordinated masses.</p>
<p>As we have seen after 13 years of resistance and more or less earnest peace negotiations (1987–2000) and nine years of violent struggle and unilateral moves (2000–2009)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0011392112456506">25</xref></sup> the Palestinians were left with no effective strategy to struggle for their liberation. International actors continue to accept the Israeli precondition of direct negotiations that lead nowhere due to the uneven power relations. The never-ending ‘peace process’ serves only to legitimize the occupation. The Palestinians are in an impossible lose-lose situation: they lose in direct negotiations and they lose when they use violence.</p>
<p>Resistance failed in the long range because it hardly changed the uneven power relations. In a very favorable specific international and local constellation the Palestinians succeeded in being recognized and their political leaders were allowed to administrate the urban areas of the OT without national sovereignty. However, the previous conditions of military domination and economic dependency were reproduced, reinforced and legitimized by the ‘peace process’.</p>
<p>In the absence of a viable strategy of mass struggle, the Palestinian focus – since the destruction of Gaza in December 2008–January 2009 and its continued blockade – has been to mobilize international support. This new strategy aims at changing the uneven power relations by non-violent acts that mobilize international support. These include the flotillas to break the blockade on Gaza, the boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel and the PA’s initiative to secure UN recognition of a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders.</p>
<p>The internationalization of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is the result of the inability to change it from within Israel/Palestine blurred borders, mutual geographic interpenetration and the overwhelmingly superior power position of the Israeli occupation regime. The Palestinian attempt to gain recognition during the First Intifada did not alter these basic conditions despite the fact that it took place under ideal circumstances. As it is highly improbable that this ideal constellation will recur, the international community’s attitude will be decisive for the future of the conflict. If the new Palestinian strategy can succeed in counterbalancing the Israeli superiority with the support of the international community it may prevent new cycles of resistance and violence.</p>
