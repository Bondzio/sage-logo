<p>Food is rich in meaning. It reflects our values and our identity. It mirrors social trends and shifting behaviours. (p. 170)</p>
</disp-quote>Rebecca Huntley’s book <italic>Eating Between the Lines: Food and Equality in Australia</italic> is a different exploration of food and its meaning in Australia. In 11 chapters (including an Introduction and Conclusion) Huntley explores inequality through the lens of food. It is an interesting idea and one that works. It brings together three core elements – money, time and place – to show how these affect the food choices and diets of Australians. Huntley writes with enthusiasm and clarity. The book is multi-layered and Huntley produces a nuanced argument which draws in the reader. She cleverly uses a mix of research, popular culture and interviews to illustrate how what we eat, when we eat, with whom we eat can tell a story about Australia in the 21st century. Her examination of food and equality ranges from market gardeners to bush tucker, through to the changing gendered relations of cooking and the definitions of family, how many of us still cook from scratch even though we are faced with an ever increasing amount of fast food and pre-prepared food. She also examines the shift to organic and peasant food, the rise of farmers’ markets and the vexed question of obesity. It is a simple book, but one that is very clever in its analysis and what it tells us about eating and food in Australia.</p>
<p>The epigraph above stands at the opening of the Conclusion, entitled ‘Republic of Food’. It is a strange place for a book review to begin, but conclusions are often a good place to start. Huntley’s book argues succinctly that inequality in Australian society can be traced through different aspects of the food cycle –growing, purchasing, preparing, eating; through the influence of indigenous and multicultural food cultures, and through food ‘narratives’ – obesity, consumption and family and gender. Each of these aspects is presented in chapters with engaging titles, such as, ‘Cheap as Chips’, ‘Fat Kids’, ‘Family Dinners’, ‘Sex in the Kitchen’, ‘Table for One’, ‘Bush Tucker No More’, ‘Lebs Make the Best Lamb’, ‘Where Has All the Lettuce Gone?’, and ‘Basic Meals for the Ultra Rich’. The Introduction is entitled ‘Welcome to Australia!’, which shows in stark contrast the extremes of food opportunities (cultures) available in capital cities in Australia, often within 30 minutes of each other. It is an experience I could easily replicate in Melbourne, where I live now, but also in my home city of Perth.</p>
<p>Each chapter deals specifically with an aspect of inequality. For example, in ‘Cheap as Chips’ Huntley examines the food choices available in a shopping centre in a low socio-economic area of Adelaide, Munno Para. Huntley uses an ethnographic approach whereby she visits the shopping centre and describes its food choices in detail. She gathers census data and informs the reader that the average weekly wage in 2006 for residents around Munno Para, Elizabeth and Salisbury was $347 (only $100 above the poverty line) and that most residents in this area are overseas born, from England, Scotland or Wales. However, it is in the detail of the food choices and the prices of food that inequality becomes apparent – the number of fast-food options far outweighs the ‘healthy’ options and what is striking is that the healthy options are more expensive. This is a strategy that Huntley uses in other chapters as well – healthy food is often not an option for those on lower, or even middle, incomes. Furthermore, Huntley makes the link between healthy food and high or full-fat food – in an experiment in which she devises a number of different meal choices, each time the healthy choice is either the same cost or considerably more expensive (p. 20).</p>
<p>Not only does Huntley describe the food choices available within Munno Para but she also examines the type of shops that are within the shopping centre, including a number of discount shops catering for larger sizes in clothing. She describes a lingerie shop that sells ‘Elle Macpherson lace lingerie in extra large’ (p. 13). Surrounding the shopping centre is a ‘lurid ring of fast-food outlets’ (pp. 12–13). All of these ‘stories’ about Munno Para show the connection between socio-economic disadvantage and food choices. However, Huntley also states that the link between gender, obesity and socio-economic disadvantage is not clear-cut – the research is equivocal, but there are clear indicators that there are distinct markers that align women, obesity and disadvantage.</p>
<p>The chapters ‘Family Dinners’, ‘Sex in the Kitchen’, and ‘Table for One’ are informative and examine the changing dynamics of gender, families and relationships centred around food. Huntley visits four mothers in Brisbane to discuss how family dinners are negotiated and prepared in each household. Each of the women has a different experience and the definition of family is different for each one too. Joanna is ‘divorced with three kids’, Carla is ‘married with two kids’, Michelle is married with one child, and Patricia is also married with one child. Huntley interviews the women in pairs on separate occasions and we get to know a lot about each of the women. They are working mums who say they work part-time but their loads seem fulltime. She asks about the gendered division of labour in each household and who is responsible for cooking. Sometimes the men cook, but mostly it is the women who cook. Some things never change. However, what is interesting is that Huntley probes and asks about what they cook, for whom and when. One woman, Patricia, prepared three different meals because of the health concerns of her husband and her son’s allergies. Huntley also asked about who did the shopping, again mostly the women; did they cook from ‘scratch’, was this cheaper and how often did they have take-away food or use pre-prepared ingredients? For Patricia, who cooked three meals every evening, often pre-prepared foods were used as a way of balancing everyone’s needs.</p>
<p>Throughout the book Huntley interweaves food research with her narrative. She uses many well-known scholars of food and eating, including Jean Duruz, Ghassan Hage and Margaret Visser. Duruz has long been writing about food in Australia and, for me, she is one of the few scholars in Australia who combines food, ethnicity, eating and nostalgia to tell a story about how our food cultures tell us much more than simply about what we eat – they tell us about our place in the world. Duruz for several years has been exploring links between Malaysia, Hong Kong and Australia – the cultural traffic of food says a lot about how we think about ethnicity and multiculturalism. Hage has also written about multiculturalism and food. Both scholars suggest that although food is a valid way to understand multiculturalism, the specificities of each culture must be attended to. It is a point that Huntley also understands. She examines closely food cultures in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide – through market gardens, restaurants and interviews with recently arrived migrant and refugee women. In doing so, she moves away from conventional and/or dominant understandings of food as a marker of ethnicity. This is one of the strengths of Huntley’s examination of food and inequality.</p>
<p>One of the new things I learnt from Huntley’s book was about the phenomenon of ‘Bobos’. According to Huntley, Bobos – a term borrowed from David Brooks’ book <italic>Bobos in Paradise</italic> (2000) – can be defined as ‘the unlikely love-child of the 1960s and the 1980s, a hybrid character whose activities and values span “the bourgeois realm of ambition and worldly success” and “the bohemian world of creativity”’ (p. 162). Huntley suggests that the ‘world of food is an infinitely expressive site for the articulation of the Bobo philosophy’ (p 162). Huntley suggests that for the Bobo food is a status symbol – it is all about where the food is purchased: organic food stores, farmers’ markets and specialty stores. Restaurants and domestic kitchens are also influenced by the Bobo philosophy. Restaurants range from ‘humble but authentic noodle bars to mega-expensive establishments that offer nothing but a dégustation menu matched with appropriate wines’. Domestic kitchens have the latest gadgets and cookbooks all ready for the Bobos ‘favourite competitive sport – the dinner party’ (p. 163). Huntley shows that for Bobos the (re)appropriation of peasant or working-class food has a new status – no longer considered food of the poor, artisanal, handmade, home grown and more authentic food has cache. She clearly argues that this type of food is no longer affordable to most Australians. It is, as Huntley suggests, ‘privilege cloaked in the garb of poverty’ (p. 164). Further, as Brooks writes, ‘(t)he beauty of such a strategy is that it allows us to be egalitarian and pretentious at the same time’ (2000: 82).</p>
<p>One of the pleasures of reading Huntley’s book, which – let’s face it – deals with ever more depressing facts, is that she writes with good humour and one does not feel as if she is preaching about how bad things are. They are bad. Huntley encourages us to think about how food reinforces inequality, but importantly she also offers insight into how to think about our food choices – from the farm to the table – in order to ‘flatten’ inequalities. This is dealt with most explicitly in the Conclusion, which provides strategies for addressing inequality through food.</p>
<p>
<italic>Eating Between the Lines </italic>is an exemplary book that combines popular and academic issues in a way that does justice to both. This is a major achievement.</p>
