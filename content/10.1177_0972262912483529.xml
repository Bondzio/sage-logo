<abstract>
<p>The purpose of the study was to explore the relationship between Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment and to investigate the moderating effects of Trust and Locus of Control on the relationship between Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment. The study was administered on 247 middle level managers belonging to private sector organizations. Four validated instruments were used in the study. Statistical tools like Descriptive Statistics, Factor Analysis, Pearson Product Moment Correlation and Hierarchical Regression Analysis were used to analyze the data. The study found that Job satisfaction was positively related to Organizational Commitment and Trust and Locus of Control moderated Job satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship. The findings of this study can assist the administrator and policy makers to understand the managerial effectiveness from the perspective of personal traits. Efforts can be made to explore managers’ perception towards themselves and their roles. The future academic endeavours might make use of the present study as a stepping-stone for further exploratory and confirmatory research towards a more complete understanding of the satisfaction considerations in particular.</p>

<p>Organizations over the years are confronted with one of the toughest challenge of having a committed workforce in order to feature in the worldwide economic competition. The factors that lead to Organizational Commitment have suddenly started gaining a lot of attention. In a non-professional’s word, commitment is nothing but a positive attitude towards something.</p>
<p>Some authors have argued that organizational commitment, as a construct, is too broad for effective organizational analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0972262912483529">Benkhoff, 1997</xref>). In response, Meyer and Allen (1991) proposed a distinction between the dimensions of affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment. Affective commitment refers to employees’ perceptions of their emotional attachment to or identification with their organization. Continuous commitment refers to employees’ perceptions of the costs associated with leaving the organization. Finally, normative commitment refers to employees’ perceptions of their obligation to their organization. For instance, if an organization is loyal to the employee or has supported his/her educational efforts, the employee may report higher degrees of normative commitment. ‘This reflects a difference between a preference to stay with the present organization arising out of a sense of attachment, compared to one rooted in a sense of economic necessity or of moral obligation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0972262912483529">Gallie et al., 2001</xref>, p. 1085). This three-pronged classification allows for identification of the underlying basis for each type of commitment and researchers have clarified the unique antecedents and outcomes related to each type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0972262912483529">Meyer et al., 2002</xref>). Like job satisfaction, reliable measures of the three types of commitment have also been developed and validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0972262912483529">Meyer and Allen, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Job Satisfaction</title>
<p>It is a positive feeling towards one’s job. In the works of Newstrom (2007), ‘Job Satisfaction is a set of favourable or unfavourable feelings and emotions with which employees view their work.’ An employee’s interpretation of values may vary regarding satisfaction or dissatisfaction. For example, some employees may feel a sense of accomplishment in their jobs while other employees may not. The finding by Hackman and Oldham’s (1980) was found to be similar. They surveyed blue and white-collar workers and determined that completing interesting tasks was not as important as job security and compensation for blue-collar employees. The findings also indicated that interesting and varied assignments were of higher importance to white-collar workers when compared to blue-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0972262912483529">Hackman and Oldham, 1980</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0972262912483529">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>There is an evidence that workers of all generations are sceptical of their organizations and have many reasons for their distrust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0972262912483529">Brandes et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to the growing acceptance that trust is a multi-dimensional concept, organizational researchers are starting to realize that just like organizational commitment, trust has multiple bases and foci or referents. McCauley and Kuhnet (1992) identified the notion that trust consists of lateral and vertical elements. Lateral trust according to them was the relationship among the employees whereas, vertical trust referred to the trust amongst the employee, his supervisor, his subordinates and top management. The pervasiveness of trust and distrust in the workplace is well documented in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912483529">Barber, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0972262912483529">Fox, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0972262912483529">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483529">Kramer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0972262912483529">Kramer and Tyler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0972262912483529">Sitkin and Roth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0972262912483529">Whitener et al., 1998</xref>). The extant research focuses on how subordinates’ trust in managers affect their (i.e., subordinates’) perceptions, behaviour and job related outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0972262912483529">Ross, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0972262912483529">Fulk et al., 1985</xref>). However, according to our knowledge, research on the question of how managers’ trust in subordinates may influence the managers’ control behaviour (i.e., how the managers control subordinates when they trust and distrust) is extremely rare.</p>

<title>Locus of Control</title>
<p>Locus of Control refers ‘to the extent to which people believe them or external factors such as chance and powerful others are in control of the events that influences their lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0972262912483529">Firth et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most important variables that has been extensively researched in organizational settings is Locus of Control. Numerous researches have opined that employees with internal locus of control are more contended with their jobs, they are less stressed and resulting in elongated job term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0972262912483529">Spector, 1982</xref>). A study done in the past revealed that employees with internal locus of control owned the authority to make judgement and perceive challenges as an opportunity for knowledge and professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0972262912483529">Knoop, 1981</xref>). In contrast, someone with an external locus of control would close the eyes to these challenges due to their intellect that learning will not have a bang on him or her. Findings of a study by Judge et al. (1998) confirmed that locus of control is highly linked with self-efficacy. They define self-efficacy as one’s estimation of one’s potential to marshal the motivation, cognitive capital and route of action needed to implement general rule over events in one’s life.</p>

<title>Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment</title>
<p>Numerous studies use different facets of satisfaction to predict employee attributes such as performance, organizational commitment and service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912483529">Dienhart and Gregoire, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0972262912483529">Oshagbemi, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0972262912483529">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0972262912483529">Yousef, 1998</xref>). It is a debateable issue whether job satisfaction is the predictor of organizational commitment or vice versa. Several researchers have made the case that job satisfaction is a predictor of organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0972262912483529">Porter et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0972262912483529">Price, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0972262912483529">Rose, 1991</xref>). Slattery and Selvarajan (2005) examined the associations between job satisfaction, organizational commitment and turnover intention among temporary employees. They found positive associations between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Several studies have focused directly on testing the causal relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912483529">Bateman and Strasser, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0972262912483529">Curry et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912483529">Dossett and Suszko, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0972262912483529">Farkas and Tetrick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0972262912483529">Lance, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Pettijohn et al. (2001) examined the relationships existing between performance appraisals, salesperson organizational commitment and job satisfaction. If various characteristics of performance appraisals that build commitment and satisfaction could be identified, then managers may be more capable of using performance appraisals that yield positive results. A survey of 185 retail salespeople and 58 retail sales managers provided the data required to evaluate the relationship between satisfaction, commitment and various aspects of performance appraisals. The results of the study indicate that managerially mediated factors may be used to enhance salesperson job satisfaction and organizational commitment.</p>
<p>When an employee leaves, organizations incur hiring, orientation and decreased productivity costs as well as temporary replacement costs. Estimates of these substantial costs are 1.2 to 1.3 times the one year salary of a registered nurse (RN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0972262912483529">Jones, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0972262912483529">2005</xref>) to replace a single RN, or up to 5 per cent of a hospital’s budget for yearly turnover costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0972262912483529">Waldman et al., 2004</xref>). These costs often are paid by the government as a major payer of health care costs in the United States.</p>
<p>The present study, wants to gauge the relationship between Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment. Thus, the first hypothesis for the present study is:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H</bold><sub>1</sub>: Job-Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment will show a positive relationship.</p>

<sec id="section5-0972262912483529">
<title>Locus of Control and Organizational Commitment</title>
<p>Locus of control is linked to a range of variables concerning internals and externals on diverse sets of principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0972262912483529">Spector, 1982</xref>). He states that internals are devoted more to their respective organizations and are more contented with their work than those with an external locus of control. Those with an internal locus of control are also likely to continue in their jobs longer and they have a propensity to execute better. The individual trait of locus of control was found to temperate the control of work-related quality on job satisfaction and organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0972262912483529">Loscocco and Roschelle, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Locus of Control and Job Satisfaction</title>
<p>For years, industrial psychologists and organizational behaviourists have debated the influence of a person’s disposition on job satisfaction. Various researchers have argued the person versus situation debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0972262912483529">Judge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0972262912483529">Bell and Staw, 1989</xref>). Bell and Staw (1989) considered locus of control to be a dispositional (personality) trait. As a personality characteristic, internal locus of control is hypothesized to be an important variable that influences the employee. The internal–external locus of control of a person has a tremendous impact on his performance and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0972262912483529">Brownell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0972262912483529">Dailey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0972262912483529">Kasperson, 1982</xref>). A study conducted by Dailey on scientists in the year 1980 found that scientists with an internal locus of control were more satisfied, motivated and had a high level of participation within their jobs as compared with those who had external locus of control. Those scientists were associated with low job satisfaction and psychological distress. Research has also shown that having an internal locus of control is related to organizational satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0972262912483529">Organ and Greene, 1974</xref>). Internals are more inclined to take action, are better performers and consequently receive promotions and rewards related to their performance.</p>

<title>Trust and Organizational Commitment</title>
<p>Moye (2003) examined the extent to which employee empowerment and employee commitment to the organization are related to interpersonal-level and system-level trust in the organization. The results indicated that employees who possess higher levels of commitment to the organization also possess higher levels of interpersonal-level trust and system-level trust. Employees who feel empowered in their work environment also tend to have higher levels of interpersonal-level trust and system-level trust.</p>

<title>Trust, Locus of Control, Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment Relationship</title>
<p>An important element in building a successful organization is trust. Organizational trust provides the basis for employee’s motivation, effective team-building, open communication and employee retention. An employee will be committed to the organization if he trusts the organization of its capabilities and its limitations. When trust is a ‘guiding principle in the corporate culture, it provides a firm foundation to build job satisfaction and committed staff’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912483529">DeFrank and Ivancevich, 1998</xref>). When trust becomes less than a back-and-forth commitment, there is a potential for a decrease in employees’ Job Satisfaction and Commitment to the task at hand and to the organization as a whole. Similarly, employees with Internal Locus of Control will tend to be more satisfied with their jobs because they will try to introspect for any unpleasant situation before reacting to it. This dimension of personality will make him more adjustable and thus, will be more satisfied and committed to their job. Studies usually recommend that internal subjects have a propensity to be more content with their job than the external ones. They see their superiors as higher on concern and initiating composition account, less role stress, observe more sovereignty and control and have a tendency to support elongated job term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0972262912483529">Spector, 1982</xref>) <italic>.</italic></p>
<p>Although there have been numerous studies linking job satisfaction with other personality variables, the moderating role of Trust and Locus of Control on the relationship between Job satisfaction and Organizational commitment of Managers has not received much attention. Increasing or decreasing level of trust certainly affects the intensity or the nature of relationship between Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment.</p>
<p>The present study intends to fulfil this vacuum by testing the postulation that Trust and locus of control serves as a moderator for Job satisfaction and Organizational commitment relationship.</p>
<p>Thus, the hypothesis are:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>H<sub>2</sub>: Trust moderates the effect of Job satisfaction on Organizational Commitment.</bold></p>
<p><bold>H<sub>3</sub>: Internal Locus of control moderates the effect of Job satisfaction on Organizational Commitment.</bold></p>

<p><bold>Objectives of the study:</bold> The study aims to examine Job-Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship and the moderating effects of Internal Locus of control and Trust on Job-Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The present study was done on middle level managers. They belonged to BPO, Banks and IT Sectors. The sample size was 247. Descriptive statistics along with Exploratory Factor Analysis, Pearson Product Moment Correlation and Regression Analysis was used for data analysis.</p>

<sec id="section11-0972262912483529">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><bold>Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ):</bold> A 15 item scale developed by Mowday et al. (1979) was used for the study. It examines the possible feelings the individuals may have about the organization for which they work and is measured on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘strongly agree’ (7). The Cronbach ά was found to be 0.76 for this scale.</p>
<p><bold>Job Satisfaction survey (JSS):</bold> The Scale was developed by Paul E. Spector, Department of Psychology, University of South Florida (1985). It is a 36 item, nine facet scale to assess employee attitudes about the job and aspects of the job. Each facet is assessed with four items and a total score is computed from all items. The scale was significantly related to workplace factors such as Pay, Promotion, Supervision, Fringe benefits, Contingent Rewards, Operation Procedures, Co-workers, Nature of work, Communication. The Cronbach ά was found to be 0.84 for this scale.</p>
<p><bold>Trust Questionnaire:</bold> The Trust Questionnaire developed by Robinson (1996) was used to measure the level of Commitment. The scale consists of 7 items. Examples of the items include an example item is ‘In general, I believe my supervisor’s motives and intentions are good, My supervisor is open and upfront with me.’ The Cronbach ά was found to be .86 for this scale.</p>
<p><bold>Locus of Control Inventory (LOCO):</bold> Udai Pareek (1992) developed this scale. The LOCO inventory has 10 items each for internality, externality (others) and externality (luck). A five-point scale is used in scoring responses ranging from ‘hardly feel’ (0) to ‘Strongly feel’ (4). The three dimensions of Locus of control are: Internal (I), External (E-O), External (E-C). The Cronbach ά was found to be 0.86 for this scale.</p>

<p>As the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) measure of sampling adequacy was found to be adequate (0.60) and the Bartlett test of sphericity as significant, it indicated that factor analysis can be conducted. Factor Analysis with principal axis factoring method and varimax rotation was then used to cluster the variables into several factors related to Job Satisfaction Scale and Locus of Control Scale. A minimum Eigen value of one (1) was used in the factor analysis in order to control the number of factors extracted. Only six (6) factors in the section of Job Satisfaction and one in the section of Locus of Control were retained and interpreted. These factors are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0972262912483529">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912483529">2</xref>.</p>

<title>Hierarchical Regression Analysis</title>
<p>To test the main effect and find if Trust and internal Locus of Control moderates the relationship between Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment, a hierarchical moderated regression analysis was conducted.</p>
<p>As indicated in Step 1, in the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was found to be 0.26 indicating that Job Satisfaction explains 26.6 per cent of Organizational Commitment. In step 2, by adding Trust as independent variables, the R<sup>2</sup> increased to 58.4 per cent which was found to be significant. It can thus be implied that the additional 31.8 per cent of the variation in Organizational commitment is explained by Trust. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0972262912483529">Table 4</xref>, Job Satisfaction had a positive relationship with Organizational Commitment, which proves our first hypothesis.</p>

<p>The interactive effects of trust and various dimensions of Job Satisfaction on predicting Organizational Commitment was also examined in the last step of hierarchical regression. It can be seen that the additional variance explained by the interaction term of 28.8 per cent was significant at .01 level. The result derived from the final step proved our second hypothesis of the study that Trust serves as a moderator for Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship.</p>
<p>When Internal Locus of Control was entered into the equation in order to gauge its impact on the Organizational Commitment, it was perceived that the R<sup>2</sup> increased from 26.6 per cent to 76.4 per cent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0972262912483529">Table 5</xref>).Thus, it explains that 49.8 per cent of change which is significant at .01 level is due to Internal Locus of Control.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The foremost aim of the current study was to find out the effect of Job satisfaction on Organizational commitment and explore the moderating outcome of Trust and Locus of control on Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship. Results of the study have proved the hypotheses. The result derived that Job Satisfaction is positively related to Organizational Commitment. The result found has found a strong evidence from the study done in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0972262912483529">Koslowsky et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0972262912483529">Knoop, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0972262912483529">Shore and Martin, 1989</xref>). The moderating roles of Trust and Locus of control between Job satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship, has not received much attention in earlier studies. Though few studies have supported the relationship between organizational commitment and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0972262912483529">Buch and Aldridge, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0972262912483529">Robinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0972262912483529">Rousseau, 1989</xref>), Locus of control and Job Satisfaction ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0972262912483529">Dailey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0972262912483529">Brownell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0972262912483529">Kasperson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0972262912483529">Organ and Greene, 1974</xref>), Locus of Control and Organizational Commitment. Both the moderating effects of Trust and Locus of Control have not been studied as per my knowledge. The present study derived that Managers with Internal Locus of control are more satisfied with their jobs and hence they are more committed towards their Organization. Managers with Internal locus of control will be able to handle stressful situations more effectively and thus, will be more efficient. Similarly, Manager’s trust in the Organization has a positive impact on Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment relationship. Trust helps in making a satisfied employee more committed to the organization.</p>
<p>The previous work shows that the present study is the first to consider the moderating effect of Locus of Control and Trust on Job Satisfaction-Organizational Commitment relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0972262912483529">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>The findings of this study can assist administrator and policy makers to understand the managerial effectiveness from the perspective of personal traits. Efforts can be made to explore managers’ perception towards themselves and their roles. Managers can be helped to develop control over the situation instead of being externally controlled. Trust can help in strengthening the link between organizational commitment and Job satisfaction. A manager who has an internal locus of control will tend to be more satisfied and thus, his behaviour will reflect commitment towards the organization. For an Organization it is the need of an hour because a committed staff will lead to a healthy organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0972262912483529">
<title>Limitations and Scope for Future Study</title>
<p>One of the most important limitation of the present study is that the impact of gender on job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment could not be ascertained. The literature shows that women are bound to be more dominated by external control than men. The future academic endeavours might make use of the present study as a stepping stone for further exploratory and confirmatory research towards a more complete understanding of the satisfaction considerations in particular.</p>
