<p>Organization development has attracted the academicians and practitioners of management for last several years. Scientific management (F.W. Taylor), human relation movement (Elton Mayo), bureaucracy (Max Weber), etc., are still central themes for the theorists and practitioners of organization development.</p>
<p>Open system model assumes the interdependency between environment and the organization. Environmental certainty or uncertainty is a major factor behind the survival and growth of any organization. Social scientists also believe that every social unit has inherent tendency to decay or deteriorate in which age and size are two biggest factors. The concept of ‘negative entropy’ emphasize upon reversing the process of organizational decay or degeneration. Today’s business environment is highly complex, unstable and globally connected due to which the speed of environmental change is immense.</p>
<p>In this context, the filed of organization development (OD) is becoming more relevant for management scientist and practitioners in recent years. Although literature exists in this field, there is a strong need to focus on current needs of organizations for their continuous growth. There are many organizations, for example Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, which were admired for their best process and practices but have faced downfall in last three years.</p>
<p>I believe that the book by Professor Ramnarayan and Professor Rao on ‘Organization Development’ is a very positive and timely effort in the context of Indian business scenario. The major strength of this book is the authors’ personal experiences and insight into the functioning of business organizations as a researcher and consultant that make this book directly relevant to professional world. Authors’ approach is a wonderful amalgamation of theory and practice. Although the authors have written a separate section on OD concepts, issues and theoretical foundation, the emphasis is more on implications of these concepts to the real world of practice. The good thing is that authors have made theoretical foundations interesting, relevant and useful by citing the small cases, checklists, points of caution and action for change agents, etc., in each chapter for OD practitioners.</p>
<p>This book is organized into three sections: first section is concerned with OD concepts, issues and theoretical foundations, spreading over 15 chapters; second section provides cases and learning resources, consisting another 18 chapters; third section is dedicated to interviews with industry experts in five chapters. First section begins with introduction to the key concepts in the field of OD and two archetypes of change are particularly very interesting in this chapter. This section ends with a focus on futuristic perspective that clearly distinguishes between what is OD and what OD is not. In this section, Chapter 14 is insightful which highlights eight OD myths. Other chapters focus on the process and content of OD for the practitioners.</p>
<p>In this section, I have following observations. First, Chapter 3 that focuses on resistance to change could have been sequenced before Chapter 15. Second, this section could have been grouped into few major subcategories which are traditionally adopted, for instance, person focused, group focused and organization focused OD interventions. It may help the readers to remember concepts easily. Of course, it is authors’ prerogative to adopt a framework which they think is more suitable for the presentation of the entire book. Third, all 15 chapters could have been interwoven into these subcategories. Each chapter can begin with clearly stated objectives, and a brief summary and learning outcomes in the end of each chapter could have been beneficial to the beginners of OD to understand major OD themes. Although each chapter has wonderful learning outcomes but such books are a complete package where readers may be interested in one or another portion of the book because that serve their momentary needs.</p>
<p>Second section focuses on cases and learning resources that are relevant and helpful to OD practitioners to understand present business challenges. Each case demonstrates a good use of theory covered in the first section. This section clearly illustrates the use of OD tools, process and content in several cases across multinational organizations like GE and Nissan; public sector organizations like State Bank of India and Indian Railways; and private sector organizations like Wipro, HCL, Tata Chemicals and non-profit organizations. These examples make this section very useful for the practitioners. However, I believe that these cases could have also been highlighted at relevant places in the first section of the book across 15 chapters which would have helped the readers to understand the application of OD concepts and process better.</p>
<p>Third section of the book presents interviews with five OD experts, namely, Warner Burke, P.M. Kumar (GMR group), Yogi Sriram (L&amp;T), Santrupt Mishra (Aditya Birla Group) and S. Chandrasekhar (Vizag Steel, NIIT, Reliance, Cap Gemini and IBM). I believe that the third section could have been interwoven into the first two sections. A separate section on interview is left out part of the book. Interviews are theoretically and practically rich and could have been used in the section on theory and cases.</p>
<p>In brief, I believe that the major strength of this book is the use of case studies to imbibe the conceptual learning from each chapter which strengthens the point of view on a particular aspect of OD. The checklists, psychometric questionnaire and interviews are very appropriate and provide good practical understanding to readers about the subject matter and the purpose of writing on this topic. The book can be recommended to students for an elective course on organization change and transformation.</p>
