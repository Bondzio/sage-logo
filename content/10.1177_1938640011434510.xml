<abstract>
<p>A 30-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of pain and swelling over the sole of her right foot. Plain radiograph showed a calcified mass in the heel pad, which appeared to be arising from the spur on inferior aspect of calcaneum. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion, hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images over the plantar aspect of the foot. Open biopsy of the mass was indicative of periosteal osteosarcoma, the variety that has never been reported in calcaneum. Below-knee amputation was done with no recurrence or distance metastasis seen at 24 months of follow up.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 30-year-old woman presented with a history of pain and swelling over the sole of right foot for 6 months. Pain over the right heel pad was the initial symptom for which she took analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication. The pain was continuous with no relation to activity and without any diurnal variation. The patient noticed swelling over the sole of her foot after about 1.5 months of initial symptoms. The pain and swelling increased progressively. There was no history of trauma, fever, or any discharging sinus. There was no history of any other swelling in the body.</p>

<p>“Calcaneum seems to be the favored site at the foot followed by other tarsal and metatarsal bones, with phalangeal involvement being the least common.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On examination, a diffuse, bony hard swelling measuring around 6 × 4cm was present over the heel and lateral aspect of the foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011434510">Figure 1</xref>). The swelling was tender. The skin over the swelling was normal. The range of movements at the ankle joint was full and painless. Movements at the subtalar joint could not be assessed because of pain and swelling.</p>

</fig>
<p>Plain radiograph of the right foot showed a well-lineated calcified mass inferior to the calcaneum in the heel pad, which appeared to be arising from the spur on inferior aspect of calcaneal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640011434510">Figure 2</xref>). Magnetic resonance imaging of the right foot showed hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted and STIR (short-TI inversion recovery) images in calcaneum. It was hypointense on T1-weighted images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011434510">Figure 3</xref>). The radiologist suggested the differential diagnosis of calcaneal osteomyelitis with involvement of surrounding muscles and soft tissue, or posttraumatic marrow edema with swelling in the surrounding muscles and soft tissue. But these were not clinically correlating as there was no history and clinical features suggestive of infection or trauma.</p>

<p>Routine hematological and biochemical investigations showed no abnormality. Alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, serum calcium, renal function tests, and liver function tests were within the normal range.</p>
<p>Open biopsy of the lesion was performed through lateral aspect of the foot. The biopsy was performed under tourniquet. Full thickness flap was raised and tissue was taken from the lesion. Wound was closed after maintaining hemostasis. Specimen showed multiple small fragments predominantly composed of nodular lesion revealing cartilaginous differentiation. Periphery of these nodules showed aggregates and clusters of osteoblasts showing significant nuclear atypia and hyperchromasia. Many mitotic figures were seen, including atypical ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640011434510">Figure 4</xref>). The findings were suggestive of periosteal osteosarcoma.</p>

<p>Three-phase bone scan revealed no evidence of any skip metastasis. Contrast-enhanced tomographies of the chest and abdomen ruled out any distant metastasis.</p>
<p>The patient was admitted and explained the nature of the disease. Below-knee amputation was performed after taking consent from the patient. The tumor was sent for histopathological examination that showed lobules of cartilaginous tissue at the periphery of which there was new bone formation by the tumor cells. The tumor cells were oval- to spindle-shaped with hyperchromatic nuclei and a moderate amount of cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640011434510">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, there were areas of reactive new bone formation. The features were confirmative of periosteal osteosarcoma.</p>

<p>Patient received a full course of postoperative chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen incorporated doxorubicin, methotrexate, and cisplatin. Simultaneously, patient was put on a program of aggressive physiotherapy to train the amputated stump for a period of 4 weeks. Patient was back to her work using a below-knee prosthesis at the end of 4 months of her initial presentation to the institute.</p>
<p>At a follow-up of 24 months, there was no evidence of any skip metastasis as revealed on bone scan. The patient was informed that the data would be submitted for publication, and she gave her consent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most of the osteosarcomas of calcaneum reported in the literature are of conventional type, with its various histological types, including osteoblastic, chondroblastic, or fibroblastic types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011434510">11</xref></sup> Cases of low-grade central osteosarcoma have been reported in few studies with relatively benign features on radiographs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434510">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434510">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011434510">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640011434510">10</xref></sup> There are few cases of telangiectatic variety of calcaneal osteosarcoma reported with radiological features similar to aneurysmal bone cyst.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011434510">6</xref></sup> A single case of small cell osteosarcoma is reported with osteolytic lesion in calcaneum and destruction of inferior portion of calcaneum seen on radiograph.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434510">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Periosteal osteosarcoma is an intermediate-grade malignancy that arises on the surface of the bone. The most common locations are the diaphyses of the femur and tibia. Histological examination of periosteal osteosarcoma shows strands of osteoid-producing spindle cells radiating between lobules of cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011434510">12</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this is the first case of periosteal osteosarcoma of the calcaneum.</p>
<p>Heel pain was the initial symptom in the present case. The common differential diagnoses of unilateral heel pain include plantar fasciitis, heel spur, tarsal tunnel syndrome, heel cord tendinitis, and retrocalcaneal bursitis. These present in middle-aged patients with long-standing history of heel pain. Although swelling may be associated with many of these disorders, progressive increase in size of swelling is not a feature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640011434510">13</xref></sup> Owing to the rarity of osteosarcoma at this site, its diagnosis is often missed or delayed.</p>
<p>Radiograph was done when the patient presented to us at 6 months, which showed a mass on the inferior aspect of the calcaneum. The possible differentials were myositis ossificans, osteochondroma, or a calcified soft tissue mass. As the calcaneal osteosarcoma with such radiological feature was never reported, it was not kept in the differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging is the best test to measure the extent of the tumor within the bone and the soft tissue. However, magnetic resonance imaging is nonspecific and is not useful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011434510">14</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance imaging in the present case was not helpful in suspecting the diagnosis. Although open biopsy has a greater risk of tumor spillage, hematoma, and infection, it has the highest diagnostic accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011434510">15</xref></sup> The final diagnosis in the present case was only reached after the histopathological examination, which showed spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and cartilaginous nodules and new bone formation. The presence of “woven bone” or “malignant osteoid” helps in confirming the diagnosis.</p>
<p>The standard treatment of patients with conventional osteosarcoma consists of combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Periosteal osteosarcoma is an intermediate-grade malignancy and in general, chemotherapy is included in the treatment protocol of this tumor. Although the advent of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy has increased the survival of patients with conventional osteosarcomas, the benefit of chemotherapy in periosteal osteosarcoma is doubtful and several studies have concluded that it does not improve the outcome or probability of survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640011434510">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640011434510">18</xref></sup> The most common surgery performed for calcaneal osteosarcomas is below-knee amputation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434510">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434510">3</xref></sup> with only a few reports of limb salvage surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011434510">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640011434510">10</xref></sup> As the periosteal variety of calcaneum osteosarcoma and its treatment has never been mentioned in the literature, we planned to go for below-knee amputation followed by full course of chemotherapy. At 24 months’ follow-up, there was no evidence of any distant metastasis or recurrence of tumor.</p>
<p>Periosteal osteosarcoma of calcaneum is a rare variety. It should be borne in mind during the differential diagnosis of any mass arising from calcaneum so as to detect it as early as possible. Open biopsy is the best investigation in reaching at an early diagnosis and initiation of the appropriate treatment; which ultimately results in long-term survival of the patient.</p>
