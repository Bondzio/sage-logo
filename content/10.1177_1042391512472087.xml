<abstract>
<p>A review of the literature has shown the need for a comprehensive flame spread dataset framework for computational fluid dynamics model validation purposes. To develop this framework, the flame spread process was viewed as having four key components: turbulent fluid dynamics, gas phase kinetics, flame heat transfer, and condensed-phase pyrolysis. A series of extensively instrumented inter-related experiments based on the four components was conducted under different source fire permutations. This series of three progressively more complex experiments, from free plume, to inert wall fires, to combustible wall flame spread were carried out to enable collection of data relevant to each component of flame spread. Measurements made include heat release rate, plume centerline temperature and velocity, heat flux to wall, near-wall temperature, flame height, flame spread progression, mass loss, and burn pattern. The combustible wall test data in the current research may not be enough to validate a complex real-world integrated flame spread model. However, the sub-models within the integrated model may be validated cohesively using the various types of data presented here as the first step of the validation process.</p>

<p>Fire tests are used by building products manufacturers to demonstrate that their products meet various safety regulations. However, testing can be cost-prohibitive during early research and development when tests of multiple permutations of the products are necessary. With advances in computational capabilities, manufacturers and engineers have begun to pursue fire modeling as a complement to traditional fire testing in the study of flame spread.</p>
<p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) fire modeling has been used to simulate large-scale fire development since the mid-1990s. A recent review of the literature suggests that there remains considerable uncertainty associated with large-scale fire development (fire growth) modeling using CFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1042391512472087">1</xref>]: comparisons between experimental data and model calculations have exhibited various amounts of discrepancy. To improve current predictive capabilities, additional verification and validation of the models is necessary to identify the source of discrepancy between model and experiment.</p>
<p>Traditionally, experimentally measured heat release rate (HRR) is used as the primary metric against which a fire model’s predictive capabilities are judged. However, a good correlation between a modeled HRR curve and its experimental counterpart does not necessarily mean that the model accurately simulated the physics of fire growth due to compensating effects.</p>
<p>The complexity of fire growth makes it difficult to isolate factors that contribute to the discrepancy between model calculations and experimental data. The overall flame spread process can be simplified by decoupling and studying four major components that contribute to fire development:
<list id="list1-1042391512472087" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Turbulent buoyant fluid flow.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gas phase kinetics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flame heat transfer to burning and unburned fuel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condensed-phase pyrolysis.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>By breaking down fire growth development into these components and assessing a fire model against each component, the model’s flame spread predictive capabilities can be evaluated. This requires a comprehensive and self-consistent set of data containing information related to all four areas of fire growth.</p>
<p>Although such a dataset would be of great value for improving the predictive capabilities of fire growth models, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, such a dataset is not currently available. There is a lack of comprehensive fire growth data in the literature that contains information on all four components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391512472087">2</xref>]: most experiments only deal with one or two components of fire development, which limits the usefulness of these datasets in a complete validation of a flame spread model.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1042391512472087"><title>Review of available flame spread datasets</title>
<p>Experimental flame spread datasets from the literature contain various amounts and types of data that fall within the four components of flame spread. In theory, data from similar experiments could be combined into a coherent dataset; however, this requires much interpretation and interpolation, which reduces the dataset’s overall applicability and may lead to internal inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Review of flame spread datasets in the literature shows that the emphasis is typically on turbulence and flame heat transfer together, or flame heat transfer with condensed-phase pyrolysis. The turbulence and flame heat transfer-oriented experiments collected velocity and temperature data around the test compartment and wall surface temperature distribution, while some collected heat flux distribution or flame height data as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1042391512472087">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512472087">6</xref>]. The majority of flame heat transfer and condensed-phase pyrolysis experimental data were reported in the form of heat flux distribution, pyrolysis progression, and wall surface temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1042391512472087">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1042391512472087">13</xref>]. Some works also presented gas phase kinetics data such as flame temperature, with pyrolysis data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1042391512472087">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1042391512472087">16</xref>]. Experiments that report three of the four component of flame spread are rare, with one example being Walmerdahl and Werling’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391512472087">17</xref>] series of flame spread experiments in a compartment. Other flame spread research in the literature has various amounts of data useful for model validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1042391512472087">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1042391512472087">23</xref>].

<sec id="sec3-1042391512472087"><title>Overview of current capabilities for fire growth modeling by CFD</title>
<p>Several CFD models have been used in fire engineering practice and they may be grouped based on their underlying simulation principles and capabilities. One standout characteristic of the general purpose CFD models is that they may use one of three turbulence solvers in the calculations: Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS), large eddy simulation (LES), and direct numerical simulation (DNS). However, the use of DNS solver is, thus far, generally impractical in fire engineering applications due to its requirement for a highly resolved mesh in order to achieve accurate solutions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1042391512472087">Table 1</xref> presents the types of turbulence solver utilized in several commonly used CFD models.

<sec id="sec4-1042391512472087"><title>General purpose CFD codes</title>
<p>ANSYS CFX is a general purpose CFD software that can utilize one of multiple solver routines in a simulation, as well as highly unstructured and non-uniform meshes. There is no inherent pyrolysis model in the base code; however, the software allows custom models to be implemented, such that the user has the ability to calculate for pyrolysis if so desired. This technique was employed in the modeling of cable trays fire spread conducted by the Gesellschaft für Anlagen –und Reaktorsicherheit mbH as a benchmarking exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1042391512472087">25</xref>]; additional validation work on CFX had been undertaken on unconfined pool fires and compartment fires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1042391512472087">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1042391512472087">28</xref>].</p>
<p>ANSYS Fluent is a popular general purpose CFD software package that is capable of solving models with a high degree of customization in the computational domains and solution methods. Fluent allows the user to specify solvers for phenomena such as turbulence and radiation separately. Similar to CFX, a pyrolysis model is not included in the base Fluent code. However, researchers have circumvented this shortcoming by coupling solid-state pyrolysis calculations within the Fluent solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1042391512472087">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1042391512472087">30</xref>]. Some validation work on Fluent focused in the areas of turbulence and temperature around a fire have been carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1042391512472087">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1042391512472087">33</xref>].</p>
<p>PHOENICS (parabolic hyperbolic or elliptic numerical integration code series), similar to the other general purpose CFD codes, may utilize a large variety of turbulence models for solution, but custom functions are required for a pyrolysis calculation. Validation work on the PHOENICS code was undertaken for compartment fires, focusing on turbulence near the flame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1042391512472087">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1042391512472087">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1042391512472087">35</xref>].</p>
<p>CD-adapco distributes the STAR-CD model and, more recently, STAR-CCM+. While STAR-CCM+ includes several fire-specific phenomena, it does not include a pyrolysis model. Consequently, the authors are unaware of any uses of STAR-CCM+ for simulating fire development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1042391512472087"><title>Specific fire field CFD models</title>
<p>Fire dynamics simulator (FDS) is a CFD modeling tool with both the LES and DNS solvers that is under active development at the USA National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is a fire simulation software package where turbulence, combustion, radiation, pyrolysis, and water spray can be modeled. Furthermore, the FDS+Evac module may be used to simulate evacuation with agent behavior changing based on smoke spread predicted in the base FDS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1042391512472087">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1042391512472087">37</xref>]. A large variety of fire experiments at different scales, and in all areas of fire development including turbulence, heat transfer, and solid-state pyrolysis have been used in the validation of the software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1042391512472087">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1042391512472087">40</xref>].</p>
<p>JASMINE (analysis of smoke movement in enclosure) model was developed by Building Research Establishment Ltd for the solution of fire and smoke movement. The software utilizes the three-dimensional (3D) transient RANS equations for solution. A pyrolysis model is not incorporated into the base code. JASMINE has been validated against a large series of fire experiments including balcony spill plume, tunnel fires, and compartment fires through analysis of the velocity and temperature in a compartment, as well as heat flux to the wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1042391512472087">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1042391512472087">43</xref>].</p>
<p>FireFOAM was developed by FM Global based on the open source CFD package OpenFOAM (open source field operation and manipulation) and uses a LES solver. Turbulence, combustion, thermal radiation, solid-state pyrolysis, soot, water spray, and surface film flow models are all incorporated in the base code. It is a relatively new software package that is being actively validated against available experimental data in the areas of turbulence, heat flux, soot generation, and flame spread for small- to full-scale fire experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1042391512472087">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1042391512472087">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1042391512472087">47</xref>].</p>
<p>SMARTFIRE v4.1 was developed by the Fire Safety Engineering Group at the University of Greenwich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1042391512472087">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1042391512472087">49</xref>]. A variety of solvers and models are available for the combustion and radiation components of fire and smoke spread, but for turbulence, SMARTFIRE utilizes the 3D transient RANS equations. Results from fire simulations can be incorporated as inputs in the evacuation model EXODUS. Flame spread modeling was introduced to the software before version 4.0. Validation of SMARTFIRE has been completed on wood crib, compartment fires, post-crash aircraft cabin fire, as well as against experimental reconstructions of the Swissair MD-11 in-flight fire and the Station Nightclub fire in West Warwick, RI, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1042391512472087">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1042391512472087">54</xref>].</p>
<p>SOFIE (simulation of fires in enclosures) is a CFD field model originally developed at the University of Cranfield. Simulations in SOFIE are based on the solution of the RANS equations with a finite volume approach. Thermal radiation is simulated via a discrete transfer radiation model only. A number of flame spread models are available for use in the software that relates cone calorimeter data, rate of volatile release to heat flux, and pyrolysis front tracking through energy balance. Validation work for SOFIE ranged from small- to full-scale experiments, involving soot formation, radiation transport, turbulence and temperatures within the compartment, and generation of toxic combustion products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1042391512472087">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1042391512472087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1042391512472087">58</xref>].</p>
<p>Ideally, and corresponding to the proposed framework, an integrated flame spread model will consist of four major sub-models such as a turbulence model, a gas phase combustion model, a heat transfer model, and a pyrolysis model. Validation of the overall flame spread model will need the validation of the sub-models as well, and a comprehensive dataset that is designed to address each of the sub-models will be necessary.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1042391512472087"><title>Scope of this research</title>
<p>The lack of datasets with comprehensive flame spread data prompted the design of experiments with a focus on decoupling the four components that contribute to fire growth. A real-scale experiment that consists of a compartment with many different combustible materials installed within will certainly provide a wealth of data. However, this realistic, but extremely complex scenario can be cost-prohibitive to instrument and the interaction of the various component of fire growth over different materials will be difficult to distinguish. Application of the various flame spread modeling tools have also shown that a model that performs well at small scale may not perform as well in a real-scale situation because of the complex interactions inherent in a flame spread problem. Taking a step back to the basics in order to unravel the relationship between the components of flame spread, the current research is focused on a simple geometry at a realistic scale that allows different initiating permutations. This process allows a mass of flame spread-related data to be collected to facilitate the validation and verification of flame spread models at different levels.</p>
<p>The basic experiments involve a combustible vertical wall within a compartment where ignition of the combustible wall panel is achieved with an area source fire. Such an upward flame spread scenario is what would be found typically in all built environments. Furthermore, this scenario serves as the basis of development for an ‘early-stage flame spread rate (FSR)’ parameter utilized as a complementary ignition criterion (along with the ignition temperature) for the fire model code SMARTFIRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1042391512472087">59</xref>]. This demonstrates the importance of understanding a well-defined upward flame spread scenario in order to further study more complex fire growth phenomena.</p>
<p>The combustible wall panel scenario may be deconstructed into the following three components:
<list id="list2-1042391512472087" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The fuel: a combustible wall covering.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The environment: a vertical wall.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ignition source: an area gas burner.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The process in which the combustible wall panel breaks down and burns is called condensed-phase pyrolysis, whereas the interactions of the wall panel with the source fire plume are controlled by flame heat transfer, gas phase kinetics, and fluid mechanics. Without the solid fuel, the base scenario devolves into a fire against an inert wall, whose interactions are through flame heat transfer and turbulent fluid mechanics. Furthermore, if the wall is absent, the scenario becomes a free plume fire defined through its fluid turbulence and combustion characteristics only. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391512472087">Figure 1</xref> shows the breakdown from a combustible wall, to an inert wall, to a free plume fire scenario.
<fig id="fig1-1042391512472087" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Evolution of free plume to combustible wall scenarios.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512472087-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>These three different, but related, experimental configurations allowed in-depth examination of the components of flame spread and collection of a comprehensive set of fire growth data; the relationships between the various components and the experiment types are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1042391512472087">Figure 2</xref>. Since each test type is designed to address multiple components of flame spread, data collected from each test type can be used to validate multiple aspects of a flame spread model. In order to provide comparable data, the three series of experiments were conducted under similar configurations. The wall material used in the combustible tests was a commercially available fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP).
<fig id="fig2-1042391512472087" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Relationships between components of flame spread and the experiment types.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512472087-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Along with the condensed-phase decomposition (pyrolysis) information, the generated dataset may be used in engineering calibration of different fire models in a structured fashion. Using multiple measured quantities as metrics against which a model’s predictions are compared, different facets of the decomposed flame spread process can be modeled and validated individually, allowing compensating effects to be more easily identified. This process can potentially lead to a logically and progressively built fire model that is also physically accurate.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1042391512472087"><title>Experimental setup and procedure</title>
<p>From simple free plume fires, to inert wall fires, to combustible wall fires, three progressively complex series of tests were conducted. All experiments were designed so that data related to the four major flame spread components may be collected. Although the three experimental configurations differed significantly, some characteristics, such as the source fire HRRs, burner shapes, and measurement locations were retained across the test series so that trends in the data could be analyzed. Further information on the experimental setup may be found in Section N.2 of Wong’s thesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512472087">24</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec8-1042391512472087"><title>Test environment and primary conditions</title>
<p>All tests were conducted inside a standard ISO 9705 fire testing compartment, modified to have dimensions of 2.4 × 2.4 × 2.4 m<sup>3</sup> (W × D × H) with an opening of 2.4 × 2.0 m<sup>2</sup> (W × H). The walls and ceiling of the test compartment were lined with three layers of 0.016 m thick gypsum wallboard over a layer of 0.012 m fir plywood base, whereas the floor was covered with a single layer of 0.016 m cement wallboard. A large-scale hood (2.4 × 2.4 m<sup>2</sup>) was located adjacent to the test compartment for the collection of combustion products and connected to a large oxygen depletion system (LODS) for gas species analysis.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1042391512472087"><title>Source fires</title>
<p>A 0.3 m square and a 0.6 m by 0.3 m rectangle gas burner were used; both burners’ top surfaces were located 0.4 m above the compartment floor. Both burners were fitted with a 25 mm wide flange welded around the top edges. A 12 mm thick ceramic fiber blanket was installed at each burner’s top surface to act as a diffuser. Three fuels were used in the study: natural gas (generalized as methane), propane, and propylene.</p>
<p>Two source fire sizes were utilized: 50 or 75 kW, with associated incident heat flux to the wall greater than the critical heat flux needed for ignition of the FRP specimen, but low enough such that the time available for potential flame spread is sufficiently long to allow for meaningful data acquisition.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1042391512472087"><title>Free plume fire test experimental setup and procedure</title>
<p>In the free plume fire tests, the source burner was centered in the compartment. Centerline plume velocity and temperature were measured using bidirectional probes and thermocouples installed on two support rakes. After ignition, the source fire outputs a steady HRR for 5 min, which was sufficient to achieve a quasi-steady environment based on the resulting data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1042391512472087">Figure 3</xref> shows a schematic of the free plume fire test configuration.

<sec id="sec11-1042391512472087"><title>Inert wall fire test experimental setup and procedure</title>
<p>In the inert wall experiments, the burner was positioned centrally and flush against the wall (along the 0.6 m-side for the rectangle burner). Heat flux to the wall and near-wall temperature measurements were made in addition to the plume-specific and HRR-related measurements. Experiments were run for 5 min to achieve quasi-steady state conditions.</p>
<p>The inert wall used in the test was constructed with two layers of 12 mm thick Kaowool®HT ceramic fiberboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1042391512472087">60</xref>] over a drywall and plywood support structure. The Kaowool® fiberboard measured 1.8 m wide by 2.4 m high, centered on a 2.4 m by2.4 m support structure near the back of the compartment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1042391512472087">Figure 4</xref> shows the orientation of the burner in relation to the wall in the inert wall fire test configuration.

<sec id="sec12-1042391512472087"><title>Combustible wall fire test experimental setup and procedure</title>
<p>Combustible wall experiments were similar to the inert wall experiments except that a combustible wall finish material was installed over the inert wall structure. The specimen was a FRP panel with a Class C (ASTM E84) flame spread rating. The material’s resin base is a modified polyester copolymer and inorganic fillers, reinforced with a weave of chopped fiberglass. The panel’s thickness is 2 mm nominal, with a smooth back-face and a pebbled, embossed white front surface. The width of the panel was 1.2 m and its height was 2.4 m. A 0.1 m by 0.1 m grid was drawn on the panel to aid flame and burning area tracking. Small openings were cut into the FRP panel to expose the wall-mounted heat flux and temperature measuring instruments. All specimens were fastened onto the inert wall with approximately 30 mechanical fasteners in no fixed pattern, with special care to insure a tight-fit.</p>
<p>Two different types of flame spread tests were conducted: (a) initiating source fire terminated upon panel ignition and (b) initializing fire HRR maintained constant throughout the test, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1042391512472087">Table 3</xref>.

<sec id="sec13-1042391512472087"><title>HRR measurement</title>
<p>HRR of each test was determined in multiple ways. The fuel flow rate through the mass flow controller provides a flow-based HRR of the source fire for propane and propylene source fires only. For all tests, HRR was also calculated by oxygen consumption calorimetry following the ASTM E-1354 methodology, and from CO/CO<sub>2</sub> generation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1042391512472087">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1042391512472087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1042391512472087">63</xref>].</p>
<p>Uncertainty of the flow-based HRR was determined to be ±13 kW based on the reported accuracy of the flowmeter. The uncertainty of the O<sub>2</sub>-based HRR was established to be approximately ±25 kW from calibration tests. Given the greater uncertainty associated with the O<sub>2</sub>-based HRR, the flow-based HRR was used in the reporting and analysis of the source fire HRR.</p>
<p>In the combustible wall fire experiments, the source fire HRRs were characterized based on the flow-based HRR, but the global HRR, which constitutes a summation of HRRs from both the source burner and the burning wall panel, was calculated based on oxygen consumption. Uncertainty in the HRR of the combustible wall panel fire was calculated to be ±28 kW.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1042391512472087"><title>Plume temperature</title>
<p>Plume centerline temperature measurements were made with thermocouples constructed from welded 24-AWG thermocouple wires. Six isotherm stations, necessary for radiation correction of the temperature measurements, were also installed and consisted of additional thermocouples made from 20, 28, and 30-AWG wires. All of the thermocouple wires were K-type with special limits of error with an uncertainty of 0.4% of full scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1042391512472087">Figure 6</xref> shows the thermocouple locations on the two rakes.
<fig id="fig6-1042391512472087" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Plume centerline instrumentations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512472087-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Accuracy of the K-type thermocouples used in the plume centerline temperature measurements is on the order of ±5℃ based on their specifications. However, this inherent uncertainty of the equipment is negligible when the thermocouples were used inside a fire plume: due to heat transfer (loss) over the thermocouple bead, the recorded temperature must be radiation-corrected to estimate the true gas temperature. The correction is assumed to yield the highest possible true gas temperature at the thermocouple location; hence, the uncertainty in the temperature measurement is represented by the range between the corrected temperature (maximum limit) and uncorrected/recorded temperature (minimum limit).</p>
<sec id="sec15-1042391512472087"><title>Radiation correction of thermocouple measurement</title>
<p>In close proximity to a fire, a thermocouple’s bead temperature differs from the true gas temperature due to radiative and convective heat transfer. Estimation of the actual gas temperature was based on temperature recorded at the various isotherm stations. Due to the quasi-steady conditions established in the free plume and inert wall experiments, temperature correction of data from those tests was based on Blevins and Pitts’ methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1042391512472087">64</xref>]. For data from the combustible wall fire experiments, Young’s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1042391512472087">65</xref>] was found to be more applicable. Details of the thermocouple radiation correction methods are found in Appendix C in Wong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512472087">24</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec16-1042391512472087"><title>Plume velocity</title>
<p>A total of 10 bidirectional probe and transducer pairs were used for plume velocity measurement, they were located at 0.2 m, and 0.5 to 1.7 m above the centerline of the burner at 0.15 m intervals. The probe’s dimensions were based on Newman’s design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1042391512472087">66</xref>]. The bidirectional probes were oriented along the centerline axis of the burner. Pressure differential between the two ends of a probe was measured using a pressure transducer with range ±12.5 Pa and a sensitivity of ±0.25 Pa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1042391512472087">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1042391512472087">68</xref>]. The locations of the temperature and velocity-sensing instruments along the burner centerline are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1042391512472087">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
<p>The calibration constant for the bidirectional probe design was reported to be 1.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1042391512472087">66</xref>]. Flow inside the fire plume was assumed to be composed of air only, under ideal gas conditions. Ambient pressure before and after the tests were averaged over 3 min periods for use to scale the measurements. Velocity is calculated from the pressure and temperature measurements using Heskestad’s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1042391512472087">69</xref>].</p>
<p>Plume centerline velocity from the free plume and inert wall tests was normalized using the convective HRR of the source fire in order to compensate the data for the varying radiation component of the different source fuels. The experimental data are compared against McCaffrey’s correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1042391512472087">70</xref>], generated from data from natural gas fires with a square burner with similar dimensions to the one used in the current research.

<p>Velocity measured during the combustible wall fire experiments were not normalized due to the highly transient nature of the fire growth. Additionally, based on the observed data-drift and the characteristics of the velocity-sensing equipment, the uncertainty of the velocity measurements for the periods of time before the sample HRR peaked is assumed to be approximately ±0.7 m/s for bidirectional probes located less than 1.0 m above the source burner surface, and ±1 m/s for probes at least 1.0 m above the burner surface.</p>

<p>Digital videos of the fire experiments were recorded at 30 frames per second by a camcorder located outside the compartment. Motion tracking software was used to track the flame tip height in frames extracted from the videos. The mean flame height was defined based on 50% intermittency.</p>
<p>Based on the distance of the digital camcorder from the fire, resolution of the video recording, sensitivity of the tracking software, and human errors in the manual flame tip tracking procedure, the uncertainty associated with the native flame height data was estimated to be ±0.05 m.</p>

The uncertainty of the heat flux measurement using TSCs was found to be approximately ±2.6 kW/m<sup>2</sup> through calibration experiments using the cone calorimeter. However, the TSCs were only subjected to radiative heat flux insult in such an environment: there was no flame impingement or forced flow over the plate. In actual experiments, the uncertainty is assumed to be twice the cone case at about ±5.2 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, research had suggested that the uncertainty may be as large as 10% of the measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1042391512472087">76</xref>], so the uncertainty associated with the TSC heat flux measurements is as defined here as ±5.2 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, or ±10% of the measurement, whichever is greater.

<p>The incident heat fluxes measured during the combustible wall fire experiments were not time-averaged or normalized due to their non-steady-state nature.

<p>Mass loss was calculated based on the initial and final mass of the panel. The final burn pattern was constructed based on values of percentage-damaged assigned to each cell on the drawn grid. Two cameras were used to collect video data of the tests for burn area tracking: one camera was located directly in front of the sample on the inert wall, while the other was positioned at the compartment opening at a diagonal to the sample. The test videos were digitized for burning area tracking.</p>
<sec id="sec21-1042391512472087"><title>FSR based on burning progression</title>
<p>To track the flame spread movement over the combustible wall panels, video footage of each test was analyzed. Images extracted from the video files were used to track the flame spread by visually identifying the outline of the burning areas. Due to the volume of images and software limitations, the process was performed for every 2 s of recorded data.</p>
<p>It was assumed that the burning areas may be approximated by rectangular shapes and the burning progression was separated into three distinct phases, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1042391512472087">Figure 9</xref>. The burning area time-history was developed from the total burning areas based on the rectangle area estimation method over a minimum of 180 s, starting from the point when flame attachment was visible on the FRP panel. The burning area was found to increase from Stage 1 until the end of Stage 2, then decreased in Stage 3, and afterward, any burning that remained took on the shape of lines.

</fig></p>
<p>Although this method of flame spread may be used to compliment the HRR per unit area (HRRPUA) method, however, there are some limitations. First of all, the quality of the video footage dictated the quality of the data. The 0.1 × 0.1 m square grid drawn on the wall panel aided the tracking process, and the resulting uncertainty based on the grid could be estimated to be four grid spaces at 0.04 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The free plume fire tests were designed to collect data only related to the fluid dynamics/turbulence and gas phase kinetics. Measurements made in the inert wall fire scenario of the full-scale tests are related to the fluid dynamics/turbulence, gas phase kinetics, as well as heat transfer to environment. Combustible wall tests allowed collection of all data relevant to all four components of flame spread. In general, due to their quasi-steady nature, experimental data from the free plume and inert wall tests were time-averaged and normalized to eliminate fuel source effects.</p>
<p>For combustible wall experiments, only the data from a representative experiment conducted using a terminated 75 kW propane fire with the rectangle burner (experiment A4) is presented here. Complete analysis of the experimental data is presented in Section N.4 and the full dataset from each test is available in Appendix F of the thesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512472087">24</xref>].</p>

<p>It is noted that the centerline temperatures from a rectangle burner fire were much lower than those recorded in the tests using the square burner above a normalized height of 0.05 m/kW<sup>0.4</sup>.

<p>Similar to the free plume centerline excess temperatures, the uncorrected temperatures from the inert wall cases were approximately 25% lower than their corrected counterparts at normalized heights below 0.05 m/kW<sup>0.4</sup> regardless of test types; however, the correction significantly decreases with height. McCaffrey’s correlation was found to lie between the corrected and uncorrected temperature measurements.

<p>The velocity measured in the inert wall tests is generally lower than that from the free plume tests, most likely due to the flame and plume leaning against the wall, disengaging the plume centerline away from the bidirectional probes. This effect also caused additional data scatter, reflected in the differing uncertainty from 0.23 to 0.40 m/s kW<sup>1/5</sup> for tests with the square and the rectangle burner, respectively.</p>
<p>Flame height data from the inert wall tests are compared to Heskestad’s correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1042391512472087">Figure 16</xref>. The uncertainty of the Heskestad’s correlation was reported to be 15–20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1042391512472087">79</xref>], so the current data falls within range of the uncertainties, except for the methane flame heights. Presence of the inert wall decreased the flame heights because the flame leaned toward the wall, which also reduced the plume temperature and velocity slightly.

A complete analysis of additional experiments may be found in Section N.4, and the complete set of data from all tests are available in Appendix F of the thesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512472087">24</xref>].</p>

<p>Although the FRP panel generally burned for more than 20 min during the tests, only the HRR during the first 10 min of the tests was reported because the majority of flame spread occurred within this period. A discrepancy in the HRR that reflects the termination of fuel gas flow is evident in the HRR curves of most tests soon after ignition, when the burning panel’s fire intensity decreased momentarily and then increased until its peak, which always corresponds with ‘rollover’ (ignition of hot combustion gases) under the ceiling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1042391512472087">Table 8</xref> presents a summary of the time to peak and peak HRR values from the combustible wall fire tests. Regardless of experiment configurations, a propylene source fire tended to cause earlier times to peak (rollover under ceiling) than the propane experiments at the same source fire size. This is due to the higher incident wall heat flux generated by the more sooty propylene source fires that efficiently preheated the unburnt portion of the combustible wall panel, leading to an earlier ignition of the majority of the FRP panel than possible when using a propane source fire. In the experiments where the source fire was continuous, the total heat released was also the highest. Additionally, it is observed that a source fire at the higher HRR correlates with a shorter time to peak.

<p>The HRR data have shown that the peak HRR was approximately 300 ± 40 kW for experiments where the source fire was terminated upon flame attachment on the FRP. For the experiments where the source fire was continuous throughout, the FRP’s HRR peaked at 580 ± 50 kW. The difference in the peak HRR may be attributed to the heat from the source fire continuously driving the flame spread on the FRP so that more area was ignited continuously, and higher pyrolysis and mass loss rates in those areas under high external heat flux insults.</p>
<p>Experiments with one of the following conditions: a terminated source fire, use of propylene source fuel, or a source fire at the higher HRR of 75 kW, were found to exhibit shorter times to panel ignition and peak HRR. Higher peak HRRs and total mass lost were also observed. A comparison of tests with different burner shapes shows that the rectangle burner tests exhibited longer times to panel ignition than from the square burner. The effect on time to peak HRR due to burner shape was less significant, but the rectangle burner generally yielded higher peak HRRs, and greater overall mass lost.</p>
<p>A spike is shown in each of the combustible panel HRR time histories for tests with a terminated source fire. The spike is present at the time when the source burner was shut off, and is generated as an artifact in the calculations of the panel HRR. In actuality, the FRP HRR at that point of fire growth does not decrease or increase sharply, but is relatively constant. For completeness of the data, the HRR curves presented here are not modified.</p>

<sec id="sec36-1042391512472087"><title>Plume centerline temperature</title>
<p>The corrected centerline excess temperatures from experiment A4 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1042391512472087">Figures 20</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1042391512472087">21</xref>. For thermocouples up to 1 m above the burner surface, temperatures were highest when the source burner output is at 75 kW, but reduced as the source fire was terminated and the FRP began to burn, suggesting that these thermocouples were not significantly affected by the wall panel fire. At elevations above 1.10 m, the thermocouples were above the source fire’s flame region, such that the temperature increases were low before the FRP started to burn. However, as the fire spread along the center of the panel, the temperature along this portion of the centerline rapidly increased until the FRP’s HRR peaked. Finally, at the peak HRR, the highest centerline temperature was registered at the highest thermocouple due to flame rollover under the ceiling.

</fig></p>
<p>For the thermocouples near the burner surface, the radiation correction process yielded a ‘correction’ of approximately 400–500 K, which corresponded to approximately 50% of the recorded temperature; this large correction factor was due to the presence of higher speed flow and flames. At 0.35–0.65 m above the burner surface, the temperature increase due to correction drastically dropped off to an order of 100 K. At 1.10–1.85 m, the thermocouples were inside the buoyant plume above the source flame and had relatively small correction on the order of 50–100 K. However, the correction at the highest thermocouple was larger at around 200 K when the HRR of the FRP fire was at its peak and rollover occurred under the ceiling. After the initial fire is shut off, the dominant plume no longer exists, and the ‘plume centerline’ temperatures recorded should be considered ‘burner centerline’ temperatures only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec37-1042391512472087"><title>Plume centerline velocity</title>
<p>Thermal effects from the fires on the velocity-measurement equipment were significant in the combustible wall tests. It is cautioned that the data be ignored after the peak HRR due to adverse thermal effects on the transducers. Although the velocity measurements may be inaccurate at this stage, the flow’s measured directionality was found still to be valid.</p>
<p>Due to data-drift and the characteristics of the velocity-sensing equipment, the uncertainty of the velocity measurements for the period of times before the sample HRR peaked is assumed to be approximately ±0.7 m/s for probes less than 1.0 m above the source burner surface, and ±1.0 m/s for probes at least 1.0 m above the burner surface.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1042391512472087">Figure 22</xref> shows the upward vertical velocity recorded in Test A4 at elevations from 0.20 to 0.95 m above the source burner surface. The velocity in this range was driven mostly by the source fire plume. At the peak HRR, the velocity increased at the locations between 0.20 and 0.80 m above the burner surface. However, the probe located at 0.95 m registered a negative flow over the same period of time. Velocity measurements at 1.10–1.70 m are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-1042391512472087">Figure 23</xref>. The velocity recorded at 1.25–1.70 m became negative during peak HRR most likely due to the pressure generated by the descending smoke layer at this stage of fire growth. Due to the proximity to the ceiling, the magnitude of the downward flow was largest at the highest probe. Because of thermal effects on the instruments, significant drift is observed for all the probes after peak HRR.

At 0.2 m above the burner surface, the centerline heat flux reached 40 kW/m<sup>2</sup> when the source fire was ignited, and then rose to 70 kW/m<sup>2</sup> when the panel was ignited. Before the specimen’s HRR peaked, the centerline heat flux at this height sharply reduced, indicating that the fire on the panel had moved away from this location. At 1.7 m above the burner surface, the heat fluxes measured before the FRP specimen ignited was under 5 kW/m<sup>2</sup>; the fluxes at all locations along this height increased concurrently to a range 55–65 kW/m<sup>2</sup> when the HRR peaked. A notable exception is the gage located 0.6 m to the right of the centerline, for which the heat flux increased as the HRR reduced. This behavior suggests that, during the period of the peak HRR at the location just below this elevation, flame spread across the entire panel almost simultaneously, resulting in the concurrent increase of heat flux.

<p>FSR calculated for experiment A4 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1042391512472087">Figure 26</xref>. The initial flame spread was slow because the source HRR was terminated upon panel ignition. The highest peak in the FSR corresponds to the point when rollover occurred under the ceiling accompanied by a rapid increase of the FSR due to increases in lateral spread and downward spread. After the initial peak, the FSR gradually increases again into another peak then decreases and becomes insignificant for the remainder of the experiment.

These time-history charts have been time-shifted to begin when the source fire was extinguished. For the first 70 s of fire growth, Stage 1 burning, as defined previously as mostly upward only, commenced. The FSR of top and bottom edge of the rectangular burning area during Stage 1 burning is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-1042391512472087">Figure 27</xref>. After that, Stage 2 burning lasted for approximately 40 s, where the burning area progressed downward away from the center and continued to move upward from the bottom. The downward spread on both flanges were caused by flame impingement under the ceiling, and the downward FSR is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-1042391512472087">Figure 28</xref>. Peak HRR was measured during Stage 2 burning. At Stage 3, the central area of the panel was burnt out, and the burning area was split into two sections. Both burn areas progressed downward and toward the outside edge of the panel until total burnout.

<p>In order to relate the cone calorimeter tests with the full-scale tests, the HRRPUA of the FRP specimen generated during a full-scale test is desired. Using an iterative method and assuming that the HRRPUA during the full-scale test is constant, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1042391512472087">equation (5)</xref> is obtained

</p>
<p>From calculations, it was observed that the iterative HRRPUA value is approximately 300 kW/m<sup>2</sup> for the FRP material, which is similar to the 90th percentile cone-based HRRPUA value under 75 kW/m<sup>2</sup> of external cone heat flux. This is supported by the fact that centerline wall heat flux measurements made during the full-scale FRP tests approached 80–100 kW/m<sup>2</sup> at the height of flame spread. It must be noted that a constant HRRPUA served only as an approximation since the FRP panel’s HRRUPA varied with time and imposed heat flux. Under this method, the uncertainty of the estimated FSR is significant, at approximately ±0.01 m<sup>2</sup>/s. Additional information on the derivation of this flame spread estimation is presented in Section N.4 of Wong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512472087">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The FSR estimate method using the HRR time history does not provide a sense of the direction of the burn (straight up or skewed), nor the shape of the burning areas. For these details, additional information was required.</p>

<sec id="sec41-1042391512472087" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A framework to analyze flame spread and to validate a CFD flame spread model by decomposing the complex process into several inter-related components has been presented. The four flame spread components are classified as:
<list id="list11-1042391512472087" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Turbulent buoyant fluid flow.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gas phase kinetics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flame heat transfer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condensed-phase pyrolysis.</p></list-item>
</list>Based on this framework, three progressively complex experiments, from free plume, to inert wall fires, to combustible wall flame spread were carried out under different permutations to enable collection of data relevant to each component of flame spread. The scenarios are simple and focused on a single combustible item at the highest level, but contain realistic elements of fires growth in a built environment such as ignition source against a wall, initial upward flame spread, and subsequent downward and lateral spread under the ceiling. Similar characteristics such as source fuel, burner shape, and source fire HRR were preserved between sets of experiment to show the interconnectivity of those flame spread components, resulting in a comprehensive set of flame spread data. Measurements made in the experiments include HRR, plume centerline temperature and velocity, heat flux to wall, near-wall temperature, flame height, flame spread progression, mass loss, and burn pattern.</p>
<p>Many CFD fire simulation calibration exercises are judged based on a single global metric such as HRR, which can lead to a failure to identify compensating effects from the various contributing phenomena and components of flame spread. Although multiple types of data involving all four components of flame spread were gathered in the combustible wall experiments, data from the free burning tests in the inert wall and free plume scenarios are just as valuable for model validation purposes because they allow fire and flow characteristics, such as wall effects, to be isolated through a comparison of test data from experiments using the same setup but under different scenarios. Data from the lower level tests (plume and inert wall) may also provide explanation of the fire behaviors observed in a more complex scenario (combustible wall) such as higher wall heat flux drives greater FSR. The decomposition framework and data presented in this article allows a user to build and validate a simple model in a logical, progressive, and piecewise fashion, thereby achieving suitable validation of constituent components of a fire growth model as well as the model as a whole.</p>
<p>Data generated from this study is comprehensive, if somewhat limiting because only a single combustible wall lining material in one orientation is used. In a practical flame spread model for engineering purposes, it is likely that multiple combustible items must be considered. The combustible wall test data in this research may not be enough to validate such a complex real-world integrated flame spread model, however, its sub-models may be validated cohesively using the various types of data as the first steps of the validation of the overall flame spread. Through this process of data verification and validation, a physically more accurate model may potentially be developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec42-1042391512472087"><title>Recommendations for future work</title>
<p>Experimental data from the three series of fire tests are intended to be used in future validation and verification for the development of fire models. A user of the dataset can choose different fire experiments to model and compare the results with real experimental data, or use the current data with other researchers’ results to deduce correlations that describe free plume fires, inert wall fires, and combustible wall fires.</p>
<p>Review of the collected data shows that there are large uncertainties in the velocity and temperature measurements. The data measurement was limited, in part, by the equipment available. Although bidirectional probes have proved to be extremely reliable in many different research projects, the pressure transducers necessary to accurately measure the relatively small pressure differential inside a low-HRR fire plume can be cost-prohibitive. Thermal effects from the fire on the transducers, gas sample lines, and electrical wires also contributed to the high uncertainty. Other methods of measuring fire plume velocity that reduces uncertainty should be considered, such as using laser Doppler techniques, installing transducers with higher sensitivity, and different mounting options for the equipment. Thermocouple measurements are inherently inaccurate because of the need for radiation correction, but they may also be complimented by other temperature measurement methods such as using infrared cameras or aspirated thermocouples. In addition, a video camera with a higher resolution can also improve the accuracy of the flame height and flame spread progression measurements.</p>
<p>Some supplementary quantities that can expand the dataset may include additional wall surface and near-wall temperatures embedded in the wall, as well as post-burn cooling of the inert wall measured using thermocouples or with a high-resolution infrared camera. Both of these quantities will aid in the understanding of the flame heat transfer to its surrounding, as well as provide another means to track the progression of flame spread. Measurements of gas temperature and velocity away from the centerline can also be made to better describe the environment within and around the fire plume.</p>
<p>Expansion of the dataset may also include additional configurations of the source fire such as additional fuels, burner shapes, and HRRs. The types of wall lining materials used in the combustible wall fire tests may also be expanded to include materials of different characteristics as well, such as different types of plastic and wood paneling commonly used in the built environment. However, it is cautioned that the critical source fire HRR should be found that correlates with the minimal heat flux needed to ignite the paneling. Furthermore, the current research was focused on a mainly vertically upward flame spread scenario, however, valuable data from additional burning scenarios such as parallel wall, room corner, and ceiling flame spread may also be gathered using the framework presented in this article.</p>
