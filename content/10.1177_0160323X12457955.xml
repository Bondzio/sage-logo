<body>
<p>This new book on public engagement’s material importance grabs you, and its generic sense of the field—its dailyness, its proximity, whether you are an academic paid to pay attention, or a layperson nursing an opinion about potholes and school district budgets—appeals to multiple audiences. John Clayton Thomas’ book is what one would expect out of the author’s long fascination with the field: thorough in combing through what is known of the government–citizen nexus and is immensely organized and rich in case study data. While the themes discussed are all too familiar, at the end readers will feel rewarded with a new appreciation for the topic and the participants of the untidy process.</p>
<p>The author takes a clinical approach and avoids the romanticized route that many of us have taken in extolling democratic civic participation, but are trying now to wrap some configuration around (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12457955">Joaquin and Greitens 2012</xref>). While many say <italic>ought,</italic> Thomas concentrates on the <italic>doable.</italic> He draws the limits and promises of interaction techniques across venues—the book aims for international audience—disentangling the philosophical sinews of engagement to arrive at practical strategies that managers would do well to treat as a toolkit.</p>
<p>The trichotomy of <italic>customer–partner–citizen</italic> is really nothing novel, according to Thomas. Each facet had been dissected in the past. Thomas contributes by sorting out the literature that trumpets them often singularly—New Public Administration’s focus on the citizen, New Public Management’s (NPM) emphasis on the customer, and the British-based idea of partnering—and demarcating intersections. Confusing the boundaries often led to frustration when, for example, a <italic>consumer</italic>-oriented feedback mechanism gets switched by a local government for a technique that invokes a more serious <italic>citizen</italic> participation in decision making. By warning about the overlaps, the author reminds us that more and more, public administration requires tolerance for ambiguity and greater flexibility to deal with a shape-shifting public.</p>
<p>The book is methodical, parsimonious, and disciplined in presenting the subject to novices, and to managers who have been burned before by public interaction, the book identifies those techniques “that are or might be <italic>under the control</italic> of public managers” (p. 13, italics in the original). Engagement gains scientific form here through an approach called design science, adapted by the author from his own previous research and studies of decision making and common-pool resource governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12457955">Vroom and Jago 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12457955">Ostrom 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12457955">Lubell 2004</xref>). It allows the author to direct his discourse from the more basic to the more complex model of engagement, and focus on the elements that would enable participation to be successful. Thomas lists strategic solutions—<italic>principles</italic>, as they are enumerated in the book—and sandwiches them by a brief theoretical overview at the beginning of each section, and a pragmatic discussion of their implications at the end. Embedded in the pages are boxes of case studies in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>The book has ten chapters, neatly divided for equal emphases on the roles. Readers will not have a difficult time recognizing many of the strategies, but not in the logic that Thomas organized them. As my own way of simplification, most of Thomas’ principles could be clustered according to serving (the customer), nudging (the partner), and sharing (with the citizen).</p>
<sec id="section1-0160323X12457955">
<title>Serving the Customer</title>
<p>The two introductory chapters give an overview of the changing place of the public in public management, away from than that of state subject, away from the insulated entity that was envisioned by the politics–administration dichotomy, and toward more activism in public affairs.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 begins with the <italic>customer</italic>, NPM, and the 1990s movement to reinvent government having almost numbed us to this philosophical orientation. Thomas shows managers how to gain control if they could make government procedures and policies decipherable, navigable, and responsive to the public. Nine principles of service are provided; some of them tethered to electronic government solutions. Readers can check them out (e.g., on page 56, “<italic>Customer Principle</italic> 4: Explore the adoption of mobile device technologies for receiving and responding to questions. . .). I wish to note two things from the author. First, customers are not always right, and, second, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X12457955">Lovell (1992</xref>), public managers cannot be expected to provide good customer service if government does not treat its employees well, as customers themselves. Statutes bind how much of a customer’s request may be provided. But to the second point, the author abbreviates his attention. In light of the antiunion, antigovernment sentiments the Great Recession of 2008 has enabled, caught in the crossfire are public employees. How are they to serve adequately when they themselves feel short-changed (rightly or wrongly)? Were it not for the elegance of the trichotomy Thomas might have perhaps devoted a chapter to this segment of the public? <italic>Their</italic> own participation in government may be shrinking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0160323X12457955">
<title>Nudging the Partner</title>
<p>A contemporary image of the coproducing citizen (or citizen organizations) rolls out in chapters 5 and 6, primarily in the area of service or policy implementation. This partner role sounds more exciting, although Thomas traces its provenance back to the 1970s and 1980s in Great Britain. The author pays tribute to the work of John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12457955">Alford (2009</xref>) in developing this section, which is shorter compared to the other two. Coproduction or partnering is described as a range of activities on a continuum, depending on the public’s contribution, from one in which the public is more able to perform the task (e.g., filling out their tax forms) than a government agency, to one in which public participation is not necessary, but it would enhance the value or quality of a public service activity (volunteering for park cleanup).</p>
<p>The principles are akin to <italic>nudging</italic>—and the author identifies them as much when he invoked Thaler and Sunstein (2008). Government could not really demand coproductive energies or contributive partnering from the public; it could only try to persuade or structure social and economic choices to yield envisioned benefits, as an architect would. The seven principles offered indicate that if government were to make partners out of people, it needs to simplify the task needed or desired from the public (<italic>Partner Principles</italic> 1 and 2), incentivize the public to contribute, employing, if necessary, material benefits and appealing to social norms (4, 5, and 6), and use sanctions (7) when the first two tactics fail, as in penalty for speed limit or tax violations.</p>
<p>Public cooperation, service contribution, and cocreation of value with the bureaucracy are therefore likely to gain ground, as governance becomes more complex, fiscally strained, and reliant on compliance, volunteerism, and mobilization of community resources or networks to carry out public goals. Just as public service and the public sector have evolved, so has public engagement, a point that I wish the author developed more in the book especially as it pertains to privatization and downsizing. The hollowing out of government since the 1980s in the United States has been consequential in limiting its capacity (Freeman and Minow 2009) to be of service to the customer or the citizen and in fact is driving it to seek the public out in a more assistive, partner role. Yet, partnering is where a skills deficit is most pronounced in government staffing. As most cases of collaboration have occurred in the implementation phase, Thomas calls on officials to understand better how to incorporate incentives and partnerships when they make policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160323X12457955">
<title>Sharing with the Citizen</title>
<p>“In an ideal bureaucracy, there is no place for citizen participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12457955">Kweit and Kweit 1984</xref>, 235). Those were the days of managerial insulation, and they are over. Last in the book is the citizen role, our default way of thinking about the public. Thomas devotes one chapter more to it and offers the most number of strategies for it: 24 <italic>Citizen Principles</italic> in all. Thomas immediately addresses when public involvement is desirable and when not. Managers must summon greater judgment in this effort, for even if customers nag government with confused requests or unstable preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12457955">Fountain 2001</xref>), and partners offer a hand but with their own selfish interests, citizens, to quote a line from a movie, have a funny way of deciding what their business is. Thomas suggests a <italic>contingent perspective</italic> that requires bureaucrats to carefully determine their need for better information, or acceptance of decisions, from the public. Balancing those criteria would help find out if and to what extent the public should share the table.</p>
<p>If opened up to participation, the next dilemma involves defining and encouraging the relevant publics. Here, aggressive techniques may be necessary, as previous studies had found that participation was often “episodic, sporadic, and idiosyncratic” (Walters 2009, 60). Several institutional and behavioral factors led to lackluster civic engagement, even with information technology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12457955">Justice, Melitski, and Smith 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12457955">Vigoda-Gadot 2007</xref>). With the panoply of groups that could claim to have a stake on any issue, Thomas admits no easy rules for verifying who truly represents whom in a community. He tries, nonetheless, as on page 157, and that is why this is such a practical handbook. He also offers ways to overcome the representation bias that favors the haves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0160323X12457955">
<title>A More Effective Democracy?</title>
<p>The last chapter is devoted to the necessary changes in managerial outlook and skills, and some final thoughts on whether an “excess of democracy” (Huntington 1975, 113) is a hazard posed by encouraging involvement. The author finds no evidence bearing out Huntington’s fear; while apathy is a real danger to democracy. The book’s argument is that if we could draw out the best of citizen ideas and their trust, the partner role becomes more accessible, and the customer might have less to complain about.</p>
<p>The author cautions the reader of the drawbacks, limitations, even danger from a careless application of each model. Application in fact might be too easy a word, because although this looks like a handbook, managers retain the challenge of defining whether what is in front of them is a customer, citizen, or (potential) partner. The book gives you the tools to run the boat, if you are certain where you are and need to be, something you are never sure for long in a democracy.</p>
<p>The governmental learning infrastructure for ascertaining customer preferences (see p. 199) and partnership possibilities (p. 207) will also help agencies identify their type of public and to change gears if needed. A sense of repetitiveness one gets while going through the principles hints that in reality, the three public personas intersect; they can present all at the same time and alternate subtly. As helpful as the principles are, procedural neatness can only be taken up to a certain point; the key lies in managerial adeptness—if those perennial staffing issues would only go away. Democracy is harder to shepherd, and civic engagement with it, when agencies lose institutional memory and talent.</p>
<p>There are many useful trinkets in Thomas’ book that are left for the readers to discover, not the least his effort to parse every terminology relating to the subject. He brings in the intergovernmental dimensions of public participation, the promised benefits of social media, and many more. This book is a valuable contribution to the political science and public administration literature; the architecture of public engagement right there in a single volume.</p>
