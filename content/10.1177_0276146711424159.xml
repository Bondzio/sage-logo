<abstract>
<p>This study focuses on the phenomenon of entrepreneurial private enterprises and their macromarketing implications in Vietnam—a vibrant economy transitioning from a centrally planned economy to the current system of socialist-oriented market economy. Relying on the writings on entrepreneurship and associated theoretical frameworks (including the complex adaptive system [CAS] perspective), especially in emerging economies, this study develops a framework for capturing the macromarketing implications of entrepreneurial private enterprises. Further, this study suggests that entrepreneurial private enterprises play a crucial role in the economic well-being (a key aspect of quality of life) of citizens in Vietnam; and the growth in entrepreneurial private enterprises is influenced by nonroutine actions by key stakeholders such as the government; and associated with the availability of skilled human resources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vietnam, as we know it now, was formed as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976 after a tumultuous history filled with foreign occupations, first by China until the middle of the tenth century, then by France starting in 1858, followed by Japan during World War II and France again until 1954, a protracted war with United States ending in 1975, and a war with neighboring Cambodia (1978–89). For the next ten years, Vietnam remained a closed socialist economy, virtually isolated from the western world, saddled with the US embargo, and heavily dependent on the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR; former Soviet Union). Finally, after a decade of isolation, economic devastation and poor agriculture leading to starvation conditions and social unrest, in 1986, Vietnam initiated the Doi Moi (meaning renovation) reforms, leading to the current system of socialist-oriented market economy. The reforms have resulted in a phenomenal growth of private enterprises and helped normalize diplomatic relationship with the United States, Japan, and other Western and East Asian countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711424159">Bekefi 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711424159">Dana 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0276146711424159">Neupert, Baughn, and Dao 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0276146711424159">Nguyen 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0276146711424159">Nguyen et al. 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0276146711424159">2009b</xref>). This dynamic interplay among politics, public policy, society, market systems, and entrepreneurship makes Vietnam an ideal study environment for macromarketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711424159">Dixon 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146711424159">Hunt 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0276146711424159">Mittelstaedt, Kilbourne, and Mittelstaedt 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0276146711424159">Shapiro, Tadajewski, and Shultz 2009</xref>). It is not surprising that Vietnam has been the focus of study in several macromarketing papers as well as in recent annual macromarketing conferences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0276146711424159">Nguyen 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0276146711424159">Shultz 1997</xref>). While the aforementioned research certainly has added to our understanding of Vietnam, macromarketing implications of entrepreneurial enterprises—often privately owned small- and medium-sized enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0276146711424159">Ronnås and Ramamurthy 2001</xref>)—have not been a primary focus among scholars. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711424159">Ardrey, Pecotich, and Shultz (2006)</xref>, who studied female entrepreneurship in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, provide one exception. This gap in the literature provides the impetus for this study.</p>
<p>Recent investigations with a focus on Vietnam from a macromarketing perspective (not counting numerous studies with history and military focus) could be grouped into three broad clusters. One group of studies has focused on the political and economic aspect of Vietnam and has tried to examine the pros and cons of policy changes in the country and their implications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0276146711424159">Shultz and Ardrey 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0276146711424159">Shultz and Pecotich 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0276146711424159">Shultz, Speece, and Pecotich 2000</xref>). A second group has focused on the quality of life and its antecedents in Vietnam (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0276146711424159">Shultz 1997</xref>). A third group has focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0276146711424159">1</xref>) and entrepreneurial ventures in Vietnam (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146711424159">Benzing, Chu, and Callanan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0276146711424159">Neupert, Baughn, and Dao 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0276146711424159">Nguyen 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0276146711424159">Nguyen et al. 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0276146711424159">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>While these studies have enhanced the knowledge about Vietnam and the relationships between policy changes and market systems, they merely provide an initial peek into this dynamic transitional economy. Even the studies with a focus on SMEs in Vietnam have only started to scratch the surface of the complex and intricate linkage between private entrepreneurial enterprises and macromarketing implications. Part of the problem could be that detailed data about private entrepreneurial enterprises and their macromarketing implications in the Vietnamese context are not easily accessible. Another problem could be the lack of a clear conceptual framework for entrepreneurship, especially when viewed within the context of emerging or transitional economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0276146711424159">Širec and Močnik 2010</xref>). There is also some confusion about terms such as entrepreneurship, private enterprises, and SMEs. While, most use these terms synonymously, others suggest subtle differences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0276146711424159">Zhu, Hitt, and Tihanyi (2006)</xref> suggest that SMEs in emerging markets could be either incumbent or entrepreneurial SMEs and differentiate between these two types of SMEs. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146711424159">Kearney, Hisrich, and Roche (2009)</xref> argue that entrepreneurship is not an exclusive characteristic of the private sector, it could also be found in the public sector. Notwithstanding this debate, the authors rely on specific writings in the area of entrepreneurship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146711424159">Hills 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146711424159">Knight 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0276146711424159">Leibenstein 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0276146711424159">Schumpeter 1934</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0276146711424159">1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0276146711424159">Shane and Venkataraman 2000</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0276146711424159">Venkataraman 1998</xref>). Our position therefore is that most SMEs would be owned by entrepreneurs, whereas not all entrepreneurs would own SMEs (some may own large enterprises); however, both SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures will be privately owned. Thus the authors focus on private sector entrepreneurship, and not on the public sector entrepreneurship, and examine the growth of privately owned entrepreneurial enterprises and its macromarketing implications.</p>
<p>Extant literature reveals life quality to be a fundamental outcome of the macromarketing ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711424159">Layton 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0276146711424159">Peterson 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0276146711424159">Peterson and Malhotra 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0276146711424159">Shultz 1997</xref>). In turn, the domain of life quality has been found to include a host of dimensions such as poverty, cost of living, economy, infrastructure, freedom, culture, environment, crime rate, employment, and health, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711424159">Anand and Ravallion 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146711424159">Dasgupta and Weale 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711424159">Howell and Howell 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711424159">Layton 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0276146711424159">Peterson 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0276146711424159">Peterson and Malhotra 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0276146711424159">Slottje 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0276146711424159">Weede 1993</xref>). In this study, the authors focus on two dimensions to capture the quality of life—per capita income and employment attributed to entrepreneurial enterprises. Our decision to focus on these two measures is based on literature that suggests welfare includes the objectively measurable resources that enable an individual to meet basic human needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711424159">Bognar 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711424159">Costanza et al. 2008</xref>). Some of these resources include income and assets, education, and objective health status. Insights about them are available through archival data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711424159">Inglehart et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0276146711424159">Shackman, Liu, and Wang 2005</xref>). The authors rely on the archival data from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (2010) and use the classification “nonstate enterprises” to capture the growth of entrepreneurial private enterprises. Further, the authors use the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and employment due to private enterprises as indicators of quality of life; and education data to capture the human capital associated with growth of private enterprises. In addition, the authors rely on existing literature that has focused on the growth of private enterprises in Vietnam, to find support for the proposed framework.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective—relying on the complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework, literature on entrepreneurship, and evidence from the existing literature on Vietnam as well as macroeconomic data from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam—this study offers a framework capturing the macromarketing implications of entrepreneurial private enterprises in Vietnam. The authors hope that this framework offers guidelines for future research with Vietnam as a focus. From a managerial and public policy perspective, this study may be useful as a blueprint for grassroots development in emerging and transitional economies, especially the growth of entrepreneurial private enterprises and their implications for quality of life—a key macromarketing outcome. This perspective of entrepreneurship is consistent with the scope of macromarketing—marketing systems and their impact and consequences on society, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711424159">Dixon 2002</xref>, 737; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146711424159">Hunt 1981</xref>, 7). In this study, the authors posit that entrepreneurship is a critical element of the marketing system in Vietnam, which is influenced by and in turn influences various dimensions of Vietnamese society.</p>
<p>The authors next present a review of literature on SMEs in emerging economies, including Vietnam (although Vietnam has been categorized as a transitional economy). This is followed by a discussion of the theoretical foundation for understanding the entrepreneurial changes in transitional economies. Finally, the authors present evidences from the Vietnamese economy pertaining to the growth of private enterprises (entrepreneurial) and their macromarketing implications.</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial Enterprises—Macromarketing</title>
<p>The notion of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial enterprises has attracted a lot of attention from very diverse constituents, such as researchers, politicians, practitioners, media, and society. Despite the generally acknowledged importance of entrepreneurship in regional development and the development of emerging and transitional economies, literature on entrepreneurship is still at an early stage, especially in terms of a theoretical framework, its domain and its nomological network. In terms of definition and domain, there is still little agreement (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146711424159">Kaufmann and Dant 1998</xref> for a literature review). However, some key common themes emerge. Some of them include profit seeking as goal and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146711424159">Hills 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0276146711424159">Schumpeter 1934</xref>); risk taking, leadership, motivation, and ability to resolve crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0276146711424159">Leibenstein 1968</xref>); creative destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0276146711424159">Schumpeter 1942</xref>), risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146711424159">Knight 1921</xref>); and creation of new enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146711424159">Low and MacMillan 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711424159">Gartner 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to its antecedents, several theoretical frameworks have been used to explain the emergence of entrepreneurial enterprises in emerging economies. One stream of literature has focused on understanding “who the entrepreneur is and what he/she does” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0276146711424159">Shane and Venkataraman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0276146711424159">Širec and Močnik 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0276146711424159">Venkataraman 1997</xref>). Others have used the notion of changes in supply of talent with entrepreneurial characteristics or changes in the environmental conditions leading to a demand for entrepreneurial ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0276146711424159">Thornton 1999</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan (2010)</xref> borrows from literature on complex system perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711424159">Arthur, Durlauf, and Lane 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146711424159">Foster 2005</xref>) and conceptualizes economies as CAS, which then is used to explain the evolution of entrepreneurs. The CAS consists of multiple interdependent subsystems and actors. The outcome of this adaptive system is determined by the complex interaction among the subsystems and actors, and characterized by feedback mechanism and nonlinearity. Together, this complex and nonlinear adaptive system creates a synergistic environment for entrepreneurial growth. The extent and speed of entrepreneurial transformation are then hypothesized to depend on four factors:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>presence of nonroutine action triggers by pioneering actors from different subsystems;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>presence of actors who engage in network-building activities that facilitate the creation of ties between pioneering actors from different subsystems;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>presence of idiosyncratic success stories that reinforce early nonroutine actions; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>effective dissemination of information about idiosyncratic success stories come together in time and space to initiate and sustain a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan 2010</xref>, p 165).</p>
</list-item>
</list>The CAS perspective offers an improvement on the supply–demand perspective as well as personality and activities perspective of entrepreneurship, that is, it offers a more dynamic perspective to the emergence of entrepreneurship than other extant perspectives that are somewhat static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan 2010</xref>). Several researchers have contributed to the elements of CAS without actually using CAS. They have identified key actors and subsystems aiding the emergence of entrepreneurship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0276146711424159">Silva (2010)</xref> suggests that countries with higher-quality human capital opt for more risky projects and have higher productivity. The positive effect of human capital on nonlinear economic growth is also reinforced by others such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146711424159">Growiec (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0276146711424159">Kottaridia and Stengos (2010)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0276146711424159">Walder and Nguyen (2008)</xref> study the pattern of economic development in China and Vietnam and state that “the scale of economic enterprises and the allocation of property rights shape the social structure and influence income distribution” (p. 251). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146711424159">Kooijman-van Dijk and Clancy (2010)</xref> study the impact of infrastructure (energy supply) on the growth of private enterprises, jobs, and well-being of society at large, and found a positive relationship. In fact, they argue that the effect of better infrastructure is nonlinear. Similarly, several authors have highlighted the importance of institutions and institutional reforms on economic performance of firms. They suggest that provincial competitiveness (through better institutions that provide better market information, secure ownership, and human resource training) is a significant predictor of cross-province differences in firm performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711424159">Carman and Dominguez (2001)</xref> highlight the importance of policies such as economic liberalization in redefining the competitive structure of the marketplace and provide an impetus for strategic organizational change.</p>
<p>With regard to the outcome of entrepreneurship, the critical role of entrepreneurship in the development of economies is acknowledged in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711424159">Bateman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711424159">Jones and Tilley 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0276146711424159">Shane and Venkataraman 2000</xref>). Entrepreneurial enterprises have also been suggested as one of the key drivers of nation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711424159">Kazem and Van der Heijden 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711424159">Hallberg 2000</xref>) and a stepping stone for robust marketing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711424159">Bekefi 2006</xref>). Others echo the crucial role of entrepreneurs in the development of emerging economies and prosperity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711424159">Cecora 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711424159">Matthews, Qin, and Franklin 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0276146711424159">Oostendorp, Trung, and Tung 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711424159">Dana 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0276146711424159">Ronnås and Ramamurthy 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711424159">Cecora (2000)</xref> also identifies some differences between entrepreneurs and corporate executives, for example, local and regional ties of entrepreneurs, high degree of identification with the product or service quality of the firm, and the kind and amount of personal risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0276146711424159">Onifade and Abiola (2010)</xref> associate entrepreneurship with several macromarketing outcomes including quality of life/standard of living, employment for self and others, talent development, experience and training, healthy competition, boosting of self-pride, increase in goods and services, reduction in crime and vices, tax payment, closer interaction among stakeholders, and flexible business operations.</p>
<p>Similar sentiments are expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0276146711424159">Okpara and Kabongo (2009)</xref>. In their study of Malaysia, Thailand, and Philippines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146711424159">Habaradas (2009)</xref> suggest that SMEs are seen as a means of reducing poverty, and broadening and deepening the industrial structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711424159">Jones and Tilley (2003)</xref> suggest that SMEs are instrumental in economic growth, job creation, innovation and promotion of enterprises. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146711424159">Jones, Snelgrove, and Muckosy (2006)</xref> highlight the importance of small businesses in national prosperity and suggest that inclusion of women further enhances this process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146711424159">Carter (2011)</xref> argues that entrepreneurial reward includes not only financial reward but also various elements that make up a broader concept of economic well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146711424159">Hills (1994</xref>, 16) defines entrepreneurship as “The process that takes place in different environments and settings that causes changes in the economic system through innovation brought about by individuals who generate or respond to economic opportunities that create value for both these individuals and society.”</p>
<p>Relying on the entrepreneurship literature, the authors surmise that entrepreneurship and growth of entrepreneurial enterprises need appropriate conditions and some push from key players (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711424159">Amit, Glosten, and Muller 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711424159">Gartner 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711424159">Layton 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146711424159">Low and MacMillan 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0276146711424159">Schumpeter 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0276146711424159">Thornton 1999</xref>). While literature reveals several determinants for the emergence and growth of entrepreneurship, these could be grouped into the following subsystems—<italic>Legal, political and regulatory environment</italic> (e.g., ownership of property); <italic>Resources</italic> (e.g., economic, intellectual and human capital); <italic>Infrastructure</italic> (e.g., transportation, communication and information); and <italic>Market opportunities</italic> (e.g., market conditions). These conditions then encourage the <italic>entrepreneurs</italic> to take risk, innovate, and create new enterprise that are entrepreneurial in nature. Further, the authors propose that the emergence and growth of entrepreneurial enterprises will lead to enhanced <italic>quality of life</italic> (e.g., enhanced economic well-being through higher income and employment) for the entrepreneurs as well as the members of the society at large. Finally, the enhanced quality of life will influence the determinants through a feedback loop, which accelerates or decelerates the growth of entrepreneurial ventures, depending upon the desirability of the outcome (i.e., quality of life). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan (2010)</xref> argues that this feedback loop results in a constant state of dynamic disorganization and subsequent self-organization. A similar interactive relationship between marketing systems, economic growth and quality of life has also been hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711424159">Layton (2009)</xref>.

<title>Evidence from Vietnam</title>
<p>Much has been written about the growth of entrepreneurial ventures (although the researchers have used a variety of terms such as entrepreneurial enterprises, private enterprises, SMEs synonymously), its antecedents, and some of its outcomes. Although a lot of these writings are conceptual, rely on experiential knowledge base (perhaps due to lack of reliable and detailed data), and are extremely rich in description, they do not provide a framework to explain the emergence and growth of an entrepreneurial economy in Vietnam (which is transitioning from a centrally planned economy). Thus, the authors will use the findings from this rich literature base as evidence to support the proposed framework. In addition, the authors will use the archival temporal data available from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (2010). The General Statistics Office (GSO) defines private enterprise as “nonstate owned enterprises” (NSOE; as against state owned and foreign investment owned). The authors use this definition to capture the growth of entrepreneurial private enterprises and try to get a sense of associative relationships between the growth of private enterprises and some of its purported antecedents and outcomes. Given the gaps in reliable data, the authors focus on the period between 2000 and 2009 and examine the emergence of private enterprises (often SMEs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0276146711424159">2</xref> and entrepreneurial) and explore their macromarketing implications. The authors next present supporting evidence—first the emergence of and growth of entrepreneurial ventures followed by the determinants and next the outcome of such growth in entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>The evidence clearly indicates that the privately owned units have been growing at a rate faster than both the state owned enterprises and foreign owned or foreign direct investment (FDI) enterprises. In terms of share of all enterprises in Vietnam, the NSOE have grown from 83 percent in 2000 to 96 percent in 2009 (in comparison, the state-owned enterprises have declined from 14 percent to close to 1 percent; and the FDI enterprises have remained consistent at around 3.6–2.6 percent). Other researchers have also noticed this growth of private enterprises (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711424159">Ardrey, Pecotich, and Shultz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146711424159">Maruyama and Trung 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146711424159">Nam, Sonube, and Otsuka 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0276146711424159">Nguyen et al. 2009a</xref> and b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0276146711424159">Nguyen and Ramachandran 2006</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0276146711424159">Oostendorp, Trung, and Tung 2009</xref>). These trends provide clear indication that the Vietnamese marketplace is changing dramatically and is shifting toward private enterprises as an engine of growth at the grassroots level. It seems that the <italic>Doi Moi</italic> policy changes and subsequent associated events are having desired effects. The logical next question is whether these changes in the Vietnamese marketplace are having the desired effect on the quality of life in the Vietnamese society?</p>

<title>Quality of Life Associates of Private Enterprises</title>
<p>Based on the extant literature on measures to capture quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711424159">Bognar 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711424159">Costanza et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711424159">Farid and Lazarus 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711424159">Inglehart et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0276146711424159">Shackman, Liu, and Wang 2005</xref>), the authors focus on two objective measures of resources that enable an individual to meet basic human needs—per capita GDP and employment. The archival data for the per capita GDP and the employees by type of ownership for Vietnam are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146711424159">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0276146711424159">Figure 3</xref>

The exception to this steady growth is seen in the last two years (2007–09), where the per capita GDP seems to have declined, possibly due to the global financial crisis.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, when we look at the employment figures, we see a steady increase in labor employed by the nonstate enterprises not just in numbers (growth rate of over 400 percent, which is higher than the other two types of enterprises), but also in terms of percentage of total employees (increased from about 29 percent to almost 59 percent). In comparison, the percentage of labor employed by state enterprises has declined from 59 percent to 20 percent; and the percentage of labor employed by FDI enterprises is around 21 percent in 2009. Interestingly, the labor force employed by the FDI enterprises also declined during 2007–09 period (23 percent to 21 percent), possibly due to the global financial crisis. The authors also conducted a post hoc analysis using bivariate correlation between per capita GDP and number of labor employed by state, non-state, and foreign investment enterprises (due to small data points the authors only looked at the direction of the correlations and not the absolute magnitude of the correlation) and found the associations to be positive.</p>
<p>Further, Ricky (2011) asserts that the NSOEs’ contribution toward GDP surpassed the contribution by the state-owned enterprises in 2005 and the gap has been steadily increasing. Thus, growth in private enterprises seems to be associated with increase in employment, ensuring that people have jobs and they can take care of their own and their family’s quality of life needs. Regarding the financial ability to take care of quality of life related needs, the trends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711424159">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0276146711424159">3</xref> suggest that while growth in the private sector seems to have a positive association with buying power, buying power is also affected by the events around the world—that is, global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Other researchers have similarly found that the emergence and growth of private sector enterprises have a positive effect on the well-being of not just the entrepreneur and his or her family but also enhance the well-being of others in their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711424159">Ardrey, Pecotich, and Shultz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0276146711424159">Oostendorp, Trung, and Tung 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0276146711424159">Walder and Nguyen 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0276146711424159">Oostendorp, Trung, and Tung (2009)</xref> moreover found that household private enterprises increased the income of the household with the business and reduced the between-household inequality. In summary, there seems to be a positive association between the growth of entrepreneurial privately owned enterprises and well-being, in terms of employment and income, for entrepreneurs and their households <italic>and</italic> their broader communities. The authors next examine evidence supporting the factors that provide the impetus for the growth of entrepreneurial nonstate enterprises.</p>

<p>This evidence (based on data from GSO and extant literature) clearly indicates that the privately owned enterprises have been growing in terms of not just sheer numbers and share of economy but also in terms of their impact on the well-being (employment and income) of the citizens of Vietnam. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan (2010)</xref> suggests that the growth of entrepreneurship is determined by the “presence of non-routine action triggers by pioneering actors from different subsystems, and the presence of actors who engage in network-building activities that facilitate the creation of ties between pioneering actors from different subsystems” (p. 165). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0276146711424159">Table 2</xref>

<title>Legal, Political, and Regulatory Factors</title>
<p>A look at the historical account of Vietnam indicates one of the reasons for <italic>Doi Moi</italic> is poor economic conditions faced by the Vietnamese population during 1976–86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711424159">Dana 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0276146711424159">Neupert, Baughn, and Dao 2006</xref>). While the authors focus on the economic data for the years 2000–09, it is not too difficult to visualize that there will be time lags between the causes (nonroutine actions by key actors) and effect (growth of private enterprises and changes in per capita GDP). Thus the authors see the effects of <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, initiated in 1986 by the Vietnamese Government, followed by a series of nonroutine actions by other actors such as the US lifting the embargo; visits by Jacques Chirac, Bill Clinton, and Vladimir Putin; memberships in Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and World Trade Organization (WTO); and a visit by Vietnamese president Tran Duc Luong to France, to continue through to our focal period. These nonroutine actions (by other actors outside Vietnam) cumulatively signal an acceptance of the new Vietnam by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This period was also marked by a significant growth in the NSOE and foreign investment, and a decline in the state-owned enterprises (as a percentage of total numbers). It seems to indicate a deliberate pattern, which could be driven by policy changes and changes in infrastructure. Thus, it is not inconceivable to see an associative relationship, albeit with a time lag, between these sequences of events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0276146711424159">Table 2</xref>) capturing a change in the political environment, economic policy, and even international network, and the growth of entrepreneurial private enterprises—that is, the reduction in the number of state-owned enterprises and the corresponding growth in NSOE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146711424159">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711424159">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Resource Availability</title>
<p>The importance of economic resources in the growth of private entrepreneurial ventures has been amply acknowledged in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711424159">Ardrey, Pecotich, and Shultz. 2006</xref>). In the case of Vietnam, the growth of nonstate enterprises seems to parallel the growth in the average capital for the nonstate enterprises (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711424159">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146711424159">4</xref>
). The numbers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146711424159">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146711424159">Figure 4</xref> indicate that the average capital per enterprise (as a percentage of total) has been increasing at a phenomenal rate for the NSOE (in comparison, this percentage has been declining for both state-owned and foreign-owned enterprises). Even though the state-owned enterprises still possess a large chunk of the total capital, there seems to be a deliberate shift in the overall composition of the three key players with NSOE gaining ground at a rate higher than both state owned and foreign owned (FDI) firms. The deliberate nature of the growth in capital per enterprises for NSOE (in comparison to the state and FDI owned enterprises) seems to bode well for the decisions taken by the key actors and the sequence of events presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0276146711424159">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Researchers have also acknowledged the role of another supply side factor—the education sector—which supplies skilled human resource in any economy, including Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711424159">Au, Altman, and Roussel 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711424159">Blundell et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711424159">Gnyawali and Fogel 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146711424159">Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146711424159">Nam, Sonobe, and Otsuka 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0276146711424159">O’Neill 1995</xref>). The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0276146711424159">Figure 5</xref>
 (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711424159">Figure 2</xref>) indicates that the growth in number of private enterprises does mirror the growth in the education sector. In fact, this upward trend is also in synch with the increase in labor force employed by entrepreneurial private sector. One interesting observation is the decline in the number of University students during 2006–07. One possible explanation is that during these years, the number of Vietnamese students going abroad for education increased. In the United States alone, the number of Vietnamese students increased by 10 percent per year during these years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0276146711424159">Open Doors 2010</xref>). Australia was another very popular destination. While some labeled this trend as brain drain, this could also be seen as an indication of success in government policies and steps taken by the Vietnamese Government to make Vietnam a more open environment, a key driver for growth of private enterprises.</p>

Thus, it is not inconceivable to link the growth in private enterprises to policy changes, such as <italic>Doi Moi</italic> and other nonroutine actions by key actors of a CAS in the form of Vietnam as well as outside Vietnam, and argue that as people feel more satisfied with the outcomes from growth of private enterprises, they are likely to provide positive feedback to such a movement.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The objective of this study is to investigate the growth of entrepreneurial private enterprises and their macromarketing implications in Vietnam—a vibrant economy transitioning from a centrally planned economy to the current system of socialist-oriented market economy. The authors use the theoretical framework of CAS (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan 2010</xref>) to integrate different aspects of growth of private enterprises in Vietnam, that is, its antecedents (e.g., actions and events within various subsystems by key stakeholders) and consequences (e.g., quality of life for citizens of Vietnam). The extant literature and archival data from GSO of Vietnam suggest that entrepreneurship does play a critical role within the Vietnamese marketplace, and it has important macromarketing implications. The evidence suggests an associative relationship between entrepreneurial private enterprises (i.e., nonstate enterprises) and various macromarketing subsystems such as legal, political, and regulatory environment, infrastructure, resources availability, and market structure. Entrepreneurship is also found to be associated with quality of life in Vietnam, captured by the per capita income and employment. Finally, the authors suggest that this sense of well-being (or lack of) based on quality of life provides feedback to the macro subsystem. In summary:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Growth in entrepreneurial enterprises (captured by the growth in non-state enterprises) seems to parallel key events in various subsystems of the macromarketing environment (education sector, capital market, legal, regulatory, public policy, and international relations) in Vietnam.</p>

<list-item>
<p>Growth in entrepreneurial enterprises seems to parallel the economic well-being of the citizens at large (captured by the per capita GDP and employment in nonstate enterprises) in Vietnam.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Enhancement of quality of life is likely to affect macromarketing, thus further enhancing the growth of entrepreneurship.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The results of this study have implications for the key actors (e.g., government policy makers, foreign governments, international trade and regulatory bodies, public at large and other stakeholders) in Vietnam. Their decisions and the sequence of events that follow must be carefully managed to encourage the growth of entrepreneurship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711424159">Arikan 2010</xref>). For this, policy makers must pay attention to the relevant subsystems (e.g., education sector, financial institutions, market conditions, and infrastructure). Further, the findings about the positive association between growth of entrepreneurial private (nonstate) enterprises and the economic well-being of the Vietnamese citizens makes intuitive sense and corroborates existing literature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711424159">Ardrey, Pecotich, and Shultz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0276146711424159">Oostendorp, Trung, and Tung 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0276146711424159">Walder and Nguyen 2008</xref>). From a theoretical perspective, the findings of this study reinforce the notion that entrepreneurship is a socioeconomic phenomenon and is intricately and dynamically linked with other institutions and phenomena in the marketplace. Hence, entrepreneurship should be viewed from a more holistic macromarketing perspective and not just from somewhat narrowly defined economic or organizational perspectives.</p>
<p>From a macromarketing perspective, growth of entrepreneurship and private sector enterprises should be perceived as a driver of the improvement of economic well-being of citizens. It generates wealth and employment at the grassroots level and has a substantial impact on societal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0276146711424159">Okpara and Kabongo 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146711424159">Habaradas 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711424159">Jones and Tilley 2003</xref>). Policy makers in Vietnam and other emerging and transitional economies should look at policies that would provide favorable conditions for the emergence and growth of private enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711424159">Bhasin and Venkataramany 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0276146711424159">Ronnås and Ramamurthy 2001</xref>). Policy makers should also look at alternate modes of private enterprises such as franchising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711424159">Alon 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711424159">Bhasin and Venkataramany 2010</xref>) or public sector entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146711424159">Kearney, Hisrich, and Roche 2009</xref>). The authors believe that the findings of this study help with the argument that people at the lower end of the income bracket or citizens of poorer economies also have a right to the quality of life that the rich enjoy, but often are left out because of their lack of purchasing ability, and this may be particularly true in emerging and transitional economies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711424159">Hammond and Prahalad 2004</xref>). Policies that encourage the growth of entrepreneurial ventures could be a possible solution.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. First, it relies primarily on archival data with a window of only ten years, and evidence and conclusions from existing studies with a focus on entrepreneurship in Vietnam. Future studies should look at a longer time horizon to get a better picture of the complex and nonlinear relationships between the nonroutine actions of key actors in Vietnam and perhaps in other emerging economies, and the resultant outcomes such as emergence and growth of private enterprises and entrepreneurship, and eventually quality of life. Future research should also look at other elements of CAS within an emerging and/or transitional economy such as Vietnam to better understand the relationships between the drivers and outcomes of entrepreneurship. However, this would entail a long-term historical look at one CAS and perhaps ethnographic study. In addition, in this study, the authors focus on only two aspects of quality of life: per capita income and employment. While existing literature on emerging economies has highlighted the relationship between economic well-being and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711424159">Farid and Lazarus 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711424159">Hammond and Prahalad 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0276146711424159">Shultz 1997</xref>), some argue that as income or purchasing power increases, subjective quality of life decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711424159">Kapur 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711424159">Max-Neef 1995</xref>). Hence, future studies should look at other aspects of quality of life and investigate their relationship with growth in entrepreneurship. Finally, the authors would urge researchers to collect primary data to draw conclusions about the relationships among some of the elements of CAS such as legal, political, and regulatory dimensions, sources availability, market conditions, infrastructure, the emergence and growth of entrepreneurship, and quality of life. The authors hope that their conceptual framework provides an impetus for further investigation in the critical area of entrepreneurship in emerging and transitional economies, to facilitate better understanding of the role of private enterprises, entrepreneurship, and SMEs in enhancing the well-being of individuals, families, communities, and Vietnam and other nations.</p>

<p>Small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) are a very heterogeneous group. They include a wide variety of firms-village handicraft markets, small machine shops, restaurants, and computer software firms that possess a wide range of sophistication and skills, and operate in wide range of markets and social environment. SMEs usually operate in the formal sector of the economy, employ mainly wage-earning workers, and participate more fully in organized markets. The operational definition of SMEs varies by country and is usually based on the number of employees or the value of assets. The lower limit for small-scale enterprises is usually set at 5 to 10 workers and the upper limit at 50 to 100 workers. The upper limit for “medium-scale” enterprises is usually set between 100 and 250 employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711424159">Hallberg 2000</xref>).</p>
