<title>Background:</title>
<p>The optimal choice for intervention for recalcitrant lateral elbow tendinopathy remains unclear as various treatment modalities have documented comparable results in the literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512470625">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To explore the safety, tolerability, and early efficacy of a new minimally invasive mode of treatment that delivers focused, calibrated ultrasonic energy, effectively microresecting the pathological tendon and removing only pathological tissue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512470625">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512470625">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Seven male and 13 female patients aged 33 to 65 years averaging 12.5 months (range, 4-48) of failed nonoperative therapy underwent the ultrasonic microresection procedure in an outpatient clinic setting. The procedure involved a sterile, ultrasound-guided percutaneous microresection with a proprietary device (TX1) performed through a stab incision under local anesthesia. The duration of the procedure and complications of the device or procedure were assessed. Outcome parameters included patient satisfaction; visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; and ultrasound assessment at 3 and 6 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512470625">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The median duration for the sterile confirmatory ultrasound examination (phase 1) was 88.5 seconds (range, 39-211; SD, ±47.6), the median duration of the procedure proper (phase 2) was 10.1 minutes (range, 4.1-19.4; SD, ±3.7), and the median energy time (duration the TX1 device was activated) was 32.5 seconds (range, 18-58; SD, ±11.0). No complications were encountered. A significant improvement in VAS score (from 5.5 to 3.3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) occurred by 1 week, and significant improvements in both DASH-Compulsory (from 21.7 to 11.3; <italic>P</italic> = .001) and DASH-Work (from 25.0 to 6.3; <italic>P</italic> = .012) scores occurred by 1 month. The VAS scores further improved at 3, 6, and 12 months (from 2.0 to 1.0 to 0.50; <italic>P</italic> = .003 and .023). The DASH-Compulsory score improved significantly from 3 to 6 months (from 8.6 to 4.6; <italic>P</italic> = .003), and both the DASH-Compulsory and DASH-Work scores were sustained by 12 months. Sonographically reduced tendon thickness (19 patients), resolved or reduced hypervascularity (17 patients), and reduced hypoechoic area (18 patients) occurred by 6 months. Nineteen of the 20 patients (95%) expressed satisfaction with the procedure, with 9 patients being very satisfied with their overall experience at 6 months after the procedure, 10 patients somewhat satisfied, and 1 patient neutral.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512470625">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Ultrasonic microresection of diseased tissue with the TX1 device provides a focally directed, safe, specific, minimally invasive, and well-tolerated treatment for recalcitrant lateral elbow tendinopathy in an office-based or ambulatory surgical setting with good evidence of some level of efficacy in 19 of 20 patients (95%) that is sustained for at least 1 year.</p>

<p>Chronic tendinopathy of the common extensor origin of the elbow (commonly termed “tennis elbow”) affects 2% to 3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512470625">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512470625">26</xref></sup> of the population, with a tendency toward an economically active population between 40 to 50 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512470625">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512470625">26</xref></sup> It introduces a significant socioeconomic burden due to loss of productivity and consumption of health care resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512470625">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512470625">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512470625">28</xref></sup> The average length of sick leave has been reported to be approximately 2 weeks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512470625">27</xref></sup> but up to 30% can have prolonged absence from work for 11 to 12 weeks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512470625">27</xref></sup> which can occasionally extend up to a year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512470625">11</xref></sup> or even result in occupational changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512470625">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Refractory forms of tennis elbow are common and require more invasive treatment such as surgery. Unfortunately, there is little evidence in the current literature to define how surgery can precisely target the pathological tissue implicated in the causative process of mucoid degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512470625">20</xref></sup> Failure to clearly identify and target the pathological tendinotic tissue has led to less effective and even inappropriate release operations of the common extensor origin, commonly termed “tenotomy,” which do not properly address the pathological component of tennis elbow.</p>
<p>Ideally, treatment of chronic tennis elbow should be targeted with precise microresection of specific regions demonstrating mucoid degenerative tissue, but current surgical techniques are still based on gross appearances. Intratendinous abnormalities are recognizable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography with regions of hypervascularity, hypoechoicity, and occasional calcification. These have been correlated with location of pain in symptomatic tennis elbows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512470625">29</xref></sup> Ultrasonography has been shown to have a high sensitivity for hypoechoic lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512470625">15</xref></sup> making it very useful for diagnosis, localization, and directing needle ablation during microtenotomy of the lesion.</p>
<p>There have been promising clinical data supporting the use of ultrasound-guided percutaneous tenotomy. A number of reports indicate both short- and long-term benefits from using an ultrasound-guided approach together with various needle techniques to debride diseased tendon tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512470625">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512470625">30</xref></sup> While these results are encouraging and supportive of this approach, the procedure is very technique and operator dependent, and the ultimate curative value is yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>A novel technique termed “fasciotomy and surgical tenotomy” (FAST) has been developed for precise ultrasonic microresection of the pathological tissue in chronic elbow tendinopathy. It allows for effective ultrasound-guided localization and treatment of the relevant pathological tissue without damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. This is the therapeutic basis of phacoemulsification that has revolutionized the management of cataract surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512470625">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512470625">19</xref></sup> Applying a similar treatment philosophy of ultrasound-guided ultrasonic microresection of diseased tissue represents a new approach to tendinopathy in the musculoskeletal system that has to be validated.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that effective long-term definitive treatment would be predicated on removing the diseased tissue in chronic elbow tendinopathy. The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of performing the FAST technique in an office setting. Its safety and tolerability, as well as its early efficacy in the management of chronic elbow tendinopathy, have been carefully evaluated and documented.</p>
<p>Patients with tennis elbow who had failed nonoperative medical management were recruited by the principal investigator and co-investigators among patients attending outpatient services in a tertiary, academic teaching hospital. Approval was sought from the relevant Institutional Review Board for the conduct of the clinical trial, which was approved for the treatment of 20 patients.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512470625" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>An open-label study was performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel ultrasound-guided percutaneous tenotomy technique in chronic elbow tendinopathy. The TX1 system (Tenex Health, Lake Forest, California) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512470625">Figure 1</xref>) was developed for the treatment of chronic tendinopathic conditions of the musculoskeletal system. It uses standard ultrasound imaging available in clinical settings for real-time visualization of the pathological tendon and targeting of the ultrasonic energy delivered by the probe. The procedure can be performed in an office-based setting or in an ambulatory surgical facility and can also be performed within a short duration under local anesthesia.</p>

<sec id="section8-0363546512470625">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria were patients between the ages of 18 and 70 years in otherwise good health with well-managed conditions and with documented chronic lateral epicondylitis that had failed nonoperative medical management, as evidenced by persistent elbow pain for a minimum of 3 months. The patients needed to have completed diagnostic ultrasound imaging of the affected arm with a positive identification of an intrasubstance tendon tear or scar. All patients had experienced significant alteration of daily activities caused by the condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512470625">
<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Patients with the following criteria were excluded from this study:</p>
<list id="list1-0363546512470625" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>unwilling or unable to complete the repeat questionnaire up to 12 months;</p>

<p>lacking a targetable hypoechoic region in the common extensor tendon on ultrasound verification; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>significant improvement of symptoms on the day of the baseline visit.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It is noteworthy that patients with recurrent symptoms after prior tennis elbow release procedures were not excluded from the study, as the possibility of a residual or recurrent nidus of pathological tendinous tissue would be the ideal indication for the FAST technique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512470625">
<title>Study Protocol</title>
<sec id="section11-0363546512470625">
<title>Screening and Enrollment</title>
<p>Patients with a documented history of chronic epicondylalgia of the lateral elbow were considered potential candidates for the FAST technique. They were advised by the attending physician of the limited experience with the therapy to address their joint pain. Patients interested in participating in the study were referred to the principal investigator or coinvestigators and underwent the following screening steps:</p>
<list id="list2-0363546512470625" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>Verification of chronic elbow pain present for a minimum of 3 months and not responsive to nonoperative medical management, which includes a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), activity modification, use of tennis elbow armband, with or without a course of therapy comprising heat treatment, massage, stretches, and therapeutic ultrasound.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Verification of epicondylalgia via the completion of a physical examination and ultrasound imaging by a single musculoskeletal radiologist to confirm the hypoechoic profile of the degenerated tendon tissue within 8 weeks of the procedure.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Explanation of alternative treatments (ie, continued medical management, local cortisone injection, and surgical release).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Potential participants were provided an informational pamphlet of the therapy along with study participation requirements. Patients interested in participating in the study visited the nurse coordinator from the institution’s Clinical Trial and Resource Center together with the principal investigator to obtain informed consent. All screening and enrollment information was specifically documented by both the investigator(s) and nurse coordinator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546512470625">
<title>Baseline Visit</title>
<p>Documentation included patient demographics and hand dominance, vital signs, concomitant medications, comorbidities, inciting mechanisms for the elbow symptoms, prior therapeutic procedures, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. The patients also completed a baseline standard quality-of-life questionnaire specifically designed for chronic musculoskeletal pain (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH]).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546512470625">
<title>Office-Based Percutaneous Microresection</title>
<p>The office-based percutaneous intervention was completed on the same day as the baseline visit and was performed in the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. All investigators and a single nurse coordinator had previously familiarized themselves with the operation of the TX1 device and the preparatory procedures. The local investigators (4 orthopaedic surgeons by training) underwent 1.5 hours of lectures and 3 hours of introductory cadaveric work and dissection in August 2010, followed by another refresher cadaveric session of 3 hours in June 2011 a day before performance of the actual clinical cases. The local investigators assisted with the first 7 cases in June 2011, and a transfer over of the technique was achieved in November 2011 during the subsequent 13 cases.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546512470625">
<title>FAST Technique</title>
<p>The actual procedure was divided into 2 phases.</p>
<sec id="section15-0363546512470625">
<title>Phase 1 (Confirmatory Ultrasound)</title>
<p>In the first phase, a confirmatory ultrasound examination was performed, and the hypoechoic region was documented. This phase was performed under sterile conditions so that the subsequent entry point could be localized with reference to the hypoechoic lesion. During the first phase, the assistant (nurse coordinator) prepared the TX1 device to the appropriate (intermediate) frequency for the soft tissue debridement and tenotomy and confirmed proper function of the device.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0363546512470625">
<title>Phase 2 (Therapeutic FAST Technique)</title>
<p>In the second phase, with the probe maintained in position, a subcutaneous weal was raised with approximately 2 to 3 mL of 1% lidocaine 1.5 to 2 cm distal to the site of the pathological changes, in line with the direction of the common extensor fibers. The injection was deepened toward and beyond the deep fascia. A tract of 1% lidocaine was injected as the needle was withdrawn. A stab incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512470625">Figure 2A</xref>) was made with a No. 11 blade over the skin weal and deepened through the deep fascia toward the region of pathological tissue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512470625">Figure 2B</xref> is a cadaveric representation of the technique to illustrate the direction and depth of the stab incision. The TX1 percutaneous ultrasonic needle (19-gauge) was inserted through the tract, and the location of the echogenic needle tip was confirmed with the ultrasound sensor. Under ultrasonic localization, the probe tip was directed into the hypoechoic lesion. At the intermediate frequency (soft tissue cutting and debridement) setting, microresection of pathological tissue was effected by intermittent activation of the device by stepping on the foot pedal.</p>

</fig>
<p>The echogenic needle delivered optimal ultrasonic energy at a specific frequency designed to microresect the targeted damaged tendon tissue. The tool and needle also provided irrigation and aspiration to effectively remove degenerated tissue. The single-use needle and instrument was maneuvered along the body of the hypoechoic tendon scar until it was completely resolved, resulting in a complete resection and removal of the hypoechoic scar tissue in the diseased tendon.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0363546512470625">
<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>After the echogenic needle was withdrawn, the stab incision was pressurized for approximately 2 minutes for hemostasis. It was then dressed with a Steri-Strip (Nexcare, 3M, St Paul, Minnesota) followed by a waterproof dressing. A Lastogrip compression stocking (Paul Hartmann AG, Heidenheim, Germany) was supplied for the first 2 days, and an ice pack was recommended for the first 3 to 7 days. These were intended to minimize swelling and improve patient comfort. Patients were also prescribed analgesia or NSAIDs to be taken when necessary for symptomatic relief.</p>
<p>Patients were instructed to perform routine, sedentary activities for the first week. They were then advised not to be too aggressive but allowed to increase activities as tolerated. Occupational therapy was only provided on an ad hoc basis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0363546512470625">
<title>Outcomes Assessment and Follow-up Visits</title>
<p>The follow-up visits were designed to document safety, tolerability, and early efficacy of the procedure. Those data included the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0363546512470625" list-type="bullet">

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>patient satisfaction indicators.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>All patients were required to return to the clinic at 1 week and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the percutaneous microresection procedure. During the visits, a single nurse coordinator collected the same information as captured at the baseline visit, namely vital signs, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and VAS and DASH scores, and noted any adverse events.</p>
<p>Postprocedural ultrasonography of the treated common extensor tendon was performed at the same visit at the 3- and 6-month follow-up by a single musculoskeletal radiologist (P.C.M.). All information from follow-up visits was captured in specific pages of a case report form and completed by the nurse or study coordinator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0363546512470625">
<title>Radiological Outcomes Assessment</title>
<p>Symptomatic chronic tennis elbow had been previously correlated with regions of hypervascularity and hypoechoicity in the common extensor tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512470625">27</xref></sup> In addition, the common extensor tendon was usually noted to have an increased thickness. Hence, these ultrasonographic parameters were used to objectively document the response of the common extensor tendon to the FAST technique by comparison of postprocedural ultrasound imaging at 3 and 6 months with baseline ultrasound parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0363546512470625">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive data, including measures of central tendencies and spread, were calculated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Repeated measures based on a general linear model were used to compare the significance in changes in the VAS, DASH-Compulsory, and DASH-Work scores over time. The DASH-Sport component was not reported, as very few patients responded to this section. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Patient Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 7 male and 13 female patients with a median age of 45.5 years (range, 33-65 years; standard deviation [SD], ±7.1 years) were recruited. The right upper limb was dominant in 19 patients. All patients underwent the procedure for lateral elbow epicondylalgia with 10 each in the left and right elbows.</p>
<p>Seventeen of 20 patients had repetitive strain injury (RSI). Four patients reported antecedent sporting injury (2 with concomitant RSI) and 3 had a history of trauma (2 with concomitant RSI). The median duration of symptoms before the trial procedure was 12.5 months (range, 4-48 months; SD, ±11.5 months). Fourteen patients had previous hydrocortisone and lidocaine injections (once in 9 patients and twice in 5 patients) an average of 10.0 months (range, 2-24 months; SD, ±6.8 months) before the current intervention, 2 patients had undergone acupuncture, while 1 patient had previous open tennis elbow release in 1998. The indications for the FAST technique included persistent subacute symptoms in 10 patients and recurrent symptoms in 10 patients.</p>
<p>The median baseline VAS score was 5.5 (range, 1-8; SD, ±1.9). The median compulsory DASH score was 21.7 (range, 5.0-73.2; SD, ±18.2), DASH-Work score was 25.0 (range, 0-75; SD, ±24.4), and DASH-Sport score was 56.3 (range, 50-100; SD, ±23.7).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The median duration for the sterile confirmatory ultrasound examination (phase 1) was 88.5 seconds (range, 39-211 seconds; SD, ±47.6 seconds), the median duration for the procedure itself (phase 2) was 10.1 minutes (range, 4.1-19.4 minutes; SD, ±3.7 minutes), and the median energy time (duration during which the TX1 device was activated) was 32.5 seconds (range, 18-58 seconds; SD, ±11.0 seconds). There were no procedure- or device-related adverse events.</p>

<sec id="section24-0363546512470625">
<title>Early Recovery (1 Week)</title>
<p>One patient reported disturbance of a single aspect of activities of daily living (difficulty in washing her face), and 2 patients reported minor sleep disturbance. The median VAS score was 3.3 (range, 0-8; SD, ±1.9). Seven patients did not require any analgesia, 11 patients required occasional NSAIDs, 1 patient took NSAIDs once a day for the first week, while another took the entire dosage prescribed because he thought he was required to do so.</p>
<p>Wound healing was uncomplicated. By the first week, 15 patients could have their wounds exposed, while 5 patients required only 1 further dressing. Only 1 patient reported oozing for the first 2 days, which then resolved. Three patients reported mild swelling over the treated region.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Treatment of chronic tendinopathy, including that involving the elbow, can be challenging when nonoperative measures fail. The various nonoperative treatment modalities that are currently employed serve to relieve pain, but it is unclear if they modify conditions for more optimal healing of the affected region, thus facilitating the body to effect its own healing process. With the failure of healing, surgery is often successful but requires operative resources and not insignificant morbidity for recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512470625">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512470625">24</xref></sup> Current surgical techniques, including percutaneous releases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512470625">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512470625">8</xref></sup> are unable to precisely target the pathological tissue, resulting in some unavoidable, inadvertent damage and scarring of surrounding healthy tissue. More aggressive and inappropriate releases have been documented to lead to iatrogenic complications such as elbow instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512470625">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recognition that the most common pathological alteration in chronic elbow tendinopathy is a localized region of angiofibroblastic degeneration usually involving the extensor carpi radialis brevis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512470625">12</xref></sup> has led Nirschl and Pettrone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512470625">17</xref></sup> to describe a specific surgical technique that emphasizes complete and accurate excision of the identifiable abnormal granulation tissue. Excellent short-term results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512470625">17</xref></sup> with long-term durability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512470625">5</xref></sup> have been reported.</p>
<p>Recent documentations of tendinopathy on ultrasound and MRI have helped in identifying the lesion more specifically. However, in a therapeutic setting, MRI is impractical. Ultrasonography, on the other hand, with its capability to be portable and performed in an office-based setting, is more applicable and cost-effective for therapeutic purposes. Ultrasonography has a low diagnostic specificity but high sensitivity for elbow tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512470625">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, certain ultrasonographic features such as hypervascularity, hypoechoicity, and occasional calcifications have been correlated with symptomatic tennis elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512470625">29</xref></sup> These make ultrasound a useful device for localizing and targeting the pathological regions of the common extensor tendon for more precise debridement. The literature has reported varying success with ultrasound-guided needle microtenotomy for tennis elbow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512470625">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512470625">30</xref></sup> but current techniques of needle tenotomy vary, are difficult to validate, and can be very operator dependent.</p>
<p>The FAST technique can be likened to a minimally invasive evolution of the Nirschl technique for treating recalcitrant lateral epicondylitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512470625">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512470625">17</xref></sup> The current technology has mechanistic similarities to phacoemulsification for cataract surgery and appears to be effective to tenotomize the diseased tendon by a cavitation effect. While new to the musculoskeletal system, the technique has a proven track record and has revolutionized the management of cataracts worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512470625">19</xref></sup> The capability to target the lesion in real time makes the FAST technique more precise compared with conventional surgical techniques that are still based on gross appearance. Needle microtenotomy is largely predicated on the differential friability of tendinotic tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512470625">2</xref></sup> but is known to be operator dependent. It is thought that the TX1 device, with its specifically designed microtool providing precise ultrasonic frequency, can more reliably microresect and remove only the diseased tissue without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>While most invasive procedures for tennis elbow can be performed in an ambulatory setting under regional blocks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512470625">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512470625">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512470625">23</xref></sup> there are few reports of percutaneous tenotomy performed in an office-based setting under local anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512470625">24</xref></sup> Our current experience supports the performance of this technique in either an office-based or ambulatory surgical setting. The overall median duration of about 90 seconds for confirmatory ultrasound and 10 minutes for the actual procedure makes it feasible for an outpatient setting. Furthermore, there was no procedure or device complication, and all patients tolerated the procedure very well. It is noteworthy that these patients were a select cohort who had failed nonoperative therapy with a very similar median age to procedures reported by Siddiqui et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512470625">21</xref></sup> and other reported series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512470625">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512470625">18</xref></sup> Hence, converting the indications for an operative procedure requiring the need for general or regional anesthetic support to an outpatient, minimally invasive technique requiring only a local anesthetic minimizes surgical risks and the need for operative resources, with potentially huge benefits for the patient and the health care institution.</p>
<p>The tolerability and safety of the technique were further evident in the early recovery of our patients. There was no wound complication, and all the stab incisions were fully healed or healing within the first week after the procedure. Only 1 patient reported swelling for a day. Eighteen of the 20 patients required no or occasional analgesia for symptomatic relief, and only 1 patient reported some disturbance in a single activity of daily living within the first week. The VAS pain score did not show any reactive increase in pain. Arthroscopic release of the extensor carpi radialis brevis has been reported to be very well tolerated, but patients still required a mean of 4.8 weeks to return to regular activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512470625">14</xref></sup> The rapid postprocedural recovery of the FAST technique makes it a very attractive alternative to surgery, which has a more protracted recovery period.</p>
<p>Few articles document the early recovery phase after invasive procedures for elbow tendinopathy, hence making it difficult to compare the recovery rates for different procedures. Marked pain relief is reported an average of 8 to 9 weeks after percutaneous release of the common extensor origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512470625">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512470625">8</xref></sup> Our patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the VAS pain score as early as 1 week after intervention. It would be premature to comment on actual efficacy at such an early stage, but this could indicate the rapidity of recovery consistent with a minimally invasive procedure, not only in the skin incision but in terms of the underlying soft tissue as well.</p>
<p>Rapid pain relief has also translated into functional improvement in terms of a statistically significant improvement in the DASH-Compulsory and DASH-Work scores by 1 month. Although the improvement in the DASH-Compulsory and DASH-Work scores was not significant between 1 to 3 months, the drop in VAS scores between this period reached significance, implying patients were able to maintain a particular activity level with less discomfort to the involved elbow. Statistically significant improvement in VAS scores continued to be evident between 3, 6, and 12 months. Further functional improvement has also been shown in the DASH-Compulsory score between 3 and 6 months, indicating early efficacy of the technique. The sustainability of the DASH-Compulsory and DASH-Work scores by 1 year is encouraging, although longer follow-up would still be required to see if this effect is sustained.</p>
<p>While clinicians have specific performance indicators for the therapeutic procedures they perform, it is also important to gauge the success of a new therapeutic modality from a patient’s viewpoint. Nineteen of 20 patients indicated a positive response to this procedure. The only patient who was neutral actually improved in her symptoms (VAS score) but tended to elicit discomfort when she carried heavy loads of groceries, an activity that was not encouraged during the rehabilitative phase.</p>
<p>A willingness to recommend the procedure is a further indication of the patient’s confidence in the safety and effectiveness of this option. In this respect, 16 patients would recommend the procedure, and 4 patients actually inquired about the applicability of this procedure to their contralateral elbows or other anatomic regions. Of the 3 who were unsure, 1 patient had pulling discomfort on heavy manual labor but achieved a significant drop in DASH scores at 12 months. Another attributed the symptomatic improvement to activity modification after the procedure but actually underwent the same procedure to his contralateral elbow in August 2012. The last patient, being non-English speaking, needed translation and had some difficulties expressing her subjective viewpoints.</p>
<p>The nature of the healing response after microresection has not yet been defined. Previous studies have documented sonographic reduction in vascularity within 2 weeks of corticosteroid injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512470625">25</xref></sup> and also after ultrasound-guided percutaneous tenotomy for tennis elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512470625">30</xref></sup> Ultrasonographic assessment in our patients did demonstrate visible responses in the common extensor tendon in terms of reduced tendon thickness (13 patients), decreased vascularity (14 patients), and size of the hypoechoic lesion (14 patients) by 3 months. The latter especially may correspond to the minimum healing time required for collagen synthesis of approximately 100 days. Improvement in all 3 sonographic features was documented in more patients by 6 months, illustrating an expected variability in tissue response. It is notable that by 6 months, there was no rebound increase in the hypoechoic lesion, indicative of the sustainability of the cavitation effect of the TX1 device. The increase in tendon thickness documented in 5 patients at 3 months, 4 of which had resolved by 6 months, could be hypothesized to represent a low-grade inflammatory response consistent with reactivation of the early phases of soft tissue healing.</p>
<sec id="section36-0363546512470625">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>It is well recognized that elbow tendinopathy is a self-limiting condition and can also be subject to placebo effects of perceived therapeutic procedures. While we have taken efforts to recruit patients with a sufficient duration of nonoperative management comparable with other series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512470625">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512470625">24</xref></sup> the true effects of the device can only be reliably proven with a single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. Longer follow-up is also required to determine the sustained efficacy of the procedure.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The FAST technique with an ultrasonic probe provides a safe and well-tolerated alternative for treating recalcitrant elbow tendinopathy in an office setting. Our experience documents early efficacy and sonographically documented positive soft tissue responses sustained and progressively improving for up to 12 months. Overall, 19 of 20 patients realized some measure of improvement in their symptoms after this intervention at 12 months’ surveillance. This response, if sustained on longer follow-up, could potentially justify early, definitive intervention in recalcitrant elbow tendinopathy.</p>
