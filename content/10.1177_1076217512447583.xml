The book begins with an overview of theoretical foundations/conception of giftedness, giving the reader a good underpinning of knowledge regarding gifted students. The topics of special populations within gifted education, developmental issues, and relationships are just a few of the important issues that are covered in this resource that is sure to inform the reader of unique characteristics and challenges of gifted students. Sections devoted to school-related matters and counseling needs/interventions for gifted students will be particularly useful for professionals.

<p>Collaboration and communication are words often used to describe skills students must acquire to be successful in life; however, Dr. Wendy Murawski and Dr. Sally Spencer believe these skills must be practiced among professionals and parents in the educational setting as well. <italic>Collaborate, Communicate, Differentiate!</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-4129-8184-2) addresses the importance of adults working together to accomplish the goal of providing the best education for all students and is written in a way that is both entertaining and easy to read. The authors explain that collaboration is imperative not only when planning appropriate educational experiences but also when assessing student learning and monitoring student achievement. Benefits and pitfalls of collaborative teaching, or coteaching, are examined in-depth. The authors stress the idea that when effective collaboration and communication occur, differentiation of curriculum to meet the needs of individual students can be more easily realized. This resource is organized so that each chapter addresses a particular issue that can stand alone or be integrated with topics included in other chapters. Short quotations from experienced professionals are included at the beginning of each chapter, helping to focus the reader on the content.

<p>Gifted and talented students do not fit a cookie cutter mold, and a cookie cutter model should not be used to identify and serve diverse students in the educational setting. In this resource, <italic>Identifying and Serving Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Gifted Students</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-59363-844-3), Dr. Lezley Collier Lewis, Annie Rivera, and Debbie Roby give professionals the tools necessary to provide educational experiences that effectively address the needs and characteristics of children with cultural and linguistic differences. In each chapter, the authors state the purpose of speaking to the particular topic and provide a list of standards and terms to help the reader gain knowledge and skills. Authors challenge readers to examine their beliefs about culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) children to provide the best possible education for these students. New approaches to curriculum, delivering instruction, professional development, and self-assessment allow professionals to realign their practices to best fit the needs of CLD students. Ideas for involving families and communities in the educational experiences of CLD children guide school personnel in gleaning support for helping students perform at their highest potential. A model to evaluate existing programs guides professionals in their quest to continuously adjust and improve services for students. For more information, contact Prufrock Press, Inc., P.O.

<p>It can be difficult to help your gifted child when you, and sometimes they, do not quite understand what is wrong to begin with. Dr. Nancy N. Heilbronner felt the same frustration as she tried to guide and support all three of her gifted and talented children. Now that her children are grown, she has decided to share research-based strategies and ideas to help other parents support their gifted children in her book, <italic>10 Things Not to Say to Your Gifted Child: One Family’s Perspective</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-935067-03-0). Dr. Heilbronner uses personal family stories, including her own mistakes in parenting, to help give insight into some of the most difficult aspects of parenting gifted children. She also includes her children’s perspective at the end of each chapter, bringing in the important points of view of gifted children. Each chapter focuses on the social-emotional or academic struggle gifted and talented children often face. In no particular order, Dr. Heilbronner counts down the 10 things not to say to your gifted child. For more information, contact Great Potential Press, Inc., P.O.

<p>It may seem as though writing comes as naturally as breathing for famous authors, and that great writing for the average person is an arduous task, but that does not always have to be the case. Author Victoria Hanley gives teens who aspire to be the next best-selling author advice on how to create full-bodied works in <italic>Seize the Story: A Handbook for Teens Who Like to Write</italic> (ISBN: 978-1-877673-81-8). Chapters in this book focus on a variety of writing skills, including character development, setting, and point of view. Readers are guided step-by-step on how to improve their writing by creating believable dialogue and page-turning plots. Each aspect is thoroughly explained and supported with multiple examples from well-known fictional works, making it easy for the reader to transfer new knowledge to their own stories. To further extend the readers’ understanding, writing exercises are provided in each chapter, encouraging extra practice for perfecting skills. Hanley addresses common errors made by novice writers as well as ways to avoid errors when creating a story. Interviews with established authors are shared, allowing for different perspectives to the writing process and providing even more expert advice.
