<p>Stories of sex crimes regularly, though variably, arouse intense condemnation across American society. A cursory look at the news often displays horrifying reports of sex crime, from the dramatic, high-profile trial of Jerry Sandusky to the routine, everyday stories of rape and sex trafficking. Although these events are all too common in contemporary social life, how American public policy has responded to the social problem of sex crime has shifted dramatically over the past century. In <italic>Sex Fiends, Perverts, and Pedophiles: Understanding Sex Crime Policy in America</italic>, Chrysanthi S. Leon presents a rich and complex narrative about the relationship between discourse, expert knowledge, and policy practices. She grounds her analysis using a wide array of data, including archival, interview, participant observation, and quantitative data. Leon reveals how sex criminals have been constructed by the public, experts, politicians, and the varied policy practices that have led to increased surveillance and incarceration of sex criminals over the century.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the book traces the shifting discourses that have constructed the varying images of the sex criminal over the twentieth century. As Leon persuasively demonstrates, analyzing the interaction between discourse and policy over the century illustrates “the long progression from multiple ways of talking about sex offenders to a simplified, totalizing narrative” (p. 9). The narrowing of sex crime talk has had important implications for the development of policy. Leon parses this out by identifying three eras of discourse, each with differing images of the sexual offender.</p>
<p>In the first era, roughly bounded between 1930 and 1955, Leon argues that the criminal justice system largely relegated the sex criminal as a “nuisance”—someone who aroused fierce rhetoric but not enough ultimately to increase incarceration rates. Leon argues that the gap between discourse and punishment was largely the result of “the insulation of decision makers and experts from public pressure” as well as a general “devaluing the victimization of women and children” (pp. 52–53), something that would radically change with the rise of second wave feminism and the anti-rape movement in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1980, discourse and policy practices went from identifying the criminal as a nuisance to one who was constructed by experts as treatable. During this era, the criminal justice system entered an era of rehabilitation, not just related to sexual offenders but for all criminals. The rehabilitative era marked the age of expert discretion in punishment outcomes. However, Leon forcefully shows that decisions to track offenders into treatment rather than punishment did not uniformly occur across all offenders or crimes. In her exceptional case study of implementation in California, Leon shows how offenders were differentiated “based on factors independent of mental health considerations.” Indeed, “those offenders who seemed most like ‘useful citizens’ were diverted from prison, while those who had less in common with the decision makers and whose offenses seemed more ‘harmful’ were sent to prison” (p. 78). Rehabilitative talk and practice expanded the range of punishment outcomes for sex offenders, but this was a short-lived experiment.</p>
<p>Notions about the treatability of criminals gave way to the “containment era,” which marks the contemporary period of expansive social control practices, including increased incarceration and surveillance practices, such as residency restrictions and registration requirements. In her analysis of national imprisonment rates on sex offenses since the early 1970s, Leon finds that there has been a dramatic increase in incarceration of non-rape sex offending, and more importantly, that the explosion in imprisonment does not correspond with increases in victimization or arrest rates. Consequently, the shift to tough punishment practices and rhetoric have had important “chilling effects” on the ability for alternative discourses to enter policy debates—most importantly, that of rehabilitative treatment. As Leon argues, “by the containment era the experts are rarely heard challenging the dominant monster construction” (p. 144). Thus, negative constructions of sex offenders have become thoroughly institutionalized, leaving few avenues for advocates who support reform or alternative constructions of sex offenders.</p>
<p>Leon argues that incarceration trends for sex offending have less to do about sex than we might think. Instead, incarceration trends are largely structured by the overall expansion in general prison incarceration rates. Her quantitative analysis shows a simple linear relationship between mass incarceration trends and sex crime incarceration, explaining as much as 92 percent of the overall variation in rates. Thus, as Leon argues, “we should abandon one of the underlying assumptions about sexual criminality…the assumption that sex crime is unique and that therefore punishment strategies and patterns of punishment should be different for sex offenders than they are for other criminal offenders” (p. 169). It is here where Leon makes her theoretical argument most clear. Departing from popular, scholarly accounts oriented on the “moral panic,” Leon instead offers us a more complex account of the multiple and interacting factors driving contemporary punishment practices around sex crime, including the narrowing constructions of sexual deviance, shifting systems of knowledge and expertise, the role of discretionary power, and the rise of victims’ rights advocates.</p>
<p>Leon concludes with a normative discussion of the implications for sex crime policy in the wake of expanded social control, arguing against the current “one size fits all” approach to punishment. The current policy of undifferentiated punishment does more harm than good—single, minor offenses are treated on par with violent offenders, following the individual for life. The institutionalization of the “monster” image and the muting of alternative discourse based on expertise and scientific knowledge have created resistant barriers for reform.</p>
<p>Overall, Leon provides a fascinating analysis focused on shifting discursive logics and their relationship to the punishment practices of sex crime policy over the twentieth century. The narrative account coupled with Leon’s strong argument against “moral panic” should appeal to scholars interested in the substantive topic of sex crime. However, the analysis is largely under-theorized, potentially limiting its overall appeal to a broader, sociological audience. This is not to suggest that the book lacks theory; indeed, there are numerous points throughout the book that give a nod to disparate theoretical traditions. For instance, Leon harkens to Durkheim’s functionalist theory about deviance and the construction of symbolic boundaries, Bourdieu’s concepts of “field” and “doxa,” unfortunately relegated to a methodological appendix, and of course, the concept of moral panic. But these traditions hardly appear to be the driving force behind the empirical analysis nor does Leon come back to broader, theoretical implications.</p>
<p>Concerning the contestation between discourses, Leon does a great job talking about the rise and fall of various constructions, but more emphasis could have been placed on the discursive battles between various stakeholders, especially among the various social movements that mobilized to institutionalize the “monster” image of the sex offender during the 1970s and 1980s. Nonetheless, the book is a stimulating analysis of the intersection between discourse, policy practices, and crime. A worthwhile read for scholars interested in similar topics.</p>
