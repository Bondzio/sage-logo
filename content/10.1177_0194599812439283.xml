<body>
<p>Minimally invasive, remote access, and robotic thyroidectomy techniques have been described for more than a decade. The minimally invasive video-assisted approach described by Miccoli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812439283">1</xref></sup> has been the most widely embraced minimal access surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812439283">2</xref></sup> and has been adopted by a number of high-volume centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439283">3</xref></sup> Although dissection is reduced, the recovery is improved, and the incision is small, patients still must accept a visible cervical neck incision. For patients who are particularly opposed to a neck scar, remote access techniques have been proposed.</p>
<p>The most widely practiced remote access thyroidectomy technique uses a transaxillary portal. Ikeda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812439283">4</xref></sup> originally described this approach, although it required insufflation and was tedious to undertake. Woong Youn Chung in Korea further refined this approach by developing a specialized retractor that allowed a gasless resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439283">5</xref></sup> In 2009, the procedure became even more accessible by the introduction of robotic technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439283">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The robotic axillary thyroidectomy (RAT) was eventually performed in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812439283">7</xref></sup> and we were among a number of centers in North America that have pursued this approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439283">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439283"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439283">10</xref></sup> While we were able to accomplish this surgery without experiencing any complications at our institution, a number of challenges with the technique emerged, including injury to the brachial plexus, perforation of the esophagus, and injury to the carotid artery and/or internal jugular vein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439283">11</xref></sup> These prompted us to explore a hybrid approach to robotic thyroidectomy that uses as its access port a modified facelift incision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812439283">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812439283">13</xref></sup> This technique integrates the use of a postauricular approach to the neck (which was originally described by Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812439283">14</xref></sup>), a modified facelift incision, the concept of a fixed retractor system as described by Chung, and the use of the surgical robot. We sought to compare and contrast these 2 techniques based on our early experience with both approaches. There are a number of fundamental anatomic differences that account for substantial differences in the ease of the procedure and the complication profiles.</p>

<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<p>Permission was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (Human Assurance Committee Protocol 04-06-403) to assess outcomes contained in a prospectively maintained patient database. A panel of demographic and clinical parameters was captured in a consecutive series of patients undergoing 1 of 2 robotic thyroidectomy techniques (RAT or robotic facelift thyroidectomy [RFT]). The patients in the RFT group were a small subset of a larger single-procedure experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812439283">13</xref></sup> Particular attention was paid to time of surgery, ease of dissection, complications, pathology, the use of drains, and the length of hospital stay. The RAT cases were performed between June 2009 and September 2009. The RFT procedures took place between July 2010 and October 2010.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812439283">
<title>Robotic Axillary Thyroidectomy Technique</title>
<p>The technique used to accomplish the RAT has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439283">8</xref></sup> but is summarized briefly here. The patient is placed in a supine position with the ipsilateral arm padded and positioned over the head to rotate the clavicle out of the way and to shorten the distance between the axilla and the thyroid compartment. The patient is intubated with a laryngeal EMG tube (Nerve Integrity Monitor; Medtronic Inc, Jacksonville, Florida) to provide continuous passive nerve monitoring during the procedure.</p>
<p>A previously marked 6- to 8-cm axillary incision is made, and a surgical pocket is created by dissecting immediately ventral to the pectoralis muscle until the clavicle is reached. Just past the clavicle, the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are identified, and dissection continues in the seam between these muscle bellies. The strap muscles are identified and reflected anteriorly and medially exposing the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>A presternal incision is made adjacent to the curve of the breast, and blunt dissection is used to reach the previously exposed thyroid compartment. An 8-mm robotic trocar is placed through this incision.</p>
<p>A fixed retractor system is introduced (a modified blade associated with the Marina Medical retractor system, which was adopted from the Chung retractor). The robotic surgical system (daVinci Si, Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, California) is then deployed. Four arms are used: 3 through the axillary incision (consisting of a 30° down dual-channel endoscope, a Maryland grasper, and a Harmonic device [ACE36p, Ethicon Endosurgery Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio]) and through the presternal port is placed a Pro-Grasp forceps.</p>
<p>The thyroid is removed robotically by first ligating the upper pedicle using the Harmonic device. Attention is directed inferiorly where the middle thyroid vein is ligated. The inferior pole is mobilized, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve is identified and dissected. The remaining attachments of the thyroid to the trachea are divided using the Harmonic device, and the ligament of Berry is divided with the nerve under direct vision. The isthmus is transected, and the thyroid gland is retrieved. An active drain is placed, and the patient is hospitalized overnight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812439283">
<title>Robotic Facelift Thyroidectomy Technique</title>
<p>The patient is positioned supine on the operating table with the head turned slightly away from the side of the surgery. Intubation is accomplished with a laryngeal EMG tube. In a previously marked modified facelift location, which begins in the postauricular crease and extends into the occipital hairline, the incision is made and carried down to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This muscle is skeletonized, with care taken to preserve the greater auricular nerve and the external jugular vein. The omohyoid muscle is identified and retracted ventrally, exposing the posterior strap muscles and the thyroid gland. The strap muscles are dissected anteriorly and medially, and a fixed retractor system (see above) is placed.</p>
<p>The robotic system is deployed, and 3 arms are used: a 30° down dual-channel endoscope, Maryland forceps, and a Harmonic device. The thyroid is removed robotically by first transecting the upper pedicle using the Harmonic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812439283"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The superior laryngeal nerve is visualized and protected, and the superior parathyroid gland is mobilized posterosuperiorly. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is then identified just proximal to its entrance into the larynx under the inferior constrictor muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812439283"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). With the nerve under direct vision, the ligament of Berry is divided, the middle thyroid vein is ligated with the Harmonic device, and the inferior pole is fully mobilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812439283"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>), with care taken to dissect the inferior parathyroid gland away from the thyroid. The thyroid gland is dissected free of the trachea, the isthmus is divided, and the thyroid specimen is removed. Surgicel is placed in the thyroid bed. No drain is used. The patient is managed on an outpatient basis.</p>

<title>Surgeon and Patient Selection Criteria</title>
<p>Robotic credentialing was obtained and included systematic preclinical and clinical training and exposure (experimental experience with the robotic da Vinci surgical system, certified console and assistant surgeon dry laboratory training, wet laboratory training composed of both animal and cadaver robotic dissections, visiting observational preceptorship in Korea for robotic axillary thyroidectomy procedures, cadaveric simulation of robotic facelift thyroidectomy).</p>
<p>Patients were offered robotic thyroidectomy if they expressed a concern regarding the cosmetic outcome of their surgery. The purely cosmetic benefits of robotic surgery were emphasized. Those who opted for robotic thyroidectomy and who satisfied the following criteria were offered a remote access approach (by either a transaxillary or facelift approach): anticipated benign pathology, not morbidly obese (body mass index less than 40), absence of substantial medical comorbidities, no previous neck surgery, normal laryngeal function on preoperative laryngoscopy, ability to understand surgical options and provide informed consent, and acceptance of the possible need for conversion to open surgery. Absolute contraindications to remote access surgery included substernal extension, presence of lymphadenopathy, or extrathyroidal extension of malignancy.</p>

<p>The operative times were compared between the robotic axillary thyroidectomy (RAT) and the robotic facelift thyroidectomy (RFT). The times were considered in incremental segments (time to develop the surgical pocket, time to deploy the robot, and the robotic console time).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several different remote access thyroidectomy techniques, with or without the use of a robotic system, have been described. Most of these require very extensive dissection and the use of insufflation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812439283">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812439283">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812439283">16</xref></sup> Chung and his colleagues made substantial contributions to the ease of remote access surgery by describing a gasless technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439283">5</xref></sup> and then the application of robotic technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439283">6</xref></sup> Despite the enormous success of this procedure in Asian countries, its application in North American individuals has posed serious challenges, including arm paralysis, excessive blood loss, retained thyroid tissue, and esophageal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439283">11</xref></sup> The disparity in the clinical outcomes may relate to the substantial differences in the size of the patients and the size of their thyroid disease. The mean tumor size of patients undergoing surgery for papillary cancer in the Korean group was less than 1 cm, a size below the threshold for even undergoing a needle biopsy in the United States.</p>
<p>We recently developed a novel remote access robotic thyroidectomy technique, undertook several experimental studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812439283">12</xref></sup> and implemented it in a consecutive patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812439283">13</xref></sup> We herein described the first direct comparison between the RFT technique and the RAT technique. While many of the differences between these procedures are qualitative and favor the RFT, we have been able to demonstrate that in a North American population, a postauricular approach is easier to perform (as indicated by the learning curve associated with the procedure). Ease of surgery, familiarity with anatomic dissection planes, and surgeon comfort level all favored RFT.</p>
<p>Important additional advantages include the ability to accomplish this procedure without the use of a drain and on an outpatient basis. Therefore, it is not necessary to compromise on the tremendous progress that has been made in the past decade in the management of patients with surgical thyroid conditions. Other advantages are the complete elimination of the possibility of brachial plexus injury and avoidance of chest wall numbness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812439283">17</xref></sup> Brachial plexus injury or postoperative arm paralysis have been reported in most large RAT series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439283">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439283">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439283">10</xref></sup> While these reportedly occurred early in these experiences (with the likelihood of paralysis reduced by careful arm positioning in latter cases), the risk remains. Because this positioning is not needed in RFT (since the clavicle is not being traversed), this complication is not associated with the facelift approach. Another potential advantage with RFT is that the recurrent laryngeal nerve is identified in a superior to inferior direction, which has been shown to be better not only in avoiding injury to the nerve but also to the parathyroid glands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812439283">18</xref></sup> Thyroid and head and neck surgeons may find the transcervical RFT technique represents a more familiar approach to the thyroid compartment with natural planes of dissection.</p>
<p>The complications reported in our series are favorable when compared with the experiences reported by others. Specifically, we encountered no incidences of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, no brachial plexus injuries (in either our RAT or RFT patients), and no cases of hemorrhage. Beyond the brachial plexus injuries, the Chung group reported a 1% incidence of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, 2 hematomas, and a case of Horner syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439283">6</xref></sup> while the Perrier group reported a 0% incidence of nerve injury and an 8% incidence of hematoma requiring wound reopening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439283">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>One disadvantage of the RFT technique is the transient numbness patients experience in the area innervated by the great auricular nerve (similar to parotid surgery). While this complication is not associated with the axillary approach, patients undergoing RAT often experience prolonged paresthesia in the anterior chest wall region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812439283">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, Chung and his colleagues have also reported a high rate (24%) of chronic pain lasting more than 3 months among their patients undergoing robotic axillary thyroidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812439283">19</xref></sup> These potential complications should be shared with all patients undergoing these procedures.</p>
<p>It is important to underscore that the primary benefit of robotic thyroidectomy, whether RFT or RAT, is the complete elimination of a cervical incision. As this is a cosmetic concern, the principal motivation for development of these techniques is to provide patient-centered care. These procedures are likely to be sought out by only a limited patient population in whom a cervical incision is not well tolerated. These may include patients with a history of keloid formation and patients who prefer to avoid a neck scar that is obvious to the casual observer.</p>
<p>Limitations of the current study include the fact that while the patients were treated in a consecutive fashion, it was a nonrandomized approach. Since the RAT cases were performed first, it is possible that these procedures provided experience with robotic thyroidectomy that led to shorter surgical times in the RFT patients. Furthermore, during the development of the RFT, several procedures were performed in a cadaver model, which may have improved the operative efficiency once clinical implementation was undertaken. It should be noted, however, that prior to the RAT cases, the primary surgeon was skilled in the use of the robot and had significant robotic experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812439283">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812439283">21</xref></sup> Therefore, we believe that the improved times from the RAT to the RFT cases reflect technical differences between the procedures and not merely cumulative surgeon experience. It is more likely that the familiarity of head and neck and endocrine surgeons with the anatomy of the lateral neck compared with axillary and chest wall anatomy would facilitate adoption of the RFT approach compared with RAT.</p>
<p>Further experience with the RFT technique is necessary before considering this a standard approach. There remain a number of issues that must be considered with RFT or any robotic approach, including the ability to perform a total thyroidectomy, appropriateness in the setting of cancer, and the issue of cost. Nevertheless, the findings presented suggest that a facelift robotic approach is at least as safe and technically feasible as a transaxillary procedure. Further study would therefore appear to be justified, and with larger experience, additional benefits and limitations of these techniques may be determined.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this first direct comparison of 2 robotic thyroidectomy techniques, in the early experience and in a small series of patients, a more rapid learning curve (reflected by shorter operative times) was observed with RFT compared with RAT. Furthermore, the vast majority of patients could be managed as outpatients, which represents one of several apparent advantages. Further study would appear to be justified, and with larger experience, additional benefits and limitations of these techniques may be determined.</p>
