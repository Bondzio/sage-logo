<abstract>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that, over the course of the Neolithic period, settlements in the Yangtze coastal plain gradually moved seawards and concentrated to the east of Lake Taihu, probably responding to the effects of sea-level change during the middle to late Holocene. To test this hypothesis, sediment cores adjacent to six Neolithic settlement sites across the study area were collected and analyzed for pollen and other microfossils. These records reveal details of the environmental conditions before, during and after the Neolithic occupation at each site. Results show that a freshwater marsh environment became established before each human occupation and persisted throughout and after it. There is no evidence at any site of a sudden or drastic change in environmental conditions towards the end of human settlement. After <italic>c</italic>. 7000 cal. yr BP the study area had become a wetland enclosed by Chenier ridges on the east (the southern shore of the Yangtze) and the south (the northern shore of Hangzhou Bay).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The coastal wetland of eastern China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1A</xref>) is a centre of early agricultural development. Collection, consumption and possible domestication of wild rice as early as 9000-10 000 cal. yr BP were documented from Shangshan (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611414933">Jiang and Liu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611414933">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), an upland settlement site some 90 km south of the head of Hangzhou Bay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1B</xref>). Firm evidence of early cultivation at Kuahuqiao <italic>c</italic>. 7700 cal. yr BP was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611414933">Jiang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611414933">Shu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2007</xref>), and the cultivation took place in a sheltered, coastal wetland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1B</xref>). This period of cultivation was short-lived as sea level rose at around 7500 cal. yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611414933">Bird et al., 2007</xref>), and marine inundation forced the Kuahuqiao community to abandon the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611414933">Innes et al., 2009</xref>). Rice agriculture then emerged at Hemudu (e.g. Jiang, 2003), Tianluoshan (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611414933">Atahan et al., 2008</xref>) and the Taihu area (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), i.e. south and north of Hangzhou Bay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequently, the process of rice domestication was accelerated in these wetland areas (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611414933">Fuller et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611414933">2009</xref>), which enabled the expansion of rice-based agricultural production and wealth accumulation in the coastal region, leading to the emergence of an early stratified society (e.g. the Liangzhu Culture) about 5000 cal. yr ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611414933">Song, 2002</xref>). Cultural developments similar to the above are also seen in the middle reach of the Yangtze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611414933">Crawford and Shen, 1998</xref>) and the lower reach of the Yellow River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611414933">Lu, 2007</xref>). These cultural developments are thought to have been facilitated by the warm climate from the end of the Pleistocene to the middle Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611414933">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611414933">Lu, 2007</xref>). Certainly the warm monsoon climate during the early Holocene was suitable for growing rice in these temperate regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611414933">Innes et al., 2009</xref>). But more importantly, the rising sea level of the early Holocene (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683611414933">Zong, 2004</xref>) had transformed the coastal area into a marsh-type wetland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611414933">Stanley and Chen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">2011</xref>) which allowed wild rice to flourish and to be domesticated and cultivated during the middle and late Holocene.</p>

<p>Upon examination of the spatial distribution of the Neolithic settlements, a pattern emerged: the Majiabang settlements scattered across the Taihu area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2a</xref>), followed by a period of increased number of settlements during the Songze Culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2b</xref>); apart from those settlements around the head of Hangzhou Bay, a large number of Liangzhu settlements concentrated in the area between the Taihu Lake and the Chenier ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2c</xref>), and this distributional pattern continued into the Maqiao Culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2d</xref>). This pattern of settlement development took place when the relative sea level of the coastal area rose slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2e</xref>). Furthermore, Neolithic cultural development was interrupted around <italic>c</italic>. 4200 cal. yr BP, and the stratified Liangzhu Culture was succeeded by culturally more primitive communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611414933">Song, 2002</xref>) before the agriculture in the region was redeveloped during the Bronze age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611414933">Atahan et al., 2008</xref>). This cultural change was thought to be a result of sea-level fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611414933">Stanley and Chen, 1996</xref>), climatic cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611414933">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683611414933">Wu and Liu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683611414933">Yasuda et al., 2004</xref>), or social and political causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611414933">Song, 2002</xref>). While sea-level and climatic change are possibly important factors in shaping the history of the Neolithic agricultural societies in these low-lying environments, the resourceful Neolithic communities certainly had the ability to identify suitable locations for their settlements and take advantage of various natural resources the environment offered.</p>

<caption><p>The locations of known Neolithic settlement sites of the Taihu area: (a) Majiabang culture, (b) Songze culture, (c) Liangzhu culture, (d) Maqiao culture. The distributions show a long-term migratory trend from west to east resulting in a high concentration of sites on the plain east of Lake Taihu in the Liangzhu period. Fewer sites, situated on localized areas of higher elevation and particularly near the Chenier ridge barrier, characterize the Maqiao culture. Shorelines in this period moved eastward from their establishment on the line of the Chenier ridges <italic>c</italic>. 7000 years ago (short dash line) to about 3000 years ago (long dash line). This process has continued until the creation of the modern shoreline.

</fig>
<p>As the habitable base of most Neolithic settlements was very close to mean sea level, sea-level change was thought to be a controlling factor for such migration, despite the lack of supporting sedimentary evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we conducted the present research which aims to collect high-quality palaeoenvironmental data from a number of Neolithic settlement sites. Here we present the results of pollen and non-pollen microfossil analyses of the sediment sequences obtained from six settlement sites across the east Taihu area, and discuss the possible influence of environmental conditions upon the movement of Neolithic settlements in the study area. This research is in conjunction with two separate studies: one on reconstructing the postglacial environmental history of the Yangtze delta area based on pollen, diatom and foraminiferal evidence from different sediment cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2011</xref>) and the other on the monsoon climate history of the region based on pollen analysis.</p>

<title>The east Taihu lowland</title>
<p>The area of the current investigation lies between the Taihu Lake and the Yangtze deltaic plain. At present, the area is low-lying, surrounded by slightly higher ground, i.e. the upland-fluvial landscape on the north, the Chenier ridges on the east, the beaches /tidal flats that are under macro-tides of Hangzhou Bay on the south and upland mountains on the west (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">C</xref>). During the last glacial, the area appeared as a flat terrace on the southern side of the palaeo-Yangtze valley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611414933">Li et al., 2000</xref>). During the early Holocene, sea level rose rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2e</xref>) and the sea inundated the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611414933">Tao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2011</xref>). A large amount of sediment from the Yangtze has filled the accommodation space created by the rise in sea level. Sedimentation along the southern flank of the Yangtze estuary helped the development of the Chenier ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611414933">Chen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611414933">Hong, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683611414933">Yan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683611414933">Zhao, 1987</xref>), a series of linear-shaped, wave-built sandy ridges with shells or gravel. During the same time, tidal flat sediments were deposited along the northern shore of Hangzhou Bay forming ridges first and then beaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 1990</xref>). As a result, the east Taihu area became a wetland environment sheltered by ridges from the sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611414933">Stanley and Chen, 1996</xref>). As sea level rose continuously at a much reduced rate throughout the middle Holocene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2e</xref>), deltaic sedimentation of the Yangtze and tidal flat sedimentation of Hangzhou Bay kept up with the pace of the rise in sea level. The east Taihu area was turned into a low-salinity lacustrine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611414933">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2011</xref>). Rice cultivation was carried out in small enclosures until the Iron Age and, particularly since the Tang Dynasty (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611414933">Tan, 1973</xref>), local people started to construct drainage networks and sea walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611414933">Chen and Zong, 1999</xref>), as well as reclaiming tidal mudflats of the Yangtze estuary, pushing the shoreline further eastwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611414933">Chen and Zong, 1998</xref>). By this time, the east Taihu area became a fully freshwater environment.</p>

<title>The Neolithic</title>
<p>Over the past decades, many archaeological sites have been found in the Taihu area, and these excavations have revealed some valuable information on the lifestyle and the state of economy of the Neolithic communities, as well as advancements in cultural and societal development. According to archaeological studies, the Neolithic history of the study area can be divided into five stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611414933">Table 1</xref>). After the final period of rapid sea-level rise around 7000 cal. yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611414933">Bird et al., 2010</xref>), people spread onto the Taihu lowland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2a</xref>) where they collected their food through hunting, gathering and fishing and made red sandy pottery, which is called the Majiabang culture. The stone tools found from this cultural period are mainly for hunting, fishing and cutting (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611414933">Jiangsu Museum, 1963</xref>). By about 6000 cal. yr BP, freshwater wetland conditions were established in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2011</xref>), and a more prosperous society was established, the Songze culture, as reflected in the rapid progress made in rice domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611414933">Fuller et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611414933">2009</xref>). During this period, people started using stone tools for cultivation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611414933">Sun, 1998</xref>), but the majority of tools for this period were still those for hunting, fishing and cutting (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611414933">Suzhou Museum, 1990</xref>). Between 5200 and 4200 cal. yr BP, the scattered communities evolved into a stratified society, the Liangzhu culture, as they established an improved production system through management of paddy fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611414933">Cao et al., 2006</xref>). They made black clay pottery and jade wares, produced many more tools for cultivation, and exercised religious rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611414933">Committee for Preservation of Artifact Management of Shanghai (CPAM), 2000</xref>). During the latter part of this period, the Liangzhu culture declined, and the reasons for such a decline are still unclear. The short period between 4200 and 3900 cal. yr BP saw little cultural development and was considered as a gap in the cultural history of the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Recent study, however, revealed that a small community came from the Huai River catchment (north of the Yangtze) and settled in Guangfulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611414933">Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611414933">Shanghai Museum, 2008</xref>). After 3900 cal. yr BP, the east Taihu area was reoccupied by people from the surrounding areas, the Maqiao culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2d</xref>), but the level of agricultural activity undertaken by this late Neolithic (also called Terminal Neolithic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611414933">Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007b</xref>) community was particularly low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611414933">Shanghai Museum, 2008</xref>). Rice cultivation in the area took off again when cultural influence from north of the Yangtze came to the region during the early Bronze Age, resulting in the establishment of the Wu and Yue states about 2700 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611414933">Song, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>At each settlement site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1C</xref>), a hand corer was used to recover sediment samples, and the lithological characteristics of each core were recorded during coring. Sediment subsamples were taken at 2.5 cm or 5.0 cm intervals and wrapped in sample bags for temporary storage and transportation. In the laboratory, the sediment samples were kept in a fridge at about 4Â°C.</p>
<p>For pollen analysis, sediment samples were prepared using standard laboratory techniques, including alkali digestion, sieving at 180 Âµm, hydrofluoric acid digestion and acetolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611414933">Moore et al., 1991</xref>), and were stained before mounting on microscope slides. Pollen grains were identified using standard reference keys and type slides and were counted using a stereomicroscope at magnification of Ã400, using Ã600 oil immersion lenses for identification of critical features. Exotic <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spores were added in known volume as a marker before proceeding, allowing for the calculation of palynomorph concentrations. Standard reference sources were used for identification of pollen grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683611414933">Wang et al., 1995</xref>) and pteridophyte spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683611414933">Zhang et al., 1990</xref>). A minimum sum of 200 land pollen grains was counted at each sampled level, as well as all the aquatic pollen, pteridophyte and bryophyte spores observed while attaining that sum. In pollen diagrams, tree pollen counts are presented as evergreen (mainly <italic>Castanopsis</italic> and <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic>), warm temperate (mainly <italic>Quercus, Alnus, Ulmus</italic>, Moraceae and <italic>Salix</italic>) and cool temperate (mainly Cupressaceae, <italic>Pinus</italic> and Urticaceae) groups. Saltmarsh pollen includes Chenopodiaceae and Compositae (<italic>Youngia</italic>), whilst disturbed ground weeds are represented by Compositae, Cruciferae, <italic>Plantago, Polygonum, Ranunculus</italic> and <italic>Rumex</italic>. Aquatic pollen is dominated by <italic>Typha</italic>. Zone 2 of each pollen diagram is defined based on microfossil evidence of human activity.</p>
<p>Non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), mainly comprising fungal spores and remains of algae and invertebrates, were also recorded with at least 100 identified on the pollen slides at each counted level, and often significantly more. Taxonomic identification of NPPs was achieved where possible, but otherwise they were identified to van Geelâs catalogue of provisional Type numbers held at the Hugo de Vries Laboratory, University of Amsterdam using the illustrations and descriptions published in several papers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611414933">van Geel, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683611414933">1986</xref>, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683611414933">van Geel and Aptroot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611414933">van Geel et al., 2003</xref>). The NPP frequencies are shown as percentages of the total land pollen sum and grouped to represent open freshwater, freshwater marsh, reedswamp and estuarine environments as well as cultural activity. These groupings are based upon taxaâs habitats and ecologies where these are known. Although some NPPs inevitably could occur in more than one environment, particularly in the case of the aquatic types, they are assigned to that group of taxa with which they seem to have most affinity with the environment in which they have been recorded most often. Although the origins of some of the NPPs are not known, their ecology can be deduced from their associations with other taxa, NPPs and local pollen types, for which ecological preferences are known. Examination of the previous published literature on these unidentified microfossils, confirming this studyâs results, show that most of them generally occur when algal and other aquatic taxa are present, and so are likely to live in the same aquatic environments. The grouped assemblages of aquatic NPPs can therefore be used to identify different hydrological communities and depositional environments, such as reedswamp, sedge-fen and open water, and so reconstruct changes in water depth and quality. On the diagrams, such groupings combine the percentages of several taxa within the same life form (pollen, NPP, etc.), and which have the same ecology, into composite conspectus curves. Combined with curves for individual taxa, these summaries show the overall character of the ecosystem community, and ecological and environmental changes, much more clearly than the separate presentation of values for all individual taxa. The taxa that comprise the summary curves are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683611414933">Table 2</xref>. All original data are available from the authors.</p>

<title>Longnan village</title>
<p>The Longnan site is located on a flat landscape, about 10 km from the southeast corner of the Taihu Lake. The site was extensively excavated in 1988-1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611414933">Suzhou Museum, 1990</xref>). At the site three Neolithic cultural layers were identified beneath a layer of paddy soil, and the dominantly clayey sediments associated with the cultural layers change from blackish grey to yellowish grey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). The lower cultural layer contains mainly black pottery which bears characteristics of the Songze Culture. There are many wild animal bones and tools for hunting, fishing and cutting. From this layer, a piece of wood was dated to 5530 cal. yr BP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611414933">Table 4</xref>), thus the layer was considered as middle Songze. The middle cultural layer contains also black pottery with some animal bones and plant seeds. There are hunting and fishing tools as well as one stone tool for cultivation. Two charcoal samples from this layer were dated to 5260 and 5400 cal. yr BP, respectively, suggesting a late Songze age. In the upper cultural layer, there are a large number of plant seeds including rice and fruits, as well as bone tools for household use and stone tools for hunting and cultivation. Through two charcoal samples, this layer was dated to 4810 cal. yr BP, and thus belongs to early Liangzhu. The sediment sequence of this site was independently dated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683611414933">Xiao (1991)</xref> at three depths, and the results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611414933">Table 4</xref>) complement the chronology established by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611414933">Suzhou Museum (1990)</xref>.

<p>In core LN, the sediment changes little in particle size, but significant changes in organic and other contents are observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref>). Below 1.20 m, changes from greenish-grey clay to brownish peat/peaty clay, and then to greenish-grey clay suggest a marshy-swamp environment with varying amount of organic matter. Between 1.20 m and 0.75 m, the blackish-grey clay is associated with the high microcharcoal counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figure 3a</xref>). Pollen zone LN-1 is dominated by grasses with some disturbed ground weeds and low counts of microcharcoal. Zone LN-2 shows high counts of microcharcoal, together with some large Poaceae grains, high frequencies of disturbed ground weeds, cultural NPPs, i.e. clear evidence of human activity. Above 0.75 m, the sediment changes back to greenish-grey clay. Within this layer, microcharcoal frequency declines; large Poaceae disappears, despite disturbed ground weeds and cultural NPPs remaining high. Other microfossils, including sedges, other freshwater herbs, open freshwater NPPs, freshwater marsh NPPs and reedswamp NPPs, change only a little between these zones. It is noted that low, but consistent numbers of saltmarsh pollen appear throughout the sedimentary sequences. The sediment and microfossil records show, therefore, a change from a natural marshy-swamp environment (below 1.20 m) to an environment disturbed by humans, and a change back to a more natural, marshy-swamp environment after the occupants left the site (above 0.75 m).</p>

<p>The lithostratigraphy from Core LN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref>) matches well with the sedimentary records of the site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). The layer of blackish-grey clay at 0.75-1.20 m depth in core LN can be related to the Neolithic cultural layers of the Longnan site. The peaty clay at the base was dated to 7410 cal. yr BP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611414933">Table 4</xref>). The two samples we sent for dating failed to provide reasonable ages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0959683611414933">Table 6</xref>), possibly because of contamination from young carbon occurring during sampling. However, based on the chronology established for the sedimentary sequences of the site (i.e. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611414933">Table 4</xref>), we tentatively assign 4810 and 5530 cal. yr BP to the blackish-grey clay of Core LN. Furthermore, the pollen data from the blackish-grey clay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figure 3a</xref>) indicates a sharp decline of evergreen trees, characteristic of east China during the middle Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683611414933">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683611414933">Yi et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Yuanjiadi village</title>
<p>The Yuanjiadi site is flat and about 2 km north of the Longnan site. This site was briefly excavated in 1958-1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611414933">Jiangsu Museum, 1963</xref>). Two Neolithic cultural layers were discovered from the yellowish grey clay and blackish grey clay respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). In the lower cultural layer, some red sandy pottery fragments were found in addition to bone and stone tools for hunting, fishing and cutting. There is no sign of agriculture in this layer. The sandy pottery was considered as pre-Liangzhu and possibly pre-Songze in age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611414933">Jiangsu Museum, 1963</xref>). The upper cultural layer contains mainly black clay pottery, typical of early Liangzhu. The emergence of stone tools for cultivation in this layer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611414933">Table 1</xref>) suggests the development of agriculture at the site. For the current study, we drilled a core in a paddy field next to the excavated area.</p>
<p>The lithostratigraphy from core YJD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref>) is similar to that of the Longnan site. A layer of greenish-grey clay (2.10-2.20 m) is overlain by a layer of peaty clay (1.80-2.10 m). The sediment between 1.80 m and 0.70 m from core YJD shows changes from greenish-grey clay to blackish-grey clay, and then back to greenish-grey clay. Within the blackish-grey clay (0.90-1.05 m, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figure 3b</xref>), some large Poaceae, disturbed ground weed pollen, cultural NPPs and high frequencies of microcharcoal are recorded. This cultural sequence (zone YJD-2) is also associated with high numbers of aquatic pollen, mainly <italic>Typha</italic> spp., suggesting that <italic>Typha</italic> stands were also harvested at the site (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611414933">Innes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2007</xref>). Throughout the three pollen zones, grasses increase, with sedges and other freshwater herbs, NPPs of open freshwater, freshwater marsh and reedswamp types change little. All this suggests that the site was under marshy-swamp conditions before and after a phase of human disturbance. Again, low numbers of saltmarsh pollen appear in most samples analyzed.</p>
<p>The peaty clay layer at 1.80-2.10 m is possibly related to the lower culture layer. The blackish-grey clay at 0.90-1.05 m can be correlated with the upper cultural layer, the early Liangzhu culture. A sample from the base of the blackish-grey clay is dated to 6380 cal. yr BP and confirms that the ages of the sedimentary sequences below the blackish-grey clay are much older than Liangzhu. The greenish-grey clay at 0.70-0.90 m and certainly the yellowish-grey clay above 0.70 m are younger than Liangzhu, according to the date, 3870 cal. yr BP, at 0.70 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figure 3b</xref>). Around 1.00 m, evergreen tree pollen declines sharply, also suggesting a middle Holocene period (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683611414933">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683611414933">Yi et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0959683611414933">
<title>Tianyilu</title>
<p>Tianyilu is a site cleared for construction of a new factory on a flat landscape. We were invited to collect sediment samples for analysis because interesting sedimentary sequences were reported to the Shanghai Museum. Close to this location are a number of known Neolithic archaeological sites including Siqian (500 m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611414933">Sun, 1998</xref>), Songze (6 km; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611414933">CPAM of Shanghai, 1998</xref>), Qianbucun (7 km; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611414933">Huang and Zhang, 1982</xref>), Qingpu (5 km; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611414933">Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007b</xref>) and a man-made mound for burial and ritual activities, Fuchuanshan (5 km, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611414933">CPAM, 2000</xref>). At Tianyilu, we took a sediment core from a vegetable field which was later occupied by a factory building.</p>
<p>At this site a layer of blackish-grey soft silt and clay is found overlaying greenish-grey soft silt and clay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref>). On top of the blackish-grey layer is brownish-grey, firm silt and clay with plentiful herbaceous roots. The base of the blackish clay is dated to 4030 cal. yr BP, whilst the top of this layer, 2410 cal. yr BP, suggests a Neolithic cultural period later than the Liangzhu or similar to the âTerminal Neolithicâ recorded in Qingpu and Guangfulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611414933">Atahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611414933">Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611414933">b</xref>). From core TYL, both evergreen and warm temperate trees declined from 1.80 m upwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611414933">Figure 4</xref>), whilst cool temperate trees increased relatively from 1.40 m upwards, suggesting the sedimentary sequences were laid down during a period of climate cooling of the middle to late Holocene.</p>

<p>The phase of human activity (zones TYL-1 and TYL-2) recorded in the core shows high frequencies of aquatic pollen (mainly <italic>Typha</italic> spp.), microcharcoal, cultural NPPs, but little large Poaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611414933">Figure 4</xref>). Throughout zones TYL-1 to TYL-3, grasses dominate the pollen diagram, whilst sedges and other freshwater herbs fluctuate a little. After the human occupation, the site returned to a grass-dominated marsh environment, i.e. the brownish-grey clay with herbaceous roots between 1.60 and 1.20 m. Above 1.20 m (TYL-4), high frequencies of disturbed ground weeds occur, suggesting human activity in the historical time. Saltmarsh pollen increases a little towards 0.70 m.</p>

<sec id="section10-0959683611414933">
<title>Guoyuancun</title>
<p>Guoyuancun was discovered <italic>c</italic>. 40 m south of a small mound which is about 5 m in height. This settlement site was excavated in 1973 when a main road was constructed through the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611414933">Huang and Zhang, 1982</xref>). Black clayey pottery and stone tools for hunting, cutting and cultivation were recovered, and these cultural remains were found with a large amount of ash associated with a layer of blackish grey clay which lies between greenish grey clay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). We drilled a sediment core in a grassed area 10 m from the mound and 20 m from the excavated area.</p>
<p>The lithostratigraphy recorded from the sediment core (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref>) matches well with the one from the excavated site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). The blackish-grey clay from 0.80 to 1.10 m is thought to be related to the Neolithic cultural layer. Two dates (3800 and 3720 cal. yr BP, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0959683611414933">Table 6</xref>) from this layer suggest the sequence belongs to the last stage of the Neolithic. Although these dates are in sequence, their calibrated ranges overlap considerably. Unless very rapid sediment accumulation occurred, the dates should probably be regarded as providing a single age estimate. Nevertheless, the blackish-grey clay was deposited during a period of climate cooling as suggested by the decline of evergreen trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611414933">Figure 5</xref>). A significant change appears around 1.10 m where a peak of cool temperate tree pollen (mainly Urticaceae) is recorded. This may suggest a sharp change in the climate conditions around 3800 cal. yr BP.</p>

<p>Throughout the three pollen zones, the herb community consists of grasses and sedges with low and consistent numbers of saltmarsh and other freshwater herbs, suggesting a dominantly freshwater marsh environment. Apart from the aquatic vegetation and the disturbed ground weeds, there is no significant change between pollen zones. Non-pollen microfossils reveal the same pattern, i.e. no significant change in the frequencies of open freshwater, freshwater marsh and reedswamp NPPs throughout the three zones. Human activity is indicated by microcharcoal, cultural NPPs and disturbed ground weeds in GYC-2 and GYC-3. It is noted that only a few grains of rice pollen are found from this site which is located close to the former coast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1C</xref>). After the phase of human activity, the site returned to a marshy environment as suggested by the brownish-grey clay with plentiful herbaceous roots and the high frequencies of grass pollen in zone GYC-3.</p>

<title>Caoxieshan</title>
<p>Caoxieshan is burial site, similar to Fuchuanshan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611414933">CPAM, 2000</xref>), and is located at the northern side of a soil mound of 15 m in height. This site was extensively excavated in 1972-1973 after a couple of jade items were found by local people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611414933">Nanjing Museum, 1980</xref>). On the northern hill slope, a large number of Neolithic tombs were recovered, and there are multiple sediment sequences that contain cultural remains, including those of the Majiabang, Songze, Liangzhu and Wu-Yue cultures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). We took a sediment core on the paddy field <italic>c</italic>. 50 m from the mound.</p>
<p>In the sediment sequences examined, a layer of hard clay is found at the base of the core, above which a layer of blackish grey clay lies between two layers of greenish grey clay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref>). The lithostratigraphy revealed by the core is not comparable with that of the burial site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>). The blackish clay contains fragments of charcoal, and the samples from the base and the top of the blackish clay are dated respectively to 4740 and 3130 cal. yr BP. Throughout the sediment sequences, both evergreen and warm temperate trees decline, whilst cool temperate trees increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">Figure 6a</xref>).</p>

<p>According to rice pollen, disturbed ground weeds, cultural NPPs and microcharcoal evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">Figure 6a</xref>), human activity is recorded from the blackish-grey clay between 0.52 m and 0.77 m and dated to 4740-3130 cal. yr BP (zone CX-2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">Figure 6a</xref>). Disturbed ground weeds, low levels of cultural NPPs and microcharcoal remained after this phase of human activity (zone CX-3). Throughout the three pollen zones, the herb community and marsh-swamp NPPs change little in frequency. Together with the lithostratigraphy, it suggests a stable, dominantly freshwater marsh-swamp environment before and after human activity. Again, at this site saltmarsh pollen appears consistently in low numbers.</p>

<sec id="section12-0959683611414933">
<title>Chuodun</title>
<p>Chuodun is also a soil mound, 6 m in height, and was excavated in 1981-1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611414933">Nanjing Museum, 1984</xref>). From the mound, layers of sediment occur containing pottery and stone tools ranging from the Majiabang culture, through the Songze and Liangzhu, to the Wu and Yue cultures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611414933">Table 3</xref>), but remains of the Wu-Yue and late Liangzhu are most abundant. East of the soil mound, ancient paddy fields were discovered and dated to the Neolithic period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611414933">Cao et al., 2006</xref>). We obtained a sediment core from a paddy field, <italic>c</italic>. 30 m south of the soil mound.</p>
<p>The lithostratigraphy recorded from Chuodun (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0959683611414933">Table 6</xref>) is similar to Caoxieshan, but again it is difficult to correlate the lithostratigraphy of this core with that of the burial site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611414933">Table 4</xref>). Human activity is revealed in zones CD-2 and CD-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">Figure 6b</xref>) according to the appearance of large Poaceae, disturbed ground weeds, cultural NPPs and microcharcoal. Throughout the three pollen zones, the frequencies of grasses, sedges and reedswamp NPPs change little, indicating a stable marsh environment. However, aquatic pollen and open freshwater NPPs are almost absent between 0.95 m and 1.20 m, yet saltmarsh pollen appear significantly in these horizons, suggesting the site was possibly well drained during low tides. Before the human activity, the site was a natural marsh-swamp as the greenish-grey clay and the associated grass pollen and marsh-swamp NPPs indicate. After the human activity, the site returned to a marsh-swamp environment as the greenish-grey clay at 0.50-0.95 m implies. The period of human activity is dated to 3390 cal. yr BP at 1.20 m and 1960 cal. yr BP at 0.92 m, a period from the end of the Neolithic right through the Wu and Yue cultures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611414933">Table 1</xref>), which saw warm temperate trees declining whilst cool temperate trees increased.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>According to the pollen and NPP microfossil results from the lower sedimentary sequences (the greenish-grey clay beneath the blackish-grey clay, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">6</xref>), dominantly freshwater marsh-swamp conditions were established prior to human occupations at each of the six sites investigated. Grasses, sedges and other freshwater herbs can be seen at these sites, with marshes and shallow ponds scattered around as suggested by the occurrence of open freshwater NPPs. These conditions were created soon after relative sea level in the region stabilized in the early mid-Holocene, during which the east Taihu area became enclosed by the newly developed Chenier ridges along the Yangtze coast and beach ridges along the Hangzhou Bay coast, and have been confirmed by diatom analyses at other sites across the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2011</xref>). The lithostratigraphic units shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0959683611414933">Table 5</xref> are all organic-rich clay and mud typical of deposition within waterlogged and fully aquatic freshwater environments, with the lower sediments in particular diagnostic of marsh-swamp habitats. These marshy wetlands formed as a result of the major deceleration in the rate of sea-level rise that occurred from about 7000 cal. BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2e</xref>) that allowed the Chenier ridges to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611414933">Chen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683611414933">Yan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683611414933">Zong, 2004</xref>). After 7000 cal. BP sea level continued to rise, but very slowly. As the Yangtze River adjusted to this much more stable high sea level, the gradient of its estuarine channel and rate of flow was greatly reduced and its delta formed. This encouraged fluvial input of freshwater into the Taihu lowlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611414933">Hong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683611414933">Sun et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611414933">Yang et al., 1987</xref>) which, coupled with the elevation of groundwater-tables there that also resulted from the rising sea level, caused soil paludification, surface waterlogging and the creation of palustrine marsh and reedswamp freshwater systems, including most of Taihu Lake itself. After <italic>c</italic>. 7000 cal. BP the rate of sediment accumulation in these coastal freshwater marshlands kept pace with the slowly rising sea level so that, also protected by the Chenier ridges, they were not directly transgressed by marine water, although their proximity to the sea gave them a mildly saline character. These eutrophic marshland habitats would have been extremely rich in food resources and attractive to early Neolithic forager-cultivators who could combine hunting and food gathering with cultivation of rice. This could account for the initial trend in the early Neolithic of eastward movement from the uplands west of the coastal plain to the coastal lowlands around Lake Taihu and the increasing settlement density there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">b</xref>).</p>
<p>At all of our six analyzed settlement sites human activity took place during the middle and late Holocene, a period which saw evergreen trees decline and cool temperate trees increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">6</xref>), suggesting a gradual climate cooling throughout the Neolithic period. Evidence of such long-term climate cooling can also be found in pollen and stalagmite records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414933">Figure 2f</xref>) from the middle to lower Yangtze (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683611414933">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683611414933">Xu et al., 1996</xref>), with several phases of more rapid and intense cooling. As our results show, in the middle sedimentary sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">6</xref>) human activity at these sites generally involved the use of fire (microcharcoal) and disturbance to the natural vegetation (disturbed ground weeds and cultural NPPs), together with rice cultivation (Poaceae pollen larger than 40 Âµm). However, there are variations between the sites. In most cases, high microcharcoal was confined to the period of the human activity, whereas disturbed ground weeds sometimes remained even after the settlement sites (such as Longnan and Caoxieshan) were abandoned. It is notable that the frequency of rice pollen is low in all six sites, being most common at Chuodun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">Figure 6b</xref>). Such low abundance of rice pollen has also been reported from major sites in the area such as Qingpu and Guangfulin (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611414933">Atahan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611414933">Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611414933">Qin et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that we did not core within any former rice paddy fields, which have been limited in size and number. Alternatively, the consistent, although low, salinity conditions as indicated by the persistent saltmarsh pollen throughout the sedimentary sequences at each site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414933">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611414933">6</xref>) suggest that the hydrological conditions during most of the Neolithic period may have restricted any great expansion of rice agriculture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683611414933">Zeng and Shannon, 2000</xref>) except during the zenith of the later Neolithic Liangzhu culture when settlement concentrations east of Lake Taihu were very great.</p>
<p>We suggest that the hydrological regime during the Neolithic was the key environmental influence on the cultural history of the coastal plain between the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay, as indicated by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611414933">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2011</xref>). Environmental changes will not have controlled Neolithic economic and settlement history in this area entirely, as purely cultural factors are always important in influencing social organization and development, and human communities are capable of resisting even strong environmental pressure for change. Water availability and quality were tremendously important for Neolithic agrarian societies, however, particularly those of the Yangtze Delta area where wet rice cultivation formed the increasingly critical agricultural component of the diet. The vulnerability of domesticated rice to higher water salinities in contrast to the much more tolerant wild rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611414933">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683611414933">Zeng and Shannon, 2000</xref>), made the viability of intensive Neolithic rice farming in the coastal plain subject to the vagaries of local sea-level change and coastal evolution. Our microfossil results from the sedimentary sequences at each site, however, indicate that the dominantly freshwater marsh conditions were largely unchanged before these sites were occupied and after they were abandoned. There is no evidence for any sudden or significant change in water salinity or other landscape conditions at the end of human occupation at each site. Certainly there is no evidence to suggest the settlement site abandonment was due to marine flooding and the ingress of brackish water. To explain the apparent eastward movement in settlement location during the Neolithic requires further study. First, the slowly evolving environment across the east Taihu area may be responsible for such seawards migration. As the inland area changed gradually to lacustrine and swamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1C</xref>), the slightly higher areas to seaward became more suitable for rice agriculture as they were better drained through daily tidal variation. Second, the newly emerged marsh and mudflats behind the Chenier ridges provided other resources such as shell fish, mammals (wild boar and deer) and migratory birds (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683611414933">Yuan et al., 2008</xref>), all of which could be found from well drained marsh and mudflat habitats. If the rice production was restricted because of salinity conditions, these resources would have been highly important to the Neolithic community. By the later Neolithic, when the Liangzhu culture flourished east of Lake Taihu, with intensive rice agriculture, any previous restrictions on cultivation due to slightly saline environments had clearly ceased to apply, with entirely freshwater conditions dominant. The collapse of Neolithic agricultural systems at the end of the Liangzhu, and then the use of higher ground to the east by Maqiao and Guangfulin settlers, occurred under continued freshwater conditions with no direct marine influence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has highlighted the value of combining pollen and microcharcoal data with non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683611414933">van Geel, 2006</xref>). The habitat of the fungal and algal organisms that produce the NPP microfossils is generally very local and site-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611414933">Ingold, 1971</xref>), avoiding the taphonomic questions that affect pollen and microcharcoal assemblages which will have had a much wider source area. NPPs will reflect conditions near the site itself, both natural and anthropogenic, and so give a much higher spatial resolution record of local environmental history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683611414933">van Geel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683611414933">van Geel and Aptroot, 2006</xref>). While becoming more widely employed in Europe and North America, NPP research has been little used in China, and our results in this and previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611414933">Innes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683611414933">Zong et al., 2007</xref>) suggest that the technique has a valuable contribution to make in this region. In combination, the various classes of biological data presented in this paper provide a spatially integrated record of environmental conditions and change throughout the middle and late Holocene.</p>
<p>At each settlement site, freshwater marsh conditions were established as the study area became enclosed by ridges and beaches which provided protection to the area from marine inundation. Such freshwater marsh-swamp conditions allowed rice to flourish, be domesticated and farmed. However, such shallow, aquatic environments were connected to the sea through several tidal outlets, i.e. freshwater was drained during low tides and saline water entered the study area during high tides which supported small amounts of saltmarsh growing in the area. After the period of human occupation the environmental conditions at each site remained unchanged as freshwater marsh-swamp, although disturbed ground weeds stayed at some sites. There is no evidence for any sudden change in environmental conditions that might suggest that the abandonment of the settlement sites was due to a drastic environmental change associated with sea-level or coastal evolution.</p>
<p>The freshwater marsh-swamp conditions were firstly established in the inland locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414933">Figure 1C</xref>) during the Majiabang-Songze cultures. Subsequently, at the time of the Liangzhu culture, such freshwater marsh-swamp conditions became available in the transitional locations. By the time of the Guangfulin and Maqiao cultures, freshwater marsh emerged in the seawards locations. Therefore, in the context of Neolithic agricultural development in the east Taihu area of the lower Yangtze, environmental factors were important only to the extent that the freshwater marsh-swamp conditions were generated, suitable for rice cultivation. The environment across the east Taihu area has evolved slowly during the middle and late Holocene, and it was human preferences that decided settlement choice, abandonment and migration as the Neolithic communities searched for locations which were better for their food generation (through rice farming) and collection (through hunting and fishing). In other words, their decisions were probably not based solely on changes in the environmental conditions, but also on factors related to food resources.</p>
