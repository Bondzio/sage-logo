            <p>Pediatric obesity and nutrition-related problems continue to be problematic around the world. The purpose of the current qualitative study was to learn more about the barriers low-income, minority families face to healthy living and where they turn for health-related information. Five focus groups were conducted using open-ended standardized questions. Standardized transcript analysis and coding techniques were used to arrive at five saturated themes. The project was conducted in partnership with a community based Early/Head Start agency. Adult parents of preschool children were invited to participate. Results indicate that low-income minority families face many barriers to eating healthily: while families do eat some healthy foods, they also eat many unhealthy foods; they rely primarily on family members for their nutrition information; they have some desire to change their own health habits (but generally not those of their children); and they have inadequate nutritional knowledge. Options for better reaching this population with important health information are discussed.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The prevalence of pediatric obesity in the United States is increasing so rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512446715">Strauss and Pollack, 2001</xref>) that it is termed a public health epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512446715">Strauss, 2002</xref>). National data indicate that 31 percent of children under the age of 18 are overweight, and 17 percent are obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512446715">Ogden et al., 2010</xref>). Children who are obese are likely to maintain their weight status and become adults who are obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493512446715">Whitaker et al., 1997</xref>). However, even if they lose weight and become normal weight adults, these individuals are likely to have health concerns in adulthood directly due to their obesity in childhood.</p>
         <p>Certain subgroups of the US pediatric population are more likely to be affected by obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512446715">Ogden et al., 2006</xref>). Among children in the US, 33 percent of Non-Hispanic whites are overweight and 16 percent obese. However, for Non-Hispanic blacks, 35 percent are overweight and 20 percent obese, as are 37 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of Mexican Americans. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been implicated as a key predictor of pediatric obesity. A recent comprehensive literature review indicates a strong inverse relationship between SES and childhood obesity, suggesting that children with lower SES tend to have significantly higher rates of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512446715">Shrewsbury and Wardle, 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>There are certain groups in the United States that are affected by many of these risk factors simultaneously, thus making them especially prone to overweight and obesity. Head Start is an early education program that serves high-risk low SES families, many of whom are racial and ethnic minorities. Data indicate up to 32 percent of US Head Start students in urban settings are obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512446715">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). Additional data indicate this may be due in part to negative parental mealtime practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512446715">Gable and Lutz, 2001</xref>), poor diet quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512446715">Hoerr et al., 2008</xref>), and a high degree of child control of food choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512446715">Hoerr et al., 2005</xref>). There has been one qualitative study of the Head Start parents’, teachers’ and caretakers’ perceptions of the causes of overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512446715">Thompson and Story, 2003</xref>) but no qualitative investigation of the healthy behaviors among these families and the specific barriers they face. Although this type of information has been sought with other groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512446715">Attree, 2005</xref> for a review) information specifically from a low-income urban Head Start population could be helpful in designing interventions to improve healthful eating and therefore decrease obesity among this very high risk preschool population. Focus groups have the potential to provide rich, qualitative data about these issues which can serve as an important starting point for local community intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512446715">Horwitz et al., 2008</xref>). Focus group studies have been completed with parents of older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512446715">Slusser et al., 2011</xref>) and suggest that parents of low-income elementary school children report many barriers to eating healthfully. Although these results are informative, preschool parents likely face different barriers than elementary parents.</p>
         <p>The objective of the current study was twofold: to learn more about the dietary barriers, namely those related to obesity, that low-income, racial/ethnic minority parents face, and, secondly, where they currently turn for nutrition-related information.</p>

            <title>Participants</title>
            <p>Parents of children participating in a university-affiliated comprehensive child development and family support program (Head Start and Early Head Start) were asked to participate in the current study. The community-based program provides low income primarily minority families with in home direct services and with supplemental services through partnerships with other local service agencies. Five focus groups were conducted with parental participants of this program. Subjects from these groups were recruited by service agency staff during regularly scheduled clinical activities. All recruitment staff had received the required Human Subjects Training and the study was approved by the relevant Institutional Review Board. Individuals were excluded if they did not speak Spanish or English, or if someone from their family had attended a previous focus group. Research personnel arranged focus groups at times convenient to participants.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section4-1367493512446715">
            <title>Procedure</title>
            <p>Prior to the start of each focus group, participants were greeted by their focus group moderator or assistant moderator and given an authorization form to sign giving permission to be audiotaped. Then, a standardized, pre-approved consent paragraph was read to the group and consent was given verbally. Focus groups were facilitated by a trained moderator and trained assistant. Groups were audiotaped for transcription purposes.</p>
            <p>Focus groups followed a semi-structured format, based on 12 grand tour questions, with follow-up questions as needed determined by the moderator. Questions were derived based upon the authors’ previous experience with pediatric obesity research and clinical work, and modified based upon input from the staff at the community service agency. Specifically, questions were designed to be conversational, clear, to elicit responses from participants, and to allow sufficient time for complete responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512446715">Fern, 2001</xref>). Focus groups lasted anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes depending upon the number of participants and individual responsiveness. Participants were not paid for their time, but did receive child care during the groups.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section5-1367493512446715">
            <title>Data analysis</title>
            <p>Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service familiar with focus group transcription. Two research assistants who did not participate in the focus groups as well as the assistant focus group moderator read through the transcripts and designated an initial set of topic areas inductively. They then met with an experienced qualitative analyst and developed a code book for use in formal coding. Using this code book, the two research assistants and the assistant focus group moderator coded the transcripts deductively and derived preliminary themes. All coded transcripts were given to the outside analyst who cross-checked the codes for discrepancies. As is typical, inter-coder reliability was measured by cross-checking approximately 10 percent of all codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512446715">Kazdin, 2011</xref>). Few differences in coding were found qualitatively; therefore, no quantitative assessment was conducted. The outside analyst compiled all coded transcripts and preliminary themes into a series of themes and then met with team members to ensure consensus among members about the meaning of the data, not just the codes themselves. The team discussed the themes and reached consensus without further discrepancies.</p>

      <sec id="section6-1367493512446715">
         <title>Results</title>
         <p>Over a three-week period, five focus groups were conducted with two to five participants each. The sample was composed of 16 females and two males, who averaged 21.7 years of age (SD = 5.59). The sample’s self-identified ethnic group status was: 10 African American, six Hispanic, and two identified as other. Two focus groups were conducted in Spanish and three in English. Socio-economic information was not collected, but the community program does not serve individuals who earn more than 130 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. Regarding educational level, overall data for the community program indicate 13 percent of parents had some schooling but did not reach high school, 33 percent attended some high school but did not graduate, 48 percent graduated high school, 2 percent had vocational certificates, and 4 percent had college degrees.</p>

            <title>Focus group results</title>
            <p>Five saturated themes emerged from the data, with additional unsaturated themes noted for further study. All themes surrounded the central concept that parents are in need of accurate nutrition information and assistance with making healthy choices for themselves and their families. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512446715">Table 1</xref> for a list of themes and supporting quotes.</p>

               <italic>Theme #2: Family members were the most important and influential sources of support for diet and exercise behaviors. </italic>The majority of parents described members of their immediate and extended family, including parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, among others, as their most important sources of support and health information. Family members generally provided assistance with childcare, nutrition, exercise, and social support. The mothers often turned to their own mothers for guidance. Additional sources of support included significant others and close friends; the university affiliated comprehensive child development and family support program; and local and federal agencies such as WIC, the Family Conservancy, and the local Health Department.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Theme #3: Participants reported a desire to make changes in their diet, exercise, or weight, but most did not feel they needed to make changes in their children</italic>. Parents generally sought to change their own physical appearance, especially their weight, the types of foods they consumed, and to increase their physical activity levels. In addition, parents reported they did not feel such changes in their child’s weight, diet, or physical activity were necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Theme #4: Participants revealed a lack of general knowledge about nutrition, exercise, and healthy lifestyle</italic>. Consistent with this, participants reported their greatest need for support was tangible assistance with choosing, shopping for, cooking, and planning healthy meals. Parents’ responses suggested they felt their knowledge regarding healthy diet and physical activity was lacking. Some participants revealed general misconceptions about food categories and what constitutes healthy dietary consumption. Additionally, several parents described uncertainty regarding effective exercise techniques, as well as how to incorporate exercise into their routine.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Theme #5: Participants reported several common barriers including not wanting to deny themselves their preferred foods, dislike of exercise, lack of time for shopping and planning meals, feeling tired, and the cost of healthy food</italic>. Many parents reported difficulty moderating their consumption of favored foods, as well as a dislike of exercise or being too tired to engage in physical activity. Participants indicated that lack of time and financial resources were barriers to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Other participants expressed frustration that their time to shop for groceries was limited, which contributed to their challenges in buying healthy foods. Financial resources also precluded parents’ ability to purchase healthy food, which was embodied by one mother’s assertion that ‘I wanna do it right, but … I can’t afford it’.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Data from the current study describe many nutrition-related issues that low-income minority families face that may be directly relevant to their higher rates of pediatric obesity. First, our data indicate that parents do report that they and their children enjoy eating some healthy foods, but they also report eating a wide variety of unhealthy foods. These findings are substantiated by previous research which indicates Head Start mothers consumed 4.6 to 2.7 cups of fruit and vegetables per day, yet also exceeded 35 percent of their total kilocalories from fat, and 25 percent of their kilocalories from added sugars – two indicators of unhealthy eating that are associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512446715">Hoerr et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>The second theme from the current study suggests that parents get the majority of their nutrition information from family members, not from physicians, WIC providers, or other potential sources of information who are likely to be better informed than their own family members. Previous research with an older, elementary-school low-income population of parents suggests they turn to the media as the primary source of nutrition-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512446715">Slusser et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that parents are not turning to well informed health care providers with whom they already work is concerning in that it makes intervention difficult. After all, if a parent reports that they rely on their own family members or the media for nutrition information rather than their in-home health worker, how can one affect change regarding nutrition knowledge and practices? These findings are supported by previous research which indicates that primary care providers do not discuss nutrition at their well child visits, indicating that current physician services are likely not the answer to this complicated issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512446715">Woolford et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>The third theme of the current study revealed that participants see a need to improve their own health habits, but do not feel they need to improve the health habits of their children. This denial of unhealthy habits in their children is supported by previous research which indicates that minority Head Start parents tend to underestimate the size of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512446715">Killion et al., 2006</xref>). Further, of mothers whose children were overweight or obese, 65 percent were either satisfied with their child’s body size or wanted them to gain weight. However, 50 percent of mothers of children who were obese (BMI &gt; 95th percentile) did want their children to be thinner. Therefore, most Head Start parents prefer a heavier body type in their child than that advocated by the medical community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512446715">Thompson and Story, 2003</xref>). This could serve as a barrier to providing prevention or treatment efforts to children. Head Start teachers are also not likely to intervene, as they believe many children they serve are from food scarce homes, are skeptical about the definition of overweight, don’t believe there is a connection between eating habits and weight status, and are uncomfortable addressing the topic with parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512446715">Lumeng et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>Parents identified their own nutrition information as lacking, and reported that they especially needed assistance with healthy recipes, healthy cooking tips, and shopping for healthy food items. Successful interventions have been completed with Head Start families regarding media literacy nutrition education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512446715">Hindin et al., 2004</xref>), however outcome data on nutrition interventions in families are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512446715">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). Data do exist to suggest that the Head Start school mealtime environment is developmentally appropriate and predictable – two factors related to positive nutritional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512446715">Gable and Lutz, 2001</xref>). However, Head Start teachers do not currently feel competent to deliver nutrition interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512446715">Lumeng et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that additional services will be needed.</p>
         <p>Finally, despite their self-identified desire to improve health habits, parents reported a plethora of barriers to healthier eating and physical activity, such as cost, time, dislike of exercise, not wanting to deprive themselves of their favored but unhealthy food choices, and fatigue. Previous research suggests that a substantial portion of Head Start families live in chaotic conditions which may interfere with healthy living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512446715">Brown and Low, 2008</xref>), and that Mexican origin and speaking English as a second language are related to overweight and obesity among Head Start families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512446715">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). Research with other low-income minority groups have also implicated neighborhood characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512446715">Block et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512446715">Heinrich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512446715">Regan et al., 2006</xref>) and financial issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512446715">Reicks et al., 1994</xref>) as barriers to healthy living. Overcoming these significant environmental/societal barriers will require a comprehensive program specifically designed to meet the needs of this unique population.</p>

            <title>Limitations</title>
            <p>As with most clinical research, there are many limitations to the current study. First our sample size was relatively small and recruited from only one community Early/Head Start program, leaving open the possibility that our data are not representative of the larger group of low-income minority parents. However, the fact that saturation was reached on all themes, indicates that at least the size of our sample was not problematic. Second, our study is qualitative rather than quantitative; however, this allowed us to delve more deeply into our two main aims. Strengths of the study include the inclusion of Spanish-speaking low-income parents, the focus on a hard-to-reach population, and the importance of the issue of pediatric nutrition and obesity.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section10-1367493512446715">
            <title>Implications</title>
            <p>The current study indicates that low-income minority families are in need of additional nutritional supports. One important focus of future intervention programs should be increasing parents’ knowledge regarding healthy foods, proper portion sizes, and healthy preparation methods; how to evaluate the healthfulness of foods and seek out accurate nutrition information; and how to incorporate these strategies into their daily lives. As we were working with Early/Head Start families, providing this additional intervention through this existing program seems optimal. Existing research, however, indicates that current Head Start staff do not feel qualified to deliver such interventions without additional training or support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512446715">Lumeng et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
            <p>There has been a call in the literature for intervention in child care settings like Head Start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512446715">Story et al., 2006</xref>), but the current study suggests that interventions will likely be needed at home as well. Targets for intervention in the child care setting could include ensuring that sites serve the foods that are indicated on their menus, as previous research indicates that in only a minority of cases do schools actually serve what is on the menu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512446715">Fleishhacker et al., 2006</xref>). When targeting change in the home environment, we must determine the most effective methods for reaching and educating this diverse population. Technology may serve as one possible option. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512446715">Salovey et al. (2009</xref>) report on the establishment of two community technology learning centers for parents of children in Head Start programs specifically designed to increase their knowledge of cancer prevention. However, as 80 percent of American adults seek health information on the internet, it seems an obvious choice for low-income minority families as well, as long as access issues can be overcome. Whatever the specific details of the intervention, it is clear that action must be taken with the entire extended family system to improve nutritional practices and thereby decrease obesity among these high-risk families.</p>
