<abstract>
<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: The new mental health care delivery system in the USA strives to provide efficient quality care at a lower cost. This cost-effective approach and focus on short-term treatment modalities and measurable outcomes has created new challenges especially for those who work with clients with severe mental illness. This study explores the relationships between workplace conditions, role stress, burnout, and intent to quit. The direct and indirect effects of role stress on emotional exhaustion and emotional exhaustion on intent to quit are illuminated in order to better understand the complex process of becoming stressed and disillusioned with one’s work.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: The results support the author’s expectations that role stress mediates the association between workplace variables and emotional exhaustion; and that emotional exhaustion mediates the association between role stress and intent to quit.</p>
<p>• <italic>Applications</italic>: These results indicate that agencies and social work schools need to prepare students and new workers for the realistic aspects of mental health work, and provide them with the necessary skills required in order to balance the financial and the clinical aspects of mental health work. Supervisory support, peer support groups, and in-service training should also be considered as important interventions that can reduce workers burnout and its negative consequences.</p>

<p>The job of caring for clients with mental illness together with uncertainties about a changing mental health care environment, high job demands, conflicted expectations for role behaviors, and low support at work, is a source of stress for the providers of mental health services. For the past two decades, American mental health care providers have been subjected to frequent organizational changes such as closures of psychiatric wards, increase in outpatient clients with mental illness, new regulations and financial constraints, and increases in management activities and paperwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310392418">Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310392418">Feldman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310392418">Hall &amp; Keefe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017310392418">Koeske &amp; Koeske, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392418">Lu, Miller, &amp; Chen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468017310392418">Shera, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The reorganization of the American mental health care system to a new way of insuring clients for health and mental health care services has created a dramatic shift in the ways providers of mental health services work with their clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310392418">Hall &amp; Keefe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468017310392418">Storm-Gottfried, 1997</xref>). This new system referred to as ‘managed care’ was a response to an institutional demand to reduce health care costs with the rationale of efficiency. Today, almost all mental health care in the USA in both the private and the public sectors is managed by those large, private, and for-profit organizations (managed care) with the overarching goal to provide services that are cost-effective instead of aiming at providing services that enhance the quality of clients’ life. Managed care controls the ways that services are delivered by reducing inpatient length-of-stay which results in larger outpatient caseloads, and providing services to less costly clients rather than to those who require intensive and long-term services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310392418">Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017310392418">Egan &amp; Kadushin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310392418">Feldman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310392418">Keefe &amp; Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392418">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017310392418">Mechanic, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468017310392418">Scheid &amp; Greenley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468017310392418">Shera, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468017310392418">Stone, 1995</xref>). Mental health care providers often perceive the cost-effective approach of managed care as an intrusion which is incompatible with their concern of the well-being of clients such as helping clients living successfully in their communities, improving their social skills, and providing them with the necessary services and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310392418">Acker &amp; Lawrence, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310392418">Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310392418">Feldman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310392418">Hall &amp; Keefe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392418">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468017310392418">Shem &amp; Trabin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310392418">Scheid, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Those working with clients with severe mental illness, who need multiple services and long-term support, face additional challenges when dealing with managed care. In this study those suffering from severe mental illness include clients with non-organic psychosis or personality disorder, such as schizophrenia and affective disorders, severe dysfunction, and prolonged illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017310392418">NIMH, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468017310392418">Ruggeri, Leese, Thornicroft, Bisoffi, &amp; Tansella, 2000</xref>). These clients need long-term treatment and certain type of services which help them integrate in the community and that include help with the management of simple life activities, advocacy, referral, and mediation between the client and social organizations such as social security offices, vocation rehabilitation centers, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310392418">Fiorentine &amp; Grusky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310392418">Scheid, 2003</xref>). Managed care decisions about reimbursing mental health services are based on diagnostic criteria and treatments that aim at reducing symptoms associated with the client’s diagnosis. The focus is on short-term treatment modalities rather than on long-term goals such as improving clients’ social skills and helping them integrate successfully in their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310392418">Scheid, 2003</xref>). In today’s mental health care environment, it has become more difficult to provide adequate services to clients because of institutional demand for cost containment, and limited access to services and programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310392418">Scheid, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The decrease in opportunities for professional development and administrative support has also become a challenge that providers must face as a result of limited funding and financial deficits of mental health care organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017310392418">Pumariega, Winters, &amp; Huffine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310392418">Scheid, 2003</xref>). Lack of workplace support and limited opportunities for professional development are additional stressors associated with the current work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310392418">Pines, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468017310392418">Um &amp; Harrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468017310392418">Winnbust, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Emotional exhaustion which has been defined as a subjective psychological experience that involves feelings of being stressed, and emotionally overextended and drained by one’s work, is the central and most significant component of the burnout syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310392418">Arches, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310392418">Demerouti, Bakker, Vardakou, &amp; Kantas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310392418">Farber, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017310392418">Koeske &amp; Koeske, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310392418">Maslach, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017310392418">Pines, 2005</xref>). Emotional exhaustion has been linked to serious inadequacies in workers’ job performance which include job dissatisfaction, lack of professional efficacy, intent to quit, and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310392418">2003</xref>; Blankertz &amp; Robinson, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310392418">Drake &amp; Yadama, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310392418">Geurtz, Schauffeli, &amp; De Jonge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017310392418">Mor Barak, Nissly, &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>). Emotional exhaustion is a major concern at a time when organizational demands are excessive, services are managed in a very strict manner, and providers are challenged with high caseloads of clients with mental illness and the frustration of not meeting their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310392418">Feldman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017310392418">Mechanic, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017310392418">Sederer &amp; Mirin, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Role stress is also inevitable when workers are subjected to changes and new demands that are incongruent with their professional expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017310392418">Koeske &amp; Koeske, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468017310392418">Um &amp; Harrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468017310392418">Wells, Astrachan, Tichler, &amp; Unutzer, 1995</xref>). In a manner compatible with social psychology theories which view individuals’ properties such as role stress as mediating variables that intervene between input and output variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310392418">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>), the above conceptualization implies that role stress intervenes or mediates between working conditions and emotional exhaustion; it also gives rise to the following hypotheses:
<list id="list1-1468017310392418" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Role stress mediates between workplace variables (e.g. the degree of workers’ involvement with clients with severe mental illness, workload, and workplace support) and emotional exhaustion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emotional exhaustion mediates between role stress and intent to quit.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The first mediator variable hypothesis says that working conditions including involvement with clients with mental illness, workload, and workplace support affect emotional exhaustion through a mediator variable. Role stress mediates between the workplace variables and emotional exhaustion. This model assumes a three-variable system which includes a direct impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable, and an indirect impact going through a mediating variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310392418">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310392418">Green, Salkind, &amp; Akey, 2000</xref>). This formulation introduces a two-stage process in which role stress and the independent variables are at different conceptual levels with regard to emotional exhaustion: role stress is proximal; the workplace variables are more distal. The independent variables are conceptualized as impacting on role stress and then the role stress impacts on emotional exhaustion. The same conceptualization is introduced in the second mediating variable which regards role stress as more distal; and emotional exhaustion as more proximal to intent to quit, which is the negative outcome of this burnout model.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468017310392418" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 460 mental health service providers (i.e. social workers, psychologists and case managers with college, associate, or high school degrees). The strategy that was used for sampling was first to recruit agencies in New York State and second to distribute self-report questionnaires to all mental health staff. Respondents were asked to mail the completed questionnaires in stamped self-addressed envelopes directly to the investigator to assure respondent’s anonymity. The response rate was 58 percent. This study was approved by the institutional review board of York College of the City University of New York.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017310392418"><title>Sample</title>
<p>Among the degrees held by the respondents were 25 with doctoral degrees in social work or other related fields (5%), 286 with master degrees in social work or other related fields (62%), 90 with undergraduate degrees (20%), 32 had associate degrees (9%), and 14 who did not have a college degree (3%). The respondents were primarily females (<italic>n</italic> = 337 or 73%). The mean age was 41 ranging from 21 to 73. Two hundred and sixty-two were married or involved in long-term relationship with a partner (57%), 197 were not married (43%). Approximately half of the respondents had children (45%). The respondents were predominantly White (<italic>n</italic> = 337 or 73%), 101 were Black (22%). The mean for years of experience in the mental health field was 11 years ranging from one year to 45 years of employment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017310392418"><title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Emotional exhaustion</italic> (EE) was measured by a nine-item scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017310392418">Maslach, Jackson, and Leiter (1996)</xref>. This scale is known to have good reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017310392418">Maslach et al., 1996</xref>). The nine statements assess feelings of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by one’s work, and to which responses are made by using a seven-point scale for frequency of agreement (from 0 = ‘Not at all’ to 6 = ‘Most or all the time’). Alpha coefficient for the study sample was .89.</p>
<p><italic>Role stress</italic> (RS) was measured by eight items adapted from the role conflict and role ambiguity scales constructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468017310392418">Rizzo, House, and Lirtzman (1970)</xref>. The items selected for inclusion in this scale reflect the incongruities arising out of perceptions or performance of role requirements, and the amount of perceived autonomy and authority that workers have about their role behaviors. The responses were made by using a seven-point scale, indicating the degree to which the condition existed for each respondent. The scale has both good reliability and face content validity. The internal consistency for this study sample was .84.</p>
<p><italic>Involvement with clients with severe mental illness</italic> is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017310392418">Hagen and Hutchison’s (1988)</xref> description of symptoms and behaviors related to having severe mental illness, and which generally require intensive and long-term services. This scale comprises eight items that reflect workers’ perception about the extent to which they work with clients who suffer from symptoms related to severe mental illness. Examples of items are: ‘Inappropriately angry or violent’, and ‘Confused, disoriented or otherwise out of touch with reality’. Each item is rated on a five-point scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very often, 5 = most or all the time. The weighted scores for all the eight items are added together to measure this variable. The scale has both good reliability and face content validity. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for this study sample was .88<italic>.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Workplace support</italic> was measured by two scales. The first scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310392418">Caplan et al. (1980)</xref> includes four items that assess the extent to which supervisors provide workers with support and help. The responses to those statements are made by using a five-point scale in which zero denotes that one does not receive any support and four that one receives support all the time. Alpha coefficient for the study sample is .86. Evidence of convergent validity is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310392418">Caplan, Cobb, French, Van Harrison, and Pinneau (1980)</xref>. The second scale, <italic>Opportunities for professional development</italic>, is a 10-item scale which assesses workers’ perceptions about the different opportunities for professional development that they have at their workplace including continuing education courses, in-service training, and job advancement. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which those professional development opportunities were available to them in their workplace on a six-point scale: from 0 = not at all to 6 = most or all the time. Alpha coefficient for this study sample is .95. Face content validity was established by having experienced workers and social work educators reviewing the scale items in terms of the degree to which they reflect opportunities that mental health care providers receive at their jobs.</p>
<p><italic>Intent to quit</italic> (IQ) was measured by a three-item scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017310392418">Lichtenstein, Alexander, McCarthy, and Wells (2004)</xref>. Examples of items include: ‘There is a good chance that I will leave this job in the next year or so’, and ‘I frequently think of quitting this job’. Each item is rated on a three-point scale: 1 = not likely, 2 = somewhat, and 3 = very likely. The weighted scores for the three items are added together to measure this variable. The scale has both good reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017310392418">Lichtenstein et al., 2004</xref>). The internal consistency for this study sample was .83.</p>
<p>Demographic characteristics (control variables) which included age, work experience, gender, race, marital status, and level of education were measured by single self-report items. Information was also collected on variables such as size of caseload and type of funding (public and private/non-profit agencies).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468017310392418"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Correlation coefficients were computed among all the study’s variables. Descriptive information was provided for all the outcome variables. Results of these analyses reflected the levels of EE, RS, and ITQ as reported by the study sample.</p>
<p>Multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate how well role stress predicted emotional exhaustion when controlling for the workplace variables, and for the sociodemographic characteristics of workers (race, gender, age, work experience, and level of education). Nominal variables including gender, race (people of color or White), marital status, and type of funding in terms of public or private/non-profit agencies were included in the statistical analysis by coding them as dummy variables. Data analyses utilized SPSS computer software.</p>
<p>The first mediator variable hypothesis was tested by a four-step approach in which several regression analyses were conducted and significance of the coefficients was examined at each step. The first step included a simple regression analysis with A predicting B; step 2 included a simple regression analysis with A predicting C; step 3 included a simple regression analysis with C predicting B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017310392418">Figure 1</xref>). The purpose of steps 1–3 was to establish that zero-order relationships among the variables existed, and that mediation was possible. Step 4 included a two steps hierarchical regression analysis in which the effect of role stress (C) was controlled in the second step. Mediation can be confirmed if the effect of C remains significant after controlling for A, and if A is no longer significant when C is controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310392418">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). A third step which included the socio-demographic variables was added to the hierarchical regression analysis in order to examine if those variables also contributed significantly to emotional exhaustion (EE). The same procedures were used to test the second mediating hypothesis in which emotional exhaustion was the mediating variable.
<fig id="fig1-1468017310392418" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A burnout model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468017310392418-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310392418">Holmbeck (2002)</xref> argues that a hierarchical regression analysis for mediation is insufficient, and that another method is needed to ascertain whether the indirect path between the predictor variables (working conditions) by means of role stress (RS); and RS by means of emotional exhaustion (EE), and the outcome variable (either EE or intent to quit) is significant. Because the total variance accounted for by the predictor variable (either the workplace variables in the first analysis or RS in the second analysis) is the sum of the direct and indirect relationships, a significant indirect path necessitates a drop in the total predictor–outcome relationship when the mediator variable is included. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310392418">Holmbeck (2002)</xref> also recommends a direct test of the indirect path (i.e. the impact of the workplace variables by means of RS; and RS by means of EE), removing the variance as a result of the direct effect. Formulas for conducting this significance test have been presented by the empirical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310392418">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310392418">Cropanzano, Rupp, &amp; Byrne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310392418">Holmbeck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468017310392418">Sobel, 1988</xref>). These formulas yield a <italic>z</italic> score, which can then be compared with the a priori critical value (<italic>z</italic> = 1.645 for a one-tailed test when <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and <italic>z</italic> = 2.326 when <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>To reduce the likelihood of finding significance that is actually produced by chance when several statistical tests of each of the null hypothesis are computed, the Bonferroni approach to control for type I error across the several zero-order correlations was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310392418">Green et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017310392418">Montcalm &amp; Royse, 2002</xref>).

<p>Emotional exhaustion has statistically significant low positive correlation with involvement with clients with severe mental illness and with level of education, and low to medium negative correlations with opportunities for professional development (OPD), and with workplace support. Workers in public agencies reported higher level of EE than those working in private and non-profit organizations. Role stress has significant low negative correlations with workplace support and OPD, and low positive correlation with workload. Intent to quit has statistically significant low to moderate negative correlations with OPD and with workplace support. Level of education has statistically significant low positive correlation with workplace support. Other statistically significant relationships showed that White workers reported higher levels of EE and intent to quit than non-Whites.</p>

<p>To test the mediator variable hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017310392418">Figure 1</xref>) a four-step approach was conducted. The first step included a simple regression analysis with the workplace variables predicting emotional exhaustion, and which resulted in significant zero-order correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); step 2 included a simple regression analysis with the workplace variables predicting role stress, and which resulted in significant zero-order correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); step 3 included a simple regression analysis with role stress predicting emotional exhaustion, resulting in a significant zero-order correlation. Step 4 included a three-step hierarchical regression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468017310392418">Table 3</xref>). Step 1 which included role stress, accounted for a significant amount of the emotional exhaustion variability, <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= .15, [<italic>F</italic> (1, 389) = 34.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001].

The inclusion of RS caused the direct effect of the workplace variables to drop to below conventional levels of significance. Likewise, the indirect effect of the workplace variables was significant, <italic>z</italic> = 3.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Step 3 which included control variables which are known to impact emotional exhaustion (age, gender, race, education, and work experience), resulted in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .03, [<italic>F</italic> (5, 380) = 1.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .223]; this analysis confirmed that the sociodemographic variables did not predict significantly over and above role stress.

<p>The same four steps as described before were used to test the mediator hypothesis in which emotional exhaustion was proposed to transmit the effects of role stress to intent to quit.

<p>The results of this study present a troubling picture regarding the levels of emotional exhaustion and the other negative work outcomes among American mental health workers. More than half of the workers (56%) reported moderate to high levels of EE, 73 percent reported moderate to high levels of role stress, and half (50%) considered quitting their job. Comparing these findings with similar professional groups within an international context suggest that American mental health care providers are not very different in their burnout levels than most of their European counterparts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017310392418">Reiningkaus and Priebe (2007)</xref> reported data on the levels of emotional exhaustion among social workers in Germany, United Kingdom, and Austria. German and Austrian social workers reported lower levels of EE than the American workers; however, the British workers reported higher levels of EE than the American workers. According to another study investigating EE among Australian mental health workers, those workers reported higher rates of EE than the American workers in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017310392418">Lloyd &amp; King, 2004</xref>). According to the European literature on burnout, several European countries have undergone major changes in their mental health services including demands for new roles responsibilities, increasing administration, changes in services, and lack of resources, thus imposing stress on workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310392418">Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017310392418">Lloyd &amp; King, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310392418">McLean &amp; Andrew, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017310392418">Reiningkaus &amp; Priebe, 2007</xref>). Some limitations have to be taken into account when comparing these findings among the different countries, as some of the European samples are small, and it is difficult to establish whether the findings of these studies are representative of the population of workers in each of the countries described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017310392418">Reiningkaus &amp; Priebe, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This study provides good support for understanding role stress in a manner compatible with social psychology theories which view individuals’ properties such as role stress as mediating variables that intervene between input and output variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310392418">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). Role stress proves to be an important and complex variable which in addition to its direct effect on emotional exhaustion, it also acts as an indirect influence by transmitting workers’ exposure to stressful work conditions to become experiences of conflict and disillusionment about professional expectations and autonomy, and which eventually result in symptoms of emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>Another contribution of this study is by explaining emotional exhaustion as a mediating variable rather than an outcome variable of the burnout process. Emotional exhaustion, acts as an indirect influence by transmitting the effect of role stress to result in workers’ intentions to quit their job. Workers’ experiences of conflict and lack of professional autonomy and authority are transmitted to feelings of chronic stress and a sense that one cannot cope anymore, leading to plans of quitting the job and eventually quitting.</p>
<p>A finding which is consistent with previous empirical literature is that those working with clients with severe mental illness are more stressed and burned out than those who work with people with mild emotional disorders and life adjustment reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310392418">Johnson &amp; Rubin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017310392418">Rubin, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468017310392418">1984</xref>). The slow progress and complex needs of these clients, in an environment which limits resources and access to long-term care and special programs, make this type of work even more stressful and dissatisfying for mental health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310392418">Acker &amp; Lawrence, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310392418">Finch &amp; Krantz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017310392418">Scheid, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Workplace support and opportunities for professional development which include supervision, positive communication between workers and administration, and continuing education are shown to be necessary for reducing negative work outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310392418">Noble &amp; Irwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310392418">Pines, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468017310392418">Um &amp; Harrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468017310392418">Winnbust, 1993</xref>). Workers who have the opportunity to attend professional development programs such as continuing education, and in-service training programs can become better informed about the changes in their work environment, and learn how to cope better with new organizational demands that are often perceived as stressful.</p>
<p>Workers in public agencies which are funded by the government appeared to be more emotionally exhausted than those employed by private/non-profit agencies. It is possible that the larger size of public agencies, the specific job demands associated with the public sector, and the heavier caseloads of clients with more serious mental health conditions are more likely to result in workers reporting higher levels of emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>White workers in this study reported higher levels of EE than non-Whites. These findings are consistent with the early burnout literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310392418">Maslach, 1982</xref>) that claims that non-White workers, compared to Whites, do not burn out as much; they have a more realistic perspective about life and an appreciation of their own difficult experiences; and thus are better prepared to cope with stressful job situations.</p>
<p>Workers with lower educational levels reported lower levels of emotional exhaustion compared to those with higher levels of education. It is quite possible that the less educated workers are more comfortable providing their clients with the ongoing daily support, and helping them with the basic tasks of daily living. The more educated workers such as those with master level degrees in social work often experience greater contrasts between their job expectations and the reality of the workplace. Those with higher levels of education, often feel that they work on unnecessary tasks and that their professional values and aspirations are at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392418">Acker, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310392418">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017310392418">Jellinek &amp; Nurcombe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310392418">Keefe &amp; Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392418">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017310392418">Rubin, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468017310392418">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468017310392418">Shera, 1996</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec12-1468017310392418"><title>Study limitations</title>
<p>The cross-sectional nature of this study is a limitation regarding the inference of causality. The convenience sample is a limitation that reduces the generalizability of the study’s findings. Another limitation is that there are always alternative causal paths than those suggested in this study and portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017310392418">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310392418">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>). For example, lack of workplace support is conceptualized in this study as a factor that increases emotional exhaustion; however, emotional exhaustion can also lead to a decrease in workplace support, as workers who are more stressed and disillusioned about their work may be less receptive to either give or receive that kind of attention and care. Another limitation related to the issue of support is the lack of a generalized measure of psychological well-being, as personal factors such as the person’s health may impact upon his or her attitudes toward the organization, the job in general, and their levels of role stress.</p>
<p>Other limitations which are inclusive for this type of research design are the response set of subjects when completing self-report measures, and the characteristics of the non-respondents, who choose not to participate in the study. It is possible that those that did not participate were more burned out and therefore, did not want to expose those kinds of feelings or take the time to respond to the survey. Thus, with this type of research design a cautious interpretation of the findings is suggested.</p>

<p>Although this research provided some important answers about the process of burnout, and the organizational conditions that either elevate or alleviate the negative consequences of job stress, there are many more questions that future research may explore. The managed care industry has been known for producing new external pressures and demands on workers; research is needed to better understand how the restructuring of health and mental health services has impacted both workers and their clients. As workers experience negative changes in their work roles, and significant reduction in resources, it is especially important that agencies offer their workers support and training. Although mechanisms for providing workplace support and training to staff may be considered expensive in today’s climate, management needs to assess the cost-effectiveness of such tools as workplace support clearly shows that it reduces job stress. Supervisory support, peer support groups, and in-service training should all be considered as important interventions that can reduce workers burnout and its negative consequences.</p>
<p>Agencies must provide their staff with the appropriate skills needed for working effectively in this new mental health care environment. Emphasis should be on teaching market-driven therapies such as brief counseling and crisis intervention as well as business skills relevant to managing services in a profitable way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017310392418">Bolen &amp; Hall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310392418">Feldman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392418">Lu et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This study shows that less educated workers are less burned out than educated professionals, a result which may indicate that workers with lower level of education may be more effective working with clients with serious mental illness. This outcome suggests that professional schools should concentrate on expending undergraduate and non-academic programs for training people to become social service providers. It is also suggested that agencies consider employing mental health consumers as case managers. The ‘life experiences’ of consumers enable them to identify more readily with clients and understand better the subjective nature of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468017310392418">Solomon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468017310392418">Solomon &amp; Draine, 1996</xref>). Consumers may experience less stress, disillusionment and frustration than professional mental health care providers.</p>
<p>It is important that such findings are also integrated in the curriculum of professional schools and programs in order to raise students’ understanding of the potential challenges associated with the new professional roles of mental health care providers.</p>
