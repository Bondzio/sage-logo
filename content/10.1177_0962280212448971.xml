<p>The bi-annual meeting GEOMED was held in October 2011 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. This meeting has, as a primary focus, developments in methodology and applications in the area of disease mapping and risk assessment for public health. In addition to spatial aspects related to population level public health, the program also featured presentations dedicated to spatial statistics for neuroimaging. The meeting saw a variety of presentations in this area, and this special issue represents a selection of the papers developed, with an emphasis on methodology for neuroimaging statistics. These papers consider techniques for the analysis of spatial data arising from a wide range of medical imaging modalities, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p>
<p>To begin, Johnson et al. present a Bayesian non-parametric Potts model based on a mixture of Dirichlet process priors, and apply this model to the analysis of pre-surgical fMRI data. Following this, Derado et al. propose a multivariate spatial model for predicting follow-up brain activity, with application to predicting disease progression in a PET study of Alzheimer's disease. Emphasizing methods for the inverse problem associated with EEG, Nathoo et al. present a study comparing Variational Bayes to Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian computation. This is then followed by the work of Ismail et al., who develop a skew-t space-varying regression model for the spectral analysis of resting state brain activity, and apply this model for analysis in an MEG study of Down syndrome. Finally, focusing on statistical shape analysis, Beg et al. consider the problem of constructing shape features and detecting Hippocampal shape changes in early Alzheimer’s using support vector machines. We hope this special issue generates continued excitement among statisticians working in this timely research area.</p>
