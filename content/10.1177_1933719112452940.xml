<abstract>
<p>We recently reported that Slit/Roundabout (ROBO) 1 pathway may be a constituent biomarker for recurrence of endometriosis, likely through promoting angiogenesis. In this study, we sought to determine as whether Slit2 overexpression can facilitate angiogenesis, increase lesion size, and induce hyperalgesia in mice with induced endometriosis. We used 30 Slit2 transgenic (S) and 29 wild-type (W) mice and cross-transplanted endometrial fragments from S to W (group SW) and vice versa (group WS), and also within the S and W (groups SS and WW, respectively), into the peritoneal cavity, inducing endometriosis. We also performed a sham surgery within both S and W mice (groups Sm and Wm, respectively). The size of the ectopic implants, microvessel density (MVD) and immunoreactivity to ROBO1, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) in ectopic and eutopic endometrium, along with hotplate and tail-flick tests in all mice, were then evaluated. We found that <bold>t</bold>he induction of endometriosis resulted in generalized hyperalgesia, which was unaffected by Slit2 overexpression. Slit2 overexpression did increase the lesion size significantly and correlated positively with the MVD in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. Slit2 expression levels appear to correlate with the MVD, but not with VEGF immunoreactivity, in ectopic endometrium. Consequently, we conclude that Slit2 may play an important role in angiogenesis in endometriosis. The increased angiogenesis, as measured by MVD, but not VEGF immunoreactivity, likely resulted in increased lesion size in induced endometriosis. Thus, SLIT2/ROBO1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for treating endometriosis.</p>

<p>Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disorder reportedly affecting 1% to 22% of women of reproductive age.<sup>

</sup> It is characterized by the ectopic presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine cavity and is closely associated with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and subfertility. While the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still poorly understood, angiogenesis is recognized as being of critical importance in the growth and survival of endometriotic lesions since it must be an absolute requirement for any lesion to become clinically relevant. As in tumor metastases, endometriotic lesions require nutritional and oxygen supply and thus neovascularization to invade into ectopic sites within the host and to maintain proliferation,<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112452940">15</xref>
</sup> the identification of all possible angiogenic molecules and pathways would conceivably help devise more effective strategies to suppress angiogenesis in endometriosis. In addition, the reports that drugs with antiangiogenic potential can impact negatively on reproductive functions<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112452940">7</xref>
</sup> This also requires, by necessity, the identification of all possible angiogenic molecules and pathways involved in endometriosis.</p>
<p>The Slit is a secretory glycoprotein consisting of 3 members, Slit1, Slit2, and Slit3, and was originally found to be secreted repellents in axon guidance and neuronal migration.<sup>

</sup> It has been shown to be an endogenously available inhibitor of leukocyte chemotaxis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452940">22</xref>
</sup> The receptor for Slit is the transmemanbrane protein Roundabout (ROBO), which currently consists of 4 members (ROBO1-4).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112452940">23</xref>
</sup> Wang et al demonstrate that the purified recombinant human Slit2 protein attracted the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that Slit2 is a chemoattractant for HUVECs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112452940">24</xref>
</sup>; disrupting the Slit2 signaling would significantly neutralize the migration of HUVECs. In addition, they convincingly show that Slit2 guided the direction of endothelial cell migration, rather than simply increasing the motility of endothelial cells. They also show that Slit is secreted by various cancer cells and ROBO1 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, where Slit can attract vascular endothelial cells in vitro and promote tumor-induced angiogenesis in a xenograft model of human malignant melanoma cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112452940">24</xref>
</sup> Recently, Dunaway et al show that Slit2 stimulates endothelial cell assembly and migration in vitro and induces subcutaneous blood vessel remodeling in vivo.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112452940">25</xref>
</sup> Consistent with these findings, Slit-ROBO4 is reported to function as a chemoattractant to recruit vascular endothelial cells to sites for vasculogenesis.<sup>

</sup> Increased Slit expression is associated with higher tumor angiogenesis as reflected by increased VEGF expression and microvessel density (MVD).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112452940">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We have recently reported that increased immunoreactivity to SLIT in ectopic endometrium may be a constituent biomarker for the recurrence of ovarian endometriomas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112452940">29</xref>
</sup> Thus, Slit2 may be involved in the development of endometriosis.</p>
<p>Since in the vertebrate the vascular and nervous systems overlap substantially and share several anatomical and functional parallels<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112452940">30</xref>
</sup> and since both angiogenesis and innervation are well documented in endometriosis, it is plausible that Slit2 might also be involved in neurotrophic activities in and around ectopic implants, endometrium, and perhaps also in vagina, resulting in innervation and, consequently, endometriosis-associated pain.</p>
<p>Therefore, through cross-transplantation of endometrial tissues within and between Slit2 transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice, we sought in this study to investigate the role of Slit2 in the development of endometriosis and its impact on endometriosis-associated hyperalgesia. We evaluated the effect of Slit2 overexpression on the size of ectopic lesions and on endometriosis-induced pain by evaluating the thermal withdrawal latency of the hindpaws. To see any resultant changes in angiogenesis and the expression of the known angiogenic factor, VEGF, we also performed immunohistochemistry analysis of VEGF, and CD31 and CD34, the latter 2 being markers for MVD and thus an indirect measure of angiogenesis.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112452940">32</xref>
</sup> hence 1 way to investigate the role of Slit2 in the development of endometriosis would be the use of Slit2 transgenic (Tg) mice. Slit2 Tg mice with C57BL/6 background were generated according to standard procedures and were characterized as reported previously.<sup>

</sup> Briefly, the transgene was constructed by cloning the complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the full-length of human Slit2 cDNA into the pCEP4F vector, which contains the CMV promoter and was injected into the pronuclei of fertilized C57 × CBA F1 oocytes. Genotypes were confirmed by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis, and additional validation came from genotyping the offspring of Slit2 Tg mice (which were homozygotes with a genotype, say, SS, as confirmed by genetic method) crossed with C57BL/6 mice (also homozygotes, but different from Tg, say, ss), which were Slit2 heterozygotes (Ss). The Tg mice showed no apparent phenotypic changes and were physiologically comparable to their WT counterpart.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112452940">33</xref>
</sup> The Slit2 expression in the uterus was detected by immunohistochemistry. Thirty female Slit2 Tg mice, 8 to 9 weeks old and about 18 to 20 g in body weight, were used in this study. Since the Tg mice were derived from C57BL/6 (ie, WT) mice and back-crossed for 10 generations, we thus used C57BL/6 mice as control in our experiments.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although this study did not examine human Slit2 binding to mouse Robo per se, their interaction has been extensively demonstrated by many previous studies, including our own ones.<sup>

<title>Experiment Protocol</title>
<p>After 3 days of acclimatization and before surgery, a baseline hotplate test and tail-flick test (described below) were performed in all the mice. Endometriosis was surgically induced (see surgical procedures below) when mice were in estrus as determined by microscopic examination of vaginal smear. In essence, endometriosis was induced through allotransplant of endometrial fragments into the peritoneal cavity. Depending on the donor and recipient status and the type of surgery (endometriosis-inducing or sham), there were 6 groups:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Group SS (n = 11) consisted of Slit2 Tg mice (recipients) transplanted with endometrial fragments from different Slit2 Tg mice (donors). Here, SS means that the endometrial tissues harvested from the S (the first S in SS, ie, Slit2 Tg) mice were cross-transplanted to the S (the second S in SS) mice. In other words, the donor of endometrial fragments was an S mouse and the recipient of the transplantation also was an S (but different) mouse (thus, the S→S or, for short, the SS notation);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group WS (n = 10), consisted of Slit2 Tg mice (recipients) transplanted with endometrial fragments taken from WT mice (donors). In other words, the donor was a W mouse and the recipient was an S mouse (thus, the W→S or, for short, the WS notation).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group Sm (n = 9), consisted of Slit2 Tg mice that received a sham surgery.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group WW (n = 10), consisted of WT mice (recipients) transplanted with endometrial fragments from different WT mice (donors).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group SW (n = 9), consisted of WT mice (recipients) with endometrial fragments from Slit2 Tg mice (donors) transplanted into WT mice.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group Wm (n = 10), consisted of WT mice that received a sham surgery.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The use of Sm and Wm groups was intended to control possible effect of surgery and also provide a reference to other groups.</p>
<p>Four weeks after implantation, the second round of hotplate and tail-flick tests was performed. Thereafter, all mice were sacrificed through cervical dislocation. The abdominal cavity was immediately reopened through the original incision, and the lesions were measured by 2 perpendicular diameters (<italic>D</italic>
<sub>1</sub> and <italic>D</italic>
<sub>2</sub>) with a caliper, and the cross-sectional lesion area was calculated using the formula (<italic>D</italic>

<sub>2</sub> × π/4) as reported previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112452940">36</xref>
</sup> The total size (in mm<sup>2</sup>) of ectopic lesions in each group was evaluated without any knowledge of the group identity (blinded evaluation). Ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissue samples in all mice were harvested and fixed immediately after collection in 10% formalin–acetic acid and embedded in paraffin for histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. These measurements and the IHC analysis were performed in a blind fashion, without knowledge of the group identity of the mouse in question.</p>

<title>Surgical Procedures</title>
<p>Surgery was performed under aseptic precautions to transplant small pieces of uterine fragments to peritoneum of lower parts of the abdomen and pelvic cavity, identical to published studies.<sup>

</sup> Prior to any invasive procedure, the mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride. For each group, laparotomy was performed and the left uterine horns were removed. The excised horns, with connecting fat tissues removed as much as possible, were immersed in a sterile lactate solution<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112452940">40</xref>
</sup> and opened longitudinally. Each uterine segment was cut into 4 smaller fragments of roughly equal size (∼2 × 2 mm). For mice in groups SS and WW, the uterine fragments were allografted into the peritoneum of lower parts of the abdomen and pelvic cavity. For mice in group SW, we sutured the uterine fragments of the Slit2 Tg mice into the peritoneum of WT mice, while mice in group WS, the uterine fragments of the WT mice were sutured into the peritoneum of Slit2 Tg mice. A total of 4 uterine fragments were sutured to the peritoneal wall of the lower part of the lateral abdominal and pelvic cavity with a 6/0 braided silk suture. For mice in Sm and Wm groups, laparotomy was performed and the left uterine horn was removed and 4 pieces of fat tissues, roughly equal in size (also ∼ 2× 2 mm) to the endometrial fragments used in the endometriosis-inducing groups, were separated and removed from the left uterine horn and sutured to the peritoneal wall of the lower part of the lateral abdominal and pelvic cavity with a 6/0 braided silk suture. Then the midline incision was closed with a 3/0 braided silk suture. After surgery, all mice, including those received sham surgery, were fed with 2 mg/L 17β-estradiol (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri) solution daily for 2 weeks, as reported previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112452940">41</xref>

<title>Hotplate and Tail-Flick Test Procedures</title>
<p>The hotplate test,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112452940">42</xref>

Mice were brought to the testing room and allowed to acclimatize for 10 minutes before the test begins.</p>
<p>The latency to respond to thermal stimulus defined to be the time (in second) elapsed from the moment when the mouse was inserted inside the cylinder to the time when it licked or flicked its hindpaws or jerked off or jumped off the hot plate. Each animal was tested only once in 1 session. The latency was calculated as mean of 2 readings recorded at intervals of 24 hours.</p>
<p>The tail-flick test was evaluated with a commercially available tail-flick Analgesia Meter (Model ZH-LUO/B; Zhenghua Co, Ltd, Huaibei, Anhui, China). Thermal stimulation was given by a beam of high-intensity light focused on the tail 2 to 3 cm distal to the end. The time between the start of the stimulation and tail withdrawal was measured as the tail-flick latency. The intensity of the beam was adjusted to produce mean control reaction time within 60 seconds before the test begins, after which the heat source was held constant for all mice and not adjusted for individual animals. All mice to be tested were placed in a metallic mesh cage with their tails extended through a slot located at the rear of the cage and allowed to acclimatize for 10 minutes before the test begins. Withdrawal of the tail exposed to the light automatically turned off the thermal stimulus, automatically stopped the time-counting, and the latency time was automatically displayed. Each animal was tested only once in 1 session. The latency was calculated as mean of 2 readings recorded at intervals of 12 hours.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Serial 4-μm sections were obtained from each paraffin-embedded tissue block, with the first resultant slide being stained for hematoxylin and eosin to confirm pathologic diagnosis, and the subsequent slides stained for Slit2, ROBO1, VEGF, CD31, and CD34. Routine deparaffinization and rehydration procedures were performed following published protocols.<sup>

</p>
<p>The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Slit2 (LS-C19086; LifeSpan, Seattle), ROBO1, VEGF (ab7279 and ab44724; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and the rat monoclonal antibodies against CD34 and CD31 (ab8158 and ab56299; Abcam), diluted to 1:200, 1:100, 1:200,1:100, and 1:400, respectively, were used as primary antibodies. For antigen retrieval, the slides were heated at 98°C in an EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) for a total of 30 minutes and cooled naturally at room temperature. The endogenous peroxidases were blocked by immersing slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide–methanol solution (v/v) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4°C. After slides were rinsed, biotinylated anti-rat secondary antibody was applied and detected using the DAB kit (85-9643; Invitrogen, California) and biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied and detected using the DAB kit (MR-SPR120; MingRui Biotech, Shanghai). The bound antibody complexes were stained for 3 to 5 minutes or until appropriate for microscopic examination with diaminobenzidine and then counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Myometrial tissues were specifically excluded. Each staining run incorporated a positive control slide. Slit2 and ROBO1 staining in retina tissue, VEGF staining in eutopic endometrium, CD31 staining in kidney tissue, and CD34 staining in lung tissue were used as positive control. A negative control was also incorporated by replacing the primary antibody with immunoglobulins of the same isotype.</p>
<p>Immunoreactivity staining was characterized quantitatively by digital image analysis using the Image Pro-Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Bathesda, Maryland) as reported by Wang-Tilz et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719112452940">44</xref>
</sup> without prior knowledge of any information on group assignment. Briefly, images were obtained with the microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a digital camera (Olympus DP70, Olympus). A series of 10 random images on several sections were taken for each immunostained parameter to obtain a mean value. Staining was defined via color intensity, and a color mask was made. The mask was then applied equally to all images, and measurement readings were obtained. Immunohistochemical parameters assessed in the area detected included (<italic>a</italic>) integrated optical density (IOD); (<italic>b</italic>) total stained area (S); and (<italic>c</italic>) mean optical density (MOD), which is defined as MOD = IOD/S, equivalent to the intensity of stain in all positive cells. All sections were inspected independently by 2 persons (Y.Z. and Y.L.). Discrepancies, if occurred, were resolved by consensus.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For descriptive statistics, we used boxplots<sup>

</sup> to graphically depict groups of data, in which the bottom and top of the box represent the lower and upper quartiles, respectively, the band near the middle of the box represents the median, the ends of the whiskers represent the smallest and the largest nonoutlier observations (no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box), and the dots outside the whiskers are considered outliers by convention. In all data analyses, outliers were not excluded from analysis unless otherwise explicitly stated in the results. The comparison of distributions of continuous variables between or among 2 or more groups was made using the Wilcoxon and Kruskal test, respectively, and the paired Wilcoxon test was used when the before–after comparison was made for the same group of animals. Pearson correlation coefficient was used when evaluating correlations between 2 variables. To see whether induction of endometriosis and/or SLIT2/ROBO1/VEGF immunoreactivity, MVD and other possible factors were responsible for the change in hotplate and tail-flick latency before and after the surgery, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed. The presence of endometriosis or not was depicted by a dummy variable with 1 if endometriosis is induced or 0 if not. To see whether the donor and recipient status (S vs W) has any effect on the size of ectopic lesions, a multiple linear regression model was used with a dummy variable coding for donor status (1 if S or 0 if W) and the other coding for recipient status (1 if S or 0 if W). To ensure the normality of the linear regression analysis, a Q-Q plot was examined using the residuals of the regression.</p>

<title>Lesion Size in Different Groups</title>
<p>We first evaluated the total lesion surface areas in all groups of mice and found that the lesion size differed significantly among the 4 groups of mice with induced endometriosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112452940">Figure 2</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .005). It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112452940">Figure 2</xref> that, on average, the SS group had the largest lesion sizes while the WW group had the smallest among the 4 groups. Of note, the average lesion size in SS mice was 3 times of that in the WW mice. The multiple linear regression analysis confirmed this impression: after deleting an apparent outlier in the WS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112452940">Figure 2</xref>), we found that both the donor and recipient statuses were significantly associated with the lesion size (<italic>P</italic> = .026 and .004, respectively). That is, Slit2 overexpression either in the donor or in the recipient tissues was associated with increased lesion size.</p>

<title>Effect on the Response to Noxious Stimuli</title>
<p>To see whether Slit2 overexpression affects mice’s generalized hyperalgesia as result of induced endometriosis or surgery, we tested the response to noxious thermal stimuli in all groups of mice before and after the induction of endometriosis or the sham surgery using hotplate and tail-flick tests. Before the surgery that transplanted either endometrial tissues or fat tissues to the pelvic cavity, there was no difference in response latency in hotplate test among all groups (<italic>P</italic> = .67). There was no difference either between Slit2 transgenic and WT mice (<italic>P</italic> = .49).</p>
<p>Yet after surgery, a significant difference among the 6 groups was found (<italic>P</italic> = .029). When the before–after change in latency was evaluated, the difference among them did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112452940">Figure 3A</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .076). All mice, as a whole, had significantly reduced response latency (<italic>P</italic> = .0005, paired test), which was most visible in mice with induced endometriosis but not in mice received sham surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112452940">Figure 3A</xref>). However, neither hotplate nor tail-flick latency correlated with the size of lesions (all <italic>P</italic> values &gt; .68).</p>

<p>For tail-flick test, no difference in baseline level was found (<italic>P</italic> = .90).

<p>We found that among the 4 groups of mice with induced endometriosis, a statistically significant difference in immunoreactivity to SLIT2, VEGF, CD34-MVD, and CD31-MVD in ectopic endometrium was found (<italic>P</italic> = .038, <italic>P</italic> = .020, <italic>P</italic> = .002, and <italic>P</italic> = .0001, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719112452940">Figure 5</xref>). The difference in ROBO1 immunostaining did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .093). Multiple linear regression, however, indicated that, for both Slit2 and ROBO1, only the donor status as being the Slit2 Tg mouse (ie, when the implants originated from SLIT2 Tg mouse) was significantly and positively associated with the immunoreactivity level in ectopic endometrium (<italic>P</italic> = .003 and <italic>P</italic> = .048, respectively).

<p>For VEGF immunoreactivity, however, the multiple linear regression indicated that donor and recipient status and their interaction were all significantly associated with the VEGF staining level (<italic>P</italic> = .045, <italic>P</italic> = .037, and <italic>P</italic> = .003, respectively). It is interesting to note that the VEGF immunoreactivity was lower in mice with transplanted endometrial tissues originating from a mouse with a different Slit2 gene expression status than those when donor and recipient mice were the same strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719112452940">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>For CD31-MVD, the multiple regression indicated that both donor and recipient statuses were significantly associated with the CD31-MVD (<italic>P</italic> = .00016, and <italic>P</italic> = 2.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, respectively). The CD31-MVD was the highest in the SS mice and lowest in the WW mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719112452940">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that CD31-MVD was dependent on both donor and recipient statuses.</p>
<p>Among all 5 IHC measures, only CD31-MVD and CD34-MVD values were found to be significantly correlated with the lesion size (<italic>r</italic> = .35, <italic>P</italic> = .037, and <italic>r</italic> = .37, <italic>P</italic> = .027, respectively). Regressing CD34-MVD on SLIT2, VEGF, CD31-MVD, and ROBO1 immunoreactivity levels indicated that only CD31-MVD was associated with CD34-MVD (<italic>P</italic> = 5.5 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, <italic>R</italic>

The multiple linear regression indicated that both donor and recipient statuses were significantly associated with the CD34-MVD level (<italic>P</italic> = .006, and <italic>P</italic> = .002, respectively), hence providing the explanation as why the highest and the lowest MVD level in the SS and WW groups, respectively. Regressing of CD34-MVD values on SLIT2, ROBO1, and VEGF, but not CD31, immunostaining levels indicated that both SLIT2 and ROBO1 immunoreactivities, but not VEGF, were associated with CD34-MVD (<italic>P</italic> = .0003, <italic>P</italic> = .001, and <italic>P</italic> = .002 [for interaction term], respectively).

However, Slit2 overexpression does not seem to be associated with any increase in generalized hyperalgesia resulting from endometriosis.</p>
<p>The finding that neither CD31-MVD nor CD34-MVD in ectopic endometrium is associated with the VEGF expression is somewhat surprising, but not entirely unexpected, for several reasons. First, the use of the Slit2 transgenic mice might somehow eclipse the role of VEGF in angiogenesis in ectopic endometrium. Second, this study only examined VEGF or VEGF-A, as did in most human studies of endometriosis. It is plausible that other VEGF family members, such as VEGF-C, may also be responsible for MVD in ectopic endometrium. Finally, Laschke et al reported that selective blockade of VEGF only results in a slight reduction in MVD in a dorsal skinfold chamber model in hamsters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112452940">15</xref>
</sup> They concluded that vascularization of endometriotic lesions is not solely driven by VEGF but depends on the cross talk between VEGF, FGF, and PDGF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112452940">15</xref>
</sup> In addition, as WW mice had induced endometriosis but Wm mice did not, the result that MVD—likely to be independent from Slit2 expression in this case—in eutopic endometrium was higher in WW mice than that in Wm mice appeared to be consistent with reportedly higher MVD in eutopic endometrium in women with endometriosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1933719112452940">58</xref>
</sup> and with reported increased proliferation of endothelial cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1933719112452940">59</xref>
</sup> Indeed, the presence of endometriosis (in the WW group) may have disrupted various vascular events in the endometrium, resulting an overall increase in angiogenesis (ie, higher MVD levels in WW mice than that in Wm mice),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1933719112452940">60</xref>
</sup> even though neither WW nor Wm group expresses Slit2. These data, taken together and along with data published by our groups that Slit2 is involved in angiogenesis in tumors,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112452940">28</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1933719112452940">61</xref>
</sup> appear to suggest that Slit2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, possibly independent of VEGF expression in ectopic endometrium as seen by the lack of correlation between SLIT2 and VEGF immunostaining and between VEGF and MVD.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Slit/ROBO pathway has been shown to be involved in normal development and pregnancy in endometrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1933719112452940">62</xref>
</sup> In particular, Slit2 expression is found to peak in the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1933719112452940">62</xref>
</sup> In view of overproduction of estrogen and proinflammatory cytokines in endometriosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112452940">2</xref>
</sup> and our recent finding that higher SLIT/ROBO1 immunoreactivity is a likely constituent biomarker for recurrence of ovarian endometriomas,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112452940">29</xref>
</sup> these data suggest that Slit2 might be important in the development of endometriosis, likely involved in the angiogenesis of ectopic implants. While Slit2 may likely be involved in neoangiogenesis in endometriosis, the apparent differential expression patterns between normal and ectopic endometrium may raise the hope that Slit2 may be a tissue or disease-specific endothelial cell marker that could be targeted by vascular-disrupting agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112452940">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The dependence of donor status in SLIT2 and ROBO1 immunoreactivity in ectopic endometrium as we observed is sensible, since the ectopic endometrium came originally from the donor mice and thus the expression of Slit2 and its receptor ROBO1 should resemble that of the original tissue. This also seems to be consistent with the finding from a human–mouse xenograft model of endometriosis, in which the VEGF that stimulates angiogenesis is found to be derived from the human endometrial explants, whereas the vasculature supplying the growing human lesions was found to be of murine origin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112452940">12</xref>
</sup> In contrast, the dependence on recipient status in SLIT2 immunoreactivity in eutopic endometrium is to be expected since the Slit2 expression in these 2 organs/tissues should not be affected very much by the origin of the transplanted endometrial implants. The increased VEGF expression in eutopic endometrium in mice with induced endometriosis also is consistent with what is seen in humans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1933719112452940">63</xref>
</sup> What is interesting, but also somewhat puzzling, is that VEGF expression levels in eutopic endometrium also depend on the recipient status in addition to the presence of endometriosis. In fact, the dependence on the recipient status is seen also in ectopic endometrium. Whether this signals some interaction between SLIT2 and VEGF signaling is unclear and warrants future investigation.</p>
<p>The dependence of hotplate latency after induction of endometriosis on the baseline level and the presence of endometriosis are consistent with our previous report in a similar mouse model of endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112452940">41</xref>
</sup> The reduced hotplate latency as a result of endometriosis is consistent with endometriosis-induced vaginal hyperalgesia in rats as manifested by heightened sensitivity to vaginal distention<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1933719112452940">64</xref>
</sup> and also is consistent with our recent finding that women with endometriosis have generalized hyperalgesia when compared with women without.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1933719112452940">65</xref>
</sup> We note that the endometriosis-induced hyperalgesia was independent of Slit2 expression.</p>
<p>In contrast, the tail-flick response latency does not seem to deteriorate as a result of endometriosis. This discrepancy may stem from the difference in nociceptive reaction between the 2 stimuli: it is well known that the hotplate test elicits reactions involves spinal–brain stem–spinal reflexes while the tail-flick test elicits the spinal reflexes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1933719112452940">66</xref>
</sup> That is, the hotplate stimulation elicits supraspinal responses, whereas tail-flick thermal stimulation elicits subspinal response.</p>
<p>While Slit2 interacts with Robo1 to mediate repulsive cues in axon guidance and neuronal migration,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112452940">21</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1933719112452940">67</xref>
</sup> in our study, we found that Slit2 overexpression did not impact on generalized hyperalgesia resulting from induced endometriosis. In fact, the extent of hyperalgesia did not correlate with the lesion size, which seems to be consistent with the consensus that there is a poor correlation between pain severity and endometriosis stage or lesion type.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1933719112452940">68</xref>
</sup> The homogeneity in the way in inducing endometriosis in these mice aside, our data appear to suggest that Slit2 overexpression in induced endometriosis does not affect the level of generalized hyperalgesia.</p>
<p>In summary, we found that Slit2 overexpression results in increased size of the endometrial implants in induced endometriosis, with concomitant increased angiogenesis as measured by MVD. These findings, in conjunction with the role of SLIT/ROBO1 in recurrence of endometriosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112452940">29</xref>
</sup> the correlation of SLIT immunoreactivity and the severity of dysmenorrhea in adenomyosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1933719112452940">69</xref>
</sup> strongly suggest that Slit2 may play an important role in angiogenesis in endometriosis and may be a therapeutic target in treating endometriosis.</p>
