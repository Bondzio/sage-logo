<abstract>
<p>The co-occurrence of positive and negative attributes of an attitude object typically accounts for less than a quarter of the variance in felt ambivalence toward these objects, rendering this <italic>evaluative</italic> incongruence insufficient for explaining felt ambivalence. The present research tested whether another type of incongruence, <italic>semantic</italic> incongruence, also causes felt ambivalence. Semantic incongruence arises from inconsistencies in the descriptive content of attitude objects’ attributes (e.g., attributes that are not mutually supportive), <italic>independent</italic> of these attributes’ valences. Experiment 1 manipulated evaluative and semantic incongruence using valence norms and semantic norms. Both of these <italic>norm-based</italic> manipulations independently predicted felt ambivalence, and, in Experiment 2, they even did so over and above <italic>self-based</italic> incongruence (i.e., participants’ idiosyncratic perceptions of evaluative and semantic incongruence). Experiments 3a and 3b revealed that aversive dissonant feelings play a role in the effects of evaluative incongruence, but not semantic incongruence, on felt ambivalence.</p>

<body>
<p>Have you ever met a person who seemed perfect, and nonetheless caused mixed, conflicted, or ambivalent feelings in you, as though the person was <italic>too</italic> perfect? Imagine a person whose core attributes—intelligence and humility—remind you of your two idols: Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi. It would seem impossible that you feel ambivalent toward this Einstein–Gandhi hybrid, whose attributes are uniformly positive. In opposition to this intuition, however, we propose that feelings of ambivalence <italic>can</italic> arise. Specifically, we consider the possibility that felt ambivalence may arise due to <italic>semantic incongruence</italic>, which stems from inconsistencies between attitude objects’ attributes, such as intelligence—an agentic trait—and humility—a communal trait. Four experiments examined the effect of semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence, and tested whether this effect is independent of the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence.</p>

<title>Evaluative Incongruence and Felt Ambivalence</title>
<p>Felt ambivalence is regarded as a particularly important aspect of attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 2001</xref>), because felt ambivalence comes with far-reaching implications. For example, felt ambivalence can increase attitude–behavior consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213481679">Jonas, Diehl, &amp; Brömer, 1997</xref>), elicit easier attitude change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167213481679">Tourangeau, Rasinski, Bradburn, &amp; D’Andrade, 1989</xref>), and heighten vulnerability to self-threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213481679">Haddock &amp; Gebauer, 2011</xref>). Felt ambivalence can also decrease elaboration of antiattitudinal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213481679">Clark, Wegener, &amp; Fabrigar, 2008</xref>) and reduce resistance to persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167213481679">Visser &amp; Mirabile, 2004</xref>). In addition to these important implications of felt ambivalence, most people are said to feel ambivalent about most attitude objects most of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0146167213481679">Zaller &amp; Feldman, 1992</xref>). Hence, it is not surprising that a large and persistent body of research has tried to understand the <italic>causes</italic> of felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark, McGregor, &amp; Zanna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213481679">Priester, Petty, &amp; Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481679">Thompson, Zanna, &amp; Griffin, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Originally, the causes of felt ambivalence have been sought in a single predictor: <italic>evaluative incongruence</italic>, defined as valence inconsistencies between attitude objects’ attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213481679">Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167213481679">J. M. Olson &amp; Zanna, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167213481679">Wegener, Downing, Krosnick, &amp; Petty, 1995</xref>). The measurement of evaluative incongruence clarifies its nature. Specifically, participants are typically instructed to report how positively they judge the positive attributes of an attitude object, <italic>irrespective</italic> of the attitude object’s negative attributes. Participants are also instructed to report how negatively they judge the negative attributes of this attitude object, <italic>irrespective</italic> of the attitude object’s positive attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481679">Kaplan, 1972</xref>). Different mathematical models have been proposed to integrate these two responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213481679">Breckler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481679">Thompson et al., 1995</xref>). However, none of the models yield more than a moderate relation between evaluative incongruence and felt ambivalence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481679">Thompson et al. (1995)</xref> found relations up to only <italic>r</italic> = .40. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty (1996)</xref> repeatedly found relations no higher than <italic>r</italic> = .52. In line with these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213481679">Riketta (2004)</xref> found an omnibus effect size of <italic>r</italic> = .44 in a meta-analysis including 27 independent studies.</p>
<p>How can there only be a 19% overlap (based on Riketta’s <italic>r</italic>) between evaluative incongruence and felt ambivalence? Attitude researchers have long puzzled over this question. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al. (2002)</xref> provided a theoretical and empirical attempt toward closing this gap between evaluative incongruence and felt ambivalence. These researchers showed that evaluative incongruence was a stronger predictor of felt ambivalence when the evaluatively incongruent attributes were rendered more accessible in consciousness. Furthermore, this effect was pronounced among people high in preference for consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213481679">Cialdini, Trost, &amp; Newsom, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty (2001)</xref> took a different approach toward the same issue. Specifically, these researchers pointed out that past research had exclusively focused on evaluative incongruence <italic>within</italic> a given person to explain felt ambivalence. At the same time, they argued that felt ambivalence may also arise from evaluative conflict <italic>between</italic> a given person and other persons. According to this account, people can feel ambivalent toward an attitude object if they possess uniformly positive evaluations toward this attitude object, but a close other possesses negative evaluations toward the same attitude object.</p>
<p>Of importance, all of these approaches treated some form of evaluative incongruence as the <italic>sole</italic> cause of felt ambivalence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al. (2002)</xref> focused on <italic>evaluative</italic> incongruence between consciously accessible attributes within an individual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty (2001)</xref> focused on <italic>evaluative</italic> incongruence between individuals, thereby relaxing the classic definition of ambivalence as an <italic>intrapsychic</italic> conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481679">Kaplan, 1972</xref>). The present research takes a complementary approach, seeking additional origins of felt ambivalence in <italic>nonevaluative</italic> incongruence. Specifically, we examine whether semantic incongruence can increase felt ambivalence even after evaluative incongruence is taken into account. To be clear, we do <italic>not</italic> propose that semantic incongruence accounts for felt ambivalence any better than the previously revealed factors (e.g., accessibility, desire for evaluative consistency, interpersonal conflict). Instead, we suggest that semantic incongruence is a fundamentally different dimension, constituting an additional cause of felt ambivalence.</p>

<title>Semantic Incongruence and Felt Ambivalence</title>
<p>Evaluative incongruence is not the only type of incongruence that can exist between attitude objects’ attributes. Research on person perception has long pointed toward a second type of incongruence labeled descriptive or semantic incongruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167213481679">Peabody, 1970</xref>). Translated into the language of attitude research, semantic incongruence can be defined as <italic>content</italic> inconsistency between attitude objects’ attributes, independent of these attributes’ valence. In research on person perception, semantic incongruence is usually studied within the framework of Wiggins’s interpersonal circumplex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213481679">Abele &amp; Wojciszke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213481679">Paulhus &amp; John, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0146167213481679">Wiggins, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0146167213481679">Wiggins, Trapnell, &amp; Phillips, 1988</xref>). The interpersonal circumplex is spanned by two orthogonal dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167213481679">Figure 1</xref>)—agency (e.g., dominant, persistent, assertive) and communion (e.g., soft-hearted, charitable, kind). Wiggins’s model can parsimoniously organize psychological attributes describing cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213481679">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>), groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213481679">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>), other persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213481679">Abele &amp; Wojciszke, 2007</xref>), and self (i.e., personality traits; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Paulhus, &amp; Neberich, 2013</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>How does the model help to separate semantic incongruence from evaluative incongruence? The opening paragraph provides an illustrative example. Suppose that a person is high in both intelligence and humility. Intelligence is an agentic trait, while humility is a communal trait. To some extent, the possession of both attributes is incongruent in terms of their semantic content, as shown through their roughly 90° angle separation (i.e., orthogonality) in the circumplex model. In contrast, there is little content incongruence in a description of someone who is simultaneously high in intelligence and high in creativity (both agency traits with roughly 5° separation) or simultaneously high in humility and helpfulness (both communal traits with roughly 5° separation). Note that, in each of these cases, all of the traits are evaluated very favorably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213481679">Abele, Uchronski, Suitner, &amp; Wojciszke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213481679">Anderson, 1968</xref>), and thus evaluative incongruence is very low (or absent). That is, it is the meaning of the traits <italic>per se</italic> and not their evaluative tone that is incongruent.</p>
<p>The main aim of the present research was to test whether semantic incongruence causes felt ambivalence independently of evaluative incongruence. Researchers have speculated that semantic incongruence might be even more prevalent as a source of felt ambivalence than is evaluative incongruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213481679">Epstein, 1980</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167213481679">Thompson &amp; Zanna, 1995</xref>). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, attitude research has never empirically tested whether semantic incongruence even contributes to felt ambivalence. We therefore sought to close this empirical gap. As such, the present research may also help to bridge research on person perception and attitudes. The former has distinguished between semantic and evaluative incongruence, whereas the latter has studied the causes of felt ambivalence. This integration may make an important step toward solving the long-standing puzzle about the elusive causes of felt ambivalence.</p>
<p>A second aim of the present research was to distinguish between two forms of evaluative incongruence as well as two forms of semantic incongruence. Specifically, past research has derived indicators of evaluative incongruence by either one of two means. One method capitalized on <italic>valence norms</italic> of attitude objects’ attributes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>—Studies 2 and 3). The other method capitalized on participants’ <italic>idiosyncratic self-reports</italic> of attributes’ valences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>—Study 1). It is not yet clear whether both of these procedures are strictly interchangeable. An obvious psychological assumption is that <italic>norm-based</italic> incongruence is merely a (somewhat cruder) proxy for the latter <italic>self-based</italic> incongruence, which actually resides in the individual’s thinking. If so, norm-based incongruence effects on felt ambivalence should vanish when self-based incongruence is additionally considered. In statistical terms—self-based incongruence should fully mediate the effect of norm-based incongruence on felt ambivalence.</p>
<p>However, there is also an important conceptual difference between norm-based and self-based incongruence. Specifically, <italic>norm-based</italic> incongruence largely reflects consensually held, culture-based incongruence, whereas <italic>self-based</italic> incongruence largely reflects consciously held, idiosyncrasy-based incongruence (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213481679">M. A. Olson &amp; Fazio, 2004</xref>). Given this conceptual difference, there are at least two reasons that norm-based incongruence may predict felt ambivalence over and above self-based incongruence. First, norm-based incongruence includes extrapersonal representations, which can exert effects independently of intrapersonal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Nehrlich, Sedikides, &amp; Neberich, in press</xref>). Second, norm-based incongruence may shape implicit associations in memory, which can exert effects independently of conscious, self-reported associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Göritz, Hofmann, &amp; Sedikides, 2012</xref>). Both of these factors are likely to be important in the context of predicting felt ambivalence because, as noted earlier, the attitudes of others are important for predicting personal feelings of ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 2001</xref>), and the likelihood of simultaneous coactivation of opposing attributes is an important predictor of felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al., 2002</xref>). These possible roles become even more tangible in light of the paradigm we use in the present research, which focuses on personal attributes. Our mental representations of personal attributes show a deep level of mental organization. There is evidence for implicit memory effects involving the Big Five personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213481679">Edwards &amp; Collins, 2008</xref>) and social values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213481679">Pakizeh, Gebauer, &amp; Maio, 2007</xref>), and the interpersonal circumplex can organize traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213481679">Digman, 1997</xref>) and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213481679">Trapnell &amp; Paulhus, 2012</xref>). Agentic and communal traits can be distinguished even at very early stages of information processing—stages that hardly reach consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167213481679">Abele &amp; Bruckmüller, 2011</xref>). Finally, the implicit semantics of traits can predict behavior over and above the corresponding explicit semantics of these traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213481679">Perkins &amp; Forehand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167213481679">Schnabel, Asendorpf, &amp; Greenwald, 2008</xref>). Overall, then, felt ambivalence may well be independently caused by (a) norm-based evaluative incongruence, (b) self-based evaluative incongruence, (c) norm-based semantic incongruence, and (d) self-based semantic incongruence, albeit much—but not all—of the norm-based incongruence effects should be mediated by self-based incongruence effects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167213481679">Figure 2</xref> displays the resultant model.</p>

</fig>
<p>The final aim of the present research was to examine the role of <italic>dissonant feelings</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213481679">Festinger, 1957</xref>) in evaluative and semantic incongruence effects on felt ambivalence. Dissonant feelings are affect-laden and aversive in nature, and they have been repeatedly linked to evaluative conflict between beliefs about personal actions (and their consequences) and personal attitudes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213481679">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>). Consequently, we expected dissonant feelings to arise from evaluative incongruence. However, we are not aware of any research revealing a link between semantic incongruence and dissonant feelings. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213481679">Festinger’s (1957)</xref> cognitive dissonance theory was consistent with this possibility, subsequent research has repeatedly revealed the affect-laden and aversive nature of dissonant feelings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213481679">Cooper, Zanna, &amp; Taves, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213481679">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>; Zanna, Higgins, &amp; Taves, 1978). This is theoretically different from the state elicited by semantic incongruence. As described in the aforementioned literature on person perception, semantic incongruence is theoretically more akin to a cognitive state of puzzlement from the lack of fit between different mental contents. For instance, a person who is highly intelligent yet humble might elicit a sense that “something is not quite right,” but might not elicit an aversive arousal because, after all, the evaluative implications of both traits are quite favorable. Semantic incongruence does not entail a tension between different <italic>feelings</italic>, whereas evaluative incongruence inherently does. Felt ambivalence may arise from both the cognitive disquiet inherent in semantic incongruence and from the emotional tension inherent in evaluative incongruence, with feelings of dissonance mediating the effects of the latter.</p>
<p>These hypotheses were tested across four experiments. These experiments progressed from examining the independent effects of norm-based semantic incongruence and norm-based evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence (Experiment 1) to examining the additional role of norm-based and self-based semantic and evaluative incongruence (Experiment 2) and examining the role of feelings of dissonance (Experiments 3a and 3b).</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>We designed this experiment to resemble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty’s (1996)</xref> seminal experiments on the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence. First, we aimed to replicate the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence. Second, and more important, we aimed to show that semantic incongruence explains felt ambivalence independently of the effect of evaluative incongruence. We deem this a conservative test of the semantic incongruence hypothesis, because the present design was adapted from Priester and Petty, who originally devised it to examine the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence.</p>

Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty (1996)</xref>, we examined felt ambivalence toward different target persons, who varied in their personality traits. Thus, the target persons constituted the attitude objects and their personality traits constituted their (more or less incongruent) attributes. Also in line with Priester and Petty, participants were instructed to rate their felt ambivalence toward each of 20 target persons, and for each target person, participants saw the target person’s two “most descriptive and prevalent personality characteristics.” These personality traits were randomly selected and paired from Wiggins’s interpersonal circumplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0146167213481679">Wiggins et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167213481679">Figure 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167213481679">Table 1</xref>’s second and third column).</p>

<p>Because the interpersonal circumplex has been found to accompany an exhaustive list of personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167213481679">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0146167213481679">Wiggins, Phillips, &amp; Trapnell, 1989</xref>), random selection and pairing of traits helps to guarantee that our findings are generally applicable, rather than valid only for a small and specific subset of traits.

<title>Norm-based manipulation of evaluative incongruence</title>
<p>As described above, we randomly selected 40 personality traits (i.e., attitude objects’ attributes) and randomly paired them, yielding 20 target persons (i.e., attitude objects). Because the selected personality traits naturally vary in their valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213481679">Abele et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213481679">Anderson, 1968</xref>), it follows that the degree of evaluative incongruence also varies naturally between each resultant pair of attributes. This variation leads to a natural manipulation of evaluative incongruence between target persons. We followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty’s (1996)</xref> strategy to use valence norms for each personality trait to derive an objective evaluative incongruence score for each target person.

<title>Dependence Between Evaluative Incongruence and Semantic Incongruence</title>
<p>The design also allowed us to examine the dependence between evaluative incongruence and semantic incongruence. Knowledge of this dependence is important for our further analyses. Specifically, if the two types of incongruence are dependent, it becomes necessary to control for one type of incongruence in the analyses of the other type to know which type of incongruence actually causes a given effect.</p>
<p>Past theory and research strongly suggests that evaluative and semantic incongruence are partly dependent. This should be the case because evaluative and semantic content of traits are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Haddock, Broemer, &amp; von Hecker, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Wagner, Sedikides, &amp; Neberich, in press</xref>). The conflicting evaluations implied by traits at opposite ends of the same semantic continuum are likely to also be evaluatively conflicting. Also, human thought and behavior is fundamentally driven by the desire to maximize self-profitability, and other persons who possess communal traits serve better to maximize self-profitability than other persons who possess agentic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213481679">Abele &amp; Wojciszke, 2007</xref>). Thus, communal traits are more positively evaluated in others than are agentic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Leary, &amp; Neberich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167213481679">Wojciszke, Baryla, Parzuchowski, Szymkow, &amp; Abele, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the dependence between norm-based evaluative incongruence and norm-based semantic incongruence, we correlated <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167213481679">Table 1</xref>’s evaluative and semantic incongruence indices across the 20 target persons. As expected, there was a significant correlation between evaluative and semantic incongruence, <italic>r</italic>(20) = .53, <italic>p</italic> = .02. Thus, it is important to control for the effects of semantic incongruence when examining the effects of evaluative incongruence and to control for the effects of evaluative incongruence when examining the effects of semantic incongruence.</p>

Nevertheless, the effect of evaluative incongruence remained significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167213481679">Table 2</xref>). Thus, adapting a classic design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>), the present research is the first to disentangle evaluative and semantic incongruence, showing that both types of incongruence have substantial effects on felt ambivalence.</p>

<p>The design used in the present research (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>) can afford a small number of participants per experiment, because target persons constitute the level of analyses and each participant rates 20 target persons, yielding <italic>N</italic> × 20 lines of data. However, small numbers of participants come with the risk that results can be highly influenced by the responses of a few atypical participants. For this reason, it is particularly important to demonstrate replicability of these results across several experiments. Such replications demonstrate the robustness of the uncovered effects even more strongly than a single experiment with a large number of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213481679">Fiedler &amp; Kareev, 2006</xref>). Thus, the first aim of Experiment 2 was to replicate Experiment 1. The second aim of Experiment 2 was to examine the role of self-based semantic and evaluative incongruence in Experiment 1’s effects. This enabled us to test whether norm-based and self-based semantic and evaluative incongruence each have independent effects on feelings of ambivalence.</p>

<title>Validity Check</title>
<p>This experiment affords verification of the norm-based manipulations of evaluative and semantic incongruence as well as the self-based measures of evaluative and semantic incongruence. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167213481679">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref>, we should obtain support for a particular nomological net. Specifically, norm-based evaluative incongruence should be primarily related to self-based evaluative incongruence, but not to self-based semantic incongruence. In addition, norm-based semantic incongruence should be primarily related to self-based semantic incongruence, but not to self-based evaluative incongruence.</p>
<p>To test for these relations, we conducted two analyses. First, we simultaneously predicted self-based evaluative incongruence with norm-based evaluative incongruence and norm-based semantic incongruence, while controlling for self-based semantic incongruence. In line with predictions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167213481679">Table 3</xref>’s first data column shows that norm-based evaluative incongruence strongly predicted self-based evaluative incongruence, whereas <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167213481679">Table 3</xref>’s second data column shows that norm-based semantic incongruence did not predict self-based evaluative incongruence. Second, we simultaneously predicted self-based semantic incongruence with norm-based evaluative incongruence and norm-based semantic incongruence, while controlling for self-based evaluative incongruence. In line with predictions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167213481679">Table 3</xref>’s third data column shows that norm-based evaluative incongruence very weakly, and negatively, predicted self-based semantic incongruence, whereas <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167213481679">Table 3</xref>’s fourth data column shows that norm-based semantic incongruence strongly predicted self-based semantic incongruence. Thus, the suitability of our manipulations and self-report measures was supported.</p>

<title>Experiments 3a and 3b</title>
<p>Experiments 3a and 3b were identical and each study examined the role of dissonant feelings. As detailed in the introduction, we expected dissonant feelings to play a unique role in evaluative incongruence effects, but not in semantic incongruence effects. Semantic incongruence’s independence of dissonant feelings would buttress the view that the effects of semantic incongruence are distinct from those of evaluative incongruence.</p>

<title>Procedure and Measures</title>
<p>The experiments were identical to Experiment 2 with one addition. Specifically, at the phase where participants were asked to rate their felt ambivalence toward each target person, participants were also asked to rate their dissonant feelings toward each target person. Items to assess felt ambivalence and dissonant feelings were presented in a randomized order. Below, we only describe the measure of dissonant feelings (because the remaining tasks were the same as in the prior experiments). As in Experiments 1 and 2, the measure of felt ambivalence exhibited high internal consistency (Experiment 3a: α = .86; Experiment 3b: α = .87).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0146167213481679">
<title>Dissonant feelings</title>
<p>The measure of dissonant feelings was closely modeled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213481679">Festinger’s (1957)</xref> description of dissonance (for a similar approach, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213481679">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>). Specifically, for each target person, participants completed the following three items: “I feel an unpleasant tension when imagining this person,” “I experience a feeling of unease when thinking about this person,” and “I experience an aversive feeling when thinking about this person.” Internal consistency of this three-item measure was high (Experiment 3a: α = .89; Experiment 3b: α = .90).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0146167213481679">Table 4</xref>’s first data column shows a significant effect of norm-based evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence, despite controlling for self-based evaluative incongruence.

Analogously, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0146167213481679">Table 5</xref>’s first data column shows a significant effect of norm-based semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence, despite controlling for self-based semantic incongruence.

Thus, across two studies, Experiment 2’s results were fully replicated. (As in Experiment 2, the analyses described in this paragraph controlled for norm-based and self-based semantic incongruence in all analyses involving evaluative incongruence, and controlled for norm-based and self-based evaluative incongruence in all analyses involving semantic incongruence.)</p>

<title>The Role of Dissonant Feelings</title>
<p>Do aversive dissonant feelings play a role in evaluative incongruence effects, and are semantic incongruence effects free from aversive dissonant feelings? We first tested whether manipulated evaluative incongruence caused dissonant feelings, controlling for manipulated semantic incongruence. As expected, this was the case in Experiment 3a, β = .20, <italic>SE</italic> = .04, <italic>t</italic>(554) = 5.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and in Experiment 3b, β = .20, <italic>SE</italic> = .02, <italic>t</italic>(1103) = 8.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. At the same time, we examined whether manipulated semantic incongruence caused dissonant feelings, controlling for manipulated evaluative incongruence. As expected, this was neither the case in Experiment 3a, β = .03, <italic>SE</italic> = .03, <italic>t</italic>(554) = .93, <italic>p</italic> = .35, nor in Experiment 3b, β = .04, <italic>SE</italic> = .02, <italic>t</italic>(1103) = 1.59, <italic>p</italic> = .11.</p>
<p>Second, we examined the processing role of dissonant feelings using the meditational tests described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167213481679">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167213481679">Sobel (1982)</xref>. Given that semantic incongruence was not a significant predictor of dissonant feelings, dissonant feelings could not mediate the effect of semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence in these analyses. In contrast, evaluative incongruence did significantly affect dissonant feelings, and this effect was similar in size to the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167213481679">Table 2</xref>). Thus, dissonant feelings were a potential mediator of the effects of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167213481679">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, controlling for dissonant feelings reduced the direct effect of manipulated evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence in Experiment 3a, β = .15, <italic>SE</italic> = .04, <italic>t</italic>(553) = 3.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and in Experiment 3b, β = .15, <italic>SE</italic> = .02, <italic>t</italic>(1102) = 6.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Furthermore, the meditational path was significant in Experiment 3a, <italic>z</italic> = 3.47, <italic>SE</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and Experiment 3b, <italic>z</italic> = 5.89, <italic>SE</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0146167213481679">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results surrounding dissonant feelings make three relevant points. First, dissonant feelings played no role in the effect of manipulated semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence. In fact, manipulated semantic incongruence did not reliably affect dissonant feelings. Thus, dissonant feelings do not pose a validity-threat to the semantic incongruence hypothesis. Second, the finding that evaluative incongruence—but not semantic incongruence—caused dissonant feelings is interesting, considering that both types of incongruence predict felt ambivalence. This pattern suggests that there exists a clear functional difference between evaluative incongruence and semantic incongruence. This pattern also suggests that there is a clear functional difference between felt ambivalence and dissonant feelings, and the latter conclusion is corroborated by the fact that there was only small to moderate overlap between dissonant feelings and felt ambivalence in Experiment 3a, β = .33, <italic>SE</italic> = .05, <italic>t</italic>(555) = 6.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and in Experiment 3b, β = .39, <italic>SE</italic> = .04, <italic>t</italic>(1104) = 10.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Finally, although not focal to the present research, Experiments 3a and 3b consistently found that dissonant feelings play a (specific) processing role for evaluative incongruence effects on felt ambivalence.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>People feel at least somewhat ambivalent toward most attitude objects (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0146167213481679">Zaller &amp; Feldman, 1992</xref>). At the same time, such felt ambivalence exerts a variety of important effects on human cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213481679">Clark et al., 2008</xref>), emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213481679">Haddock &amp; Gebauer, 2011</xref>), and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213481679">Jonas et al., 1997</xref>). Not surprisingly then, understanding the causes of felt ambivalence is central in attitude research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>). Originally, attitude researchers hypothesized that felt ambivalence is largely—if not exclusively—caused by valence inconsistencies between attitude objects’ attributes (i.e., evaluative incongruence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213481679">Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167213481679">J. M. Olson &amp; Zanna, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167213481679">Wegener et al., 1995</xref>). Given the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, it may seem paradoxical that study after study found that evaluative incongruence only explains a modest percentage of variance in felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481679">Thompson et al., 1995</xref>). Echoing this, a meta-analysis across 27 samples estimated that evaluative incongruence only explains 19% of the variance in felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213481679">Riketta, 2004</xref>). Several influential studies have been conducted in response to this paradox. These studies either identified specific conditions under which valence inconsistencies between attitude objects’ attributes are particularly predictive of felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al., 2002</xref>), or these studies identified alternative types of valence inconsistencies (i.e., between personal evaluations and evaluations by close others) that predict felt ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 2001</xref>). These attempts were successful in narrowing the gap between evaluative incongruence and felt ambivalence, but they also revealed the need to identify additional causes of felt ambivalence.</p>
<p>The present research responded to this need. We built on the observation that all prior research sought the causes of felt ambivalence in <italic>valence</italic> inconsistencies, and we hypothesized that other types of inconsistencies may also cause felt ambivalence. We drew on classic person perception evidence for two major types of inconsistencies: evaluative incongruence and semantic incongruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167213481679">Peabody, 1970</xref>). Our main hypothesis was that semantic incongruence may cause felt ambivalence independently of the well-established—but modest—effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence. In addition, we had two ancillary hypotheses. First, we distinguished between self-based incongruence (reflecting consciously held, self-reported incongruence) and norm-based incongruence (reflecting norm-list derived, culture-based incongruence), and we hypothesized that norm-based evaluative incongruence, self-based evaluative incongruence, norm-based semantic incongruence, and self-based semantic incongruence all explain unique portions of variance in felt ambivalence. Second, we hypothesized that dissonant feelings play a unique processing role in the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence, but that dissonant feelings are not involved in the effect of semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence.</p>
<p>Four experiments fully supported our hypotheses. Each experiment consistently revealed that semantic incongruence helps to close the gap between incongruence and felt ambivalence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167213481679">Table 2</xref>). In addition, Experiments 2, 3a, and 3b consistently revealed that self-based and norm-based semantic incongruence are independently useful toward closing this gap (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167213481679">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0146167213481679">4</xref>). But how useful is the <italic>collective</italic> of norm-based evaluative incongruence, self-based evaluative incongruence, norm-based semantic incongruence, and self-based semantic incongruence in explaining felt ambivalence? To address this question, we aggregated the data from our three relevant experiments (Experiments 2, 3a, and 3b). In close replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213481679">Riketta’s (2004)</xref> meta-analytic results, norm-based evaluative incongruence alone only explained 17% of the variance in felt ambivalence. In contrast, norm-based evaluative incongruence and norm-based semantic incongruence together explained 28% of the variance in felt ambivalence. Finally, the collection of all four types of incongruence (norm-based evaluative incongruence, self-based evaluative incongruence, norm-based semantic incongruence, and self-based semantic incongruence) explained 37% of the variance in felt ambivalence. This corresponds to an omnibus effect of <italic>r</italic> ≈ .60.</p>
<p>Considering the different measurement methods underlying the different incongruence scores and felt ambivalence scores, an omnibus effect of <italic>r</italic> ≈ .60 is large. Furthermore, past research has identified conditions under which this omnibus effect should be even stronger. This should arise when the cognitive accessibility of incongruent attributes is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al., 2002</xref>), individuals score highly on relevant personality factors (e.g., self-monitoring—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481679">Cowley &amp; Czellar, 2012</xref>), and causes of felt ambivalence other than intrapersonal incongruence (i.e., interpersonal incongruence) are included as predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 2001</xref>). Considering these additional sources of variance, the omnibus effect size in the present experiments can even be described as very large. Hence, the introduction of semantic incongruence (and to a lesser degree, the distinction between norm-based and self-based incongruence) considerably narrows the gap between incongruence and felt ambivalence.</p>
<p>The present research raises several interesting questions for future research. First, how much variance may the tandem of evaluative and semantic incongruence explain in felt ambivalence under conditions that favor incongruence effects on felt ambivalence—that is, under conditions of high cognitive accessibility of incongruent attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al., 2002</xref>), among individuals high in preference for consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481679">Newby-Clark et al., 2002</xref>), and among individuals high in self-monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481679">Cowley &amp; Czellar, 2012</xref>)? May the tandem of evaluative and semantic incongruence be able to fully close the gap between incongruence and felt ambivalence under these conditions?</p>
<p>Second, is the effect of semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence direct or mediated by another psychological variable? Experiments 3a and 3b have revealed that aversive dissonant feelings constituted a processing variable for the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence, while aversive dissonant feelings did not constitute a processing variable for the effect on semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence. Analogously, there may be processing variables that uniquely drive the effect of semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence. One candidate variable is feelings of uncertainty, which predict feelings of ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167213481679">Petrocelli, Tormala, &amp; Petty, 2007</xref>). However, prior research has suggested links between uncertainty and aversive feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213481679">Jonas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213481679">van Harreveld, Rutjens, Rotteveel, Nordgren, &amp; van der Pligt, 2009</xref>), and our results showed that aversive dissonant feelings played no role in the effect of semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence. Another candidate variable is disfluency—the difficulty with which the attributes of an attitude object can be integrated into a coherent whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167213481679">Schwarz, 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213481679">Briñol, Petty, &amp; Tormala, 2006</xref>). Indeed, prior research has found that semantic incongruence can slow processing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213481679">Pakizeh et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that semantic incongruence causes disfluency.</p>
<p>Third, the present research was largely built on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty’s (1996)</xref> study design (e.g., using persons as attitude objects). Yet, there is also one noteworthy difference between Priester and Petty’s and our design. Specifically, the former design varied the relative number of positive versus negative attributes of the target persons. In contrast, our design described each target person via two attributes, which varied in their degree or extremity of evaluative (and semantic) incongruence. This deviation from Priester and Petty’s design appeared necessary because it is not clear a priori how to calculate a suitable semantic incongruence index on the basis of more than two attributes. Of course, this is not to say that such an index cannot be derived, and future research could attend to this issue. Reminiscent of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty’s (1996)</xref> work, such research would probably have to compare the predictive validity of different semantic congruence formulae against each other. The results of the present research may serve as a benchmark for such a comparative approach.</p>
<p>Fourth, by adapting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty’s (1996)</xref> classic incongruence design, we examined the effect of incongruence on felt ambivalence within the context of person perception. Although there is no reason to believe that incongruence effects are restricted to felt ambivalence in person perception (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>), future research could empirically ascertain the explanatory power of semantic incongruence for felt ambivalence utilizing other attitude objects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213481679">Riketta and Ziegler (2007)</xref> have pointed toward the need to understand the cause of <italic>self-ambivalence</italic>. Given that the interpersonal circumplex also organizes self-perception (i.e., personality traits; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213481679">Paulhus &amp; John, 1998</xref>) semantic incongruence between self-ambivalent individuals’ personality traits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213481679">Gebauer, Sedikides, Verplanken, &amp; Maio, 2012</xref>) may be one such cause. Along similar lines, the interpersonal circumplex also organizes group perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213481679">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, semantic incongruence may well elicit ambivalent feelings toward groups such as housewives (high agency and high communion) or homeless people (low agency and low communion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213481679">Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick, 2007</xref>). Such ambivalent feelings, in turn, may help to explain subtle and blunt prejudice against these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167213481679">Pettigrew &amp; Meertens, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifth, are there conditions under which semantic incongruence does <italic>not</italic> predict felt ambivalence? An East-Asian cultural setting may be one such condition. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213481679">Peng and Nisbett (1999)</xref> suggested that the dialectic way of thinking in East-Asian cultures tolerates and even encourages semantically contradictory arguments. As such, semantic incongruence may be tolerated and even encouraged, thus reducing its effect on felt ambivalence.</p>
<p>Finally, future research could also examine potential effects of semantic incongruence on nonhuman attitude objects, such as consumer products. For example, imagine a car that is not only fast and sporty but also comfortable and spacious. Although these attributes are positive, we may not see them as associated in most vehicles; cars tend to be quick and easy to handle (e.g., sports cars) <italic>or</italic> large and spacious (e.g., SUVs). In a sense, these attributes become semantically incongruent for vehicles, despite being evaluatively congruent. We expect that the (vehicle-specific) semantic incongruence should create feelings of ambivalence in the same way as we have observed for persons.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Evaluative incongruence constitutes only a modest cause of felt ambivalence. The present research introduced semantic incongruence as a complementary form of incongruence and as an additional cause of felt ambivalence. Four experiments consistently revealed that semantic incongruence elicits felt ambivalence independently of evaluative incongruence. In fact, our results suggested that semantic incongruence is at least as strong a predictor of felt ambivalence as is evaluative incongruence. In addition, we consistently found that norm-based and self-based forms of incongruence independently predict felt ambivalence, and our results pointed toward different processes underlying the effects of evaluative incongruence and semantic incongruence on felt ambivalence: Only the former elicited dissonant feelings, which mediated the effect of evaluative incongruence on felt ambivalence. Taken together, these findings indicate that evaluative incongruence and semantic incongruence jointly determine why people possess those familiar and consequential feelings of ambivalence. Further explorations of this tandem operation may help to better understand the antecedents and consequences of felt ambivalence.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester and Petty (1996)</xref> used valence norms from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213481679">Anderson’s (1968)</xref> norm list. Thus, in addition to our evaluative incongruence index based on Cardiff norms, we calculated an evaluative incongruence index based on Anderson norms. The two indices were strongly correlated, <italic>r</italic>(20) = .71, <italic>p</italic> = .001.

This is not surprising, because Anderson’s valence norms are based on ratings from American colleague students in the 1960s.

<p>The intercomponent ambivalence model is calculated as follows: |Trait A| + |Trait B| − 2 × |Trait A + Trait B| + 72. In this model, Traits A and B are the valence ratings of each trait within a given target person. Importantly, this model is identical to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481679">Thompson, Zanna, and Griffin’s (1995)</xref> frequently used and well-validated similarity-intensity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481679">Priester &amp; Petty, 1996</xref>), if one trait is positive and the other trait is negative. However, in contrast to the similarity-intensity model, the intercomponent ambivalence model yields meaningful evaluative incongruence scores even when both traits are univalent (e.g., Trait A is slightly positive and Trait B is extremely positive). Past research has established that such univalent evaluative incongruence is an important part of ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213481679">Petty, Tormala, Briñol, &amp; Jarvis, 2006</xref>), irrespective of which, we additionally calculated an evaluative incongruence index based on the discrepancy between the traits of each target person while residualizing the absolute valences of each trait (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167213481679">Ullrich, Schermelleh-Engel, &amp; Böttcher, 2008</xref>). The resultant “residualized discrepancy index” was strongly correlated with our index based on the intercomponent ambivalence model, <italic>r</italic>(20) = .79, <italic>p</italic> = .001. When utilizing the residualized discrepancy index, evaluative incongruence effects were somewhat smaller than when utilizing the intercomponent ambivalence index. Correspondingly, when utilizing the residualized discrepancy index, <italic>semantic</italic> incongruence effects were <italic>comparatively larger</italic> than when utilizing the intercomponent ambivalence index. Hence to pit semantic incongruence against the <italic>most competitive</italic> form of evaluative incongruence, we examined our hypotheses utilizing the intercomponent ambivalence model. Hence, if anything, the decisions explained in this note and in Note 1 bias our results against semantic incongruence effects, rendering the present examination a particularly strong test of our hypotheses.</p>

<p>According to these results, dissonant feelings may function similar to self-based evaluative incongruence. Perhaps then, our measures of dissonant feelings and self-based evaluative incongruence assess the same construct.
