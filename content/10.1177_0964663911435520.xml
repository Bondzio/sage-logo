<abstract>
<p>On both sides of the Atlantic, states have tended to react nervously to reparative claims for slavery, just as they have tended to be wary of making apologies of any kind. In the absence of more radical gestures, public history has taken on an added significance, not least as a way of providing some kind of recompense for past suffering. But to what extent can public history be used to repair historical wrongs? This essay sets out to explore this question, taking as its point of departure the bicentenary of the abolition of the British slave trade (2007). In particular, it focuses on three inter-related areas of activity: heritage funding, museums and, finally, monuments and memorials. The 2007 commemorations generated a wide range of public history initiatives, from small-scale exhibitions, plays, workshops and installations to larger capital projects that in different ways, and with different degrees of success, reshaped representations of British transatlantic slavery and, in doing so, invited Britons to look again at the paradoxes embedded in national histories that first enslaved and then liberated persons of African descent.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s and 1960s, we have become accustomed to the idea of making recompense for slavery. Civil rights legislation in the United States, together with programmes like affirmative action, deliberately set out to rectify historic wrongs suffered by African Americans in the past, while more recently we have witnessed calls for governments to apologise for slavery, and, in some quarters, demands for reparations – a controversial issue that divides opinion on both sides of the Atlantic. The reluctance of many states to apologise for slavery, however, has led to increasing emphasis on other ways of offering blacks recompense for past injustices, notably public history. To what extent can education (broadly defined) be used to repair historical wrongs? This essay sets out to explore this question, taking as its point of departure the recent bicentenary (in 2007) of the abolition of the British slave trade. In particular, it focuses on three inter-related areas of activity: heritage funding, museums and, finally, monuments and memorials. As we shall see, 2007 generated a wide range of public history initiatives that in different ways, and with different degrees of success, opened up discussions about slavery and the slave trade and, in doing so, sought to raise awareness of the damaging legacy of enslavement.</p>
<sec id="section1-0964663911435520">
<title>Background</title>
<p>During the 17th and 18th centuries, slavery was recognised and accepted as an avoidable and, some might have said, necessary adjunct of European empire. The rise of plantation complexes in the New World that depended on enslaved rural labour forces imported from Africa underpinned imperialistic expansion in the Americas, at the same time creating important links between economic interests and state power. All of the major European powers at one time or another entered the Atlantic slave trade, just as most of them possessed slave colonies. Yet it was the British who came to dominate the slave trade. At its height, British Empire ships carried more slaves than any other nation, their slave colonies produced vast quantities of tropical goods, and the country as a whole grew rich on the profits of African slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663911435520">Klein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663911435520">Richardson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663911435520">Walvin, 2000</xref>). It is all the more remarkable, then, that it was the British who led the struggle to bring slavery to an end: in 1807 they acted decisively to end British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, and then in 1833 to abolish slavery in the British West Indies. In fact, ‘abolition’ was to emerge as one of the most popular reform movements of the 18th and 19th centuries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663911435520">Blackburn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663911435520">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663911435520">Davis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This complex history, in turn, had an impact on how Britons remembered slavery. British involvement in transatlantic slavery was set aside and forgotten. In its place, Britons substituted a ‘culture of abolitionism’ that celebrated the nation’s moral leadership and legitimised its (imperialistic) claims to defend those who were too weak to defend themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663911435520">Oldfield, 2007</xref>: 2–3, 88–92). Challenges to this dominant white discourse were slow to emerge, at least with any force, but in recent years they have grown apace, stimulated in large part by societal changes, as well as broadly political and cultural forces, among them debates about diversity and multiculturalism. Another important impetus has come from below. In the English-speaking Caribbean, for instance, the years following independence witnessed the emergence of alternative versions of the slave past, many of them shaped by the work of black intellectuals like Eric Williams and CLR James. These trends mirrored developments in the United States, where during the 1960s blacks started to reclaim their history, aided in many instances by white scholars who took it upon themselves to revise traditional accounts of transatlantic slavery. Determined to unravel and document ‘the world the slaves made’ (the emphasis was important), scholars increasingly turned their attention to what had hitherto been neglected areas of slave life, including family life, religion and notions of community. Suspicious of what in the past had undoubtedly been an over-reliance on ‘white’ perspectives, scholars on both sides of the Atlantic called instead for much greater emphasis on black agency, and, just as important, African ‘voices’ (see, in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663911435520">Blassingame, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663911435520">Genovese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663911435520">Kolchin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663911435520">Walvin, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>One obvious side-effect was a growing interest in black resistance. Taking their cue from Michael Foucault, who argued that resistance was a sine qua non of all power relations, historians began to rethink the boundaries of slavery, stressing the importance of acts ranging from quiet sabotage (sham pregnancies, breaking tools, going slow in the fields) to organising and fighting back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663911435520">Berlin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663911435520">Foucault, 1978</xref>). They also began to explore the enduring significance of cultural resistance – that is, the refusal to abandon one’s values and traditions – evident in such things as black folklore, marriage, burial and mourning practices, and, above all, music. According to this view, enslaved Africans were not passive victims but historical actors in their own right, capable of retaining a sense of their cultural integrity, as well as forging common cultural memories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663911435520">Gilroy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663911435520">Scott, 1990</xref>). Resistance, as a result, has become an important interpretative tool and one that, as we shall see, has had an impact far beyond the academy, even if it sometimes runs the risk of obscuring the traumatic and often brutal aspects of transatlantic slavery.</p>
<p>Not content with reclaiming their history, blacks also began to embrace the idea of making claims for atonement, including reparations, a movement that since the 1970s has gained momentum in Britain, Africa and the United States (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663911435520">Bittker, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663911435520">Brooks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663911435520">Robinson, 2000</xref>). The reparations issue is interesting, not least because it bears directly on the relationship between slavery and commemoration. Unlike other specific claims for reparations – in the case of Japanese ‘comfort’ women or Rwandan genocide survivors, for instance – reparative claims for slavery involve intergenerational legacies; that is to say, the claim here is made not by the immediate victims but by their descendants, for wrongdoings suffered in the past. Assessing the validity of these claims is, as a result, problematic, as is demonstrating how and to what extent present-day blacks have suffered as a result of slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663911435520">Winter, 2007</xref>). Reparative claims for slavery also involve multinational jurisdictions. Even if there were a single legal authority with the power to redistribute resources between different states, changing national or state identities (this is particularly the case in Africa since decolonisation) offers a further perceived obstacle to international rectificatory justice, a point addressed by Daniel Butt in his essay, in this issue. History, therefore, presses heavily on these claims, which is why in the United States attention has increasingly focused on tackling businesses and institutions (Brown University, for instance) that are known to have clear and demonstrable slave trade links.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0964663911435520">1</xref>
</sup> For these reasons, states have tended to react nervously to reparative claims for slavery and to keep them at arm’s length. One of the knock-on effects has also been wariness about making apologies for slavery. This has been particularly evident in the United States. In 2009, for instance, the United States Senate belatedly issued an apology for slavery but coupled it with a disclaimer that nothing in the resolution authorised any claim against the United States (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663911435520">
<italic>National Public Radio</italic>, 2009</xref>). Similarly, in 2007, the Virginia General Assembly limited itself to an expression of ‘profound regret’ for slavery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663911435520">Koch, 2007</xref>). In these and other cases, the obvious fear has been that by apologising for slavery states might find themselves exposed to future compensation claims. Efforts to commemorate transatlantic slavery, therefore, should be seen in this wider political context. In the absence of more radical gestures (such as apologies or reparations), heritage projects, memorials, and educational initiatives have taken on an added significance, not least as a way of providing some kind of recompense for past suffering.</p>

<title>Britain and 2007</title>
<p>Although many countries, including the United States and parts of Africa and the Caribbean, have started to commemorate slavery, Britain presents an interesting case study, not least because of the excitement surrounding the 2007 bicentenary of the abolition of the British slave trade. As the anniversary approached and thoughts turned to marking it in some way, Britons were faced with a number of awkward questions, chief of which was: who and what should be remembered? For some, the challenge was clear. As Gary Streeter, Conservative MP for South-West Devon, told the House of Commons in 2004 in a debate on the then forthcoming bicentenary:<disp-quote>
<p>there must be an acknowledgement of the part that the country played in this appalling atrocity; that what we did was wrong; that it is a scar on our history, and is only partly redeemed by the fact that we led the way in the abolition of the trade and then the abolition of slavery. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663911435520">
<italic>Hansard</italic>, 2004</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>Many other MPs voiced similar sentiments, fuelling a sense that 2007 offered an opportunity not simply to ‘do justice’ to slavery but also to ‘ensure that we learn the lesson of the past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663911435520">
<italic>Hansard</italic>, 2004</xref>). The question was how? Here, opinion was more divided. If many MPs stepped back from endorsing reparations or even an apology of some sort, there was support for a national slavery remembrance day, a permanent commemoration that, in the words of one of the scheme’s leading proponents, would recognise the indignity of transatlantic slavery, celebrate black resistance, and emphasise the links between slavery and modern-day racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663911435520">
<italic>Hansard</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The government’s official response, when it finally came, was carefully calibrated. As his critics had feared he might do, Prime Minister Tony Blair neatly sidestepped the question of making an apology for Britain’s involvement in the slave trade, limiting himself to an expression of ‘regret’ that something bad had happened. The message he and his ministers wished to convey, it seemed, was rather different: namely, that 2007 offered an opportunity for <italic>all </italic>Britons (the emphasis was important) to reflect on ‘the spirit of freedom, justice and equality that characterised the efforts of the early abolitionists’, ‘the same spirit that drives our determination to fight injustice and inequality today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663911435520">Government Press Notice, 2007</xref>). The government, in short, chose to focus on abolition rather than slavery, and, in doing so, posited a clear link between abolitionism and modern human rights campaigns, setting them within the same moral and political orbit. This – and not reparations – was the real meaning of the government’s decision to commit itself to an ambitious initiative aimed at tackling poverty and inequality in Africa and the Caribbean, racism in the UK, and contemporary slavery in all its forms. In making these commitments, the government imposed its own shape on the 2007 bicentenary, summed up in the slogan ‘reflecting on the past and looking to the future’ (Department for Culture, Media and Sport, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663911435520">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of commemoration, this message was reinforced via an adaptive process that ironically breathed new life into Britain’s ‘culture of abolitionism’. Perhaps the best example of this was the series of six postage stamps produced by the Royal Mail to commemorate 2007. As Marcus Wood has observed, ‘British commemorative stamps constitute a semiotic environment that has always been, and remains, heartily and unapologetically, celebratory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663911435520">2010</xref>: 180); 2007 was no exception. All six stamps produced by the Royal Mail focused on specific individuals, among them Granville Sharp, William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson. To this extent, the stamps evoked a well-established and essentially white heroic paradigm. But in adopting this celebratory stance, the Royal Mail was also careful to extend its frame of reference to include two black figures, Olaudah Equiano and Ignatius Sancho. Significantly, it also included one woman in the shape of Hannah More, who, in this context is best remembered for her <italic>Slavery: A Poem</italic> (1789). Equally revealing was the deliberate pairing or ‘twinning’ of these stamps in ascending monetary value: Wilberforce with Equiano (34p), Sharp with Clarkson (50p), and More with Sancho (72p).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0964663911435520">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Transatlantic slavery, when it was mentioned at all, was left for others to deal with. Particularly significant in this regard was the decision of the Department of Education and Skills to make slavery a compulsory part of the National Curriculum, thereby setting it on a par with the Holocaust. Briefly, what this meant was that from this date (2007), all children aged 11 to 14 (Key Stage 3) would be introduced to the subject of slavery, either as part of the history syllabus or as part of classes on citizenship. While teachers retained a degree of flexibility over what they taught in the classroom, the clear intention was to deepen students’ understanding of slavery, as well as to increase awareness of the legacy of enslavement. To this end, throughout 2007, the Department of Education and Skills worked closely with the team behind ‘Understanding Slavery’, a national education project pioneered by the National Maritime Museum in London, National Museums Liverpool, the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum in Bristol, Bristol City Museums, and Hull Museums and Art Gallery, to develop suitable resources for Key Stage 3 students. Clearly nervous about making an official apology for slavery, the government instead put its faith in educational initiatives to change attitudes about slavery and racism, thereby shifting the burden of responsibility to schools and schoolteachers.<sup>

<sec id="section3-0964663911435520">
<title>The Heritage Lottery Fund and 2007</title>
<p>One of the most intriguing and certainly most far-reaching interventions into this debate came from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). Established under the National Lottery Act (1993), the HLF is a non-governmental public body accountable to the British Parliament through the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Though not autonomous, its policy decisions are ‘entirely independent’ of the government, which in practice means that it enjoys considerable latitude in determining which projects it chooses to support. The HLF’s definition of ‘heritage’ is, in its own words, ‘broad, progressive and inclusive’ (Heritage Lottery Fund, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663911435520">2011</xref>). Non-political in its outlook, it nevertheless believes that ‘understanding, valuing and sharing our diverse histories changes lives, brings people together and provides the foundation of a confident modern society’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0964663911435520">4</xref>
</sup> It was with these aims in mind that in June 2006 the HLF launched a new initiative called ‘Remembering Slavery’, although it is worth noting that by this date it had already made over 40 awards with a total value of over £10 million to projects relating to the bicentenary of the abolition of the British slave trade, including £1.6 million to National Museums Liverpool to establish a new National Centre for the Understanding of Slavery, £800,500 to Wilberforce House Museum in Hull, and £653,000 to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery to create an exhibition and education programme related to the black abolitionist Olaudah Equiano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663911435520">Heritage Lottery Fund, 2006a</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>By definition, these were large capital projects intended to have a lasting impact. At the same time, however, the HLF was keen to encourage community-based projects linked to the anniversary and, more important still, to involve ‘black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups’ in ‘HLF2007’. Indeed, one of the key objectives of ‘Remembering Slavery’ was to engage with communities that hitherto had not accessed significant amounts of HLF funding, thereby providing them with the experience and know-how to ‘access money from what [were] effectively generic programmes involving a competitive process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663911435520">Heritage Lottery Fund, 2009</xref>: 2). The response was enthusiastic. Initiatives came from all parts of the country, including Scotland, Wales, the Midlands, Yorkshire, and the Humber. Equally striking, an impressively wide range of organisations gained support from the HLF, among them schools, museums, archives, local authorities, community groups, theatre companies, and arts organisations. In all, the HLF funded over 280 projects connected with the bicentenary – ranging from capital projects to touring exhibitions and workshops in local schools – at a total cost of between £15 and £20 million, or roughly 10 per cent of its operating budget.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0964663911435520">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Several things were interesting about ‘Remembering Slavery’. One was the aim to embed slavery in British national history; that is, to see it not as something distant and best understood in terms of the Empire or British colonial history, but as part of the web and weave of everyday life. Many of the projects supported by the HLF, for instance, explored the slave trade links of specific regions and localities, often with the intention of challenging national orthodoxies or making connections where none had been thought to exist. Others sought to allow black communities to tell stories about themselves; hence the emphasis on opening up heritage collections and preserving documents relating to slavery and the slave trade.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0964663911435520">6</xref>
</sup> Nothing was ruled out. Funds could be used to document the lives of black campaigners like Equiano, but equally they could be used to commemorate the work of William Wilberforce, the chief parliamentary supporter of abolition. The overriding factor was that projects should aim to conserve the UK’s diverse heritage and to highlight the diverse way in which Britishness is imagined. In design and conception, therefore, ‘Remembering Slavery’ was an ambitious initiative, framed by an agenda that at once set a value on inclusivity, creativity and accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663911435520">Heritage Lottery Fund, 2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>As the HLF would be the first to admit, it is difficult (if not impossible) to measure the impact of the approximately 280 projects it funded between 2005 and 2007. Many of these projects were short-lived and ephemeral; this was particularly true of small-scale exhibitions, plays, readings and installations. Others, like education packs, heritage trails and capital projects had a much longer shelf life, although here again one of the problems identified by the HLF in its review of its activity during 2005–2007 is ensuring that the momentum created by 2007 is not ‘lost’. Some projects, it seems, were abandoned because the organisers erroneously assumed that funding would not be available after 2007. More worrying perhaps was the slow take-up from BAME groups, and, linked to this, the inability of some of these organisations to run projects on an equal footing with larger mainstream organisations (for which, incidentally, the HLF accepts a large share of the responsibility) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663911435520">Heritage Lottery Fund, 2009</xref>: 4). Nevertheless, the HLF has played a vital role in shaping how the history of slavery and abolition is represented and remembered in the UK. As a non-governmental public body, it has been able to set its own agenda, which, crucially, has involved empowering minorities by giving them the means to tell their own stories and to ‘set the record straight’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0964663911435520">
<title>Museums</title>
<p>Most successful of all were the large capital projects funded by the HLF, among them the refurbishment of Wilberforce House Museum and the purchase of the Michael Graham-Stewart Slavery Collection for the National Maritime Museum in London.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0964663911435520">7</xref>
</sup> In the past 30 years museums have emerged as key sites of memory in relation to transatlantic slavery. There are a number of reasons for this. The language of diversity and more inclusive notions of Britishness placed new demands on museums and galleries. These pressures, not to mention new technologies and new approaches to the interpretation of texts, led in the 1980s to a radical reappraisal of the role of museums in modern society. In many museums today, visitors will find, and expect to find, discovery rooms, hands-on exhibits, and interactive video and audio recordings. Similarly, greater emphasis is placed on ‘enactive’ or ‘experimental’ modes of learning, whereby visitors acquire knowledge through demonstrations, role-playing, or handling objects. ‘New’ museums are also more user friendly, in the sense that they openly seek and encourage the involvement of their ‘customers’ through consultation groups, outreach programmes and dialogue with those (minorities, for instance) who might have been ignored in the past (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663911435520">Oldfield, 2007</xref>: 120–121).</p>
<p>The result in the case of transatlantic slavery was the opening of exhibitions in Bristol, Liverpool, Hull and London that were highly innovative, not least in their use of new technologies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0964663911435520">8</xref>
</sup> The year 2007 coincided with a fresh burst of activity, including the refurbishment of Wilberforce House Museum and the opening of new exhibitions and/or museums in Liverpool (The International Slavery Museum), Bristol (‘Breaking the Chains’ at the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum) and London (‘London, Sugar and Slavery’ at London’s Docklands Museum).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0964663911435520">9</xref>
</sup> Supported in most cases by ambitious outreach programmes and a wide range of educational resources, these slave museums offered fresh and, in some cases, challenging interpretations of slavery and abolition that problematised the African diaspora and, just as important, related it to contemporary concerns. There is not space here to discuss all of these museums/exhibitions in detail. Instead, I want to concentrate on the various ways in which they have re-imagined transatlantic slavery, and, in particular, how they deal with black resistance, a theme that has grown in importance since the 1980s.</p>
<p>First and foremost, all of these museums highlight the indignity of transatlantic slavery. At the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool this is realised through a Middle Passage panorama, a jarring series of sights and sounds that literally envelopes visitors and seems to take its cue from Steven Spielberg’s film, <italic>Amistad</italic>. This part of the gallery is dimly lit, all of the interpretation boards are black, instruments of torture are prominently displayed, and the sounds from the Middle Passage provide a constant backdrop, reminding visitors of the inhumanity of the slave trade. At London Docklands Museum, by contrast, the curators came up with a different approach. From the outset, visitors are invited to reflect on the meaning of slavery. An introductory film, for instance, explores the different ways in which slavery dehumanises human beings before bringing visitors up short with the statement, ‘I hope the slave trade <italic>will</italic> be abolished’. But perhaps the exhibition’s most effective innovation is a simple device that again demands that visitors ‘consider slavery and what it is’. At regular intervals throughout the day, the lights in the gallery dim and a disembodied voice proceeds to run through a list of abuses, which together ‘define’ slavery: ‘you will not speak your own language’, ‘you will be taken from your family’, ‘you will be someone’s property’, ‘you will have no privacy’, and so on.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0964663911435520">10</xref>
</sup> The effect created by this device is powerful. Visitors are literally compelled to stop and confront the meaning of slavery, not least as a lived experience.</p>
<p>Similarly, all of these museums stress what Africans did to resist slavery. In Bristol, for instance, visitors are told that African communities developed tactics, including fortified villages and an ‘alarm system’, to defend themselves against slave traders. Adopting the same approach, ‘Breaking the Chains’ notes that on the Middle Passage there was one slave rebellion on every 10 ships. The exhibition also contains a large section on slave resistance in the Americas, highlighting both the significance of passive resistance (language, culture, acts of sabotage) and slave rebellions. At the International Slavery Museum, meanwhile, resistance is wrapped into a much broader narrative charting the progress of human rights struggles from the late 18th century through the American Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement, and Anti-Slavery International’s campaign against modern slavery. Here again, this narrative highlights black resistance, particularly the role of slave rebellions in the early campaigns against slavery. The message is clear: ‘Resistance was on the minds of enslaved Africans from the first moment of captivity’, visitors are told. Moreover, ‘rebellion fuelled the campaigns in Europe to abolish the slave trade and then slavery itself’ – although how this took place is not made entirely clear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0964663911435520">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>All of this is a long way from those ‘orthodox’ histories that have tended to view slavery through the moral triumph of abolition. Instead, slave museums are keen to give a voice to black agency, just as they are keen to confront visitors with the indignity of transatlantic slavery. Perhaps just as importantly, these museums also inculcate a sense of black pride and achievement. The re-imagination of Africa is important here. In Bristol, for instance, there is a deliberate attempt to overturn negative images of Africa (such as AIDS, famine and genocide) and to replace them with more reassuring images of stable family life, vibrant modern cityscapes, and ancient civilisations. These exhibitions also emphasise the achievements of diasporic blacks in music, sports, politics and religion. The best example of this is the Black Achievers Wall at the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool. Such devices will always invite criticism, not least from those who believe that they detract attention away from the ‘real’ issues confronting black communities in the UK, but the Liverpool exhibition shows how successful they can be when they are embedded in a deeper sense of the legacy of slavery and how it has affected the development of all the countries involved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0964663911435520">12</xref>
</sup> These exhibitions, therefore, reflect and reinforce a very different outlook, one that is confrontational and at the same time affirmative, that celebrates blacks’ cultural achievements without diminishing the obstacles (racism, prejudice, discrimination) placed in their way.</p>

<title>Memorialising Slavery</title>
<p>What museums have been able to do, in others words, is to advance an agenda that might otherwise have been fiercely resisted, particularly if it had been promoted by the government or one or more of the UK’s political parties. Other projects, including attempts to memorialise slavery and the slave trade, have arguably been less successful. Monuments, like museums, are sites of memory that help to define the meaning of the past and, just as important, how it should be remembered. They also provide a focus for commemorative acts, for the rituals that bind communities and nations together (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663911435520">Levinson, 1998</xref>: 63–65, 137; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663911435520">Young, 1993</xref>). Since the 1980s, there has been increased activity in this area, a lot of it, significantly, outside the UK. Today, there are slave memorials in the Caribbean (Barbados and Jamaica), in Africa (Ouida, Goree, and Cape Town), and in parts of Europe (Nantes and Amsterdam). The United Nations has also recently announced plans for a permanent memorial ‘in honour of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade’, which eventually will be placed at its headquarters in New York.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0964663911435520">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Some of these memorials, particularly those in the Caribbean, celebrate slave rebel leaders and maroons like Bussa (Barbados) and Nanny (Jamaica). Others are more abstract, even minimalist, in their approach, consisting of simple shapes (eleven black granite blocks in the case of the Cape Town memorial) that evoke silence and the impossibility of fully comprehending and recovering the slave past. Still others are more complex and, for want of a better word, theatrical. The National Slavery Monument in Amsterdam’s Ostpark, for instance, is a large-figure composition that represents both life on board a slave ship and the moment of emancipation, the intention being to ‘give people a public space and symbol where the horrors of, and struggle against slavery can be commemorated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663911435520">University of Central Lancashire, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663911435520">Lambert, 2007</xref>). What we are dealing with here, in other words, is a range of responses that reflect not simply different aesthetic choices but also specific political agendas that are often inseparable from specific state interests.</p>
<p>In Britain, it is safe to say that it has proved impossible to surmount these various obstacles, at least at a national level. Significantly, the HLF funded only two memorial projects between 2005 and 2008, both of them involving the restoration of existing abolitionist monuments: the Anti-Slavery Arch in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and the Clarkson Memorial in Ware, Hertfordshire.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0964663911435520">14</xref>
</sup> Plans for a national slavery memorial never materialised, partly because of problems over funding, and partly because of aesthetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663911435520">University of Central Lancashire, 2010</xref>). Where memorials have appeared it has usually been as a result of local initiatives. A case in point is the Slave Trade Arts Memorial Project (STAMP) in Lancaster. Lancaster does not usually figure very prominently in histories of British transatlantic slavery, but for much of the 18th century it was the country’s fourth largest slave port. It was in an effort to recover this history that in 2002 the City Council, Lancaster Museum Service, the County Education Service, and the campaign group Globalink set up STAMP, which was responsible for a number of different initiatives, including an ambitious education and outreach programme. STAMP was also the driving force behind a project to create ‘a permanent commemorative art piece’ on the quayside in Lancaster, which was officially unveiled in October 2005 in the presence of the mayor, some 150 schoolchildren, and the black American civil rights activist Preston King (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663911435520">Oldfield, 2007</xref>: 79).</p>
<p>By his own admission, the artist Kevin Dalton-Johnson was keen to design a memorial that would contest Eurocentric views of the slave trade. Instead, ‘Captured Africans’ is rooted very firmly in the black experience of transatlantic slavery. The base, for instance, consists of a mosaic of the triangular trade that explicitly commemorates black loss. Above the mosaic (the sea) is fixed a ship consisting of two pillars, one a carved sandstone block (the stern), the other a stainless steel bow section. Strung between these two pillars are six acrylic blocks – the decks, if you will – each of which represents a specific cargo, organised in order of importance, with ‘slaves’ at the bottom and ‘wealth’ at the top. Read as a whole, therefore, ‘Captured Africans’ attempts not only to memorialise enslaved Africans but also to put the slave trade on show, as if it too was an exhibit. Not everyone has welcomed the appearance of ‘Captured Africans’, some preferring to throw a veil over Lancaster’s slave past, as if it were best forgotten.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0964663911435520">15</xref>
</sup> For others, however, the memorial represents a bold and innovative visual statement that places emphasis on remembrance rather than celebration, that has less to do with the moral triumph of British abolitionism than with the voices of the forgotten, the slaves themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663911435520">Oldfield, 2007</xref>: 79–81).</p>

<sec id="section6-0964663911435520">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Britain’s experience of 2007 sheds important light on the role of public history in repairing historical wrongs. As we have seen, a lot of what happened in 2007 – at an official level, at least – was evasive, manipulative and often misleading. Yet, at the same time, huge amounts of money were spent on heritage projects that, taken together, advanced a very different agenda: one that demanded that Britons look more critically at their involvement in transatlantic slavery and address the needs of those still blighted by the legacy of enslavement. Significantly, a lot of this activity was non-governmental in nature, the HLF playing a particularly conspicuous role in raising awareness of slavery and its relevance to present-day concerns. For the most part, the purpose (and effect) of these initiatives was to encourage mutual respect and understanding. While ‘Remembering Slavery’ aimed to challenge many safe (white) assumptions about slavery and the slave trade, it also aimed to be inclusive, and in that sense the programme took it as axiomatic that improved awareness of the UK’s ‘diverse heritage’ – the sharing of stories, and so on – would have a beneficial impact on the outlook of contemporary British citizens, BAME groups included.</p>
<p>To this extent, the HLF was driven by a presentist agenda that in many ways reinforced the Labour government’s own explicit emphasis on social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435520">Hall, 2010</xref>: 195–196). Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the extent to which the hundreds of heritage projects launched to coincide with the 2007 bicentenary empowered black Britons, not least by reframing debates about slavery and the slave trade and setting them in a very different historical context. Whether such gestures can ever really act as a substitute for more radical or concerted action on the part of the state is, of course, a mute point; and, for some, investment in costly public history initiatives will only ever be regarded as a ‘safe’ option that allows those states implicated in the slave trade to evade issues like apologies and reparations. One thing is certain, however: the old consensus, the one that traditionally focused almost exclusively on Britain’s tradition of compassionate humanitarianism, has broken down. It may be too early to predict what will take its place, but there is no question that bodies like the HLF, working in co-operation with museums, archives and community groups, have dramatically reshaped representations of British transatlantic slavery, or that, in doing so, they have forced Britons to look again at the paradoxes embedded in national histories that first enslaved and then liberated persons of African descent.</p>
