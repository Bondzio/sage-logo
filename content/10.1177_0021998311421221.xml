<sec id="sec1-0021998311421221" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are used in a variety of structural applications in the aerospace, marine, and construction industries. Glass-fiber composites are widely used in civil and marine applications as they are of relatively low cost and widely available. Thick laminates, such as often used in marine applications, are typically made from woven fabric. Woven fabrics are preferred for thick laminates due to relative ease and speed of layup, and they have been shown to have relatively good impact resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311421221">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cracks in the form of delaminations and disbonds are the most common failure modes observed in composite structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311421221">2</xref></sup> As a result, methods to characterize crack onset and propagation in laminated structures have been developed. Damage in the form of delaminations and disbonds can be caused by fatigue and impact loads. Cracks may also form during construction, or due to high differential stresses between bonded laminates near stiffeners or at locations where thermal stresses from cured secondary bonds are high. These types offailure are a result of the absence of through-the-thickness fiber reinforcement, which creates planes of weaknesses between the layers of the laminate. Crack onset and propagation are typically characterized using fracture mechanics.</p>
<p>Fracture toughness (<italic>G</italic>) is measured as a material property and is equivalent to the critical strain energy release rate (SERR) at the crack tip. The critical SERR occurs immediately before crack growth and is commonly defined as <italic>G</italic><sub>c</sub>. Fracture can be separated into three modes: mode I (opening mode), mode II (shearing mode), and mode III (scissoring mode). Fracture toughness for modes I, II, andIII is typically denoted as GI, GII, and GIII, respectively. The total SERR, GT, is the summation of all three modes. As the width of a component increases, mode III fracture energy becomes relatively small, and for most structural applications, it can be ignored.</p>
<p>In most structural applications, the SERR at the crack tip is made up of both mode I and mode II fracture energy. Fracture toughness of laminated composite materials under static loading has been shown to be dependent on the relative amounts of GI and GII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311421221">3</xref></sup> Mixity is typically used to describe what portion of the total SERR comes from GI and GII and is defined as the ratio of GII to GT.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to characterize interlaminar fracture toughness and crack propagation behavior in woven fabric composites. Unidirectional composites are well characterized and have been widely studied with respect to fracture properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311421221">4</xref></sup> Current experimental methods for obtaining fracture toughness properties of composite materials are based on unidirectional materials. Existing fracture toughness tests developed for unidirectional composites have been used in previous research for fracture of woven fabric composites with varying degrees of success; however, there is a gap in the understanding of the behavior of crack propagation in woven fabric composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311421221">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311421221">6</xref></sup> The findings of the current research will serve to further adapt current experimental methods for determining fracture toughness of woven fabric composites. A numerical technique to determine the point of crack onset is proposed. The proposed technique will contribute to the proper characterization of fracture onset and propagation in woven fabric composites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311421221"><title>Woven reinforcement</title>
<p>Woven fiber reinforcement is typically used in applications where multidirectional laminates are required. These applications are common in plates subjected to two-way bending as seen in a ship hull where structural requirements are similar in both principal directions. Crack propagation behavior is inherently different in woven and unidirectional laminates. Woven fabric composites exhibit relatively unstable crack growth compared to unidirectional laminates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421221">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311421221">8</xref></sup> Unstable crack growth in woven fabric composites can be observed as the crack jumps between transverse tows.</p>
<p>Woven fabrics tend to have heavier tows (e.g., higher filament count) than unidirectional reinforcement. While specimen width has been shown not to affect the fracture toughness of unidirectional composites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311421221">9</xref></sup> this may not be the case for woven fabric composites. Further research is needed to determine size effects ofwoven fabric composites on fracture toughness. Unidirectional composites and woven fabric compositesare physically different in that the individual fibersare bonded in unidirectional composites, whereas fiber bundles or tows are bonded in woven fabric composites. The woven fabrics investigated in this article have a tow spacing of 5–6 mm (4–5 tows per inch). For a heavy woven fabric composite, the number of tows per specimen width will depend on where the specimen is cut from a panel, which can result in an increase in variability. Possible contributing factors to variability of fracture toughness in woven fabric composites have been identified by Naik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311421221">10</xref></sup> A previous study on the subject with respect to weave pattern was conducted by Alif et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311421221">11</xref></sup> The tow spacing of the woven fabric used in their study was approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the one discussed in this one.</p>
<p>Toughening mechanisms in heavy woven fabric composites vary from the mechanisms exhibited in unidirectional laminates. Unidirectional laminates undergo significant fiber bridging when subjected to mode I fracture;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311421221">12</xref></sup> however, the weave in woven fabric composites limits the amount of fiber bridging which can occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421221">7</xref></sup> Other toughening mechanisms include the presence of inclusions and resin-rich areas. Energy can be stored behind a transverse tow as it acts like an inclusion within the laminate, causing the crack to deviate from the mid-plane of the fracture specimen. The amount of energy capable of being stored behind each tow is highly variable due to thickness variations in the woven fabric. Additionally, it is possible for resin-rich areas to form in a regular pattern as a result of the weave structure. The result is unstable crack propagation for woven fabric composites made with heavy woven fabrics. Research has shown that both the thickness and location of the end of the film used to create the initial crack within the laminate can affect the observed fracture toughness at onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311421221">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311421221">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311421221" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>The specimens for each of the three fracture toughness tests require placement of a predetermined crack by inserting a thin layer of non-adhering material at themid-plane of the laminate. Care must be taken when placing the film so as to not create a resin-rich area at the crack tip as a result of an excessively thick film or a fold.</p>
<p>Mode I and Mode II fracture toughnesses are determined experimentally by conducting double cantilever beam (DCB) and end-notched flexure (ENF) tests, respectively. Fracture toughness values for various levels of mixity are determined by conducting mixed-mode bending (MMB) tests which cause both a mode Iand mode II response to the specimen using a special loading fixture. Standard test methods exist for bothmode I and mixed-mode fracture toughnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421221">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311421221">16</xref></sup> A draft ASTM standard is currently under consideration for mode II ENF fracture toughness testing and a discontinued European standard is also available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311421221">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311421221">18</xref></sup> Formulation of various data reduction methods and corrections available for each test type are widely available throughout the literature and are not covered in thisarticle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311421221">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311421221">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The DCB test is used to determine mode I fracture toughness and is the most widely used fracture toughness test. The DCB specimen consists of a laminate with a predetermined crack created at the mid-plane of the laminate during fabrication. The two arms are loaded by placing either hinges or loading blocks at the arm tips, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421221">Figure 1</xref>. The DCB test is subject to fiber bridging and failure of the arms for very tough materials. Onset values are considered to be more valuable than propagation values for mode I fracture toughness due to the development of fiber bridging. Since fiber bridging is limited in woven fabric composites, propagation data offers more value; however, unstable crack propagation due to heavy weaves can complicate attempts to quantify the fracture toughness during propagation. Data reduction of the DCB test using the modified beam theory method and the various corrections are presented in ASTM D5528.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421221">15</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0021998311421221" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>DCB specimen with piano hinges.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The ENF test, used to determine mode II fracture toughness, consists of a specimen similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421221">Figure 1</xref> with the hinges removed and the specimen subjected to three point bending as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421221">Figure 2</xref>. The ENF test typically results in more unstable crack propagation than the DCB test. As a result, it is more difficult to obtain the propagation data. Visual detection of crack growth in the mode II ENF test is more difficult than for the mode I DCB test as extension of the crack tip does not result in separation of the two arms butrather produces interlaminar shear at the crack tip. Reduction of the ENF test data using a compliance calibration technique is presented by Davidson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311421221">17</xref></sup> in a draft mode II standard.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311421221" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>ENF test specimen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The MMB test is used to determine mixed-mode fracture toughness for various levels of mixity. The MMB test fixture developed by Reeder and Crews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311421221">22</xref></sup> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421221">Figure 3</xref>. Corrections are necessary to account for bending of the specimen, which causes rotations at the crack tip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311421221">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311421221">23</xref></sup> In addition, the weight of the loading lever may need to be considered when calculating fracture toughness. The concerns encountered with the ENF and DCB tests, such as fiber bridging and stress concentrations caused by the load-head, are relevant to the MMB tests. The degree to which each factor affects the mixed-mode response will depend on the level of mixity. When a mode I response dominates, the behavior can be expected to more closely follow that of a DCB test, such as the development of fiber bridging, and when a mode II response dominates, more unstable crack growth and the introduction of heavier stress concentrations about the load-head can be expected. Visual detection of crack onset also becomes increasingly difficult for higher levels of mode II, resulting in greater variability of visual onset results. Data reduction methods and various corrections for the MMB test are presented in ASTM D6671.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311421221">16</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311421221"><title>Analysis methods</title>
<p>Proper analysis of fracture toughness data is critical to obtain fracture toughness properties that are accurate and repeatable. Current analysis methods for determining crack onset can result in widely different fracture toughness properties depending on the specific method chosen. Measurement of fracture toughness during crack propagation is not allowed in current standards when crack propagation is unstable.</p>
<p>The measured values for any fracture test are load, displacement, and crack length. For fracture toughness at onset, the crack length can be measured prior to starting the test, making the critical load and displacement at crack onset the only remaining variables. The general equation for the SERR for the DCB specimen in displacement control based on Griffith fracture theory is given by:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021998311421221"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>P</italic> is the applied load, <italic>C</italic> the compliance, and <italic>a</italic> the crack length. Compliance is defined as the inverse of stiffness or the ratio of displacement to load. From Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311421221">1</xref>), fracture toughness is proportional to the load squared (<italic>P</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311421221">2</xref></sup>). This causes the fracture toughness to be inherently more variable than critical load and deflection data.</p>
<p>Several standard methods are available to determine the critical point for crack onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421221">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311421221">17</xref></sup> The definition of crack onset has been recognized as a point of controversy in recent literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311421221">24</xref></sup> Some of the different methods available are:
<list id="list1-0021998311421221" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>maximum load (max) – where the critical point is assumed to occur and where the recorded load reaches a maximum,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>visual observation (VIS) – where the critical point is determined through direct observation using optics or by recording test images digitally,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>deviation from linearity (NL) – where the non-linear point in the load–deflection curve is assumed to be where onset occurs, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5% offset/maximum load (5%/max) – which uses the larger of the maximum load or the intersection of the load–deflection curve with a secant 5% decrease in initial stiffness.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The non-linear method is typically considered to be the most conservative; however, the criteria used to determine the non-linear point can alter the results significantly. Because of this ambiguity in current standards, comparisons between published data sets using the non-linear technique are difficult. However, the non-linear technique is preferable as it generally provides a more conservative prediction of fracture toughness and is typically less variable within data sets than other methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421221">15</xref></sup> In order for the fracture toughness material property to be found consistently, a reliable method for determining the critical point is necessary. The NL method is the only method that allows for a numerically consistent way to achieve this. Any criteria used to determine the NL point must be able to be implemented efficiently and reliably. A numerical technique for determining the critical point using the NL method is proposed as part of a case study in this article.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, crack propagation in woven fabric composites is typically unstable. The resulting behavior is described as ‘run-arrest’. An example of this behavior is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311421221">Figure 4</xref>. The run-arrest behavior of woven fabric composites is a result of the weavestructure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311421221">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311421221">28</xref></sup> Kotaki and Hamada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311421221">25</xref></sup> observed unstable fracture initiating at the edge of transverse tows and that the transverse tows relate to regions of high fracture toughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311421221">25</xref></sup> Kim and Sham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311421221">26</xref></sup> identified that stronger interface bonds tended to create unstable crack propagation; further, the crack front was discontinuous. Another observation made by Kim and Sham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311421221">26</xref></sup>is that thicker fabrics yield greater fracture toughness due to fiber migration into the interply zones created by fabric nesting.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311421221" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Run-arrest behavior for typical specimen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-fig4.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Compliance and crack length have been shown to be dependent on local variances in the weave of heavy woven fabrics such that the compliance response varies periodically around the theoretical response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311421221">29</xref></sup> The total compliance response as a function of crack length can be separated into the local effect caused by the perturbation of the crack away from the mid-plane (<italic>C<sub>e</sub></italic>) and the theoretical response for a crack at the mid-plane (<italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic>).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0021998311421221"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Since the local response will fluctuate periodically around the theoretical response, the local response can then be estimated by a periodic function, as shown in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0021998311421221">3</xref>), where <italic>s</italic> is the tow spacing, <italic>a</italic> the crack length, and <italic>k</italic> a constant determined by the weave structure.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0021998311421221"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>An example plot showing the effect of the weave on compliance is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421221">Figure 5</xref>. Since the general equation for fracture toughness is directly related to the first derivative of compliance with respect to crack length, as shown in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311421221">1</xref>), fracture toughness will follow a periodic pattern which can be defined by the transverse tow spacing and crack length. The periodic nature of fracture toughness creates areas of high fracture toughness such as that described by Kotaki and Hamada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311421221">25</xref></sup> The periodic response of fracture toughness will also fluctuate around the theoretical response for a crack at the mid-plane of a fracture coupon specimen. Fracture toughness can then be defined generally as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0021998311421221"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
<fig id="fig5-0021998311421221" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Compliance showing local effects of weave pattern.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311421221-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Three areas of interest were presented by Davies and Moore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311421221">30</xref></sup> The individual peaks in the load–deflection plot were defined as areas of crack growth onset (INST). Troughs are defined as the locations in the load–displacement plot of crack arrest (ARREST). The peaks occur at the points before crack propagation and the troughs are the points at which load ceases to drop with displacement following a peak. A region of relatively stable crack growth (STABLE) has been observed by both Davies and Moore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311421221">30</xref></sup> and Dharmawan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311421221">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study by Dharmawan et al. evaluated the fracture toughness of a woven fabric composite as that represented by the region of stable crack growth. By this definition, identification of the critical point of crack onset is unnecessary. The method presented by Dharmawan et al. is ideal if it is acceptable for the crack to propagate into the constant portion of the resistance curve (<italic>R</italic>-curve). Such a requirement would need to be established through a damage tolerance approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311421221">32</xref></sup> However, it may be necessary to implement a failure model based on onset values of fracture toughness for a preliminary design. For unstable crack growth, it is necessary to record each point where crack propagation occurs in order to obtain adequate data for a reliable <italic>R</italic>-curve.</p>

<p>Fracture toughness tests of a woven fabric composite were conducted for mode I, mode II, and three different mixed-mode levels. Specimen layup consisted of 10 layers of woven roving with an areal weight of 800 g/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311421221">2</xref></sup> (24 oz/yd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311421221">2</xref></sup>) with a non-adhering film located at the mid-plane between layers 5 and 6. The non-adhering film used was a 0.0127 mm (0.0005 in) thick virgin PTFE film. The weave of the fabric was slightly off-balanced with 55% of the weight in the warp direction and 45% in the fill direction. The tow spacing in the warp and fill directions was 5.1 and 6.4 mm (5 and 4 tows per inch), respectively. In this article, the results are presented with respect to the warp direction. The polymer matrix used was Derakane 8084, a rubber toughened vinyl ester resin. The nominal specimen thickness was 6.1 mm (0.24 in), which is slightly thicker than the thickness proscribed in standard test methods. The nominal width of each specimen was 25.4 mm (1.0 in).</p>
<p>Fracture toughness specimen dimensions and testing procedures were determined in accordance with the associated standards, and a total of 12 specimens were used for each test type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421221">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311421221">17</xref></sup> Crack onset was detected both visually and through the use of a numerical routine to determine the point of non-linear onset. Crack propagation data were collected for the DCB and MMB tests but not for the ENF tests due to the large amount of unstable crack growth observed during the ENF tests. The edge of each specimen was marked in 1 mm increments over a 55mm range to facilitate the identification of crack growth. Crack propagation was detected visually using a digital image acquisition system, which collected data at a 1 Hz sampling rate. Images were examined for crack growth increments of 1 mm or greater, and the load, displacement, and crack length at each occurrence of crack growth were recorded. Visual detection of crack onset is susceptible to local variances within a specimen and assumes that the crack front moves uniformly; however, this assumption is typically not true, as crack onset can occur locally at either the edge or the middle of a specimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998311421221">33</xref></sup> Debonding of the non-adhering film can also be mistaken for crack onset, resulting in an unnecessarily conservative estimate of fracture toughness.</p>
<p>Results from DCB, ENF, and three sets of MMB fracture tests are presented. A numerical technique wasused to detect crack onset by finding the point of non-linear onset in the load–displacement plot. The numerical technique consisted of comparing the initial stiffness with the tangent stiffness of the specimen rather than the secant technique defined in the 5%/max method. The initial stiffness of the load–deflection curve was obtained over a range approximately equal to 25% of the mean onset load of each data set, where the linear range is taken between 35% and 60% of the mean onset load of each data set. The initial 35% was not considered when determining the initial stiffness due to settling of the fixture and non-linear behavior of the load deflection curve at small loads.</p>
<p>Onset was considered to be the point where the initial stiffness and the tangent stiffness differed by 5% or more. Smaller divergence criteria result in smaller and more conservative fracture toughness properties whilelarger ones result in larger and less conservative fracture toughness properties. A parametric study was conducted to determine the divergence criteria. Fracture toughness was calculated as the slope-divergence criterion was adjusted between 1% and 7%. The final value for the criterion of 5% was selected based on variability within each data set and comparing the critical point with both the visual observations and the load–deflection plots.

<p>In general, variability decreased as the slope-divergencecriterion increased; however, the NL fracture toughness for the larger slope changes began to approach or exceed the fracture toughness determined using visual detection. The final value of 5% was chosen for the divergence criterion in an effort to reduce variability while maintaining a conservative estimate of fracture toughness using the NL technique.</p>
<p>Fracture toughness at visual and NL onset for each test type is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311421221">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311421221">3</xref>. NL onset was determined using the slope-divergence criteria of 5% as previously described. Fracture toughness determined using the NL method was generally more conservative than the visual method; however, the NL method gave higher values of fracture toughness for the 50% mixity and mode II tests. Variability between the two methods was comparable in the two mode I dominated tests, but significant reductions in variability were observed for the remaining tests. The instances where the NL method resulted in fracture toughness values greater than those determined using the visual method may be a result of the difficulties encountered when determining the point where visual crack onset occurred.

<p>Propagation fracture toughness for each test type is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311421221">Table 4</xref>.

<p>Visual onset values for fracture toughness have a high amount of variability both within and between data sets. The two non-linear data sets have comparable variability within the respective data sets, but the study by Compston<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421221">7</xref></sup> shows a marked increase in the average fracture toughness. The difference in average fracture toughness between the two non-linear data sets may be due to the technique applied in determining the non-linear point, since the method used by Compston<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421221">7</xref></sup> is not specified. In the studies by El-Chiti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998311421221">34</xref></sup> and Thibodeau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311421221">29</xref></sup>, fracture toughness exhibits an initial decrease as the mixity increases. The opposite of this behavior is observed in the remaining studies where the fracture toughness is shown to constantly rise with an increase in mixity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421221">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311421221">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>Woven fabric composites behave much differently than the unidirectional laminates for which current fracture toughness test standards have been written. Woven fabric composites exhibit what could initially be identified as unstable crack growth and greater variability than unidirectional composites. Experimental methods to evaluate fracture toughness of woven fabric composites have been proposed. The variability of results for fracture toughness at onset within data sets has been shown to depend on the method used to detect the point of crack onset. A numerical technique based on the difference between the initial stiffness and the tangent stiffness has been presented in an effort to establish a simple and repeatable technique to determine the point at which non-linear onset occurs in the load–deflection plot of a fracture test. A comparison between published fracture toughness properties of similar materials shows the importance of establishing a universal criterion for determining fracture toughness at onset. A method for determining the propagation fracture toughness was presented based on previous work by Davies and Moore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311421221">30</xref></sup> and Dharmawan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311421221">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crack propagation behavior in woven fabric composites has been shown to follow the woven pattern, where each transverse tow forms an inclusion which causes the crack to propagate around it. This action has also been shown to cause an additional toughening mechanism in which the crack will propagate into the next layer, around a transverse tow, until forced to stop due to the weave. The unstable crack propagation observed in woven fabric composites is thus an artifact of the weave and crack propagation can be considered to be relatively stable for mode I dominated responses since the crack typically grows from transverse tow to transverse tow. Mode II dominated responses, which are more reliant on interlaminar shear forces, exhibit a much more unstable behavior as the additional toughening mechanism of propagating into the transverse tow does not occur.</p>
<p>Several drawbacks of using visual detection of crack onset have been identified. Since visual detection is somewhat subjective, it can be expected that differences would exist between data sets. The difficulty of using visual crack detection for ENF tests and mode II dominated MMB tests has been demonstrated by a significant decrease in variability between the visual and NL methods for crack onset detection. Visual detection of crack onset is limited to observations of one or both edges of the specimen. The NL method allows for detection of crack onset independent of where it occurs through the depth of the specimen. A NL method also eliminates the need to visually track the crack at onset since only the load–deflection plot is required to identify the point of NL onset.</p>
