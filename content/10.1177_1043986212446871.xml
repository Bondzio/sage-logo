<p>Police and racial minorities have had a contentious relationship throughout American history. Clashes between these groups have resulted in riots, civil unrest, mutual cynicism, calls for police reform and shifts in policing priorities. It is recognized that minorities are overrepresented across the criminal justice system, that minorities tend to harbor less favorable perceptions toward the police, and differential contacts between police officers and minority citizens is consistent with these observations. However, in the mid-1990s high-profile court cases focused attention on police-public contacts during traffic enforcement. It was observed that minority motorists were more likely to be pulled over by the police, and terms including “racial profiling” or “driving while Black” were used to characterize this new strand of tension between the police and the public. Perhaps in part due to the catchy phrase and shared understanding among the general public of what racial profiling is, the reaction to this phenomenon has been truly remarkable. From anti-racial profiling laws, civil litigation, consent decrees, and internal policies forbidding racial profiling, to the volumes of commentary, observations, political reaction (which included a Presidential beer-summit) and research on the topic – the larger social reaction to the “discovery” of racial profiling has also been remarkable. Yet despite this attention, it is frustrating that a common accepted definition has not been identified, theoretical explanations for the practice remain elusive, and agreement of recognizing and detecting racial profiling does not exist.</p>
<p>Racial profiling was ‘born’ in part due to outcomes from civil trials in New Jersey and Maryland, and since that time litigation has increased dramatically. Withrow and Dailey (this issue) document this evolution and the various remedial avenues for racial profiling claims, and further compare and contrast successful and unsuccessful legal allegations. Based upon their analysis and larger societal factors they anticipate a continued increase in these legal claims. This observation underscores the importance for policy makers to accurately define, recognize, and proactively address bias within police-public contacts.</p>
<p>Initially allegations of racial profiling occurred within the context of disproportionate contact between the police and the public; specifically, minorities were more likely to be stopped by the police than their white counterparts. Methodological debates ensued as people grappled with the benchmarking controversy, or in other words, identifying the correct racial characteristics of the population in which to compare the racial composition of who was stopped. Clearly some benchmarks have proved to be less valid than others, but to some extent this discussion misses the mark – regardless of the benchmark, citizens’ perceptions of stop legitimacy are critical to understanding public sentiment as to whether racial profiling exists, or whether citizens feel they have been inappropriately targeted for police action. Perception is reality, particularly when it comes to police legitimacy. Cochran and Warren (this issue) examined perceived legitimacy of stops across driver’s race with a focus on the race of the officer, and report that net other explanatory factors, black males and females were more likely to question the legitimacy of police stops during encounters with white officers. They noted that recognition of this can contribute to addressing police-minority community relations.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the frustration surrounding the benchmarking controversy, increasingly research has focused on post-stop decision making. Three manuscripts in this issue address searches that occur during traffic stops, however each approaches it from slightly different angles. Fallik and Novak (this issue) recognized that the proportion of Black and Hispanic drivers searched was higher than Whites, however, subsequent analyses reported that race or ethnicity failed to provide significant explanatory value net other factors. They question whether race or ethnicity is a meaningful correlate with the decision-making processes during traffic stops whatsoever. Yet Tillyer, Klahm and Engel (this issue) argued that it may be problematic to consider minorities as single collective groups. Borrowing from the foundations of the symbolic assailant and the social conditioning models, they reported that race interacts with other factors such as age (youth) and gender (male). Furthermore, Higgins, Vito and Grossi (this issue) sought to examine the decision to search within the context of the Focal Concerns Theory. They argued that criminal justice actors attribute sanctions based on an individual’s level of blameworthiness, concerns about community protection and practical constraints and consequences, and apply these factors to gain a better understanding of racial bias within the traffic stop context. Their analysis reveals that motorists were significantly more likely to be searches due to perceived blameworthiness, but these did not vary across race. Some racial differences appeared regarding concerns for protection of the community. But the additional value of research by Tillyer et al. and Higgins et al. is to extend the application of broader theoretical explanations for post-stop decisions within traffic stops.</p>
<p>The manuscripts comprising this issue contribute to the ongoing discussion of racial profiling, yet make no claim to be the final, definitive word on the subject. In fact these inquiries are somewhat indicative of the larger racial profiling literature base – it addresses the issue from a variety of directions, however even when there appears to be overlap in focus, results observed and conclusions drawn tend to vary. This may be due to the fact that racial profiling research, while voluminous, remains in its infancy. Research is beginning to build upon itself, but overall it remains fragmented and in some respects underdeveloped. A negative consequence of this is that the ability to shape policy will be limited. Variations in data collection, analysis, and operationalization of key concepts remain an impediment to policy formulation. It is our hope that the contributions within this issue advance a more coherent body of literature, yet concede this reality is not yet upon us.</p>
