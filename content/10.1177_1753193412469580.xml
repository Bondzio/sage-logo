<abstract>
<p>The objective of this prospective study was to investigate the long-term effect of one or more local corticosteroid injections in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and whether a good response can be predicted. Follow-up visits took place at 3 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after the first corticosteroid injection. Thirty of the 120 patients (25%) had a good outcome with a single injection, 11 additional patients (9%) needed a second injection, and five patients (4%) needed a third injection to reach a good outcome after 1 year. Of patients with an initial good treatment response, 28 (52%) had a good outcome after 1 year compared with 18 (27 %) who had an initially moderate or no response to treatment. One-third of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had a long-term beneficial effect from corticosteroid injection, especially when they had a good initial response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of complaints related to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in women of the Dutch adult population is 9.2%, although only 3.4% of women and 0.6% of men are actually diagnosed with CTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469580">de Krom et al., 1992</xref>). In the UK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412469580">Jenkins et al. (2012)</xref> showed an overall incidence of 103/100,000 population/year, especially in those in caring and leisure occupations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469580">Bekkelund and colleagues (2001)</xref> showed a median sick leave of 7 weeks (range 0–252) for employees with CTS. Considering the high prevalence and large number of people who miss work, CTS is a substantial socioeconomic burden for society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412469580">Bickel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment options for CTS include operative carpal tunnel release, wrist splints, ultrasound, laser therapy, manual therapy, or treatment with oral or local corticosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412469580">Graham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412469580">Huisstede et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412469580">O’Connor et al., 2003</xref>). Recent systematic reviews have shown short-term effectiveness of oral and local steroids, surgery, ultrasound, electromagnetic field therapy, nocturnal splinting, and ergonomic keyboards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412469580">Huisstede et al., 2010a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412469580">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers et al. (1999)</xref> showed that corticosteroid injections have better results than placebo injections in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Local steroid injections improve symptoms in more than 75% of patients at 1 month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469580">Armstrong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412469580">Hagebeuk and de Weerd, 2004</xref>). However, according to a Cochrane systematic review and various other studies, local corticosteroid injections only have a short-term effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469580">Armstrong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412469580">Hayward, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469580">Marshall et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary objective of the current study was to investigate the long-term effect of treatment with a local corticosteroid injection in patients with CTS. We also aimed to determine any additional benefit of multiple injections and whether it would be possible to predict a beneficial response to treatment, based on the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics at presentation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1753193412469580">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, long-term, follow-up cohort study. All patients seen at the outpatient neurology clinic of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, clinically suspected to have CTS were asked to participate. Before entering the study, all participants gave informed consent. Patients were included between January 2002 and December 2003. Those who had been treated with a splint, oral medication, injections with corticosteroids, or surgical carpal tunnel release within the last 6 months before the study were excluded.</p>
<p>Patients were asked to fill out a standardized questionnaire covering the following topics: duration of symptoms; side of symptoms; dexterousness; fingers affected; extent of symptoms in the hand, wrist, forearm, upper arm, or shoulder; and description of symptoms (tingling, numbness, pain, or cramps). Furthermore, patients were asked about the time of occurrence of symptoms (day, night) and whether shaking the hand resulted in some relief.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193412469580">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Electrophysiological tests were done with percutaneous stimulation of the median and ulnar nerve at the wrist, and the averaged antidromic median and ulnar sensory response were recorded from ring electrodes placed around the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the ring finger. All electrodiagnostic tests were carried out with a Nicolet, Viking Select 4 apparatus (Natus Medical Incorporated, San Carlos, California, USA). The diagnosis was considered to be confirmed electrophysiologically if the sensory distal latency measured on the ring finger differed by &gt; 0.4 ms between median nerve and ulnar nerve stimulation, as recommended by the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412469580">Jablecki et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412469580">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Patients with an electrophysiologically confirmed diagnosis of CTS were offered an injection with corticosteroids. If both hands were affected, the hand causing more discomfort was injected first and the symptoms of that hand were assessed at follow-up.</p>
<p>Patients received a local injection of 40 mg methylprednisolone and 10 mg lidocaine in 1 mL proximal to the wrist crease. The injection was given with a 3 cm long 0.7 mm needle between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus. The fluid was massaged towards the carpal tunnel, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers et al. (1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412469580">2006)</xref>. Patients were not injected with corticosteroids and were not entered in the study if electrophysiological studies did not show abnormalities compatible with CTS.</p>
<p>There were three follow-up visits. The first visit was at 3 weeks and the second at 6 months after the first injection. At these follow-up visits, patients were asked about relief of symptoms after the corticosteroid injections. Patients could describe themselves as <italic>good responders</italic> (i.e., complete relief of symptoms not needing additional treatment), as <italic>moderate responders</italic> (i.e., substantial relief of symptoms, but still requiring a second or third injection), or as <italic>non-responders</italic> (i.e., no or only minor relief of symptoms, requiring a second or third injection or surgery). During the follow-up period, patients were offered a second injection and, in those with complaints of CTS that reoccurred after a good initial response to the second injection, a third injection was given. If the second injection was not effective, surgical treatment was offered.</p>
<p>The final outcome was assessed at the third follow-up visit at 1 year. At this stage patients were classified as good responders if they were symptom-free to the extent that they did not require additional injections or surgery. Patients unsatisfied with symptom relief and those who already had had surgery during the 1 year follow-up were designated poor responders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1753193412469580">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>For analysis patients were classified into three groups according to their initial treatment response. Group 1 consisted of patients with a good treatment response at 3 weeks; group 2 had a moderate treatment response at 3 weeks, requiring a second injection; and group 3 patients had no beneficial treatment response and were treated with a second local injection or surgery.</p>
<p>Results are presented as relative risks and statistical significance was calculated using Chi-square tests where appropriate. Statistical significance was defined at a <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.05.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-1753193412469580" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Two-hundred-and-fourteen patients suspected to have CTS were referred for electrophysiological examination. Seven of these patients refused to participate; hence, 158 women and 49 men were included in the analysis. In 142 patients (69%), the diagnosis of CTS was confirmed using electrophysiological tests. Sixty-five patients did not fulfil the electrophysiological criteria for CTS. Twenty-two patients with CTS were not treated with local injections for the following reasons: medical reason to withhold injections, such as anti-coagulant use (<italic>n</italic> = 6); patients preferred another treatment for CTS (<italic>n</italic> = 12); spontaneous recovery before injection (<italic>n</italic> = 2); and one patient refused local injections for unknown reasons. We excluded another patient because of simultaneous treatment of both hands for CTS. Of the 120 treated patients, 84 had complaints of both hands. We treated and assessed the hand that was more severely affected. The baseline features of the 120 patients with CTS confirmed by electrophysiological tests who were treated with local corticosteroid injections are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412469580">Table 1</xref>. The duration of symptoms before presentation was longer in female than male patients, with 52% of women having symptoms for over 1 year compared with 30% of men.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412469580">Table 2</xref> also shows the outcome at 1 year follow-up in relation to the initial response to treatment 3 weeks after the first injection. Fifty-four patients (45%) reported a good treatment response (group 1), 37 patients (31%) had a moderate response (group 2), and 29 patients (24%) reported no effect of treatment (group 3) at the first follow-up visit.</p>
<p>Of the patients with an initial good treatment response (group 1), 28 patients (52%) also had a good outcome after 1 year compared with only 12 patients in group 2 (32%) and six patients (21%) in group 3. This difference between the results of group 1 versus the combined results of group 2 and 3 reached statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01).</p>
<p>This difference in long-term treatment results between the three groups was also reflected in the number of patients who needed only one injection to have a good outcome after 1 year. Twenty-one (39%) patients in group 1 had a good outcome after 1 year with only a single injection, compared with six patients (16%) in group 2 and three patients (10%) in group 3. During the 1 year follow-up, 65 of 120 patients received a second or third injection: 20 in group 1, 29 in group 2, and 16 in group 3. Patients in group 1 with an initial good treatment response who needed additional injections more often reported a good treatment effect at 1 year follow-up (35%) than patients in groups 2 and 3 (20%). Of patients who received multiple injections, the second injection was given on average 11 weeks after the first injection.

<p>In the group of patients without an initial treatment response at 3 weeks, baseline sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) were more frequently absent compared with the other groups, but this did not reach significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.19). Interestingly, the mean difference between the median and ulnar nerve action potentials was greatest in group 1 with a good treatment response after the first injection, but this difference also did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.13).</p>
<p>No complications related to the injections were reported during the study follow-up, other than some discolouration at the site of injection in a patient with pigmented skin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After 1 year follow-up, 38% of the 120 patients treated with corticosteroid injection had a good treatment response. After 1 year, 25% of patients attained this outcome with only one injection, and 13% needed two or three injections to have an excellent treatment response. We also showed that a good response to the first local corticosteroid injection is predictive of long-term benefit and a good response to multiple injections, if necessary. Patients with a good initial response less often reported symptoms in the arms and shoulder, whereas patients who had no response to treatment complained more often of numbness and had less benefit from shaking their hands.</p>
<p>The male to female ratio of confirmed CTS in this study was about 1:3, which is comparable with the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469580">De Krom et al. (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469580">Atroshi et al. (1999)</xref>. Three weeks after the first injection, 76% of patients had a good or moderate treatment response. This percentage is identical to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers and colleagues (1999)</xref>, who reported improvement in 77% 1 month after treatment. Although some investigators have reported slightly lower percentages of success, there is no doubt about the beneficial short-term effect of corticosteroid injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469580">Armstrong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412469580">Bickel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412469580">Bland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469580">Girlanda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412469580">Hagebeuk and de Weerd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469580">Herskovitz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469580">Marshall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469580">Peters-Veluthamaningal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469580">Wong et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to our results, in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers et al. (1999)</xref> a good outcome decreased from 77% after 1 month to 39% after 1 year of follow-up. These results are also in accordance with results of other authors who showed an excellent response to treatment in approximately one-third of patients after a 1 year follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412469580">Hagebeuk and de Weerd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469580">Peters-Veluthamaningal et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412469580">Hui and colleagues (2005)</xref> showed that open surgery is more effective than a single corticosteroid injection over a 20 week period. However, this was true only for relief of symptoms and improvement in neurophysiological parameters. A steroid injection gave a better result than surgery when grip strength was measured.</p>
<p>In our study the primary outcome was relief from symptoms without the need for alternative therapy, as reported by the patient. We choose this pragmatic approach, which reflects clinical practice, because of the poor association between reported symptoms and abnormal neurophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412469580">Padua et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412469580">Zyluk and Szlosser, 2012</xref>), and therefore we decided not to repeat the neurophysiological testing. Others have reported a much higher success rate for treatment with corticosteroids, which may be explained by the outcome measures used in these studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469580">Dammers and colleagues (1999)</xref> used referral to a neurosurgeon after local steroid injection as the outcome measure and reported that 50% of patients who received a local corticosteroid injection did not need further treatment in the form of surgery. In our study, 62% of patients were not referred for surgery during the 1 year follow-up, indicating that these patients, even if not completely satisfied with the effect of injections, had improved to the extent that surgery was not needed. This might in part be a result of spontaneous recovery, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469580">Padua et al. (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>The local effect of corticosteroids is plausibly explained by reduction of swelling of the soft tissue within the carpal tunnel possibly by lipolysis. This might also explain the long-term effects. Oral corticosteroids also reduce symptoms in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412469580">Chang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469580">Hui et al., 2001</xref>), but the long-term effects of systemic treatment of CTS are unclear.</p>
<p>Our study showed that patients who had a good response to the first injection also benefited from repeated injections if symptoms reoccurred. Considering the high incidence and burden of CTS in society, we therefore believe that injection with corticosteroids is a valuable initial or even definitive treatment option, especially for patients who respond well to the first injection. Patients with an absent SNAP more often had a poor response to the first injection, probably reflecting a more severe degree of CTS, and these patients may be better served by early surgical treatment.</p>
