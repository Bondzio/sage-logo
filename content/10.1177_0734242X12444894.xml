<abstract>
<p>This study presents the social, economic, health and environmental implications of solid waste scavenging activity in Olusosun, one of the government’s designated open waste dumpsites in Lagos, Nigeria. Using incidental or convenience sampling methods of questionnaire administration, 112 scavengers were sampled. It was established that scavenging on the site was only possible through registration with an associate on site. Recovering items from hills of waste involved physical energy and the use of manually-operated rudimentary equipment. Thus, 87% of the scavengers were males in their early twenties (minimum age = 19 years; maximum age = 35 years; mean = 26.7 years; SD = 4.2). The daily mean income from the exercise was Naira480.80 (Naira160 = $1.00). The most important method of arriving at the selling prices of the scavenged products was the use of scale measurement. Although the scavengers were aware that scavenging exposed them to both environmental and health hazards, they continued scavenging for economic and social reasons. The study concluded that because of the level of employment provided and the large number of people directly involved (1243 on this site alone), outright banning, even when the open dump is closed down, without rehabilitating the scavengers will constitute a social, economic and security threat to the community. Scavenging should, therefore, be integrated fully into the waste-management system and regulated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scavenging upholds the assumption that some economically useful items can be recovered from solid waste that has already disposed of. The activity is an informal recovery of materials that certain depositors considered to be of no further economic value. In countries where efficient and effective urban solid waste management exists, scavenging is an illegal activity. In San Diego it is regarded as an act of unauthorized persons going through refuse containers whether in private property or designated public places to remove recyclable material and is thus a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12444894">San Diego Environmental Service Department, 2000</xref>). In Brown County, South Dakota, scavenging is an uncontrolled removal of materials from a disposal facility or collection point (Title 3 Solid waste Management System 2000). Among the prohibited practices in the code of ordinances pertaining to solid waste control in Clive, Iowa, scavenging is one of that attracts a fine of $500.00 or imprisonment upon being found guilty.</p>
<p>Public policy towards scavenging in countries like Egypt, Bolivia, Mexico, Brazil and Karachi vary from being legal to one of indifference. In these countries, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12444894">Medina (1997)</xref>, it represents an important survival strategy for the poor. In Mauritius scavenging became a legal activity in 2003 when a law providing for registration of scavenging contractors was enacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12444894">Mauritius Ministry of Local Government, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12444894">The International Labour Organization (ILO) (2004)</xref> defines scavenging as the manual sorting and picking of recyclable and/or recoverable materials from mixed waste at legal and illegal landfills, dumpsites, open dumps on streets and transfer points, as well as waste collection points.</p>
<p>The socioeconomic and environmental effects of scavenging activities have been scientifically documented in some African countries; however, information regarding Nigeria is very scanty, despite the fact that scavengers are found in every major Nigerian city. Reasons why people take to scavenging in Nigeria are generalizations from inferences on the experiences from other parts of the world. Similarly, information available on the mode of operations and the socioeconomic and physical effects of this informal activity were speculation than scientifically-verified facts. Yet, there is a need to provide information on this increasingly popular activity. It is thus important to provide scientific information on the different aspects of scavenging and its operators to allow for comparative analyses among the different countries of the world. Such assessment could develop an internationally acceptable policy to integrate scavenging and scavengers into evolving an effective and efficient urban solid waste management system. This study therefore examines the solid waste scavenging activities in Olusosun, the oldest, largest and most popular government designated open dump in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

<title>Relevant issues on scavenging and scavengers</title>
<p>Scavenging is an informal sector initiative in urban solid waste management. People that are involved (scavengers) sort through the trash in order to retrieve recyclables which may include paper, aluminum cans, clothes and food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12444894">Chapman and de los Reyes, 2007</xref>). Two types of scavengers were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12444894">Rathana (2009)</xref>. There are street scavengers who roam about the city searching for materials considered to have some economic value. There are also the dumpsite scavengers who live and work on municipal landfill. Reporting on the activities of Mexican scavengers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12444894">Medina (2006)</xref> submitted that people could scavenge for self-consumption when articles such as food items, discarded furniture, appliances and clothing are retrieved to satisfy personal needs. Materials could also be retrieved for sales to consumers and industries.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12444894">Medina (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12444894">Chapman and de los Reyes (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12444894">Wilson et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12444894">Rathana (2009)</xref> observed that the activities of scavengers, especially at the dumpsite, are too significant to be ignored. For example, scavenging is capable of making provision for the practitioners before they fall into crimes. It not only contributes to the reduction of the quantity of waste, especially non-organic substances, but also improves the neighborhood economy through the increase in income of the poor. In addition to the above is that scavenging serves the function of a supply of raw materials to industries. Thus, scavengers’ activities on dumpsite reduce waste that has to go landfill, consequently increasing its lifespan and relieving the burden that our planet has to bear of decomposing waste.</p>
<p>Similarly, specific advantages are associated with scavenging. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12444894">Gonzenbach and Coad (2007)</xref> these include the need for no supervisor; rules and regulations guiding the operations are not written down; showing up for work is optional; there is no dress code; shifts are defined by workers themselves; quality control is non-existent, workers get paid at the end of day for any recyclables found; productivity is determined by the amount of income the worker may need for the day or week.</p>
<p>Factors responsible for the development of scavenging are multi-faceted. These factors have social, economic and physical dimensions. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12444894">Medina (1998)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12444894">ILO (2004)</xref> documented that scavenging in developing countries is caused by chronic poverty occasioned by high unemployment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12444894">Muktar (2007)</xref> specifically noted that scavengers in Kano, Nigeria, are poor relative to the rest of the society. Therefore, waste scavenging represents an adaptive response to chronic poverty. Physically, it developed from unbridled access to household bins where materials thought to be of economic value can be recovered. Similarly, the existence of open dumpsites (legal or illegal) where the activity can take place encourages people to scavenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12444894">Johannessen and Boyer 1999</xref>). In the opinion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12444894">Medina (1997)</xref>, the fact that scavengers produce goods and services that industrialists and middlemen would want to buy is responsible for people to continue to scavenge. The activity also requires little or no formal education; thus, entry into the trade is easy with the least rudiment of skill possessed. At the political level is the view that unfavourable government policies aimed towards youths in most of the developing nations have compelled them to retrieve articles considered to be valuable from refuse storage or disposal points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12444894">Muktar 2007</xref>). Lack of parental care which compels people, especially the youth, to scavenge is also a strong factor.</p>
<p>Another relevant issue on scavenging is the public policies towards it that vary from country to country. Four of such public policies are identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12444894">Medina (1997)</xref>. First, repression considers scavenging as inhuman, a symbol of backwardness, and a source of embarrassment and shame for the city or country. Thus, the country and the general public treat scavengers as criminals and outcasts. Countries like Columbia, India and The Philippines declared scavenging illegal and, as such, scavengers were restricted and hostilities raised against them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12444894">Furedy, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12444894">Gonzalex et al., 1993</xref>). In Egypt, repression policy was the ban of donkey carts for transporting waste in the street between sunrise and sunset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12444894">Meyer 1987</xref>). The second public policy is neglect. In this case, authorities simply ignore scavengers and their operations. They are neither persecuted nor helped. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12444894">Diallo and Coulibally (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12444894">Tonon (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12444894">Waas and Diop (1990)</xref> pointed out that the policy of neglect was adopted in the cities like Dakar (Senegal), Bamako (Mali) and Cotonou (Benin).</p>
<p>Third, collusion as a policy is when government officials develop relationships of exploitations and mutual profit and assistance with scavengers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12444894">Medina (1997)</xref> this relationship as that of ‘political clientelism’ as existed when the most powerful scavenger boss became deputy representative in the Mexican congress in the mid-1980s. Scavengers in Mexico also gave bribes to government officials, disguised themselves as peasants and workers in official parades and beat-up anti-government demonstrators. Stimulation as the fourth public policy evolves as a recognition of the economic, social and environmental benefits of scavenging and recycling. The stimulation policy ranges from legalization of scavenging activities and encouraging the formation of scavenger’s cooperatives (Indonesia) to the awarding of contracts for collection of mixed waste and/or recyclables (in some Colombian towns) to the formation of public–private partnership between local authorities and scavengers (in some Brazilian towns).</p>
<p>Scavengers are characterized by poverty and suffering from bad labour conditions, especially when they work on landfills and dumpsites. They settle around dumps to minimize transportation costs, to occupy land that may be undesirable to others and have access to discarded materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12444894">Chapman and de los Reyes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12444894">Cointreau and de Kaadt 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12444894">Furedy, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12444894">Medina, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12444894">Rathana 2009</xref>). They live in very poor conditions which results in shorter life expectancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12444894">Gonzenbach and Coad 2007</xref>). Scavengers, whose age may range between 40 and 60 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12444894">Bernstein, 2004</xref>) are also known to lack access to paid work. There is stigmatization and exploitation because the handling of waste materials is disdained by the society at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12444894">Dias, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12444894">Scheinberg et al., 2006</xref>). Scavengers are observed as migrants who come from other cities or areas from where they might have fled because of droughts, floods, or losing husband or wife. In some countries, scavengers belong to the minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12444894">Medina 2006</xref>). It is recorded by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12444894">ILO (2004)</xref> that in Egypt, the Coptic Christians used to constitute the majority of waste scavengers, while in Calcutta, India, the Muslim minority is over-represented among the scavengers. Despite the social perceptions and some scholars’ characterization of scavengers as marginal and as the poorest of the poor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12444894">Medina (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12444894">Gonzenbach and Coad (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12444894">Rathana (2009)</xref> concluded that scavengers cannot be considered marginal nor the poorest of the poor.</p>
<p>Hazards and problems faced by scavengers are diverse both in type and magnitude. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12444894">Eerd (1997)</xref> provided a six-point classification of hazards and risks to which scavengers are exposed. First is the occupational accident. Examples include injuries such as cuts. Second is the physical risk caused by working under all sorts of weather conditions such as collapsing and exploding waste mountains. The third is chemical risks, which involve inhaling toxic gasses on site during scavenging activities. Fourth is the psychological risks, among which are lowering of self-esteem, hallucinations and the sexual harassment of female waste-pickers. Biological risk is another hazard. It is recorded that many waste pickers suffer from intestinal protozoa, helminthes, eye infections, skin diseases, diarrhea and HIV/AIDS arising from healthcare waste. The general hazard is the sixth group. This consists of bites from rats, dogs and snakes, and stings from insects, such as scorpions. In addition is violence between different groups, syndicate groups and among lorry drivers.</p>
<p>In spite of the above hazards and risks, scavengers retrieve materials from communal storage sites, and commercial and residential containers, especially from high-income areas, hotels and stores. Other places include canals and rivers that cross urban areas carrying materials dumped upstream, compositing plants, municipal open dumps and landfills.</p>
<p>Although the circumstances of materials recovery in a particular place may be unique, scavenging patterns exist despite variations in socioeconomic, political and cultural situations. Scavenging activities can be classified as: source separation at the household or place where waste is generated; collection and sorting crews; informal collectors and retrieving recyclables prior to the disposal of the refuse they pick up; itinerant buyers purchasing source-separated recyclables from residents; scavengers retrieving materials at open, but communal, storage sites, as well as from commercial and residential containers placed at curbside. Others could include scavengers picking waste on the street or public places, on vacant plots where solid waste is dumped, in canals and rivers that cross areas carrying materials dumped upstream, at composting plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12444894">Vogler 1984</xref>), at municipal open dumps and at landfills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12444894">Cointreau 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The review carried out above reveals the world patterns of the different aspects of scavenging and scavengers operations. The question that this study intends to answer is: To what extent do the operational characteristics of scavenging and scavengers activities in Olusosun dump site in Lagos, Nigeria, conform?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12444894">
<title>The physical setting of the study area</title>
<p>The dumpsite covers 42 hectares of land area. The site at the time of investigation had four official gates. However, vehicles conveying waste from different parts of Lagos could enter through the only one with a weigh-bridge. The vehicles were used by Private Sector Participants (PSP) hired by Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) to collect waste. Scavengers on the site were neither repressed nor encouraged. Thus, public policy on scavengers operating at the Olusosun dump site could be termed as that of neglect. The site was a haven for scavengers. Access to the site by waste-conveying vehicles is denied after 16:00 h; however. scavengers operated on site until 18:00 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12444894" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The study utilized primary data obtained from scavengers through questionnaire administration. The incidental or convenience (a family of non-probability) sampling method was adopted in questionnaire administration. In this method, the researcher simply selects a requisite number of cases that are conveniently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12444894">Singleton et al., 1988</xref>). The number of scavengers operating on the site was known through the scavengers’ association’s register. Incidental sampling was employed for survey because scavengers were usually very keen to recover a high quantity of materials in the early hours of the day; in the afternoon, attempts to get scavenged materials sold was the main pre-occupation. Therefore, scavengers could hardly spare any time to complete the questionnaire. The reconnaissance survey carried out beforehand showed that the survey was best carried out before 10:00 h, when daily operations began. Therefore, few that came early enough and were ready to attend to us were sampled over a five-day period of Monday to Friday. However, records were kept to make sure that none of the respondents was surveyed twice. The 112 surveyed represented 9% of the 1243 scavengers in the association’s register. The method of data analysis was mainly descriptive.</p>

<title>Research findings</title>
<sec id="section6-0734242X12444894">
<title>Scavengers’ operations on site</title>
<p>Two means of gaining permission to scavenge on the Olusosun open dump site existed. These were through registration with the scavengers’ association and operating under a registered scavenger. The two categories of scavengers offered two distinct levels of opportunity. While a registered scavenger existed as an entity and conducted business with buyers of scavenged materials directly, a scavenger working for a registered scavenger was not given these opportunities. Working for a registered scavenger was usually as a result of the inability to back one’s intention to scavenge on this site by paying a registration fee of Naira5000 (160 Naira = $1) at the time of survey. The amount received by such a person employed by a registered scavenger is a proportion of the sales value of the materials scavenged daily. The proportion would have been agreed upon between the two parties before scavenging commences. This proportion of the daily sales paid to the employed scavenger by the registered scavenger was, however, not disclosed.</p>
<p>The association came into existence in the 1980s to prevent scavengers from being embarrassed by dump site touts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12444894">Afon (2007)</xref> established that scavengers and cart-pushers collecting waste from the source pay a sum of money to touts before waste can be disposed of on open dumps. While the cart-pushers can tolerate embarrassment from touts, probably because of the very short time spent in their presence, scavengers find this intolerable as they spend a large number of hours operating on the open dump. To form a formidable front to ward off the touts’ assaults, scavengers in Olusosun organized themselves into a formidable association. The association was not registered; it operated through unwritten constitution and the scavengers’ income was not taxed.</p>
<p>At the time of this survey, the association’s register contained 1243 names—1037 (83.4%) males and 206 (16.6%) females. Information provided on the membership register included the name of the scavenger and their next of kin (if any), their gender, their home address and their date of registration. The financial strength of the association was through the compulsory weekly subscription of Naira200 paid by members. A registered member paid an additional Naira55 on each scavenger working under him/her.</p>
<p>The association functioned through elected executive members. Eligibility to contest for the posts of chairman, financial secretary and treasurer was reserved for the longest-serving scavengers, while any registered member could vie for the posts of vice-chairmanship and secretary general. These officers received monthly honoraria that were not disclosed. The association operated through no written constitution but through oral conventions. Regard and respect for the unwritten laws and the executive members were very high.</p>
<p>Members enjoyed access to purchase tools used in scavenging [sacks and scythe (go-to-hell)] at reduced prices. Membership of the association allowed one to scavenge on the site and to sell all materials recovered to buyers visiting the site. Alsothrough the association was adequate security provided for scavenged materials and life within the dump site. Quarrels among registered members were settled amicably through the association’s officials. Quarrels and disputes among scavengers working for a registered member were settled by the masters’, while disputes among scavengers working for different registered members were settled by their masters. Disputes between a registered scavenger and those working for him/her were hardly heard of as the ‘master’ could relieve them of their posts for even the most trivial offence or misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Food vendors operating on the site were well known to the executive members of the association. Through the executives, vendors recover debts from scavengers who prove difficult in making payment. Instead of resulting to violence or abuse, food vendors report recalcitrant scavengers to the association’s executives. It is conclusive that law and order were maintained on the dumpsite through the association. It should be mentioned that executive members of the scavengers’ association had the advantage of selling their scavenged materials before ordinary members. Moreover, the association’s chairman office is the first point of call to a buyer visiting the site for the first time.</p>

<p>Of the 112 sampled scavengers, 86.6% were males. This suggests that males were usually at the dump site early enough to start the day’s business. It also implied that more males are involved in this energy-sapping exercise. Closely related to gender is the issue of age. The scavengers were grouped into two age brackets: 19–30 years and above 30 years. This grouping was informed by the fact that the youngest of the scavengers was 19 years old while the oldest was 35 years of age. The average age of scavengers was 26.7 years. The fact that the standard deviation of the age distribution was 4.2 indicated that the age of the scavengers clustered around the mean. Thus, little variation existed in their ages. The bulk of the scavengers were aged between 19 and 30 years. This group represented 86.7%. That the majority (86.6%) of the scavengers were males and (86.7% were) between the age of 19 and 30 years proved that scavenging may be an activity that needs the energy found in young males. None of the female scavengers identified on site was above 30 years of age. Investigation into the marital status of the scavengers indicated that 57.2% were married while the remaining 42.8% were single. Further analysis revealed that 45.4% of the 97 male scavengers were single; the others were married. It was also discovered that few (13.3%) of the sampled female scavengers were single.</p>
<p>The scavengers were low in educational status—18.8% of the scavengers had no formal education, 51.8% had primary education while only 29.4% had been to secondary school for formal education. To further understand how far they had gone in the pursuit of formal education, scavengers were instructed to indicate the number of years they had spent in this pursuit. It was confirmed that 19.6% of the scavengers were dropouts from primary school because they had only spent four years at school instead of the six expected. A conclusion was also reached that 7.1% and 2.7% were dropouts from junior and senior secondary schools, respectively. Only 3.6% of the scavengers claimed that they had spent 12 years pursuing formal education. It must be emphasized that as many as 51.7% of the scavengers had spent between four and six years in the pursuit of formal education. A comparative analysis of the educational status of scavengers examined above with that of residents in Lagos showed that scavengers were very low in educational status. A recent study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12444894">Jiboye (2008)</xref> where 60.8% of the residents had tertiary education, 24.2% had secondary education, 11.2% -had vocational education and 3.9% had primary education confirmed this. It can therefore be concluded that scavenging as an activity requires no formal training and special skills that other forms of employment would.</p>
<p>Another important socioeconomic characteristic of the scavengers is the income realized from their activities on daily basis. The daily income is what kept scavengers in the business. Information obtained indicated that the daily minimum amount of money made was Naira300, while the maximum was Naira650. The mean income of scavengers was Naira480.80, while the standard deviation was 92.8. The daily income of scavengers was further grouped using a class interval of Naira50. The daily modal income group was Naira451–500. Close to a third of the scavengers (30.4%) were in this income group. Indeed, 26.8% earned between Naira300 and Naira350 daily from the sales of the scavenged materials. Using the established daily average income of Naira480.80, it is estimated that a scavenger will realize a monthly income of between Naira12,020 and Naira12,500 depending on whether the scavenger worked for 25 or 26 days in the month. If this is compared to what is earned in the public sector, it follows that someone with no formal educational background (or, at best, a junior secondary school graduate) is earning as much as a university graduate in the public sector. This simple reason explained why the number of scavengers is increasing daily at dump sites in Nigerian urban centers.</p>

<title>Operational characteristics of scavengers</title>
<p>The basic tools of any scavenger on the site were two: the sack and scythe (go-to-hell; fork). The latter is used to retrieve the desired materials from heaps of solid waste while the former is the storage receptacle for the scavenged materials. To avoid a mix-up of scavenged materials between scavengers, sacks belonging to individuals were identified with unique marks.</p>
<p>Findings on why people took to scavenging are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12444894">Table 2</xref>. The most important reason why people scavenge was economic (the need to survive). It accounted for 31.5% of all the reasons. Next in importance (14.6%) was scavengers’ inaccessibility to another (decent) job. Opportunities for decent jobs were very low because of the low level of formal education and skills held by scavengers. Other reasons why scavenging became a choice include: lack of parental care (12.7%), initial capital to start scavenging is not required (10.1%) and ‘my friends were engaging in scavenging’ (7.8%). Therefore, the conclusion was drawn that taking to scavenging is purely determined by social and economic factors.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12444894">Table 3</xref> presents the reasons why scavengers choose to operate on Olusosun waste dump site. The most important reason adduced was the desire to reside within, and very close to, the site (24.8%). As a result of this desire, there were structures put up in the dump site that housed scavengers and their family members during the heat of the day. Indeed, about a third (34.7%) of the scavengers sampled were residing in houses built within the dumpsite. The houses were constructed of scavenged materials such as wood, discarded furniture and tarpaulin. Accounting for 23.1% of the reasons why scavengers patronized Olusosun is that the dump site is the largest in Lagos metropolis. It thus ranked second in importance. While the fact that no waste dump site touts existed to extort money from scavengers ranked third, the availability of the opportunities to recover the desired materials in high quantities was fourth in importance. These accounted for 14.7% and 13.0% of the reasons why there was a high concentration of scavengers on this site respectively. The absence of any form of molestation by the government and its agencies was also listed as an important reason. It was established that scavengers on the Olusosun dump site operated without the fear of being molested, especially by LAWMA workers. This is attributable to the public policy of ‘neglect’ on scavenging adopted in Nigeria. The site was more or less a government-approved designated site where scavengers were free to carry out their activities without molestation. The least important reason was the ease of selling the scavenged materials. From the above analyses, it is conclusive that several factors had jointly occasioned the emergence of the Olusosun waste dump site to become the haven of scavengers in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

<p>There were four major materials sought while scavenging: plastic and rubber materials; paper and paper products; metal products; and nylon and polythene materials. Plastic and rubber materials include empty drug, water and cosmetic containers, and rubber slippers among others. Paper and its products include news print, old books and paper cartons, while metal products could include bottle corks, scraps from metal works and discarded vehicle parts. Nylon and polythene materials were nylon containers used in storing water and fast food. Each scavenger is responsible for selling materials recovered to buyers without a middle man. Sales could be made in the dozens and/or the use of bargaining power between the stakeholders. These were not as popular as selling materials scavenged through the use of scales.</p>
<p>Scavengers operated between the hours of 10:00 h and 14:00 h on weekdays; however, activities usually peaked between 10:00 h and 13:00 h. Most scavengers observed a period of rest between 13:00 h. and 16:00 h to eat lunch and shelter from the scorching heat of the sun during the dry season. Scavengers were hardly deterred from their activities by rain. The period of rest may then be followed by a very serious recovery activity between 16:00 h and 18:00 h.</p>
<p>An anxious rush was usually exhibited by scavengers on disposal vehicles entering the site. The main motive behind the rush was to recover materials on moving vehicles. This has often led to scavengers falling off moving vehicles which constituted one of the prevalent hazards on the site.</p>

<p>Associated with scavenging operations were environmental and health hazards.

Presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12444894">Table 4</xref> are the findings viewed from two perspectives: the proportion of the scavengers who had suffered one hazard or another relative to the total scavengers (112) surveyed and the proportion of each hazard that had occurred relative to the total hazards experienced by scavengers. While 83.9% of the sampled scavengers had suffered an insect sting, it accounted for 17.1% of total hazard occurrence. Malaria, wounds from sharp objects and burns from hot ashes ranked second, third and fourth in importance respectively. Wounds and insect sting in particular were the consequences of the manual sorting of materials recovered. It was also established that 11 of the scavengers had fallen off moving vehicles while trying to recover material.</p>

<p>From the information presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12444894">Table 4</xref>, insect sting was the most important environmental risk that scavengers were exposed to. From wastes that quickly decompose a variety of insects can breed easily. The fact that over 70% of waste generated in developing countries is organic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12444894">Afon and Okewole 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12444894">Cointreau 1983</xref>) explained why waste produced by Lagos residents and brought to Olusosun can decompose quickly. Insects such as scorpions, termites and flies, among others, are prevalent on the dumpsite. Stings and bites from these insects can cause skin rashes and malaria. This explains why malaria accounted for the second most important environmental risk (12.8%), with skin rashes also ranking high in importance. Wounds from sharp objects is also an important risk. Wounds can be sustained by scavengers from sharps such as needles and syringes, surgical blades, broken bottles and metals. Wounds from these objects are potential sources of hepatitis, AIDS, tetanus and other life-threatening diseases. Wounds can be obtained easily from the manual sorting practised by scavengers on the recovered materials while recovering materials from heaps of waste. All these are in addition to the dangerous gases that are emitted to the atmosphere as a result of the chemical reactions from the various waste components. The above comments are clear indications that scavengers all over the world are exposed to environmental and health risks, and that scavengers in Olusosun dump site of Lagos, Nigeria, are in no way immune.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The implications of the study, especially in developing countries, are many. It is imperative that a definite public policy be adopted towards scavenging activity. With the poor solid waste management system in the cities of developing countries, it is suggested that scavengers be recognized and provision made for economic, social and environmental benefits. Scavengers reduce the waste on the site to almost only organic, as metals, plastic, glass and polythene materials are recovered for sale. This reduces quantity and type of the materials (organic) to be buried. The consequence of this is that the remaining organic waste can be easily turned to compost or organic fertilizer. In essence, scavengers have helped agencies responsible for waste management in reducing financial and technological commitments.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering the level of employment and the number of scavengers in the country (1243 on this site alone) and those that were their dependants, a policy of outright banning the activity, even when the site is closed down, without adequate rehabilitation programmmes for scavengers poses a serious security risk to both the community and economy. It is hereby concluded that scavenging should be regulated to make sure that operations become environment-friendly thus creating fewer hazards to both the operators and members of the public.</p>
