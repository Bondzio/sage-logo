<abstract>
<p>The micromotion at the interface between the polyethylene tibial insert and metal tibial tray, in modular total knee replacements, has been shown to contribute to wear particle-induced osteolysis and cause implant failure. Therefore, studying the design parameters that are involved in the backside wear process is an important task that may lead to improvement in new total knee replacements. In the present study, a finite element model was developed to predict the backside micromotion along the entire modular interface. Both the linear elastic constitutive model and non-linear J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity constitutive model were considered in the finite element model for polyethylene and were corroborated against published results obtained from displacement controlled knee simulator wear tests. The finite element simulation with the non-linear J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity constitutive model was able to more accurately predict backside micromotion, while the linear elastic constitutive model was not. The developed finite element model (including the non-linear J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity constitutive model) was then applied to assess the effects of the tibial tray locking mechanism design (dovetails versus full-peripheral design) and different levels of interference fit on insert micromotion. The developed finite element model, implementing the non-linear J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity constitutive model, was shown to successfully predict clinical amounts of backside micromotion and could be used for the design and development of total knee replacements for the reduction of backside micromotion and wear.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Wear-induced osteolysis, caused by the wear particles of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) bearing components, is one of the factors that can limit the longevity of total knee replacements (TKRs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911435593">1</xref></sup> The backside surface has been identified as a significant source of wear particles possibly with an increased osteolytic potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911435593">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911435593">7</xref></sup> Backside wear has been shown to make a significant contribution to osteolysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911435593">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911435593">5</xref></sup> has been correlated with tibial osteolysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911435593">4</xref></sup> and has been shown to account for up to 30% of total PE insert wear volume for some TKR designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911435593">8</xref></sup> Therefore, there is great interest in reducing the micromotion and wear of the backside surface of PE inserts to improve the long term success of TKRs.</p>
<p>The loading and motion of the femoral component relative to the PE insert causes deformation of the insert and relative movement between the distal (backside) surface of the PE insert and the tibial tray of modular TKRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911435593">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911435593">3</xref></sup> The micromotion at the backside interface can generate PE wear particles that have been shown to be smaller in size than wear particles from the articulating surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911435593">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911435593">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911435593">7</xref></sup> The smaller relative size of the PE particles may increase biological activity and osteolysis potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911435593">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411911435593">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tibial tray surface finish and type of tibial tray locking mechanism design have been identified to affect backside wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911435593">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911435593">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911435593">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411911435593">14</xref></sup> Grit-blasted surface finishes were shown to result in a greater amount of backside damage by the retrieval study of Brandt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911435593">13</xref></sup> The knee simulator wear experiments of McNulty and Swope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911435593">15</xref></sup> demonstrated that a grit-blasted tibial tray surface increased PE wear by as much as 38% as a result of their higher tray surface roughness. Several retrieval studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911435593">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911435593">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911435593">16</xref></sup> have presented evidence that partial-peripheral locking mechanisms reduced backside damage over central locking mechanisms.</p>
<p>Knee simulator wear tests have been conducted to quantify the amount of micromotion and its effects on backside PE wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911435593">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911435593">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411911435593">19</xref></sup> However, the backside micromotion in such knee simulator wear tests can only be measured at specific locations around the peripheral surface of tibial inserts, while the micromotion of interest occurs across the entire backside surface. Thus, further knowledge on the magnitude of backside micromotion along the entire backside interface was deemed necessary to gain further insight in the aforementioned design parameters affecting backside wear and micromotion, which may lead to design improvements.</p>
<p>Finite element (FE) simulation could enable the assessment of backside micromotion along the entire backside interface, and is not associated with the limitations of high cost and time commitments of knee simulator wear testing, thus, making parametric analysis and iterative design optimization procedures more efficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411911435593">20</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the development of a FE model to predict backside micromotion was deemed to be a complex task as it requires the accurate assessment of the complex contact interactions and nonlinear material response to deformation. The reaction forces at the articular and backside surfaces of the PE insert depend upon a number of variables including the relative motion of each component in contact, the coefficient of friction, and the loading conditions of the contact interaction. The coefficient of friction between the components in contact may also depend upon the lubricant composition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411911435593">21</xref></sup> thermal conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411911435593">22</xref></sup> sliding velocity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411911435593">23</xref></sup> and the contact pressure at the interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411911435593">24</xref></sup> The reaction forces result in the deformation of the PE insert and micromotion between the tibial tray and PE insert. Thus, the selected material model for PE could have a significant effect on the predicted micromotion, since the material’s mechanical properties determine the stress distribution and the deformation of the material. To date, FE modeling of PE has utilized various material models, including linear elasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411911435593">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411911435593">26</xref></sup> and non-linear models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup> Linear elastic models offer advantages such as simplicity and computational efficiency. Only Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio are required for a linear elastic model, however, a linear elastic model is not able to describe the characteristics of PE for medium-to-large strain values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411911435593">28</xref></sup> A nonlinear material model such as the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model can better describe PE behavior. A J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model is typically represented by a set of tabular stress–strain data obtained from experiments, which are used to construct piecewise linear interpolation functions between the data points. It has been demonstrated that a J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model exhibits improved accuracy over the linear elastic model while still requiring a reasonable amount of computational time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup> The J<sub>2</sub>-placticity model, developed by Bergström et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup> predicted the mechanical behavior of PE with a coefficient of determination, a measure of how well the FE model predicted the outcome, of 0.877.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, a FE model was developed with the goal of predicting the amount of backside micromotion at every location of the modular interface between the PE insert and the tibial tray, which cannot be measured during knee simulator wear testing alone. First, the FE model was developed to predict the micromotion at the backside surface of a TKR, and the model was corroborated by comparing the FE predicted micromotion with the measurements obtained from displacement controlled knee simulator experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911435593">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911435593">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411911435593">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911435593">30</xref></sup> Finally, the developed FE model was utilized to analyze the effects of different locking mechanism types, as well as different levels of interference fit on backside micromotion.</p>

<p>The Anatomic Modular Knee (AMK<sup>®</sup>, DePuy Orthopedics Inc., Warsaw, IN), a modular fixed bearing TKR, was selected for studying backside micromotion.

Both trays were of the same geometry, but include different substrate materials and surface finishes. The arithmetic average roughness coefficients of Ra = 1.05 ± 0.06 μm and Ra = 0.02 ± 0.01 μm were reported for the grit-blasted Ti-alloy tibial tray and the polished CoCr-alloy tibial tray respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911435593">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>A FE model was developed using Abaqus/Explicit (Abaqus 6.101, Simulia, Providence, RI). A realistic constitutive model for the PE insert was vital to the success of the model for the prediction of backside micromotion. Two different constitutive models were implemented, the linear elastic model and a nonlinear model based on the true stress–strain behavior of PE. The linear elastic model was considered for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and owing to its popular application for the modeling of PE in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411911435593">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411911435593">26</xref></sup> The linear elastic constitutive model has a modulus of elasticity of 680 MPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.46.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411911435593">28</xref></sup> The nonlinear model was implemented by means of the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity theory.

The model includes an elastic component defined by the modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio, as well as a plastic component defined by the linear interpolation functions of the tabular stress–strain values. The model was preconditioned to ensure that the plastic response of the PE insert had stabilized by repeating the step that recreated the conditions of the stated ISO standard until the peak cumulative micromotion converged to within 5% of the previous step’s values without any oscillation between results.</p>

<p>The loading and boundary conditions were applied according to the ISO-stated loading conditions. The internal-external (IE) rotation and AP displacement were implemented as boundary conditions on the tibial tray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911435593">Figure 2</xref>). These boundary conditions were specified using the reference point placed at the intersection of the axis of the tibial tray stem and the tray–insert interface. The axial load was applied to the tibial tray, offset in the medial direction from the tibial tray’s reference point by 7% of the trays width, as per the stated ISO standard. The flexion of the knee was recreated by the rotation of the femoral component, by means of a boundary condition, about a reference axis placed at the ISO specified flexion–extension axis location.</p>
<p>The AP micromotion was calculated by comparing the most posterior node of each condyle on the peripheral–distal edge of the insert to the tibial tray node directly below it. This method of calculating AP micromotion was consistent with the measurement system of the in vitro knee simulator experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911435593">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411911435593">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911435593">30</xref></sup> Similarly the medial–lateral (ML) micromotion was calculated at the insert node of the most lateral point, compared to the node of the tibial tray directly below it, also in agreement with the method of the in vitro knee simulator experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911435593">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411911435593">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911435593">30</xref></sup> The average AP micromotion was determined by averaging the AP values from each condyle.

<title>Cumulative micromotion of backside surface</title>
<p>A compression test was conducted to analyze the significance of obtaining micromotion predictions for the entire backside PE surface, compared with relying on the peripheral measurements a knee simulator test would provide. The compression test was conducted by incrementally adding and removing a load of 2600 N, using tabular equally spaced intervals, to the femoral component while the tibial tray remained fixed. The compression of the femoral component against the PE insert was the only relative motion applied during the simulation. The cumulative micromotion of the backside surface during the stated ISO simulated gait cycle was also analyzed to consider the increased amount of backside micromotion information obtained by the FE simulation over knee simulator experimentation alone.</p>

<title>Analysis of tibial locking mechanism design</title>
<p>Two different locking mechanisms were analyzed to assess the influence of the locking mechanism design on backside micromotion. A comparison was conducted between the AMK<sup>®</sup> with a dovetail and pin locking mechanism and the AMK<sup>®</sup> with a modified peripheral locking mechanism. The peripheral locking mechanism was similar to that of the Press-Fit Condylar knee system (PFC<sup>®</sup>, DePuy Orthopedics Inc., Warsaw, IN). The PFC<sup>®</sup>-type locking mechanism was applied to the AMK<sup>®</sup> insert in order to enable a direct comparison of the locking mechanism performance without altering the reaction forces of the topside surface. A laser scanner (Ai600 ShapeGrabber, Ottawa, Ontario) was used to generate solid models of the PFC<sup>®</sup> PE insert and tibial tray. The solid models of the AMK<sup>®</sup> insert and the tibial tray were modified to include the PFC<sup>®</sup>-type full peripheral locking mechanism and remove the original dovetail and pin locking mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911435593">Figure 3</xref>). The tibial tray surfaces of the two designs were modeled with a polished CoCr alloy surface.</p>

<p>The influence of interference fit on backside micromotion was also analyzed. Interference fit (press fit), refers to the amount of geometrical overlap (interference) between two components. Once the two components are pressed together, the PE deforms (resulting in strain) to fit the geometry of the tray and results in pressure between the two components. The measure of interference fit of the AMK<sup>®</sup> with the PFC<sup>®</sup>-type locking mechanism was varied from size-on-size to 0.254 mm. The femoral component and tibial tray were, once again, modeled as rigid bodies for computational efficiency.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge, this study presents the first FE model that permits the researcher and implant designer to predict the amount of backside micromotion of the modular TKR. The J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model behaved much more accurately, in comparison to the knee simulator results, than the linear elastic model. The linear elastic model was proven to be an oversimplification of the material, and has previously been shown to exhibit accurate material response only for small strain values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411911435593">28</xref></sup> The second material model implemented the true stress–strain behavior of PE by means of the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity theory. Although the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model does have several disadvantages compared to more advanced material models, the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model has an excellent balance of computational efficiency and accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup> Some of the shortcomings of the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model include predicted piecewise linear behavior owing to the linear interpolation between the points of the tabular stress–strain values. The J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model does not account for strain-rate dependant behavior. The model also predicts linear unloading behavior rather than the nonlinear behavior of PE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup> However, the model has been shown to perform well in comparison with physical material testing (r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911435593">2</xref></sup> = 0.877),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911435593">27</xref></sup> and more accurately predicted the AP micromotion magnitude and trend over the ISO gait cycle.</p>
<p>FE simulation with the proposed model is capable of predicting the micromotion in all regions of the backside surface, whereas only peripheral points can be monitored during in vitro knee simulator testing. Peripheral measurements are insensitive to the majority of micromotion that occurs on the backside surface and, therefore, provide a poor measure of implant performance with respect to backside micromotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411911435593">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>During the ISO gait cycle the greatest amounts of micromotion were identified to occur in the region below the femoral condyles and near the interface of the locking mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411911435593">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411911435593">11</xref>). The evaluation of relative sliding vectors at each location provides micromotion information that is not obtainable through the use of in vitro knee simulators, yet could be used to improve the designs of locking mechanisms.</p>
<p>The peripheral locking mechanism design resulted in greatly decreased cumulative micromotion values over the dovetail locking mechanism of the AMK<sup>®</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411911435593">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411911435593">11</xref>). The results of the FE simulation are in agreement with the retrieval study results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911435593">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911435593">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911435593">16</xref></sup> that have indicated that peripheral type locking mechanisms reduce backside damage compared with central locking mechanisms.</p>
<p>The analysis of locking mechanism interference fit revealed that increasing the amount of interference fit results in increased initial stresses in the PE, providing increased stiffness and, therefore, decreased relative movement in response to loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411911435593">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411911435593">13</xref>). Furthermore, increased interference fit would be beneficial to the design to avoid introducing laxity between the components as a result of creep and other forms of PE damage over time.</p>
<p>The FE model predicted micromotion results have to be compared with clinical results as part of the development process. Unfortunately, there is limited information available regarding the quantification of in vivo micromotion. Therefore, the results of the present study were compared with clinical results of a different implant design in order to serve as an indication of approximate micromotion magnitude that the TKR may experience in vivo. Tibial trays fixed to the bone by screws include a recess for the screw heads. The plastic flow properties of PE may result in protrusions into the screw hole recesses on the backside surface of PE tibial inserts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411911435593">37</xref></sup> The AP micromotion results in the formation of oblong screw hole protrusions, rather than round protrusions, corresponding to the PE tibial insert motion relative to the screw hole recesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911435593">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411911435593">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411911435593">38</xref></sup> These screw hole protrusions have been shown to be as much as 600 µm out of round, indicating 600 µm of maximum displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911435593">4</xref></sup> These clinical results are of similar magnitude to the FE model predicted micromotion results for TKRs with a polished CoCr-alloy tray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411911435593">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411911435593">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411911435593">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411911435593">13</xref>), indicating that the FE predicted micromotion is within the range of reported clinical micromotion magnitude.</p>
<p>The FE simulation results corroborated well with the available knee simulator results, although further testing to investigate the effects of different test conditions and different implant designs on the model’s accuracy could be conducted. For the evaluation of backside micromotion it is recommended that the FE simulation be performed in combination with knee simulator testing. In such cases, the micromotion of peripheral points from the knee simulator results could be used to evaluate the models accuracy under the given conditions, while the FE simulation could provide the micromotion results for the entire backside surface.</p>
<p>The scope of the current work was limited to the prediction of micromotion, not PE wear. However, a computational wear model could be applied to the results to predict the backside wear. Furthermore, the predicted micromotion results are only accurate for the initial stages of the implants life, as the PE material around the locking mechanisms is subject to wear, creep, and deformation, which may result in increased laxity over time. Therefore, for the simulation of micromotion throughout the lifecycle of the implant, the micromotion model must be combined with a wear and damage model that regularly updates the implant geometry to account for the PE damage over time. It is recommended that the FE micromotion simulation procedure be implemented in combination with knee simulator experimentation for the evaluation of backside micromotion, and the design of new tibial tray locking mechanisms.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A FE simulation method was developed for the prediction of backside micromotion. Two different constitutive models were implemented, a simple linear elastic model, and a nonlinear J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model. The predicted micromotion of the J<sub>2</sub>-plasticity model corroborated well with knee simulator results and provided improved accuracy over the linear elastic model. The model was utilized to analyze two different locking mechanism designs and two levels of interference fit. The peripheral locking mechanism of a PFC<sup>®</sup>-type design was demonstrated to result in decreased micromotion in comparison to the dovetail design of the AMK<sup>®</sup>. As well, increased interference fit was demonstrated to reduce backside micromotion. Both trends are in agreement with the results of knee simulator wear tests and clinical results. The FE simulation featured improved time and cost efficiency over in vitro knee simulators and provided complementary information, therefore, it is recommended that both simulations be conducted in combination, for the analysis of backside micromotion and backside wear. The method is promising as a supplemental procedure to improve TKR designs for the reduction of backside micromotion and wear.</p>
