<p>This book provides an intriguing account of the seafaring trade in the Indian Ocean around the first century of Common Era (CE). Believed to be the first record of organized trade between the East and the West, the book will fascinate readers in illustrating people’s time-immemorial interest in trade. Indeed, wherever commerce thrived there was the need for new ideas in areas such as economics, technology, recordkeeping, social order and governance. In this respect, the book will be of interest not only to accounting, business, and economic historians, but also to anyone with an interest in history more broadly. The <italic>Periplus</italic> was written in Greek and believed to be penned by a Greek merchant (whose name is unknown), to guide his fellow seafarers along the perilous harbours, waters, and coast-line of the Indian Ocean. The book offers a rare glimpse into trading and commerce at the turn of the first millennium CE. It is noteworthy that amidst competition, where traders tried to keep the sources of their important goods and how to reach those places a well-guarded secret, there were also others who cared for fellow traders’ safety and well-being.</p>
<p>The first issue concerning this book is to make sense of the title. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff (1912</xref>: 50),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1032373213478603">1</xref></sup> “The Periplus” may mean “sailing-chart and traveller’s hand-book”, with Schoff preferring the title: “Guide-Book to the Erythraean Sea”. Similarly, the Erythraean Sea “was the term applied by Greek and Roman geographers to the Indian Ocean, including its adjuncts, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 50). The date of the Periplus is taken as approximately 60 AD (60 CE).</p>
<p>The value of the Greek manuscript was first recognized by the Commercial Museum of Philadelphia, which led to the English translation with notes by Wilfred H. Schoff, then the Secretary of the Museum. In Schoff’s words:<disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</italic> is one of those human documents, like the journals of Marco Polo and Colombus and Vespucci, which express not only individual enterprise, but the awakening of a whole race toward new fields of geographical discovery and commercial achievement. It is the first record of organized trading with the nations of the East, in vessels built and commanded by subjects of the Western World. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The original document is organized into 66 sections (or books, numbered from 1 to 66), with the aim of guiding fellow sailors in navigating the Erythraean Sea (Indian Ocean) by describing designated ports, market places, people of those places, and how to safely approach various harbours located along the shores of the Indian Ocean. The first section describes the “Egyptian port of Mussel Harbor” as the first market-town and the “designated port”, where trade, at the time, was largely confined to the designated ports which comprised those protected and controlled by the local rulers, such as through the collection of taxes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>). The voyage appears to be from Egypt to India, for the destination appears to be India. At the end, the author also refers to a land called “This”, which is understood to be China. The book ends with a passage clearly indicating the lack of knowledge at the time about other places (section 66, p. 49): “The regions beyond these places are either difficult of access because of their excessive winters and great cold, or else cannot be sought out because of some divine influence of the gods”. Apparently the “great cold” place refers to the Himalayas of India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>).</p>
<p>From each place to the next, the original author of the manuscript states the distance by referring to days of voyage, although in some cases the distance is given using “stadia” (approximately 525 to 700 feet, a distance measure used in Rome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 54)). The month of the year during which some places are visited is provided, perhaps as a way of suggesting the most sailor-friendly time of year to reach such destinations. For example, in section 14 (p. 27) it is stated that: “The voyage to all these far-side market-towns is made from Egypt about the month of July … ”. Furthermore, the voyage from Egypt to India described in the <italic>Periplus</italic> appears to be via a route sailing along the coast or “coast-hugging sailing”, as opposed to sailing across the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The <italic>Periplus</italic> mentions important trading goods and the places from which they were sought and who controlled such trade. For example, in section 59, the author of the <italic>Periplus</italic> mentions these details for one of the most valued goods of the era, pearls, as follows: “From Comari toward the south this region extends to Colchi, where the pearl-fisheries are; (they are worked by condemned criminals); and it belongs to the Pandian Kingdom”. This refers to the present-day waters of the Gulf of Mannar, a place which was known among Greek writers, such as Pliny, for its highly valued pearls. Schoff’s notes shed more light by describing the continuing struggle for control of the pearl fisheries between the “Dravidians of Southern India” and the “native Sinhalese” of Ceylon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 239).</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting points documented in the <italic>Periplus</italic> is how the Romans learned to use the Monsoon Wind Pattern to navigate across the Indian Ocean. The Romans’ understanding of how to use monsoonal winds is believed to have been the result of an accident. As described in the <italic>Periplus</italic>, sometime around the first century CE, an open boat was carried away by gale force winds and drifted to the coast of Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka). The man who sailed in that boat, Annius Plocamus, received good treatment from the King of Ceylon and returned to Rome after six months. With this experience, a keen Roman navigator, Hippalus, correctly recognized the pattern of the Indian monsoon and made a successful voyage to India, and returned to Rome with all manner of highly sought after goods (the <italic>Periplus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 6–8). Schoff states how this was described in the <italic>Periplus</italic>: “Hippalus was the pilot who by observing the location of the ports and the conditions of the sea, first discovered how to lay his course straight across the [Indian] ocean” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 45). This knowledge gained by the Romans was undoubtedly one of the most important factors that accelerated the advancement of trade and commerce in the early CE.</p>
<p>Given the rarity of the work, Schoff did not attempt to alter the writing style out of respect and recognition for the efforts of the merchant who originally wrote the manuscript. That is commendable because, as Schoff states, the fact that the author: “ … was not a highly educated man is evident from his frequent confusion of Greek and Latin words … The value of his work consists not in its literary merits, but in its trustworthy account of the trade of the Indian Ocean and of the settlements around its shores” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373213478603">Schoff, 1912</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>This is, without a doubt, a rare and a unique book. The English translation of the original document fills only 28 pages (pp.22–49), and makes easy and attractive reading for anyone interested in trade and commerce. Students and writers who have an interest in history will find that the translator’s notes (pp.50–282) are extremely valuable in better understanding the places, people and voyage described in the original document and in the correction of some of the errors made in the original account. There is a good bibliography for anyone interested in further work on the <italic>Periplus</italic> and other translations of this rare book. Also included is a list of goods and articles of trade mentioned in the <italic>Periplus</italic> and the places from which they were sought. There is also a list of goods that were subject to tax in Alexandria. In fact, it is highly recommended that the serious reader consult Schoff’s notes, which are comprehensive and illuminating. Taken collectively with the notes, the <italic>Periplus</italic> is an invaluable source to better appreciate and understand both the state of the seafaring trade in the Indian Ocean and the context within which such trade operated during the earliest part of the Common Era.</p>
