<abstract>
<p><italic>Background:</italic> The connection of cluster headache (CH) attacks with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been suggested by various studies, while other authors challenge this assumption. We performed serial polysomnography to determine the association of nocturnal CH attacks and sleep.</p>
<p><italic>Methods:</italic> Five patients diagnosed with CH (two with the episodic and three with the chronic subtype) were included and studied over four consecutive nights to evaluate connections between attacks onset and sleep stage.</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> Twenty typical CH attacks were reported. Thirteen of these attacks arose from sleep. Seven attacks were reported after waking in the morning or shortly before going to sleep. The beginnings of sleep-related attacks were distributed arbitrarily between different non-REM sleep stages. No association of CH attacks with REM or sleep disordered breathing was observed. Increased heart rate temporally associated with transition from one sleep state to another was observed before patients awoke with headache. Total sleep time, total wake time, arousal index and distribution of non-REM sleep stages were different between chronic and episodic CH.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> CH attacks are not associated with REM sleep. Brain regions involved in sleep stage transition might be involved in pathophysiology of CH. Differences in sleep characteristics between subgroups might indicate adaptation processes or underlying pathophysiology.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102411436332"><title>Background</title>
<p>A high prevalence of nocturnal sleep-related headache attacks is characteristic for cluster headache (CH). An association of headache onset with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102411436332">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102411436332">6</xref>) was previously suggested. Recent work questions this causal REM connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102411436332">7</xref>). Possible REM influence was explained by absent dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus nuclei activity during REM sleep, leading to a reduction of antinociceptive effects of these structures in central pain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102411436332">8</xref>). Hypothalamic pathology was suggested in terms of regulation of circadian rhythm and typical accompanying trigeminal autonomic symptoms (lacrimation, rhinorrhea, tearing, nasal congestion, ptosis, miosis, facial sweating). Imaging data show increased hypothalamic activity during CH attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102411436332">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Nine studies report findings from polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring of 104 CH patients (91 with episodic CH and 13 with chronic CH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102411436332">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102411436332">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102411436332">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102411436332">11</xref>). Some authors report CH attacks to be driven by REM sleep and irregularities of REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102411436332">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102411436332">4</xref>). Others report association with non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102411436332">5</xref>). Headache emerging from REM and non-REM sleep in the same participant with CH was reported by Kudrow and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102411436332">5</xref>), who monitored ten patients diagnosed with chronic or episodic CH during one night.</p>
<p>Here we report serial PSG findings during four consecutive nights in five patients diagnosed with episodic or chronic CH to determine the temporal association of headache attacks and different sleep stages, to test our hypothesis that neither episodic nor chronic nocturnal CH attacks are associated with REM sleep or SDB. Furthermore, we investigated whether differences in sleep structure and sleep characteristics can be detected comparing CH subtypes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0333102411436332" sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0333102411436332" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>We investigated a total of five patients with CH (two with the episodic and three with the chronic subtype) fulfilling the ICHD-II diagnostic criteria (code 3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102411436332">12</xref>). All of them were reporting nocturnal CH attacks during similar times almost every night before study inclusion. Each participant was studied during four consecutive nights. Thus, we investigated a total of 20 nights. This number allows reliable results of the temporal association between nocturnal CH attacks and different sleep stages to be gained. No patient received prophylactic medication for CH before or during the study, except one patient diagnosed with chronic subtype, who paused lithium and verapamil 1 week before the first study night. The other two chronic CH patients failed preventive therapy, and patients with the episodic subtype were included before preventive medication was started.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two patients were taking triptans during acute CH attacks on a nearly daily basis. The remaining participants were taking no other medication except for oxygen via nasal probe during acute attacks.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0333102411436332"><title>Polysomnography</title>
<p>Each patient underwent overnight PSG monitoring over four consecutive nights using the Embla-System N 7000, Medcare (REMBrandt Manager 7.5) to evaluate the relationship of nocturnal headache attacks to distinct sleep stages and to any occurrence of SDB. PSG was performed during the night time (between 22:00 and 07:00), including two-channel electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electro-oculography, chin electromyography (EMG), thoracic and abdominal respiratory efforts measured by impedance plethysmography, body position monitored by a position sensor, oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (ResMedModel 305A, San Diego, CA, USA), surface EMG of tibialis muscles and oronasal airflow recorded by nasal cannula. During the recording patients were monitored by infrared video surveillance. Patients were instructed to sleep as ‘normally’ as possible. Sleep stages were determined visually in according to the standard criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102411436332">13</xref>). Arousals were scored according to the criteria of the American Sleep Disorders Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102411436332">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Apnoea and hypopnoea were defined according to the criteria of the American Sleep Disorders Association. Apnoea was defined as cessation of airflow or reduction of the flow signal &lt;10% of the normal flow for ≥10 s, hypopnoea as an observable reduction of at least 10 s duration followed either by arousal or a desaturation of 4% or more. Events were classified as obstructive or central according to the respiratory effort channels.</p>
<p>The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was used for quantification of sleep apnoea (number of apnoeas and hypopnoeas per hour of sleep) in accordance to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102411436332">14</xref>). Sleep apnoea was considered mild with AHI between 5 and 15, moderate between 15 and 30 events per hour and severe if AHI was &gt;30. Oxygen indices were calculated by software from the oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) curve, with minimal SaO<sub>2</sub> being the lowest saturation reached during sleep and average SaO<sub>2</sub> being the mean of all saturation values reached during all respiratory events. Clear oxygen saturation artifacts were excluded manually before analysis. In case of headache the patients were instructed to inform the attending nurse and record the exact time of awakening and the headache features in a standardized questionnaire.</p>
<p>The protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before study inclusion.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0333102411436332"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Comparison of percentage of CH attacks occurring from different sleep stages and proportion of sleep stages of total sleep time (TST) was performed using the chi-square test. Different characteristics of sleep were compared between subgroups (chronic vs. episodic CH and nights with headache vs. nights without headache) using paired t-test for independent samples. Level of significance was set to p &lt; 0.05. Statistics were calculated with SPSS 18 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results are reported as mean values ± standard deviation (SD).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0333102411436332" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Individual patient characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102411436332">Table 1</xref>. Summarized PSG results for different CH subgroups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0333102411436332">Table 2</xref> for nights with and without headache and for all nights in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0333102411436332">Table 3</xref>. A total of 20 CH headache attacks were reported. Only three patients (one episodic CH, two chronic CH) suffered from nocturnal headache attacks (n = 13). Of these 13 attacks, three (23.0%) arose from non-REM sleep stage 1, nine (69.2%) attacks arose from sleep stage 2 and one attack was reported after wakening from non-REM sleep stage 3 (7.7%). No patient showed headache attacks during REM sleep. Chi-square tests revealed no significant differences of the percentage of the headache attacks arising from the different non-REM sleep stages compared with the percentage of the different sleep stages of TST (CH stage 1 vs. TST stage 1, χ<sup>2 </sup>= 6.0, df = 4, p = 0.199; CH stage 2 vs. TST stage 2, χ<sup>2 </sup>= 6.0, df = 4, p = 0.199; CH stage 3 vs. TST stage 3, χ<sup>2 </sup>= 3.0, df = 2, p = 0.233), suggesting that there is no association between any particular non-REM sleep stage and the onset of CH attacks.

<p>Our data show no REM association of nocturnal CH attacks in patients suffering from episodic or chronic CH. We recorded 20 typical CH attacks in five patients each monitored by PSG during four consecutive nights. Seven attacks occurred from wakefulness and 13 attacks arose from sleep. All 13 attacks were reported after awakening from non-REM sleep (predominantly sleep stage 2). These findings contradict previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102411436332">4</xref>) suggesting a strict REM relationship and support studies that report no association of nocturnal headache attacks with REM sleep in patients with CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102411436332">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102411436332">7</xref>). Different distribution of onset of nocturnal headache attacks in REM sleep and non-REM sleep between patients with episodic CH and patients with chronic CH was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102411436332">5</xref>). The authors suggested that episodic CH attacks more likely occur from REM sleep, whereas chronic CH attacks may also occur from non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102411436332">5</xref>). Our data do not support this distinction, as neither episodic nor chronic CH patients had headache attacks in REM sleep.</p>
<p>Our observation challenges the previously suggested pathophysiological concept of hypothalamic alteration in CH and favours malfunction of other brain stem nuclei associated with sleep control and pain.</p>
<p>Neurons of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) have been hypothesized to have a key role in primary headache and were shown to be highly active during headache attacks in patients suffering from, for example, migraine according to recent imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102411436332">15</xref>). Serotoninergic neurons of this brain area have also shown to have a major role in the regulation of wakefulness and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102411436332">16</xref>). Our participants showed more stage 2 sleep with reduced amount of slow wave sleep (non-REM stage 3 and stage 4) and lower amount of REM sleep (as a percentage of TST) than healthy older participants reported by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102411436332">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102411436332">18</xref>). The decreased amount of REM sleep might be an indicator of increased activity of the DRN, which was shown to inhibit REM sleep via serotoninergic innervations. The DRN has been shown to have such efferent interactions to the cerebral cortex, amygdala, basal forebrain, thalamus, locus coeruleus, pontine reticular formation and pre-optic and hypothalamic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102411436332">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether the difference in the amount of the different sleep stages is secondary to the recurring nocturnal headache attacks, or whether it is a sign of disturbed sleep regulating pathways due to CH pathogenesis, remains unclear. However, this difference in sleep might only be secondary to increased amount of wake after sleep onset due to nocturnal headache attacks. In contrast, the sleep architecture during nights with headache compared with nights without headache did not differ substantially (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0333102411436332">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Three patients (60%) showed at least some signs of SDB and its main subtype obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (AHI &gt; 5), a larger proportion than reported in healthy middle aged men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102411436332">19</xref>). This might be due to the number of participants or the higher age of our participants. Nevertheless, no temporal correlation of headache onset and decreased SaO<sub>2</sub> was detected in any of the participants. None of the patients complained of clinical symptoms of OSA (hyper somnolence, fatigue, impaired concentration or increased daytime sleepiness). Moreover, headache attacks also occurred under adequate positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (oxygen via nasal probe). These findings indicate no strong association of nocturnal CH attacks and SDB.</p>
<p>Comparing sleep characteristics of the different CH subtypes, we found a highly significant (p = 0.001) difference in TWT, with higher values for patients with episodic CH during nights without headache. This effect might be due to adaptation to regular nocturnal headache, which might be larger in chronic CH. This hypothesis would be in line with the significantly lower arousal index in patients with chronic CH during nights without headache and a trend towards higher values for sleep efficiency in this subgroup (77% vs. 67% in episodic CH, not significant) and lower sleep latency in chronic CH patients.</p>
<p>A major problem in studying CH attacks in regard to headache onset using PSG has to be addressed. It is not possible to determine the exact time of headache onset because the headache generally starts during sleep. Only the wake-up time of the patient with already existing headache can be identified accurately. Some authors reported an increase in heart rate after nociceptive stimuli during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102411436332">20</xref>). We hypothesize a similar reaction to headache in our CH patients, because a rise in heart rate was observed shortly before waking up with a headache attack. This heart rate increase started approximately 7.2 ± 5 min before waking up with the typical CH attack. Thus this might represent the accurate time of headache onset. If this is the case, onset of headache was loosely associated with sleep stage transitions within 6.5 ± 4 min. Transitions were made from non-REM stage 1 to stage 2 in six cases, from stage 2 to stage 3 non-REM sleep in three cases and from stage 2 to stage 1 in one case. This finding might indicate a connection of the initiation of nocturnal CH attacks with neuronal control of transition to a different sleep stage.</p>
<p>Which brain areas are involved in non-REM sleep stage transitions is still unclear. Recent literature indicates the following areas to be involved in regulation of sleep and wakefulness: cholinergic neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei; monaminergic cells of locus coeruleus and the serotoninergic median and DRN; and glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus and the adjacent precoeruleus area and more rostral brain areas (see Saper et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102411436332">21</xref>) for a detailed review). These areas are most likely to be involved in regulation of transitions from wakefulness to non-REM and REM sleep. Modified or maladaptive interactions between these different brainstem structures might be involved in the regulation of transitions between non-REM sleep stages. For example cholinergic neurons of the LDT have been shown to increase their firing rates just before the transition from cortical slow waves to faster EEG frequencies in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102411436332">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study is limited by the small number of patients studied, but to our knowledge results of four consecutive nights in CH patients have not been reported previously. This leads to a total of 13 nocturnal and seven daytime attacks, and thus we have gained insight into the temporal association of CH attacks and different sleep stages.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data indicate that REM sleep and SDB are not associated with the occurrence of nocturnal headache attacks in patients with episodic or chronic CH. The identified connection to sleep stage transitions as trigger factor for the individual headache attack might be of interest for further research, and may indicate a major role of brainstem structures in nocturnal CH attacks, such as the DRN or LDT nuclei. Different sleep architecture in episodic and chronic CH indicates diverse pathophysiological mechanisms in both subtypes.</p></sec>
