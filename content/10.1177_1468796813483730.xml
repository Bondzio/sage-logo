<abstract>
<p>This paper examines how ethnicity informs the ways in which Romanian migrants in the UK cope with stigmatisation. Instead of assuming ethnicity’s relevance, our purpose is to examine how responses to stigmatisation may or may not become ethnicised. We consider two strategies. The first strategy invokes and reinforces the salience of ethnicity, albeit in a negative and thus still stigmatised way. Instead of countering stigma with a positive reappraisal of ‘Romanianness’, some Romanians seek to transfer the stigma onto the ethnic Roma with whom they are frequently associated. This strategy thus acknowledges stigma, but attempts to detach it from the self and reattach it to the ethnicised other. The second strategy emphasises individual skills and accomplishments to overshadow the effects of a stigmatised ethnicity. Ethnicity is made less salient by this switch to a register of personal skill and worth. Exploring the interplay of these coping strategies, we highlight the fluctuating relevance, rather than declining relevance, of an ‘ethnic lens’ (Glick Schiller et al., 2006) in individual migrants’ de-stigmatising discourses and practices that produce, transform or at times elide different ethnic boundaries.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468796813483730" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Migrants are often portrayed as capitalising on various ethnic resources in managing their everyday migration predicaments. The reliance on ethnic forms of support and economic opportunities, investment in ethnic traditions and ethnic belonging are well documented, as the scholarships on ethnic networks, ethnic economies and ethnic identities demonstrate. But ethnicity does not simply bring benefits and protection. It can also be a liability as a prominent source of stigmatisation in dominant discourses. Stigmatisation can strengthen ethnicity by stimulating a ‘reactive’ ethnic solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468796813483730">Portes, 1999</xref>), but it can also weaken it by pushing migrants away from claiming a disgraced ethnicity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796813483730">Goffman (1990[1963]</xref>: 13–15) defines stigma as an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’, an ‘undesired differentness’ that ‘spoils’ an individual’s social identity and affects her sense of self-worth. Whilst migrant groups may be subject to multiple forms of stigmatisation, pertaining to their socio-economic background, legal status, or occupation, the ‘tribal stigma of race, nation, and religion’ has been identified as one of the most prominent types of stigma individuals may experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796813483730">Goffman, 1990[1963]</xref>: 14). Stigmatising discourses that operate according to a logic of ethnic difference constitute a powerful tool that invokes and sharpens ethnic boundaries, enabling exclusion from access to various resources.</p>
<p>Migrants of course are not simply passive victims of stigmatisation. There is a rich body of literature that documents the varied strategies migrants (and minorities) devise to manage the ‘tribal stigma of race, nation, and religion’. Some of these coping strategies invoke and thus reinforce the salience of ethnicity, often by recalibrating it in positive terms. As Goffman notes, the stigmatised may turn to their ‘own’, ‘sympathetic others’ who share their stigma, for ‘moral support and for the comfort of feeling at home’ (1990[1963]: 31–32). Indeed, the ethnic honour of the group can be invoked as a positive value by anyone claiming membership in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468796813483730">Weber, 1978</xref>: 391). In various contexts, migrants and minorities have been shown to manage their ‘spoiled identities’ in this way, using their disadvantage as a basis for ‘organizing life’ and ‘community’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796813483730">Goffman, 1990[1963]</xref>: 32–36). They associate with coethnics, challenge negative stereotypes, and attempt to present their ethno-cultural distinctiveness in positive terms, whilst simultaneously taking a critical stance towards the ‘dominant’ (stigmatising) population. This can be seen, for example, in the case of Filipinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468796813483730">Espiritu, 2001</xref>), Mexican Americans and Native Americans in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468796813483730">Vasquez and Wetzel, 2009</xref>) or Somalis in Toronto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468796813483730">Kusow, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468796813483730">Vasquez and Wetzel (2009: 1558</xref>) noted in the Mexican American and Native American case, these minorities ‘resist their marginalization by rearticulating the same racialized terms that others use to categorize them, and re-inscribe this language with different values’. Racialised and ethnicised difference is thus invoked and reproduced – and sometimes transformed and hardened – in these coping strategies with stigmatisation.</p>
<p>Ethnic solidarity and redefinition is a widely documented phenomenon, but it is by no means the only response to stigmatisation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796813483730">Goffman (1990[1963]</xref>: 51) also underlines the opposite effect of stigma, resulting in ambivalence towards, and distanciation from, the stigmatised category. In the case of territorial stigmatisation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468796813483730">Wacquant (2008: 183)</xref> shows how stigma has exactly this opposite effect, ‘stimulat[ing] practices of internal social differentiation and distancing’ amongst its victims. A similar rhetoric of dissociation is also present amongst some stigmatised migrant populations. Association with criminal activities and negative press coverage may lead certain migrants to internalise their stereotypical representation and generate feelings of avoidance, social fragmentation and distrust amongst coethnics, as noted, for example, in the case of Colombian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468796813483730">Guarnizo et al., 1999</xref>), Russian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468796813483730">Kopnina, 2006</xref>), or Albanian migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468796813483730">Iosifides et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468796813483730">King and Mai, 2009</xref>). In one sense, avoidance of and dissociation from ‘coethnics’ may reinforce the salience of ethnicity in <italic>negative</italic> ways, by reproducing the prevailing negative discourse and stereotypes around ‘coethnics’, thereby emphasising ethnically marked boundaries and maintaining ethnicity as a principle mode of defining and demarcating social groupings. However, taking distance from the stigmatised category may also stimulate the development of alternative strategies to defend and elevate one’s status by recourse to non-ethnicised qualities and repertoires, revolving, for example, around education and competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468796813483730">Lamont and Fleming, 2005</xref>). Looking at migrants’ different strategies to manage stigma sheds light on processes that reflect the strengthening, reconfiguration or weakening of ethnic boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468796813483730">Lamont and Mizrachi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468796813483730">Wimmer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>By drawing on the experience of Romanians in Bristol and London, this paper examines the role of ethnicity in migrants’ ‘everyday responses’ to ethnic stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468796813483730">Lamont and Mizrachi, 2012</xref>). Our interest is in how, when, and where, if, indeed, at all, ethnicity gets implicated in the everyday strategies deployed by ordinary Romanian migrants. This paper contributes to efforts to unseat ethnicity as a privileged modality of migrants’ experience, but without ignoring its potential salience in various contexts of everyday life. Our study remains sensitive to the varied roles ethnicity may attain in migrants’ experience, alongside non-ethnicised discourses and perspectives. Ethnicity in this view is not a feature of the individual, but a feature of the everyday coping strategies for dealing with stigma. It is to be found not affixed to the migrant but rather inflecting their quotidian practices of stigma management. Romanians’ narratives thus reveal both ethnicised and non-ethnicised strategies to manage stigma, which result in both the ‘contraction’ and ‘blurring’ of ethnic boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468796813483730">Wimmer, 2008</xref>: 986–989). By focusing on boundaries, our approach conceptually detaches ethnicity from groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468796813483730">Brubaker, 2002</xref>) but also from boundaries themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468796813483730">Wimmer, 2008</xref>), allowing us to determine empirically how it can get attached, detached and reattached to them in particular contexts. In the first part of the paper we will briefly sketch out the ways in which Romanians are subjected to ethnicised forms of stigmatisation. We then turn to the main focus of our paper by considering two different strategies for coping with stigma that illustrate contrastive facets of ethnicity: strategies that invoke ethnicity, and strategies that deflect ethnicity. Before this, we provide details on the research on which the analysis is based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468796813483730" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The data we use in this paper come from two projects whose fieldwork was conducted between 2008 and 2010. The first project was a study of the different social networks Romanians in London established locally or transnationally, based on 40 in-depth interviews. The second project was an ESRC-funded study on the racialisation of Hungarian and Romanian migrant workers in Bristol, which consisted of 25 in-depth interviews (out of a total 50) and 5 focus groups (out of a total 10) with Romanian participants. The 89 participants from both studies were young (averaging just under 28 years of age) and equally distributed by sex. Almost two thirds had a university education (or were students) and a further third had secondary education (including vocational schools). The first study purposefully sampled 20 migrants in high-skilled occupations (students and professionals) and 20 in lower-skilled jobs. The second study did not sample on occupation (or education). The range of occupations participants held in the UK varied widely, and often failed to match migrants’ qualifications. This reflects the broader trend of ‘de-skilling’ that many East Europeans (and indeed other migrants) experience in the UK (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468796813483730">Parutis, 2011</xref>). Amongst the lower-skilled occupations, many participants worked in construction, cleaning, or services. Professionals came from varied sectors such as law, IT, finance, and engineering. The vast majority were recent migrants who arrived in Britain around or after Romania’s accession to the European Union in 2007. They thus benefited from the removal of travel restrictions, although labour market restrictions are still in place.</p>
<p>The question of stigmatisation was not the substantive focus of either study but we uncovered plenty of evidence of it in the data we collected. We were thus able to understand its relevance and effect against migrants’ broader experience in different domains of everyday life. We then examined the context specific ways in which ethnicity was implicated in their responses to stigma and identified two main responses that attribute different salience to ethnicity. Before we discuss these strategies, we briefly contextualise our research on Romanians in Britain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468796813483730"><title>Ethnicised stigma against Romanians</title>
<p>Romania has become one of Europe’s major sources of migration. In 2012, Romanians and Turkish citizens formed the largest groups of non-nationals living in another EU member state. Furthermore, Romanians (living in another EU state) recorded the most significant increase from 2001 to 2012, reaching 2.4 million (Eurostat, 2012). Romanians’ migration in large numbers has not been viewed favourably in their destination countries. The initial waves of asylum seekers in the 1990s followed by growing numbers of (often undocumented) labour migrants especially after the lifting of the Schengen visa requirements in 2002 (and notably to Italy and Spain) have created mounting discontent and anxieties in European countries about the social and economic consequences of this new migration. Across all of Europe, Romanians have been received with scorn and associated in public discourse with crime, begging, and the ‘troublesome’ Roma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468796813483730">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468796813483730">Sigona, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468796813483730">Woodcock, 2007</xref>). Romania’s accession to the European Union in 2007 has only amplified fears and contempt in the West about growing migration from one of the poorest member states. Our participants’ migratory journeys were often marked by an awareness of Romanians’ stigmatised image abroad. The words of George, who worked as a carpenter in London, convey this quite forcefully: ‘Everywhere you go in this Europe, Romanians bear a negative stamp, so to say, there isn’t any country in Europe where Romanians are welcome’. Adriana specifically underlined that ‘there are many Romanians in Italy and Spain and they are not well regarded’. They have ‘a certain image which is not very … [positive]’, Ovidiu further noted, doubtful that the situation could be much better in Britain.</p>
<p>The negative reputation of Romanian migrants has been increasingly felt in Britain in recent years. The arrival of unexpectedly high numbers of East European migrants after the 2004 European Union enlargement generated considerable anxiety about further migration from Bulgaria and Romania (due to join the EU in 2007). The British tabloid press has repeatedly targeted Romanians (and Bulgarians) both before and after Accession, importing and reinforcing the negative stereotypes circulating in the rest of Europe. Stories of crime, benefit shopping, Romanians and Roma ‘flooding in’ have come to define these new European migrants to Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468796813483730">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796813483730">Light and Young, 2009</xref>). The extent to which and the ways in which migrants feel affected by, and respond to, these stigmatised representations is the topic we address next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468796813483730"><title>Strategies to cope with ethnicised stigma</title>
<p>Awareness of Romanians’ tarnished reputation and media representation did not typically lead Romanians to focus on presenting an alternative, positive image of Romania or Romanians, as sometimes happens in other cases of stigma. A more common response was to recognise and even reinforce the negative stereotypes attached to their ethnicity. After all, ‘there’s no smoke without fire’, Corina noted. ‘You can’t really present Romania in a very positive light, because there are things that are true’, Ilona, who worked as a nanny in Bristol added. Georgiana who worked in a pub reiterated the wealth of negative stories and stereotypes about Romanians circulated in the international press in a more resentful way that conveyed both shame but also the view that the reputation was deserved (on Albanians in Italy, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468796813483730">King and Mai, 2009</xref>: 125):<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve got to the point of driving people crazy, we really have. They break into [people’s] homes, they rape their women, kill their people … I can’t believe such people exist. I am ashamed of Romania, honestly, I’m ashamed to be Romanian … Because that’s what the women did, they went to Italy and became prostitutes and dancers and escorts, because this was the fastest way to make money, and this is what we’re notorious for, and they are right, they’re absolutely right.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Awareness of stigmatisation led many of our participants to dissociate themselves from their fellow stigmatised (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796813483730">Goffman, 1990[1963]</xref>). Whilst they were less focused on redefining their collective ethnic identity in positive ways, Romanians did not remain passive in the face of stigmatisation but rather developed alternative strategies to restore their status honour and salvage their individual (if not collective) self-esteem. The two main coping strategies we discuss in the next sections alternatively emphasise and de-emphasise the salience of ethnicity: they emphasise ethnicity in a negative way by redrawing ethnic boundaries to redirect stigmatisation to the Roma with whom Romanians are often associated; and they also de-emphasise ethnicity by stressing individual, achieved qualities to elevate their position and counter the effect of a tainted ascribed (ethnic) identity. We discuss each strategy in turn.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1468796813483730"><title>Invoking ethnicity: Transferring the stigma to the Roma</title>
<p>Romanians were well aware of, and typically accepted rather than vehemently denied, their stigmatisation. If in some cases of migration we find that stigmatisation leads to ethnicised forms of solidarity and identification, in others it occasions the opposite phenomenon of ‘reactive’ stigmatisation of and dissociation from groups still defined in ethnicised ways. One of the most recurrent strategies to cope with Romanians’ negative representation falls in the latter category, being reflected in attempts to dissociate themselves from the stigmatised by blaming the Roma. Ethnic boundaries are thus redrawn, but their importance is not diminished; to the contrary, the Romanians’ response to stigmatisation moves and hardens the ethnic boundary, increasing ethnicity’s everyday relevance in the process.</p>
<p>Strategies of dissociation and replicating stigmatisation are also found in other contexts of migration. Documenting the case of Poles in London, Ryan shows how they blame their stigmatised image on the ‘bad behaviour’ of ‘Poles abroad’ depicted as a source of profound embarrassment (2010: 365–369). Taking distance from the ‘loud, drunken, uncouth Poles’ was a strategy undertaken particularly by students and professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468796813483730">Ryan, 2010</xref>: 368), who thus contribute to reproducing a negative, essentialised view of Polishness. A similar rhetoric of dissociation and avoidance of coethnics emerges in other cases of stigmatised migrants. For example, association with drug trafficking led to social fragmentation and mistrust amongst Colombians in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468796813483730">Guarnizo et al., 1999</xref>: 373). In the Italian context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468796813483730">King and Mai (2009: 124–125)</xref> note various strategies of dissociation deployed by Albanian migrants, powerfully shaped by negative press coverage and migrants’ internalisation of their stereotypical representations. And in the case of Russians in London and Amsterdam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468796813483730">Kopnina, 2006</xref>) and Albanians in Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468796813483730">Iosifides et al., 2007</xref>), criminalising narratives contribute to coethnic avoidance. Whilst sharing similarities with these cases where a critical stance towards ‘coethnics’ emerges, Romanians’ dissociation strategy is distinctive in its emphasis on Romanians’ internal ‘other’, the Roma, resulting in a process of shifting ethnic boundaries through ‘contraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468796813483730">Wimmer, 2008</xref>: 987–988).</p>
<p>George, introduced above, provides a good illustration of this transfer, and redefinition, of ethnic stigma:<disp-quote>
<p>… you face racist views and you’re not guilty. But there are many others from the same country as you are who did something bad and people hate you … they don’t hate you, they generally hate those who did something bad in certain countries, they hate the ones I don’t even think are Romanian, … the Roma …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Blaming the Roma for Romanians’ negative image abroad is by no means a new strategy (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468796813483730">Brubaker et al., 2006</xref>: 323–325; Vamanu and Vamanu, forthcoming). Romania is one of the East European countries with a large Roma minority who has long suffered from acute socio-economic marginalisation, discrimination, and even violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468796813483730">Tileagă, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468796813483730">2006</xref>). Whilst critical of the treatment of the Roma in Romania and other East European countries, Western states have not necessarily been more welcoming towards them. The hostile reception of Roma migrants, criminalising rhetoric across Europe, and recent expulsion campaigns from France and Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796813483730">Hepworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468796813483730">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468796813483730">Sigona and Vermeersch, 2012</xref>) powerfully attest to their ‘unwanted’ status. The Roma often figure in media reports involving crime related incidents or ‘shocking scenes of extreme poverty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468796813483730">Nacu, 2011</xref>: 135). Given their acute stigmatisation, recurrent conflations between Roma and Romanians in Western Europe have generated deep anxiety in Romanian politics and press about Romanians’ ‘endangered’ reputation abroad, and reinforced anti-Roma sentiments (Vamanu and Vamanu, forthcoming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468796813483730">Woodcock, 2007</xref>). For decades Romanians have voiced their discontent about the association with Roma migrants and blamed them for Romanians’ negative image in Europe. In 2000, the Romanian Minister for Foreign Affairs memorably stated that the government had an obligation to ‘protect 23 million Romanians against the few thousand Gypsies who are damaging the country’s image abroad and hampering the country’s efforts to get off the EU’s visa blacklist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468796813483730">ERRC, 2000</xref>). A number of attempts have been made to rectify the semantic confusion between Romanian and Roma (<italic>român</italic> and <italic>rom</italic> in Romanian), including adding an ‘r’ to Roma (producing <italic>rrom</italic> in Romanian) (see Vamanu and Vamanu, forthcoming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468796813483730">Woodcock, 2007</xref>) and proposals to revert back to using the term ‘Gypsy’ (<italic>ţigan</italic> in Romanian) instead of the politically correct counterpart Roma (<italic>rom</italic> in Romanian) (see <italic>România liberă</italic>, 9 February 2011).</p>
<p>Our Romanian participants frequently experienced this conflation with the Roma in their various countries of migration. For example, Traian who initially migrated to Spain noted that when the Spanish television showed ‘Romanian Gypsies washing their laundry in the river and lighting fires on the banks of the river’, they ‘didn’t of course mention they were Romanian Gypsies but that they were Romanian, because their identity cards read Romanian’. Recounting the racist attacks against Romanian Roma in Belfast in the summer of 2009, another participant noted that ‘the BBC didn’t even mention they were Gypsies, they didn’t say they were Roma, they said they were Romanian’. Such conflations in the media could lead people in Belfast to be ‘unreasonably’ concerned about participants’ own safety and well-being, as witnessed by Sorana, a postgraduate who lived in Belfast at the time.</p>
<p>News stories like these were echoed in everyday encounters. In a certain sense, Romanians are not necessarily ‘discredited’ from the start but ‘discreditable’, to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468796813483730">Goffman’s (1990[1963]</xref>: 14) distinction between a directly visible (or known) stigma and one that is not immediately perceivable by others. This affords Romanians the choice of ‘passing’ through the <italic>temporary</italic> concealment of their ethno-national identity. ‘Every time I’m asked where I’m from, I avoid saying I’m from Romania’, Olivia (a business analyst) confessed (for similarities in other contexts, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468796813483730">Craciun, 2011</xref>; Jones forthcoming). However, the advantage of anonymity was quickly dispelled in mixed interactions which frequently involved acts of disclosure, triggered either by identity document checks or the inevitable queries about migrants’ origin. This often led locals to ‘mis’-label Romanians as Roma or attracted negative commentary about the Roma. Locals’ limited knowledge of Romania was, according to István, reduced to ‘Dracula’ and the ‘Gypsies’, the two main things he was not infrequently asked about when driving a taxi. The same participant recounted how, upon entering a club, the bodyguard’s first reaction at the sight of his and his friend’s Romanian ID was, ‘oh, you’re a Gypsy?’. Similarly, on her first day at college, Ilona was told by her teacher that the majority population of Romania was Roma. In a convenience store, another participant’s disclosure of his country of origin attracted an alleged Pakistani’s comment, ‘oh, another Gypsy’. Looking for a job on a farm, other migrants faced the same question: ‘aren’t you all Gypsies [in Romania]?’.</p>
<p>Holding the Roma responsible for the stigma Romanians face abroad was common to both high- and low-skilled migrants who equally strove to ‘educate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468796813483730">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468796813483730">Marvasti, 2005</xref>) the locals about the difference between Romanians and Roma. For example, accepting the ‘real[ity]’ of ‘Romanian Gypsies who clean car windows and [had] invaded … Bristol’, Cristian, a graduate who worked as a bar manager, sought to ‘explain to everyone [the difference] between Romanian Gypsies and the Romanian nation’. Unlike other ‘educational accounts’ used as a tactic to counter stigma by ‘teaching the ignorant’ about the victims’ culture and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468796813483730">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>: 407–408; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468796813483730">Marvasti, 2005</xref>: 535–537), our participants did not simply attempt to ‘correct’ stereotypes about Romanians and inform locals about Romania and Romanians but articulated their own stigmatising discourse against the Roma.</p>
<p>Much of migrants’ rhetoric of differentiation revolved around <italic>numbers</italic>, emphasising, contrary to common beliefs, the numerical minority of the Roma and thus their limited representativeness for Romanians as a whole. Delia, a postgraduate in London, recounted the unpleasant discussions she had at university in the aftermath of the notorious rape and murder of an Italian woman by an allegedly Romanian Roma migrant in Italy in the autumn of 2007. The crime generated public hostility against Romanians in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796813483730">Hepworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468796813483730">Sigona, 2011</xref>; Vamanu and Vamanu, forthcoming) where they have been the largest regularised foreign population since 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468796813483730">Ban, 2012</xref>: 133). In response to her Italian colleague’s affirmation that ‘Romanians are Gypsies’, Delia struggled to explain to everyone that ‘it’s not true’, ‘not all Romanians are Gypsies, they’re only three per cent of the population. And they spoil our image’. Delia’s other colleagues continued to tease her calling her ‘the Gypsy’. Speaking about the Romanian-Roma confusion, Mircea, who worked in a pub in Bristol, offered a different percentage yet with the similar aim of underlining the small size of the Roma population: ‘unfortunately, a lot of people in Europe and in England have the impression that there are a lot more Roma in Romania and that the majority of us are Roma, which is totally different, they are only about 10–12%, very, very few’.</p>
<p>Our participants further articulated the difference between Roma and Romanians in <italic>behavioural</italic> and <italic>cultural</italic> terms. Despite their small numbers, it was the Roma’s cultural visibility and ‘morally flawed’ character that apparently earned them, and by extension Romanians, the notorious reputation they now held across Europe. The Roma were shown on TV camping at motorway junctions, which filled Olivia (the business analyst) with shame in front of her work colleagues. They wore long skirts and sold the <italic>Big Issue</italic> magazine<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468796813483730">1</xref></sup> on Bristol’s central Park Street. And they could be seen cleaning car windows in Bristol’s shopping centre, at Heathrow airport, or begging in the streets of London, as others bitterly remarked. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468796813483730">Grill (2012)</xref> found that the cultural visibility and distinct socio-economic practices of Romanian Roma (such as busking and selling the <italic>Big Issue</italic>) raised anxiety and resentment amongst Slovak Roma in Glasgow too who otherwise sought to ‘pass’ as simply Slovaks.</p>
<p>Although there were ‘very few’ of them, Mircea continued, the Roma ‘generally tended to do more bad things. And this is why they always appeared on TV, in newspapers and so on’. ‘Denouncing’ the fraudulent activities performed by Romanians abroad, George gradually shifted from the general ‘Romanians’ to blaming the Roma. Not only foreigners but also Romanians apparently fell victims to the Roma, which made the latter unworthy, in George’s eyes, of bearing their politically correct name:<disp-quote>
<p>When they lifted visas for the Schengen space, some six-seven years ago, when a friend of mine wanted to go to Italy, remember you had to show [authorities] €500 at the border? … Well, the people who stole my friend’s money [for the border] from her bag were the Gypsies with their <italic>alba-neagra</italic> [a street game to swindle its victims].</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking about her visit home, Georgiana depicted Romania in utter disgust as ‘full of Gypsies, fuuuuuull of Gypsies, full; whoever said Gypsies are Romanian was a 100 per cent right, they watch you …, you’re even afraid to make a move, they’re so many of them, how they watch you, and how much they steal …’. Demonstrating similar anxieties, Olivia stressed that the Roma were ‘perhaps one of the reasons why many of us didn’t want to go back home’. The deeply rooted resentment Romanians felt against the Roma is thus amplified through migration, when Romanians come to experience first-hand conflations with the Roma abroad.</p>
<p>The difference between Roma and Romanians was also drawn with the help of <italic>racialised markers</italic>. In different ways, our participants asserted their superiority as white Europeans compared to non-white minorities in Britain (in the US context, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468796813483730">Craciun, 2011</xref>). Migrants’ claims to whiteness powerfully surfaced in their attempts to rule out any possible confusion with the Roma in everyday interaction. The way Dragoş (a teacher who now worked in a pub) responded to one of his colleagues claiming that ‘all Gypsies come from Romania’ was, ‘Look at me! My skin, it’s white, my face is Scandinavian, not Moroccan!’. Similarly, Liviu, who worked for a cleaning company, reacted to the suggestion that ‘“Romanians [were] … Gypsies and thieves”’ by retorting, ‘Do I look black to you?’. Colour was thus invoked as the most straightforward and definitive way to ‘educate’ the locals about the difference between the Roma and the Romanian ethnic majority (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468796813483730">Fox, 2012</xref>). The construction of ethnic difference can thus be accentuated through the racialisation of that difference. The boundary between Roma and Romanians is hardened and made more obvious to outsiders through the invocation of (quasi-)phenotypical differences.</p>
<p>The different examples above show that stigmatising the Roma was not confined to lower-skilled workers; students or professionals who were in less vulnerable positions expressed similar views (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468796813483730">Tileagă, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468796813483730">2006</xref>). This is not necessarily surprising if we consider the Romanian context. Although right-wing nationalists in Romania have been particularly known to stigmatise and criminalise the Roma, prejudiced views against this minority are common across all segments of society and politics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468796813483730">Tileagă, 2006</xref>: 20-22). The Roma are not only scorned for their ‘shocking and shameful behaviour’ but also for ‘ruin[ing] [Romanians’] reputation in the eyes of Western Europeans’ (Vamanu and Vamanu, forthcoming). The words of the editor of a leading online Romanian publication are perhaps telling of the ubiquity of this stigmatising and scapegoating discourse, now translated in the migration context: speaking against the negative portrayal of Romanians in the UK, she noted that, ‘because of a few Romanians lots [of us] have to suffer and it’s normal to have frictions between Romanians and Roma [<italic>rromi</italic>], between those who work and those who beg or steal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468796813483730">Irimie, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>So far we have showed how one of the main ways to escape the burden of stigmatisation is to blame the Roma for Romanians’ sullied reputation. Through this rhetorical strategy to manage stigma, Romanians redrew ethnic boundaries in an endeavour to transform social hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468796813483730">Lamont and Mizrachi, 2012</xref>: 367) at the expense of the Roma. In other words, they sought to position themselves more advantageously in Britain’s ethnic hierarchies by jettisoning the Roma from the category of Romanians and transferring the stigma attached to them. This strategy to redress status reinforces and even strengthens the salience of ethnicity: a tacit and undifferentiated understanding of Romanianness is transformed into a hardened, polarised, and in some ways caricaturised representation of the Romanian self and Roma other. This is accomplished not through a redefinition of migrants’ collective (ethnic) identity and distinctiveness, as found in various cases of marginalised migrants and minorities. Instead, our participants make ethnicity salient through a process of boundary ‘contraction’, by drawing (and drawing attention to) ethnic boundaries within what locals ‘erroneously’ perceive to be a single migrant group. Intentionally or not, the boundaries between Romanians and Roma have been blurred, and those between Romanians (and Roma) and the local majority sharpened. Romanians’ response to this was to single out, and separate out, ethnic Roma from Romanians, joining the stigmatising majority in a broad coalition against the former. Stigmatisation is a form of ethnic exclusion, of Weberian social closure. What we witness here is how the stigmatised employ the same exclusionary strategy applied to them to negotiate a more favourable position in Britain’s ethnicised hierarchies, implicitly aligning themselves with the stigmatiser and shifting the location of the boundary between them to one between Romanians and Roma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468796813483730">Fox, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468796813483730"><title>Deflecting ethnicity and ethnic stigma: Embracing individual accomplishments</title>
<p>But ethnicised stigma does not always lead to ethnicised strategies for dealing with that stigma. To the contrary, it can also encourage migrants to develop non-ethnicised responses. Apart from blaming the Roma, the other key tactic frequently employed by our participants to deal with Romanians’ negative reputation was to refocus attention on their individual skills and work ethic, qualities which enabled them to establish successful careers or ‘fit in’ despite an overall negative collective image of Romanians abroad.</p>
<p>Whilst agreeing that Romanians’ reputation was tarnished, many participants implied that their personal and professional ‘virtues’ compensated for, or even nullified the possibility of stigmatisation in their everyday interactions. Migrants challenged the negative discourse about Romanians through personal examples of adaptation and achievement, in ways that ultimately contributes to the blurring of ethnic boundaries and distinctions. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468796813483730">Wimmer’s (2008: 989)</xref> analysis, ‘boundary blurring aims to overcome ethnicity as a principle of categorization and social organization’, emphasising instead non-ethnic bases for claiming membership and status. Although Romanians’ narratives of ‘hard work’ could at times become an indication of ethnic pride, many of our participants’ stories, as the examples below will demonstrate, are more about personal success grounded in individual skills and accomplishment, rather than efforts to recuperate a collective ethnic self-esteem. They thus illustrate a marked departure from a tarnished ascribed group identity to a redeemed individual identity built around achieved qualities.</p>
<p>The effect of stigma is lessened when the ethnic basis of that stigma is simply ignored or disregarded. Cătălina, a bank director who had studied and worked in Britain for fifteen years, emphasised the irrelevance of ethnicity when talking about her rapid professional mobility:<disp-quote>
<p>At my current job, the great majority are English, we have a few French in my team too for example, so I’m the only Romanian … It’s a purely professional relationship … I’m now a director, in a position of authority as it were, I have people working for me, … it’s a relationship characterised by respect, the issue of being Romanian has never come up.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Completing a degree in Britain and obtaining a professional qualification made Cătălina feel that she was part of ‘the system’. To her, it was her skills and qualifications that made her peers ‘see [her] as one of them’, thus eliding the significance of ethnicity. Şerban, a university lecturer, also invoked his qualifications in a way that deflected the potential for ethnic stigmatisation. For him, completing a PhD programme in the US conferred him ‘American’ status from a legal and professional viewpoint, which overrode and obscured his ascribed Romanian ethnicity and citizenship.<disp-quote>
<p>I studied in the States and I came here as an American, so these things aren’t relevant. When I applied for jobs here, Romanians had restrictions … we weren’t in the EU, and I applied as an American, they even said this to me when they hired me, ‘you know, you did your PhD in America’. That I was Romanian didn’t matter at all.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Education also enabled high-skilled migrants who worked in lower-skilled occupations to build and assert status, moving away and above the unhappy fate of Romanians as a whole. Anda is another participant who was aware of the ‘bad’ image of Romanians abroad in her everyday life, but nevertheless did not feel personally affected by it. A graduate in psychology, Anda struggled to cover basic expenses from her low income in Romania, and so decided to take a break and come to Britain on an <italic>au pair</italic> contract. Unable to obtain a work permit after a year, she became self-employed, continuing to work as a nanny and cleaner for several families, whilst also studying for a Masters at the university. Anda didn’t have a hard time finding domestic work, given her ‘pretty good CV’:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got seven years of studies in psychology, including the Masters here … whichsounded very attractive … Then I speak English pretty well and that’s why they immediately accepted me, this wasn’t a problem. Moreover, I’ve got experience of working with children, having been a … school psychologist in Romania.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Anda became aware of many locals’ perceptions of Romanians on her very first day as an <italic>au pair,</italic> when the 8-year-old daughter of the family she came to work for asked her whether she was ‘rich or poor’, disdainfully noting that ‘dad said that Romanians are very poor’. Opinions about Romanians were however not uniform, Anda later found out. Those who had been to Romania were often enthusiastic about it. Others were truly alarmed at Romanians’ ‘criminal’ activities, often reported in the media, but concluded she was ‘different’. Others were specifically concerned about the Roma. However, apart from her tense relations with UK immigration officials, Anda did not usually feel directly discriminated against, or affected by Romanians’ image abroad in her everyday life. On the contrary, her upbringing, qualifications and work ethic allowed her to develop strong relationships with her different clients, and even befriend some of them:<disp-quote>
<p>We consider ourselves friends, although they pay me, we help each other, when I have free time I stay with the kids, sometimes for free, just because I enjoy it. … they came to my wedding, so we do get on very well. So I don’t feel I’m inferior [<italic>jos</italic>], just a cleaner or a nanny. Not at all.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>What is noteworthy in Anda’s case is that she assesses her status in class rather than ethnic terms. She does not view her position as inevitably marked or irretrievably ‘spoiled’ by her ethnicity. Rather, she sees her status tied to her broader professional experience, her educational qualifications, and her skills – all resources she can invoke to convey (and possibly improve) her status.</p>
<p>Another telling case is that of Dan, an engineer, who started off working in construction and made strenuous efforts to demonstrate his skills and earn his boss’s trust, so that he was eventually offered the opportunity to start and manage an IT firm for his boss. There was considerable banter about Romanians’ ethno-national background on the construction site but ‘if you worked, you got on with [Britons] very well’, claimed Dan. Whereas other Romanians felt demoralised in the face of stereotypes, Dan took them lightly and focused his attention on making socio-economic progress. ‘I may be in their country but this doesn’t mean they can walk all over me, I have my pride’. Emphasising his skills and competence enabled him to obtain subsequent pay rises and promotions and eventually the offer of a job commensurate with his qualifications, running an IT firm for his boss.</p>
<p>These non-ethnicised strategies to cope with stigmatisation were not reserved for highly educated migrants, either. Indeed, competence, work ethic and professionalism also trumped stigmatised ethnicity for participants from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds, who depicted their success in light of a perceived meritocratic system prevailing in Britain (on Polish migrants’ endorsement of meritocracy, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468796813483730">Lopez Rodriguez, 2010</xref>). Florin’s trajectory provides a telling account of a ‘self-made’ merit-based career. Employed with a reputable delivery company, Florin was not only ‘hard-working’, but also had the drive to do something ‘extra’, on top of his specific job responsibilities. This constituted, in his view, a sign of enhanced professionalism that raised appreciation amongst his superiors and opened up opportunities for career progression:<disp-quote>
<p>At some point, I was put forward for a transport manager position, which is why I also started taking courses, … only after a year and four months. That’s because I was smart and good enough to do it, of course, not because I have blue eyes, nor because I’m nice. For the work I did, because I wasn’t only doing what I was told to, I would also do something extra, which for them is very unusual … When you are a driver, you don’t know mechanics too. Whereas drivers in Romania know everything.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Florin’s rapid professional promotion (made possible, in his view, by his skills and competence) stirred envy amongst more senior colleagues who had been in the company for longer but still occupied lower-rank positions. Although somewhat irritated by their prejudiced remarks about Florin’s Romanian driving credentials, Florin had not been held back and continued to follow his clearly set plan. ‘London … is a city of business, no one’s wasting any time here’. Whilst working several years for this company, he built a solid network of clients of all nationalities, which enabled him to start his own small but successful transport business. ‘We are all the same, we are all people’, Florin noted with reference to London’s cosmopolitan business environment and his own multi-ethnic client network. He worked up to 14 hours a day, he worked weekends, but took pride in his achievements and never let his ethno-national background put him at disadvantage. ‘I showed I’m better than all of them. We generally tend to keep our heads down and endure; no, I kept my head up no matter what’. Florin’s occupational success is depicted in individualistic terms, in a context where his skills, competence, drive and determination outweighed considerations about ethnicity, allowing him to establish a merit-based career regardless of his ethnic background.</p>
<p>Without denying the wide circulation of stereotypes about Romanians, George similarly emphasised how skills and work ethic were frequently more important:<disp-quote>
<p>they [locals] do disregard us a little because we come from a poor country, you know, the same old TV stories about Romanians, but as workers they appreciate us, they are really pleased, and they know we are hard-working … .</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such self-evaluations as ‘hard workers’ compared to locals are common amongst migrants (on Polish workers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468796813483730">Datta and Brickell, 2009</xref>; and on low-paid migrants in London more generally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468796813483730">McIlwaine et al., 2006</xref>). Whilst in these studies migrants’ ‘superior’ abilities are often cast in ethno-national terms, our participants did not necessarily define the notion of the model worker in strictly ethnicised ways. As the examples presented above illustrate, migrants often resorted to individualistic repertoires and unique circumstances that brought forth their personal skills and achievements, and thus distinguished their trajectories from the common fate of ‘Romanians’ as a whole.</p>
<p>Alongside rhetorically dissociating themselves from the Roma, many of our participants thus also invoked education, competence and work ethic to elevate their status in everyday practices and interactions with locals. This response to racism and discrimination is well documented, sometimes depicted as characteristic of middle-class or elite migrants and minorities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468796813483730">Lamont and Fleming, 2005</xref>). The examples presented above however reveal that such strategies are not the ‘“ticket” out of […] exclusion’ reserved only for the Romanian elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468796813483730">Lamont and Fleming, 2005</xref>: 36); similar tools are available to a wider range of migrants who are nevertheless striving to ‘get ahead’ and improve their social and economic position. This includes participants from more modest socio-economic backgrounds or more ambiguous categories, such as students and graduates working in precarious low-skilled jobs. Skill level and occupational status may therefore not necessarily influence responses to stigma. In the previous section, we showed that blaming the Roma was not uncommon amongst highly educated and professional migrants, reflecting the wide reach of prejudices against the Roma. Here, emphasising personal skills and achievement also emerged in lower-skilled environments, as a strategy to dismiss stigmatisation and assert status in terms of developing work relations and career progress in a perceived meritocratic society. By emphasising achieved rather than ascribed characteristics in varied ways, these migrants blurred ethnic boundaries between Romanians and non-Romanians in this case, reducing the overall salience of ethnicity as a feature of their experience.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1468796813483730" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has examined how ethnicity informs strategies to cope with stigmatisation devised by Romanian migrants in Britain. Instead of assuming the relevance or irrelevance of ethnicity, our purpose has been to determine the ways in which responses to stigmatisation may or may not become ethnicised. Stigmatisation thus served as a starting point to examine the varying relevance (and valence) of ethnicity in migrants’ everyday responses to negative categorisation.</p>
<p>We showed how Romanian migrants often chose pathways to establish their status which reaffirmed the salience of ethnicity. But we also noted how ethnicised stigma could be responded to in non-ethnicised, and even de-ethnicising ways. Ethnicity is central to the first main strategy we examined, which focused on blaming the Roma and dissociating Romanians from them. This defensive rhetoric reinforces the salience of ethnicity in a negative rather than positive way, attempting to transfer Romanians’ stigma onto the ethnic Roma with whom they are frequently associated. This resembles a form of ethnic cleansing: it operates according to a logic of ethnicity, but one that splits the polluted parts of the ethnicity from its ‘purer’ core, in an attempt to ‘correct’ locals’ perceptions of Roma and Romanians as being the ‘same’.</p>
<p>The second strategy we discussed lessened the salience of ethnicity. Here Romanians emphasised personal skills, competence and work ethic to escape the effects of ethnic stigmatisation. Whilst often recognising ethnic stigma, the response to it shifts registers to non-ethnic individual traits and achievements. These achieved qualities overshadowed participants’ ascribed and widely stigmatised ethnicity.</p>
<p>These two strategies illustrate different processes of ethnic boundary making and un-making through which migrants seek to negotiate a more favourable position in Britain’s status hierarchy. Although (partly) accepting their negative reputation, Romanians do not remain passive victims and, what is more, engage in their own stigmatising practices. On the one hand, as shown by the first strategy, participants erect a boundary between them and the Roma, ‘educating’ others about their ethnic (and racial) difference and diverting the stigma, its roots and consequences onto the Roma. On the other hand, as evidenced in the second strategy, they invoke achieved qualities to dismiss the effects of a stigmatised ethnicity, blurring boundaries in the process.</p>
<p>The two main strategies to cope with stigmatisation examined here did not belong to different migrants. Participants cannot be easily divided between those who favoured ethnicised discourses and repertoires, and those who adopted non-ethnicised perspectives. Indeed, the very same migrants often embraced both strategies depending on the social situation or referent involved, drawing thus on multiple tools to build status. This allows a more subtle understanding of ethnicity, showing that it is a feature not of the individual but of the everyday contexts in which she is located; ethnicity ‘happens at particular moments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468796813483730">Brubaker et al., 2006</xref>: 208), proving useful in some situations and less useful in others. Our findings are thus not contradictory but demonstrate the continuous making and un-making of ethnic boundaries. What is notable about the interplay of the strategies documented here is that they highlight the fluctuating relevance, rather than declining relevance, of an ‘ethnic lens’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468796813483730">Glick Schiller et al., 2006</xref>) in individual migrants’ de-stigmatising discourses and practices that produce, transform or at times elide different ethnic boundaries.</p>
