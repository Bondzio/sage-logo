<abstract>
<p>Because many seniors choose Medicare Part D plans offering poorer coverage at greater cost, the authors examined the effect of price frames, brand names, and choice set size on participants’ ability to choose the lowest cost plan. A 2 × 2 × 2 within-subjects design was used with 126 participants aged 18 to 91 years old. Mouselab, a web-based program, allowed participants to choose drug plans across eight trials that varied using numeric or symbolic prices, real or fictitious drug plan names, and three or nine drug plan options. Results from the multilevel models suggest numeric versus symbolic prices decreased the likelihood of choosing the lowest cost plan (−8.0 percentage points, 95% confidence interval = −14.7 to −0.9). The likelihood of choosing the lowest cost plan decreased as the amount of information increased suggesting that decision cues operated independently and collectively when selecting a drug plan. Redesigning the current Medicare Part D plan decision environment could improve seniors’ drug plan choices.</p>

<p>Millions of senior citizens report difficulties in choosing their Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558711435365">Konrad, 2009</xref>). With dozens of different insurance plans selling prescription drugs for Part D and a lack of standardized benefits, it is no wonder that older adults report difficulties. Despite its financial and health ramifications, little is known regarding how older adults navigate the current maze of choices under the Part D program. We do know, however, that saving money is the most important factor in their decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558711435365">MedPAC, 2006</xref>). Yet, the evidence shows that only a small minority are actually choosing the lowest cost plan available to them with potential individual losses of hundreds of dollars annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558711435365">Gruber, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558711435365">Hanoch, Rice, Cummings, and Wood (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711435365">Hanoch, Wood, Barnes, Liu, and Rice (2011)</xref>, and others, the difficulty in choosing the lowest cost plan for seniors is in part due to the sheer size of the choice set they face. Beyond cost, medical decision-making research has demonstrated that how numeric information is presented to consumers (e.g., quantitative or symbolic) can affect decision outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558711435365">Dudley, Hibbard, &amp; Shaller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711435365">Hibbard, Slovic, Peters, Finucane, &amp; Tusler, 2001</xref>). Factors such as company reputation play an important role in consumers’ medical decisions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558711435365">MedPAC, 2006</xref>). However, little is known about how numeric information, like price, affects older adults’ Medicare Part D decisions, and how, if at all, older adults trade off between company reputation and costs. The aim of this article is to investigate the effect of price frames (e.g., the use of symbols such as $$$$ vs. numeric dollar amounts), real versus fictitious company name (i.e., brand effects), and choice set size on whether consumer choose the lowest cost Medicare Part D plan and, if they do not, the dollar amount of the “loss.”</p>
<p>To investigate these questions, we used a computer-based process-tracing program called “Mouselab” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558711435365">Bettman, Johnson, &amp; Payne, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558711435365">Payne, Bettman, &amp; Johnson, 1993</xref>). Mouselab is a web-based decision environment which presents information about choices in a grid but, akin the game “Memory,” the information in each cell is hidden. When the cursor moves over the cell, the information is revealed allowing researchers to trace the decision-making process and record participants’ decisions.</p>
<p>In recent years, a number of researchers have come to question the idea that increased choice benefits consumers. Iyengar and colleagues, for example, have shown that offering more choices—whether chocolate, jams, or job offers—can negatively affect performance and reduce satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558711435365">Iyengar, Huberman, &amp; Jiang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558711435365">Iyengar &amp; Lepper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558711435365">Iyengar, Wells, &amp; Schwartz, 2006</xref>). In one illustrative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558711435365">Iyengar et al. (2004)</xref> examined 80,000 individuals’ willingness to join a 401(k) retirement plan in relationship to the number of plans to choose from. The authors found that the more choices employees had, the less likely they were to join the program, a phenomenon referred to as “decision fatigue.” Decision fatigue has also been shown to affect health insurance and retirement saving plans decisions domestically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558711435365">Besedeš, Deck, Sarangi, &amp; Shor, in press</xref>) and in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558711435365">Schram &amp; Sonnemans, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Medicare Part D program offers a policy relevant, real world setting to examine the effect of choice set size on older adults’ performance. Capitalizing on this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558711435365">Bundorf and Szrek (2010)</xref> have found that on one hand having a larger number of drug plans to choose from (2, 5, 10, and 16) increased participants’ satisfaction with their decision; on the other hand, it also amplified their desire to see fewer options on the menu. Other studies found that offering a greater array of plan choices size negatively affected both older and younger participants’ performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558711435365">Hanoch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711435365">Hanoch et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In our earlier investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558711435365">Hanoch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711435365">Hanoch et al., 2011</xref>), however, we did not examine the questions of how brand name and price frame might affect older adults’ decision performance. These are important factors to address, as a large body of research has shown that consumers are sensitive to both brand name and the framing of numeric information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558711435365">Dudley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558711435365">Grewal, Krishnan, Baker, &amp; Borin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711435365">Hibbard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558711435365">Smith &amp; Brynjolfsson, 2001</xref>). More significantly, it has been shown that consumers often use brand names as a proxy for product quality and thus create decision shortcuts (or heuristics) in making decisions. A study comparing risk perception of generic versus brand name drugs found that between 14% and 53% of respondents perceived the generic drug as posing greater risk, and that a large financial discount was required to convince consumers to purchase generic prescription drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558711435365">Ganther &amp; Kreling, 2000</xref>). Looking at judgments and choices about an unknown product, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558711435365">Brucks, Zeithaml, and Naylor (2000)</xref> showed that while brand names play a pivotal role in decision making, consumers use price and brand name as independent factors in their decision process. A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558711435365">Rao and Monroe (1989)</xref> found that both brand name and price positively predicted consumers’ perceived product quality.</p>
<p>Moreover, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558711435365">Hoyer and Brown (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558711435365">Maheswaran, Mackie, and Chaiken (1992)</xref> provide important insights regarding the relationship between brand name and decision strategy. Brand name, it was found, was associated with sampling or evaluating fewer choices—that is, reliance on more simplified decision strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558711435365">Hoyer &amp; Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558711435365">Maheswaran et al., 1992</xref>). Making a decision based on brand name, in addition, carried a price: those who used brand name as a cue made inferior decisions.</p>
<p>A large corpus of data shows that brand names play a role in the decision processes and outcomes. Whether price frame (symbol vs. numeric) has a similar effect is an open question. To our knowledge, only two studies have used symbols instead of numbers to examine consumer’s decision performance in the health domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711435365">Hibbard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558711435365">Peters, Dieckmann, Dixon, Hibbard, &amp; Mertz, 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, these two studies did not examine how price frame affects participants’ performance. The researchers did find that presenting symbols instead of numbers with regard to hospital quality did influence the participant’s choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711435365">Hibbard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558711435365">Peters et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1077558711435365">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>To bridge the gap between prior work on price frames and brand effects in other medical decision settings and Medicare Part D decisions, we investigated the role of these decision cues as well as choice set size on whether participants chose the lowest cost plan and, conditional on not choosing this plan, the amount of money they would have lost. We used four hypotheses to guide our analysis. First, we hypothesized that numeric (vs. symbol) price frames make it more difficult to choose the lowest cost plan and larger dollar losses conditional on choosing an alternate plan (Hypothesis 1). Second, we predicted that having real (vs. fictitious) brand names are associated with a lower likelihood of choosing the lowest cost plan and greater monetary loss (Hypothesis 2). Third, we hypothesized increases in the size of the choice set also lowers the probability of choosing the cheapest plan and increases dollar losses (Hypothesis 3). Finally, we predicted increasing the amount of information in the decision environment, through combinations of the three conditions above, is associated with lower likelihood of choosing the cheapest plan and higher financial losses if an alternate plan was chosen (Hypothesis 4).</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The study was conducted in Claremont, California, a community 30 miles east of Los Angeles. A total of 129 individuals participated in the study. Of these, 126 had complete data and were used in the main analysis. Aiming to recruit a sample across life span, older participants were recruited from an existing senior participant pool and through advertisements at senior centers. Younger participants were recruited from the staff and student body of the Claremont Colleges and from community boards.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077558711435365">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>MouselabWeb, an updated version of the original Mouselab, was used to examine differences in participants’ decision outcomes across experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558711435365">Payne, Bettman, &amp; Johnson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558711435365">Willemsen &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Mouselab has been used extensively to understand how individuals acquire information and make choices in a range of decision-making settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558711435365">Bettman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558711435365">Johnson, Payne, &amp; Bettman, 1988</xref>). In this study, the MouselabWeb design was adopted to simulate the official Medicare website.</p>
<p>A hypothetical scenario about a friend, “Bill,” was presented and all participants were asked to help Bill choose a Medicare prescription drug plan. More specifically, participants read the following paragraphs, and were asked to choose a Medicare drug plan based only on the information presented to them:
<disp-quote><p>Imagine that one of your friends, whom we’ll call Bill, has asked you to help him in choosing a Medicare prescription drug plan. He has made it clear that he is not sure how to choose among the different drug plans, and therefore would like you to make the choice for him. However, Bill has told you a little about the type of drug plan he would like. He does not want to spend a lot of money. That is, he wants to keep his annual cost, monthly premium, and annual deductible as low as possible. He is, however, not sure whether he should get a plan that offers coverage in the gap. He is also interested in a company that he knows and feels he can trust. Finally, he expects to get all of his drugs by calling a toll-free phone number, and having them mailed to his home. In the screens that follow, you will see information about a range of drug plans (their name, their estimated annual cost, their monthly drug premium, the number of network pharmacies, whether they offer coverage in the gap, and their annual deductible). Please try to make the best choice for Bill.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>After reading a scenario description on the Medicare prescription drug plan, participants were instructed to choose the prescription drug plan that suits Bill’s needs. Information about drug plans was presented on a computer screen and varied along six dimensions: plan name, estimated annual cost, monthly drug premium, annual deductible, coverage in the gap, and number of network pharmacies. The information presented for each plan was based on actual Part D plans obtained from the Medicare website. Information on various plans and their attributes was presented in a grid. Participants needed to move the computer mouse to see the information hidden underneath labeled boxes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558711435365">Figure 1</xref>). Once they moved the cursor from one box to the next, the previous box closed and the new one opened. They were also told that definitions of insurance terms were available. Note taking was allowed to minimize working memory load and was controlled for in the regression analyses. After clicking the “next page” button, participants faced one of eight possible decision trials.</p>

</fig>
<p>The eight trials represented all combinations of the three treatment conditions (price frame, brand effects, choice set size). To avoid learning effects, the trials were randomly presented through computerized design; thus the order was counterbalanced between subjects. Because not all participants completed all of the trials, the 126 participants with complete data represented 955 decision trials. After each trial, participants were asked to rate the most and least important information across the six dimensions that affected their choice. The study protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and prior to the start of the study, written informed consent was obtained. Participants also completed a demographic questionnaire and were paid $20 per hour for their participation.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1077558711435365">
<title>Decision outcomes</title>
<p>We included two decision outcomes—whether the participant chose the lowest cost plan and the dollar amount of loss if the participant did not choose the lowest cost plan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558711435365">
<title>Primary regressors</title>
<p>We examined the amount of information in participants’ decision environment using indicators for whether the trial had numeric or symbolic price frame information, real or fictitious drug plan names, and three or nine drug plans to chose from. Four categories of symbolic prices ranging from one dollar sign ($) to four dollar signs ($$$$) were created based on the numeric prices of the plan in the complementary experimental condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558711435365">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>We controlled for demographics, note taking, and numeric literacy. Demographic controls included an indicator for whether or not the respondent was older than 65 years, gender (female or not), race/ethnicity (a dummy variable where Caucasian is the referent group), education (at least some college or not), marital status (married or not), and mental and physical component scores (MCS and PCS from the SF-12v2). Whether participants chose to take notes during the task was also controlled for. Numeric literacy was controlled for using an 11-item numeracy scale, which consists mostly of questions on the calculation of basic probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558711435365">Lipkus, Samsa, &amp; Rimer, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077558711435365">
<title>Stated preferences about decisions</title>
<p>After each decision trial, participants were asked which of the plan attributes (drug plan name, total annual cost, monthly premium, number of pharmacies, coverage in the gap, annual deductible) was most and least important to them while making their decision.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077558711435365">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To examine associations of our experimental conditions with the decision outcomes while controlling for observed confounders (i.e., demographics, note taking, and numeric literacy) and accounting for the within-subject repeated measures design, we used multilevel regression. Level 1 modeled information from each trial for each participant as separate observations. Level 2 included a random intercept term for each individual to capture differences among trials across participants. Interaction effects between the three experimental conditions were included in the models.</p>
<p>To estimate the adjusted association price frames, brand effects, and choice set size with choosing the lowest cost plan, multilevel logistic models were used. Multilevel linear regression models were used to estimate the adjusted associations of the experimental conditions and the dollar value of loss if participants did not choose the lowest cost plan. Risk differences were calculated representing the percentage point difference in the probability of choosing the lowest cost plan between experimental conditions while holding the model covariates at their original values. A similar approach was used to calculate the predictive margin of monetary loss. Model predictions used to construct risk differences and predictive margins consider only the fixed effect, or within person, portion of the multilevel logistic models and not the individual random effect. Bias-corrected standard errors for risk differences and monetary loss margins were obtained by bootstrapping using 1,000 replicates. An alpha level of 5% was used to determine the statistical significance of model estimates.</p>

<p>The participants were mostly female (63.2%). Less than half were older than 65 years (42.0%), of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity (39.6%), completed college (36.9%), were married (31.4%), or took notes during the tasks (39.4%). The average mental component score (MCS) was 48.86 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.17) and participants had an average physical component score (PCS) of 49.33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.49). On average, participants scored 8.32 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.27) on the numeracy scale. (The ranges for these variables appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558711435365">Table 1</xref>.)</p>
<p>Regarding participants’ preferences about what drug plan attributes were viewed as the most and least important when making their decision, 44.1% of the overall sample indicated estimated annual cost was most important, followed by coverage in the gap (18.5%) and monthly premiums (16.7%); 4.9% of participants reported drug plan names were most important (table available on request). In line with the prompt that Bill would receive his prescriptions through the mail, only 6% thought the number of pharmacies was the most important plan attribute. For participants who did not choose the lowest cost plan, 28.3% reported coverage in the gap was most important in making their decision suggesting a possible trade-off between overall costs and drug coverage. Conversely, 41.6% of the overall sample reported drug plan names were least important when making their decision followed by the number of pharmacies (27.0%) and coverage in the gap (21.1%).</p>

<p>After adjusting for observed confounders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558711435365">Table 2</xref>), we found support for our first hypothesis that participants facing a numeric versus symbolic price frame found it harder to choose the lowest cost drug plan and, conditional on not choosing it, experienced larger monetary losses. Participants in trials that used numeric (vs. symbolic) costs had an 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = −14.7 to −0.9) percentage point lower probability of choosing the lowest cost plan while holding model covariates at their original values. Participants in the experimental condition using numeric prices who did not choose the lowest cost plan lost $55.29 (95% CI = 43.16 to 67.06) more dollars after adjustment than those in the symbolic price condition.</p>

<p>The evidence did not support the hypothesis that real versus fictitious drug plan names would lower the adjusted probability of choosing the lowest cost plan and higher losses (Hypothesis 2). Participants in trials using real rather than fictitious drug plans were equally likely to choose the lowest cost plan (risk difference = −6.4 percentage points; 95% CI = −12.7 to 2.4) but experienced smaller losses if they did not choose the lowest cost plan (−$17.80; 95% CI = −29.79 to −5.99).</p>
<p>Evidence from our adjusted models supported our third hypothesis that choosing from among nine versus three drug plans would lower the likelihood of choosing the cheapest plan and larger monetary losses if a more expensive plan was chosen. Nine versus three plans was associated with a 30.9 (95% CI = −35.6 to −20.9) percentage point lower probability of choosing the lowest cost plan while holding covariates at their original values. Participants choosing from nine rather than three plans lost $40.31 (95% CI = 24.79 to 52.39) more dollars if they did not choose the cheapest plan.</p>
<p>We next examined combinations of experimental conditions to test the hypothesis that increasing the amount of information in the decision environment was associated with a lower likelihood of choosing the lowest cost plan and larger losses conditional on choosing an alternative plan (Hypothesis 4). The results supported our fourth hypothesis in that, relative to a trial with symbolic prices, fictitious brand names, and three drug plans, increasing the amount of information by switching combinations of the experimental conditions resulted in lower probabilities of choosing the cheapest plan and larger losses if an alternate plan was chosen. For example, participants in a decision environment with numeric prices, real drug plan names, and nine plans had a 56.0 (95% CI = −63.4 to −34.5) percentage point lower probability of choosing the lowest cost plan compared with those facing symbolic prices, fictitious drug plan names and three plans. They also lost $96.70 (95% CI = 66.89 to 119.15) if the lowest cost plan was not selected. One exception to this finding was, as noted above, switching from fictitious to real brand names while holding prices as symbolic and the number of choices at three plans was associated with lower losses (−$30.46; 95% CI = −56.82 to −8.37).</p>
<p>Although minimizing costs was considered the primary objective of the decision tasks in our analysis, the prompt suggested participants may care about choosing a plan with coverage in the gap and were interested in a drug plan they knew and could trust. Thus, a priori, participants may have been willing to spend more money in order to choose a plan with coverage in the gap or with a particular brand name. The preferences for plan attributes presented earlier suggest individuals found drug plan names the least important regardless of whether they chose the lowest cost plan suggesting individuals were not choosing more expensive, branded drug plans. However, those who did not choose the lowest cost plan may have done so because they felt coverage in the gap was important. To determine if some participants were making trade-offs between cost and coverage, we subdivided the sample to the 43 participants, representing 146 trials, who indicated coverage in the gap was most important and who did not choose the lowest cost plan. We then created an indicator for whether or not these individuals chose the lowest cost plan among the subset of plans that included coverage in the gap and then repeated the multilevel model analyses above. Because of sample size limitations, the interaction terms were not included in the subanalyses.</p>
<p>Among this subgroup, 76.0% chose the cheapest plan with coverage in the gap from the remaining set of drug plans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558711435365">Table 3</xref>). Similar to the overall sample, numeric prices and nine plans were associated with lower probabilities of choosing the lowest cost plan with coverage in the gap after adjusting for confounders. Switching from symbolic to numeric prices while holding covariates at their original values was associated with a 14.5 (95% CI = −27.6 to −1.4) percentage point decrease in the probability of choosing the lowest cost plan with coverage in the gap. Similarly, increasing the choice set size from three to nine plans was associated with an 18.8 (95% CI = −31.7 to −5.9) point decline. Both of these experimental conditions were also associated with increased monetary losses if an alternative plan was chosen (numeric prices = $41.33, 95% CI = 23.34 to 59.31; nine plans = $62.18, 95% CI = 43.95 to 80.41). These results when, combined with the main analysis, suggest that whether participants primarily cared about cost or whether they cared about coverage and cost, price frames and choice set size affected their ability to choose plans in line with these preferences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Do price frame, company name, and choice set size affect Medicare Part D decision performance? Our results suggest that price frames and choice set size matter. Participants in choice environments using numeric rather than symbolic price frames had an 8 percentage point lower probability of choosing the lowest cost plan. This finding is congruent with a recent policy paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558711435365">Dudley et al. (2010)</xref> suggesting that using symbols rather than numbers in health care decision tasks make data more evaluable and less cognitively burdensome. Using qualitative rather than quantitative price information is, de facto, reductionist but our results suggest reducing the price dimension from cardinal to ordinal improved participants’ ability to select the lowest cost plan. Switching the presentation of cost and quality data in the Medicare Part D choice environment from numeric to symbolic could help seniors in their choice of a drug plan even if the remaining choice attributes (e.g., number of drug plans) were kept at the status quo.</p>
<p>Our results add further evidence that reducing choice set size improves seniors’ performance in the Medicare Part D environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558711435365">Hanoch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711435365">Hanoch et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, the improvements in individuals’ choice performance are substantial. In addition to making an initial drug plan selection more difficult, recent evidence also suggests increased choice size can lead to “stickiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558711435365">Frank &amp; Lamirand, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558711435365">McWilliams, Afendulis, McGuire, &amp; Landon, 2011</xref>). We know less than 10% of Medicare beneficiaries actually change plans during open enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558711435365">Neuman et al., 2007</xref>). One possibility this stickiness is that the sheer number of choices in the program reduces the likelihood of changing drug plan, even when it is financially beneficial to do so. This possibility is supported by an analysis of both the Swiss health insurance market and Medicare Advantage, where consumers who faced more choice were less likely to switch plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558711435365">Frank &amp; Lamirand, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558711435365">McWilliams et al., 2011</xref>). To keep prices low and quality high in a market with fewer drug plan options, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could act as an agent for seniors. The Medicare Part D website could allow seniors to input the plan attributes they care most about and then present them with a small subset of “preferred” options to choose from with the remainder of the choice set available if the initial set does not meet the senior’s needs.</p>
<p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, the stakes of the choice tasks participants completed were low. If we were examining real instead of hypothetical choices, individuals might expend more mental resources to perform better. Second, given the community-based convenience sampling frame employed, state and national inferences may be limited. Furthermore, compared with the general U.S. population of older (and younger) adults, our sample was more educated and had higher income. Nonetheless, our adjusted estimates should be broadly generalizable insofar as controls for education also proxy for income. Third, better performance with a smaller choice set may be explained by the fact that, given that participants guess, they are more likely to guess correctly. An analysis of this competing hypothesis suggests this is not the case. We found participants would have to be 5 times as likely to guess in the 9-plan condition as in the 3-plan condition to account for the observed difference in the probability of choosing the lowest cost plan.</p>
<p>In our study, brand names followed closely by number of pharmacies were the least important factors in individuals’ choice of drug plans suggesting individuals were not choosing more expensive plans because of brand effects or to purchase from more pharmacies. However, respondents in 146 of the 516 trials in which participants did not choose the lowest cost plan indicated that coverage in the gap was the most important factor in their decisions. This subset represents an interesting case, as they might have been willing to pay a higher price for more extensive drug coverage. Trading cost for coverage could indicate two (not mutually exclusive) possibilities. First, this subset might have greater drug utilization and thus their choice represents their actual needs (rather than the factitious character Bill). Second, this group might be more risk averse (or face greater health risks), and hence willing to pay more for greater coverage. Interestingly, being risk averse might prove to be financially beneficial in the Medicare Part D environment. Looking at real drug utilization among Medicare beneficiaries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558711435365">Domino, Stearns, Norton, and Yeh (2008)</xref> found that many would incur financial loss, due to changes in drug use and drug coverage, if they stick to the cheapest drug plan. That is, as it is difficult to foresee what medications one might require in the future, picking a less generous drug plan (which tends to be cheaper) could carry a financial cost. Domino et al.’s (2008) research captures nicely the possible trade-off that beneficiaries must make between price and coverage. Indeed, about a quarter of the sample who indicated coverage in the gap as the most important factor in their decisions failed to choose the cheapest drug plan on the menu. At the same time, as with our general results, this subset also made better decisions when faced with fewer choices and symbolic prices.</p>
<p>Our finding, coupled with those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558711435365">Domino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558711435365">McWilliams et al., 2011</xref>) further illustrates the complex nature of choosing a Medicare Part D drug plan, and the need to provide beneficiaries with a more user friendly decision environment. In the midst of a broadening concern over the national debt, entitlement reform has again come into the spotlight with all sides aiming to control Medicare costs. This research suggests minor changes to the Medicare Part D website, in particular the presentation of price, may lead to cost savings for beneficiaries and the government. While further research is needed to determine the potential scope of the savings, policies aimed at price frames appear to be low-hanging fruit with little political risk and should be considered further.</p>
