<p>Given long histories of international migration and cross-border movement, the recent identification of the ‘feminization of migration’ in policy and media debates is something that demands critical academic scrutiny. Questioning the evidence for the increased proportion of women involved in migration is important given that talk of women’s migration raises the spectres of coercion, trafficking and exploitation – all things seemingly dismissed in the context of male migration. This is something particularly evident in debates surrounding sex work, where it is widely assumed that migrating women are victims of sex traffickers who require ‘saving’. Media representations invoke stereotyped categories of race, gender, class and sexuality to establish the idea that Eastern women are vulnerable agents unable to make capable or rational decisions about migration, with images of trafficked women presenting an unanswerable argument for tighter border control and surveillance of migrant bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-096466391202100203">Agustin, 2007</xref>). As such, Sharron FitzGerald (p. 3) begins this edited collection by suggesting that Western governments’ ‘manipulation of racialised and gendered stereotypes of non-Western women’ is something that serves to justify the control and regulation of migrating women’s bodies and behaviour. Putting this in the context of post 9/11 anxieties about the permeability of national boundaries, FitzGerald argues that the vocabulary that frames women’s transborder mobility makes a case for both tightening the boundaries of the nation-state as well as subjecting the female migrant body to intense scrutiny given the vulnerabilities assumed to be in play. </p>
<p>Situated in the fertile terrains where human geography, socio-legal studies and political theory meet, <italic>Regulating the International Movement of Women</italic> is an edited collection that does not shy away from exploring issues of women’s exploitation and violence against women. However, rather than adding to the wealth of accounts that provide ethnographic evidence of such exploitation, the focus of this volume is to explore vulnerability not so much as a ‘fundamental human condition’, but as a ‘tactic of neoliberal governance’ (p. 4). The nine chapters are organised in three thematic sections, the first of which explores the notion of citizenship as it applies to different migrant groups, while the second explores the intersection of race and migration in relation to different notions of victimhood, and the third questions the existence of vulnerability in sex trafficking.</p>
<p>In the first part of the book, Rosemary Hunter begins by posing some interesting questions about the slipperiness of the categories ‘at risk’ and ‘risky’ as they apply to different migrant groups. Focusing on the UK, she argues that policies relating to forced marriage have resulted in an over-precautionary approach to the in-migration of young women (especially from South Asia) and a contrary under-awareness of issues of vulnerability among older ethnic minority women already resident in the UK. It is this theme of contrary policy and unintended outcome that recurs throughout this volume, with discourses of vulnerability and community cohesion conversely creating the conditions whereby the law is unable to adequately distinguish between the vulnerable and the culpable. In Sarah Keenan’s chapter, for example, this is evidenced in the way that vulnerable lesbian refugees need to visibly conform to Western ideals of sexual citizenship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-096466391202100203">Stychin (2006</xref>) on ‘the good gay’) to obtain the right to remain and prove a well-founded fear of persecution. Through such a move, Keenan argues that this produces positive outcomes for some lesbian refugees, but ultimately perpetuates damaging hierarchies of gender, race and class. Exposing the homonormativity of the law, and its enfolding in colonial projects which emphasise the Western state’s superiority and cultural tolerance, Keenan’s chapter is a fascinating account of the use of law in creating landscapes of inclusion and exclusion. So too is Heli Askola’s chapter on the Othering of Roma within the EU, which notes the apparent co-existence of full rights of EU citizenship with the multiple forms of discrimination faced by the Roma as they seek to exercise rights to mobility within the EU.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the EU to consider US guest worker programmes, Deborah Dixon begins the second section of the book on vulnerability and race by providing a geographical ‘counter-topography’ of female H-2B visa holders. Considering mainly Mexican women working in Carolina’s fish-meat and seafood industry, she contrasts the ‘vulnerability’ of domestic US workers to the immigration of foreign workers, and considers the panoply of laws which have served to restrict the rights of employed ‘aliens’, whom, she argues, enjoy few entitlements and privileges within the law. Returning to the EU, Nadina Christopoulou and Gabriella Lazaridis consider the migrant woman as abject in the eyes of the Greek state, and provide three powerful cases studies of women whose vulnerabilities appear related to their being welcomed into a patriarchal state where the price for admission is an acceptance of a submissive, silent subjectivity. Here, there is an engagement with Agamben’s notions of bare life, with the idea of the female migrant as <italic>homo</italic> <italic>sacer </italic>being deployed to emphasise the importance of the law in creating spaces that are liminal to the extent they appear ‘beyond the law’. Continuing the theme of asylum, Helen Baillot, Sharon Cowan and Vanessa Munro highlight how decision-makers assess claims to vulnerability among those women alleging to have been raped. Emphasising the ways in which decisions fall back on essentialised notions of identity, based on a selective assessment of applicant’s narratives, they argue that stereotyped views of culture, nationalism and gender prevent an understanding of how interlocking and overlapping aspects of vulnerability need to be attended to by policy-makers and decision-makers operating at the sharp end of asylum policy. As they argue, things are not always different between the ‘liberated’ West and those nations understood through a fog of colonial and racial myths; rape cannot be understood through generalisable truths that neatly map onto national territories.</p>
<p>In the final section of the book, these questions of vulnerability and legal affect are deployed to investigate the specific impact of the law on the sex industries. Anna Carline kicks things off here with a reading of recent ‘panic’ legislation in the UK (specifically, clauses in the 2009 Policing and Crime Act), engaging with the work of Judith Butler to suggest that the state and law’s attempt to present all sex work as violence is an attempt to construct a ‘schema of intelligibility’ that cannot accommodate the realities of gendered exploitation, given that most sex workers choose their work voluntarily and experience little coercion and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-096466391202100203">Agustin, 2007</xref>). Sharron FitzGerald extends this notion through her close reading of the Home Office’s prostitution strategy and <italic>Action Plan on Tackling Human Trafficking</italic> (2007), arguing that the figure of the migrant sex worker has been caught up in debates about the vulnerability of the nation-state to ‘foreign influence’, and hence subject to calculative forms of governmentality which often operate ‘at a distance’ (p. 170). Finally, Tsachi Keren-Paz explores the intersection of moral and legal obligations towards the victims of sex trafficking, asking difficult questions about fault and fairness. Here, the idea that society benefits from rules that make victims more, rather than less, vulnerable is a powerful, if contentious, argument.</p>
<p>Overall then, this volume is a powerful feminist intervention in debates which often become mired in questions about the ‘realities’ of gendered vulnerabilities, with evidence mustered on both sides about the exaggerated nature of gendered violence, or, conversely, its inevitability within a profoundly gendered global economy. Sidestepping debates about the magnitude of exploitation, this book charts out a terrain in which the very categories and definitions of vulnerability come into question, and where the value of a critical legal perspective is highlighted. Overall, the case studies work best when they retreat from considering abstract legal questions of blame, culpability and punishment to consider the enactment of the law in specific times and places. Here, attention to the intersectionality of the different scales at which law operates is especially valuable, helping the contributions to connect issues which initially appear grounded in local lawscapes to wider geopolitical projects (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-096466391202100203">Hubbard, 2011</xref>). While the volume stops short of offering a compelling case for a legal geography of gendered migration, by exploring the intersections of governmentality, space and law, it points to the possibility of work that is both theoretically sophisticated and empirically nuanced in this area of pressing international concern, moving us beyond seemingly ever-present myths about the ‘global trade in women’.</p>
