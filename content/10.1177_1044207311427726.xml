<abstract>
<p>Students with disabilities have high rates of dropping out of school despite safeguards from Individuals With Disabilities Education Act provisions. The purpose of the study was to explore the effects of disability classification, demographics, and selected academic experiences on school drop-out rates among youth with disabilities. Variables related to youth characteristics and school experiences were drawn from selected participants (<italic>N</italic> = 5,018) in the first three waves of the National Longitudinal and Transitional Study 2 database. Data were entered sequentially into a logistic regression model to identify factors associated with dropping out. Findings indicated that students with emotional and behavioral disorders had a significantly higher risk of dropping out but that disability classification was not significant with consideration of academic factors. Disciplinary exclusion, grade retention, and lower than average grades were associated with a higher risk of dropping out. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Reducing the number of students who drop out of school is an urgent national policy issue. Despite protections established under Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as well as numerous drop-out prevention initiatives, many students with disabilities have higher rates of dropout than students without disabilities. For example, the U.S. Department of Education (U.S. DOE), Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) reported that, in the 2004–2005 academic year, 28.3% of students with disabilities dropped out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207311427726">U.S. DOE, OSEP, 2010</xref>). In the same reporting period, the status drop-out rate for students without disabilities was only around 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1044207311427726">U.S. DOE, National Center for Education Statistics, 2007</xref>). Drop-out rates were varied according to disability classifications: Youth who were classified with emotional disturbances (ED) had drop-out rates of 48.2%, youth with learning disabilities (LD) had drop-out rates of 26.8%, youth with speech-language impairments (SI) had a 25.2% drop-out rate, youth with other health impairments (OHI) had a 24.7% drop-out rate, and youth with mental retardation (MR) had drop-out rates of 24.5%. Within these five categories were placed nearly 90% of all youth with disabilities between the ages of 6 and 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207311427726">U.S. DOE, OSEP, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Consequences of Dropping Out</title>
<p>In the information-driven, global society of 2011, a high school diploma has become a minimum requirement for many job opportunities and economic stability. Data from the U.S. Department of Labor Surveys showed that the median income for individuals without a high school diploma was US$444 per week, but the median income for individuals with a high school diploma was US$626 per week and nearly doubles to US$1,038 per week for those with a bachelor’s degree. Similarly, the rate of unemployment was highest for people without a high school diploma. In 2010, individuals with less than a high school diploma had an unemployment rate of 14.9%. In contrast, high school graduates had an average 10.3% unemployment rate, and individuals who had completed a bachelor’s degree had a 5.4% unemployment rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1044207311427726">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The path for youth with disabilities has similar outcomes. National knowledge about outcomes for youth with disabilities in 2011 has primarily come from the national Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS) and the National Longitudinal and Transitional Study 2 (NLTS2). Although within 2 years of leaving school youth with disabilities who dropped out were more likely to be employed than youth with disabilities who completed school, the students who dropped out were less likely to earn higher wages, vote, or obtain drivers licenses. The students who dropped out were also more likely to be arrested, to change jobs often, and to start families than youth in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207311427726">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Garza, &amp; Levine, 2005</xref>). Youth with disabilities who did not complete high school were less likely to earn a General Education Development diploma and consequently were less likely to take college entrance exams or attend postsecondary institutions than youth without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1044207311427726">Rossi, Herting, &amp; Wolman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>). Across disability categories, students with an emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) had more challenges, including (a) trouble getting along with teachers and peers, (b) lower grades, (c) participating in more fights, (d) higher rates of suspension, and (e) expressing dissatisfaction with school in addition to having the lowest school completion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1044207311427726">Scientific Research International [SRI], 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1044207311427726">2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Drop-Out Prediction and Prevention</title>
<p>Experts at the What Works Clearinghouse have identified several evidence-based drop-out prevention programs that were proven to be effective in keeping students in school or completing school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311427726">Dynarski et al., 2008</xref>). To better inform these programs, the researchers identified several predictors for increased risk of dropping out, including absences, behavior problems, low academic achievement, and grade retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311427726">Dynarski et al., 2008</xref>). The information has to be used for identifying and targeting youth who are at risk for dropout to remain vital to program improvement. One recommendation was to use data systems to identify students at risk of dropping out to refer these students to evidence-based prevention programs. This referral would be critical because “implementing a generic program without assessing the extent of the problem and accurately identifying the students who need it is ill-advised” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311427726">Dynarski et al., 2008</xref>, p. 12). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311427726">Dynarski et al. (2008)</xref> further suggested using longitudinal data sets to help accomplish this identification and referral objective.</p>
<p>Drop-out predictors have been identified in various studies on youth in the general population. For example, youth who are male, Black or Hispanic, and from a lower socioeconomic background have a higher probability of dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311427726">Goldschmidt &amp; Wang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1044207311427726">Rumberger &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>). Although such individual attributes have been well known to researchers, these attributes alone did not explain the drop-out phenomenon when other factors were considered. Poor academic achievement is a strong predictor of dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311427726">Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 1995</xref>). School-related practices associated with dropping out include suspension and expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311427726">Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207311427726">Finn &amp; Rock, 1997</xref>) and grade-retention practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311427726">Alexander, Entwisle, &amp; Horsey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311427726">Reschly &amp; Christenson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207311427726">Stearns, Moller, Blau, &amp; Potochnick, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An intuitive assumption might be that these same predictors would be true for youth with disabilities, but few large-scale, longitudinal studies have been used to examine the predictive nature of these indicators for youth with disabilities. In an early study with the original NLTS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1044207311427726">Wagner (1991)</xref> found that student absences, course failure, and disciplinary problems were associated significantly with dropout. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311427726">Reschly and Christenson (2006)</xref> examined correlates of dropping out for 1,064 students with and without disabilities from the National Education and Longitudinal Study: 88 (NELS: 88). They found that grade retention, achievement, and low socioeconomic status were significant predictors of dropping out for youth with LD, ED, and students in the general population. Truancy and skipping class were also strong predictors of dropping out, although students with positive perceptions of school warmth showed decreased odds of dropping out. More recently, researchers for the National High School Center Consortium on Chicago School Research (NHSCCCSR) have identified that factors of (a) low numbers of school absences, (b) low numbers of course failures, and (c) high grade point averages were predictive of graduation for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311427726">Gwynne, Lesnick, Hart, &amp; Allensworth, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In these recent studies, similar factors, such as achievement, school absence, and grade retention, were identified as drop-out predictors for students with disabilities as consistent with findings in other predictive studies. The current study will be an addition to the drop-out literature on determining if previously identified predictive factors for dropout of youth in the general population also were associated with drop-out rates for youth with disabilities. To expand on previous NLTS2 studies, modeling factors were sequentially chosen to determine the predictive effects of selected factors beyond disability classification alone. The current study was also one of the first independent examinations of these factors for students with disabilities using the NLTS2. The researchers hope that the study will be a basis for future academic researchers interested in using the NLTS2 and the SEELS data sets.</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to use the NLTS2 data to explore the association between previously identified risk factors for dropout, such as grade retention and academic achievement, and the addition of behavioral factors, including school suspension and emotional engagement, to determine what influence was shown on the drop-out rates for students with disabilities. Longitudinal designs were beneficial for following the same cohort of students over time and taking repeated measures of a phenomenon under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207311427726">Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Epstein, 2003</xref>). The ongoing examination of risk and protective factors that had influence on outcomes for a consistent set of students was another benefit of the longitudinal design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The significant size of the NLTS2 data set was a unique opportunity to expand existing knowledge about school dropout by examining multiple factors simultaneously. The following questions guided the study:</p>

<sec id="section4-1044207311427726">
<title>Data Source and Measures</title>
<p>Data from the first three waves of the NLTS2 were used to answer the research questions. SRI experts constructed the NLTS2, which had nationally representative information for individuals who were between 13 and 17 years of age in the first wave of data collection. More than 11,000 students with disabilities were included in the initial sample. The NLTS2 included data on individual and household characteristics, school program and experience, high school achievement, and postschool outcomes from 2000 to 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1044207311427726">
<title>Analytic Sample</title>
<p>Data for the current study were selected from parent and youth interviews across the first three data collection waves. Specifically chosen were (a) the 2001 parent interviews, (b) the 2002 youth interviews, (c) the 2003 parent/youth interviews, (d) the 2004 youth interviews, (e) the 2005 parent/youth interviews, and (f) the 2005 direct assessments. Information on the NLTS2 variables’ names and coding were obtained from the <italic>NLTS2 Waves 1 and 2 Data Documentation and Dictionary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1044207311427726">Valdes et al., 2006</xref>). Interviews with parents and youth were conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviews. Questionnaires were mailed to participants who could not be reached by telephone. Questions addressing youth attitudes toward school were conducted during direct assessments and were taken from the <italic>Student Self-Concept Scale</italic> and the school attitude measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Cases that had full responses on the dependent variable (dropped out or not) across all three waves of data were used, and steps were taken to ensure that individual responses were only counted once to avoid duplication. Cases that did not have an NLTS2 assigned weight or had missing data on two of the dichotomous independent variables (grade retention and suspension) were filtered out of the sample. The final selection resulted in a total number of 5,928 cases in the unweighted sample and 5,018 cases in the weighted sample. All analyses for the current study were conducted with the weighted sample. Mean imputation was used to address missing data on three of the independent variables of household income, grades, and emotional engagement.</p>

<title>Variables and Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1044207311427726">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>Dropout was the dependent variable used in the study. Dropout was a dichotomous variable that measured whether a youth had dropped out of school. Data on dropout were obtained via a three-step process from responses to the question on school exit from the 2001 parent interview, the 2003 parent/youth interview, and the 2005 parent/youth interview. Youth were counted as dropping out if parents or youth reported that they had dropped out or been permanently expelled. Youth who tested out, aged out, were suspended, graduated, or were still in school were counted as not dropping out. Participants were matched across all three waves; thus, if a parent or youth reported being in school in Wave 1 and then dropped out in Wave 2, they were counted as students who dropped out. As such, the drop-out rate (12.5%) was reflective of a proportion of the full sample across all three waves and included students still in school in the third wave.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1044207311427726">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Information about disability classification was available in the cross instrument data file from first data collection point (W1_Dis12) and was submitted to SRI by the head of the school district or the special school. If cases were missing a response, responses were retrieved from the 2003 parent/youth interview data file (W2_DisHdr2003) and the 2005 parent/youth interview (W3_DisHdr2005). The variable was coded in the following way: 1 = <italic>LD</italic>, 2 = <italic>SI</italic>, 3 = <italic>MR</italic>, 4 = <italic>ED</italic>, 5 = <italic>hearing impairment</italic>, 6 = <italic>visual impairment</italic>, 7 = <italic>orthopedic impairment</italic>, 8 = <italic>OHI</italic>, 9 = <italic>autism</italic> (<italic>AUT</italic>), 10 = <italic>traumatic brain impairment</italic>, 11 = <italic>multiple disabilities</italic>, and 12 = <italic>deafness/blindness</italic>. These classifications were considered on students’ primary disabilities and did not include any co-occurring disabilities.</p>
<p>To make comparisons across classification subgroups, a dichotomous variable was created to represent a high-incidence disability category for the five classifications of LD, MR, ED, SI, and OHI, and to represent a low-incidence disability category that included the remaining seven categories. High incidence was coded as 0 and low incidence was coded as 1. This coding allowed for examination of the two broad categories of special education most closely aligned with special education teacher preparation programs. This coding was also a solution to the issue of the very small number of students in the discrete disabilities within the low-incidence category. Specifically, some categories within low-incidence disabilities had less than five students (i.e., deafness/blindness) and analyses required a minimum of five cases per cell.</p>
<p>Gender information was available in the 2001 parent interview (np1A1). If cases were missing a response, we retrieved responses from the 2003 parent/youth interview data file (W2_GendHdr2003) or the 2005 parent/youth interview data file (W3_GendHdr2005). Responses were coded 0 = <italic>male</italic> and 1= <italic>female</italic>. Males were used as the reference group because males were the larger group, and preliminary analyses had shown that males reported slightly lower drop-out rates than females.</p>
<p>The race/ethnicity variable was created from the NLTS2 data obtained from school districts. The variable for race and ethnicity (W1_EthnHdr_2001) was taken from student rosters provided by students’ school districts or state-supported special schools. In the absence of roster data on a youth’s racial/ethnic background, data were taken from the Wave 1 parent interview or mail survey or from subsequent waves of parent data collection if not available in an earlier wave. The variables were recoded to 1 = <italic>Caucasian/White</italic>, 2 = <italic>African American/Black</italic>, 3 = <italic>Hispanic</italic>, 4 = <italic>Asian/Pacific Islander</italic>, 5 = <italic>American Indian/Alaskan Native and Other</italic>. Five dichotomously coded variables for each category were created to make comparisons between ethnic groups and for use in the logistic regression analyses.</p>
<p>For this analysis, household income was used as a proxy variable for socioeconomic status. The NLTS2 did have a composite income variable from each wave of data that divided income into 16 categories by US$5,000 increments (&lt;US$5,000 to &gt;US$75,000). The household income variable from the 2001 parent interview (np1K15Detail) was used; missing data were completed with responses from the 2003 parent/youth interview (np1K14Detail) and the 2005 parent/youth interview (np1K14Detail). These data were standardized to a continuous variable (<italic>M</italic> = 0, <italic>SD</italic> = 1). The mean income was approximately US$35,000, and the standard deviation was equal to US$17,500. Each one standard deviation corresponded to an increase or decrease in the odds ratio.</p>
<p>Information on grades was obtained from the parent/youth interviews from all three waves. Reported grades in the first wave (np1D9b) were used and completed for missing data with reports from the second (np2d6m) and third (np3d6m) waves of data collection. The grade categories represented a broad range: (a) 3.0 to 4.0 was considered as mostly As and Bs, (b) 2.0 to 2.9 was considered mostly Bs and Cs, (c) 1.0 to 1.9 was considered mostly Cs and Ds, and (d) 0 to 0.99 was considered mostly Ds and Fs. Grades were standardized into a continuous variable for use in the analysis (<italic>M</italic> = 0, <italic>SD</italic> = 1). As with income, a one standard deviation in grades corresponded to an increase or decrease in the odds ratio. In a small number of cases, data were reported for not receiving grades or for receiving a wide range of grades. Mean imputation was used to complete missing data.</p>
<p>Information about grade retention came from the 2001 parent interview of the NLTS2, in which parents reported whether their child was retained at any point in the child’s schooling. This variable was only available in the first wave; thus, the variable was not combined across waves. The school exclusion variable was created from responses to the 2001 parent interview (np1D_5L_7h), the 2003 parent/youth interview (np2D5d_ever), and the 2005 parent/youth interview (np3D5d_ever). Responses were dichotomously coded (1 = <italic>ever suspended/expelled</italic> and 0 = <italic>never suspended or expelled</italic>). Initial data came from responses from the 2001 wave, and missing responses were completed with data from the 2003 and 2005 waves as necessary. If a parent or youth reported being suspended at all three waves, responses were only counted once. As this was a dichotomous variable and asked at all three waves, the variable only showed that a student had been suspended at any time or had never been suspended. Numbers of suspensions or expulsions could not be determined from available data.</p>
<p>The emotional engagement variable was comprised of responses for six NLTS2 questions: (a) youth enjoys school, (b) adult cares about youth, (c) youth gets along with teachers, (d) youth gets along with peers, (e) youth is satisfied with school, and (f) youth is satisfied with education. These variables were derived from interviews during direct assessments that were released in the NLTS2 second wave using the Student Self-Concept Scale and the school attitude measure. Most of these subscales were measured with a Likert-type scale that ranged in responses from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” with some variations. For the current analysis, all six variables were coded uniformly for consistency and to align with other variables in the study. The responses were matched with the final status of each student. If data were not available for that wave, data from the previous wave were imputed. The subscale variables associated with emotional engagement were summed into a single variable for which a reliability analysis was conducted. The Cronbach’s alpha was .616 for the construct. This construct was standardized to a continuous variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1044207311427726">
<title>Weights</title>
<p>The stratified and clustered sampling design of the NLTS2 resulted in proportional oversampling and undersampling of certain subgroups (i.e., disability category). SRI analysts assigned variable weights to each participant to ensure proper representation in the sample. In addition, the full sample weight contained in the NLTS2 for the appropriate data collection point was included. In combining responses from different waves, the normalized, full sample weight for the instrument with the lowest response rate was used (Valdes, July 31, 2008 personal communication). One consequence of using the raw weights provided in data sets was that some statistical packages could be “fooled” into reading the sample size as larger than it was intended to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207311427726">Thomas, Heck, &amp; Bauer, 2005</xref>). To correct for this sample size misread, weights were normalized by dividing the raw weight by its mean.</p>
<p>Another issue was the nonindependence of cases that resulted from cluster sampling. Similarities among individuals within groups become more pronounced, which might lead to biased estimates such as smaller standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207311427726">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). To adjust for the cluster similarities, the Complex Samples program in SPSS Base 16.0 was used, which was a program specifically designed for adjusting standard errors in stratified large-scale data sets. The NLST2 included stratum and cluster variables for use with the Complex Samples program.</p>

<sec id="section10-1044207311427726">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Logistic regression analysis was chosen for the analysis of understanding how dropping out was associated with the independent variables. Logistic regression is the appropriate procedure with bivariate dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207311427726">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Logistic regression was selected to predict dropout (a discrete bivariate criterion) from continuous, discrete, and dichotomous predictors. In the first model, disability status was entered with the LD group as the reference group to determine the likelihood of dropping out for youth from other categories. The reference groups for all variables were groups coded as zero (0). For the continuous variables, a code of zero was representative of the mean of that particular variable. The regression sequence included two additive models: demographics and academic experiences.</p>
<p>To guard against multicollinearity problems, tolerance statistics were examined using linear regression in the SPSS Base 17.0 version. A tolerance statistics option was not available in the SPSS Complex Samples program. The tolerance statistic is 1 − <italic>R2</italic><sub>x</sub> in which <italic>R2</italic> is the variance in each independent variable, explained by all of the other independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207311427726">Menard, 2002</xref>). Tolerance levels below .20 indicate potential multicollinearity and would be cause for concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207311427726">Menard, 2002</xref>). The current analysis showed a range of tolerance across all variables from .74 to .97, indicating that multicollinearity was not present.</p>

<title>Disability category</title>
<p>In the first model, the results showed a comparison of the likelihood of dropping out to students with LD. Students with EBD were significantly more likely to drop out, but students with low-incidence disabilities were significantly less likely to drop out. Youth with OHI, which included students diagnosed with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, had higher rates for dropping out. Youth with MR and SI were less likely to drop out; however, these categories were not statistically significant. The Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> shows that this category was the explanation for a small amount of explained variance (4%) in disability classification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1044207311427726">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>The results for the second model indicated that ethnicity and gender had no significant effect on the likelihood of dropping out; however, students whose families had higher than average income were associated significantly with a decreased likelihood of dropping out. Each one standard deviation increase in income (approximately US$17,500) was associated with a 32% (OR = 0.68) decrease in the likelihood of dropping out. For ethnicity demographics, African American students, Hispanic students, Native American students, and Asian American students had a higher likelihood of dropping out than Caucasian students; this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, results should be interpreted with caution because of the very small sample sizes for Native American and Asian American youth. For disability classification, the odds ratios remained relatively the same for youth with EBD and low-incidence disabilities. A modest increase in the explained variance (Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 8%) was shown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1044207311427726">
<title>Prior academic experiences</title>
<p>All four academic factors entered in the third model were significantly associated with the likelihood of dropping out. Youth who reported higher than average grades had a 69% lower likelihood of dropping out (OR = 0.31) for each one standard deviation increase in grades (approximately one letter grade). Higher than average levels of emotional engagement were associated with a significant decrease in the odds of dropping out. A one <italic>SD</italic> increase in emotional engagement levels was associated with a 27% (OR = 0.73) reduction in the likelihood of dropping out and was significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level. Students who reported being suspended or expelled were more than 3 times as likely (OR = 3.42) to have dropped out, and students who had been retained were more than twice as likely (OR = 2.34) to have dropped out. Both of these factors were significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 level.</p>
<p>The addition of this academic factors model had a pronounced effect on the other previously entered variables. For example, the likelihood of dropout for the EBD and low-incidence categories became statistically nonsignificant, and the likelihood of dropping out for females rose significantly. The addition of this model showed substantial increase in the amount of variance explained (Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 44%).</p>

<sec id="section16-1044207311427726">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from the current exploratory study were generally consistent with similar large-scale, drop-out studies and confirmed some previously identified factors in targeting youth for drop-out prevention programs. The current major findings indicated that disability classification alone was not a significant predictor when considered along with academic achievement, grade retention, school suspension, and emotional engagement. In addition, lower average levels of household income and being female were associated with greater odds for dropping out. In the following discussion, the results will be placed within the context of existing drop-out literature, implications for policy, study limitations, and directions for future research.</p>
<sec id="section17-1044207311427726">
<title>Disability</title>
<p>Across the 12 federally designated disability categories, youth with EBD have been known to have higher rates of dropout, more disciplinary exclusions, lower academic achievement, and poorer adult outcomes than youth in other categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>). The ways in which certain factors have an influence on school, completion or withdrawal, has not been known. The current findings that youth with EBD had a higher likelihood of dropping out was not surprising given the fact that this group had the largest drop-out rates, which was reflected in the first model. More importantly, the inclusion of academic factors reduced the likelihood of dropping out to no significance for this group of students. This finding is suggestive that academic factors have a stronger association than EBD with students’ rates of dropping out. However, it is difficult to tell from the current study which academic factor had more of an effect on the odds ratio because multiple academic factors were examined as a single group. It is plausible that the high rates of suspension for youth with EBD (80%) in this data set would account for the reduction to no significance. More inquiry is needed into the relationship between school practices such as disciplinary exclusion and school dropout.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1044207311427726">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>In the second model (demographics), the results indicated that ethnicity and gender were statistically not significant. The fact that few differences existed in dropout by ethnicity was consistent with previous research that had shown that race/ethnicity was not a factor as other factors were considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207311427726">Lee &amp; Burkam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 1995</xref>). This finding was also consistent with NLTS2 reports that showed little differences based on ethnicity in a number of different outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1044207311427726">SRI, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1044207311427726">Wagner, 1991</xref>), including dropping out.</p>
<p>Family income had a significant effect on the likelihood of dropping out. The odds ratio for students from families with higher than average income decreased by 32% for each standard deviation (1 <italic>SD</italic> = US$17,500) in annual income. Although this was consistent with previous finding that drop-out rates were high among youth from low-income backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207311427726">Laird, DeBell, &amp; Chapman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>), determining the predictive value of family income in this model was difficult. The income variable used in this analysis was a proxy for socioeconomic status. Additional components of socioeconomic status include income level, parental education, parental employment, and family cohesiveness, but these components were not considered in the current study.</p>

<title>Academic Factors</title>
<p>The third block of predictors was a significant improvement to the overall model with the result that the academic factors used in this model showed the increased likelihood for students dropping out. The largest effect among academic factors was shown from disciplinary exclusion. Students who had been suspended or expelled had increased odds for dropping out at more than 3 times the rate of students who were not suspended or expelled. Although this finding was not confirmation of a direct link between school removal and dropping out, this practice may increase the likelihood of dropping out. Previous studies had shown that students with disabilities, particularly those classified with EBD, were more prone to removal from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207311427726">Krezmien, Leone, &amp; Achilles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1044207311427726">SRI, 2006</xref>). This finding is troubling, particularly in the context of IDEA and its due process safeguards such as the manifestation determination clause and “stay put” provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1044207311427726">IDEA, 2004</xref>). Disciplinary exclusion from school also was a component in the theoretical “school to prison pipeline” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1044207311427726">Wald &amp; Losen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Grade retention was associated with increased odds of dropping out at a rate of nearly 2.5 times that for students who were not retained. This finding was consistent with existing research on youth without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311427726">Alexander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311427726">Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207311427726">Finn &amp; Rock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207311427726">Jimerson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207311427726">Stearns et al., 2007</xref>) and youth with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311427726">Reschly &amp; Christenson, 2006</xref>). The findings reported here indicate the need to examine the longitudinal associations between grade retention and later school outcomes.</p>
<p>Having higher than average grades was associated with a significant decrease in the likelihood of dropping out. Consistent with well-established research, academic achievement has been a strong predictor of school completion or dropout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311427726">Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311427726">Gwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1044207311427726">Lehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 2004</xref>). Conversely, students with lower than average grades theoretically might have increased risks for dropping out. Even as many drop-out prevention programs and special education programs include academic interventions, low academic achievement still is a persistent challenge and significant risk factor in dropout for students with disabilities.</p>

<sec id="section20-1044207311427726">
<title>Student Engagement</title>
<p>Results from the logistic regression model indicated that higher levels of emotional engagement were means of decreasing the odds of dropping out by nearly 27% (OR = .733). These findings were consistent with existing literature in which elements of emotional engagement, including positive student–teacher relationships and satisfaction with school and education, were shown to decrease the odds of dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311427726">Alexander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311427726">Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207311427726">Dunn, Chambers, &amp; Rabren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311427726">Reschly &amp; Christenson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The link between student engagement and school dropout was based in part on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207311427726">Finn’s (1989)</xref> work on student engagement. As such, student engagement became a driving force behind efforts to identify drop-out indicators and design subsequent interventions. Researchers have generally agreed on three types of engagement (a) behavioral, (b) cognitive, and (c) emotional, though academic engagement has been added by some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207311427726">Bost &amp; Riccomini, 2006</xref>). In many studies, including the current study, types of engagement were constructed retroactively from survey responses to fit previous definitions of engagement. Behavioral engagement indicators such as misbehavior and homework completion were observable, but cognitive and emotional engagement indicators were ambiguous and somewhat crude measures of emotional engagement. The contributions of each of the variables in the construct were obscured by use of the composite measure. For example, the possibility exists that youth who did not enjoy school were more potent predictors of dropout than youth who did not get along with teachers.</p>
<p>Another consideration with the results would be that emotional engagement did not exist as a separate entity but was tied into forms of behavioral engagement, for example, attendance, work completion, and extracurricular participation or cognitive engagement, for example, the utility of schoolwork, that were not considered here; thus, any potential explained variance associated with the inclusion of these variables would be missing. These variations were not included in the current study because some indicators were not available or would have presented methodological challenges. For example, attendance has been considered a very strong indicator of behavior engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1044207311427726">Balfanz, Herzog, &amp; MacIver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1044207311427726">Yazzie-Mintz, 2007</xref>) but was not yet available in the NLTS2. Other indicators that were available, including homework completion, teacher perception of behavior, and class participation, would have resulted in a substantial loss of cases due to missing data.</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind, the theoretical basis for this composite variable and its significance in the study should be interpreted with caution. Types of engagement are multidimensional, and thus, they can be used in different ways. Engagement can be seen as a mediating factor between school experiences and the decision to drop out or as a dependent outcome variable. Future research should be focused on using sound measures of engagement in different research designs rather than creating scales from available variables. Researchers at the University of Minnesota recently have developed and piloted a scale designed to measure cognitive and emotional engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207311427726">Appleton, Christenson, Kim, &amp; Reschly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207311427726">Furlong &amp; Christenson, 2008</xref>). The Student Engagement Instrument was developed within the theoretical framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207311427726">Finn’s (1989)</xref> engagement work and may become a common metric for future researchers interested in exploring student engagement.</p>
<p>The addition of the third model (academic factors) also resulted in some interesting trends in the other predictors. One notable change was that the likelihood of dropping out was increased significantly for females as academic factors were included. This finding was consistent with studies that showed higher drop-out rates for girls in controlling for other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311427726">Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 1995</xref>) but is contradictory to other findings from the NLTS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207311427726">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>) and numerous studies and reports that show the drop-out rate was higher for males than females. One plausible explanation for the varied rates is the existence of other gender-specific factors such as pregnancy or family issues that have influence on girls’ decisions to withdraw from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1044207311427726">Pirog &amp; Magee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1044207311427726">Yampolskaya, Brown, &amp; Greenbaum, 2002</xref>), but they were not considered in the current study.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section21-1044207311427726">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were several limitations to the study. Data came from an extant database that is complex and requires special training to navigate. Parent and student reports as the primary data sources would be prone to the error and bias that is characteristic of self-report data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1044207311427726">Hodapp &amp; Krasner, 1995</xref>). For example, parents may underreport dropout or suspensions/expulsions to appear more favorable. Similarly, students and parents may report grades and school engagement more positively than teachers might report these data. The use of one data source did not allow for triangulation with responses from other sources; however, the use of additional sources would have significantly reduced the sample size due to participant nonresponse. High attrition rate among NLTS2 participants has an effect on generalization of results. Plausible assumptions include that some students may have dropped out of school and left the study, which might have resulted in an underestimation of overall drop-out rates. Despite these limitations, parent and youth responses reflect firsthand accounts and provide a “jumping-off” point for more detailed data analysis.</p>
<p>The use of collapsed variables was another limitation. The school exclusion and grade retention variables were dichotomous; therefore, it could not be determined whether multiple suspensions or being retained more than one time had a cumulative effect on the likelihood of dropping out. The findings were robust, however, and may indicate the need for further inquiry into the associations between grade retention, suspensions, and school dropout. Similarly, although the emotional engagement composite was theoretically driven, it could have been more robust with the inclusion of additional questions to provide a more complete picture for practitioners and policy makers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1044207311427726">
<title>Implications for Policy and Practice</title>
<p>Dropping out of school is not a discrete event but the culmination of factors that might have begun early in a child’s school years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 1995</xref>). The finding on grade retention included students who reported grade retention in elementary school and was consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311427726">Alexander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311427726">Reschly &amp; Christenson, 2006</xref>); school personnel may have awareness of one potential indicator of dropout. The use of retention has increased since the 1970s, and youth who were ethnic minorities, youth who had learning and behavioral problems, or youth who came from low-income backgrounds have been disproportionately targeted for retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1044207311427726">National Association of School Psychologists, 2003</xref>). Practices such as response to intervention (RTI) and other early childhood interventions were promising for students at risk of repeating a grade and may keep the students on track to progress in their educations.</p>
<p>In addition, the finding that school suspensions are associated with increased odds of dropping out might suggest that school administrators need to examine evidence-based preventive measures such as Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports. In addition, school leaders may consider using evidence-based interventions to increase student engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207311427726">Christenson &amp; Anderson, 2002</xref>). As a variable that could be altered under the control of school personnel to a certain degree, emotional engagement may be fostered by implementing interventions to encourage students to stay bonded to school. These interventions may include additional tutoring or counseling, or creating more personable and positive environments with consistent, clear rules and consequences to facilitate interpersonal connections between students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1044207311427726">Murray &amp; Pianta, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding was consistent with previous studies that higher grades were better for the odds of staying in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311427726">Gwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311427726">Reschly &amp; Christenson, 2006</xref>). Achievement was one of the early warning indicators for dropout as identified by the National High School Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311427726">Heppin &amp; Therriault, 2008</xref>). The Early Warning System (EWS) includes other academic and attendance indicators for students in ninth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311427726">Heppin &amp; Therriault, 2008</xref>). The EWS is a promising tool to help school personnel identify students at risk of dropping out and provide interventions. Administrators could use the inclusion of indicators such as early-grade retention or school suspension to identify students for referral to intervention programs.</p>

<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Logistic regression exclusively was used to analyze correlates of dropout. Although this technique is useful to examine multiple factors simultaneously, it cannot be used to examine contextual factors simultaneously. Some researchers call for sophisticated approaches using (a) statistical cluster analysis to examine developmental trajectories over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311427726">Cairns, Cairns, &amp; Neckerman, 1989</xref>), (b) hierarchical linear modeling to examine external contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311427726">Rumberger, 1995</xref>), and (c) structural equation modeling to test theories and to identify causal pathways and mediating effects of variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207311427726">Battin-Pearson et al., 2000</xref>). Qualitative methods could be used to capture participants’ unique perceptions and experiences associated with their decisions to leave school early. Future research with these approaches may better address the dynamic interactions between contextual factors that have influence on students’ decisions for dropping out.</p>
<p>These findings confirm existing research that some factors predictive of dropout for youth without disabilities are true for youth with disabilities. Of particular concern were the higher odds of dropout shown for girls and youth with EBD. The finding that girls were more likely to dropout than boys was perplexing given the higher overall drop-out rates for boys. Possible bias from the suspension variable, which had a strong effect in and of itself, could have affected the drop-out odds toward girls and youth with an EBD. Future research is recommended to explore the contextual factors surrounding girls’ drop-out rates and the interactions between disciplinary exclusion and other factors. Finally, the findings were encouraging that higher than average grades for boys and girls, and higher levels of emotional engagement, particularly for boys, were factors in reducing the likelihood of dropping out. Future inquiry into the mediating effects of academic factors is recommended to gain insights on the intricacies of these effects and to provide additional evidence and support for drop-out prevention programs.</p>
<p>Existing knowledge on school drop-out predictors and youth with disabilities is expanded with the current findings. Although the predictors of the study are confirmation of previous findings in drop-out research, not all of the disparities in drop-out rates for youth with disabilities have been explained adequately. Areas in need of further study are highlighted; in particular, the relationships between disciplinary exclusion, grade retention, and dropping out warrant further study. Future research should be focused on these relationships and their interactions in context. Large-scale, longitudinal studies that include a representative sample of youth with disabilities may help researchers find relevant predictive factors for youth with disabilities and youth without disabilities to provide accurate data for drop-out prevention programs.</p>
