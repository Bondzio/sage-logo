<abstract>
<p>This article proposes a simple isotropic damage model within damage mechanics framework to represent the behavior of concrete in tension. Macroscopic evolution of tensile crack is considered as damage and is mathematically defined using an exponential function of tensile strain. A damage evolution law is formulated by applying strain equivalence principle to hyperbolic tension-softening curve. Value of damage variable is assumed theoretically to vary between ‘0’ and ‘1’ to denote uncracked and ruptured states, respectively. A smeared rotating crack model is coupled with damage formulation to simulate crack propagation effects in nonlinear finite element analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Many deficiencies of smeared crack model such as stress locking, mesh-induced directional bias, and instability in response computation for near-ultimate load are overcome using the coupled model. To verify the proposed model, nonlinear static response behavior of a RC beam is computed and compared with experimental and analytical results reported in literature. Effectiveness and applicability of the model to analyze practical structures are proved by analyzing a RC chimney. Nonlinear response of RC chimney is reviewed at global level while damage states of finite elements are studied at local level.</p>

<p>T<sc>he</sc> response behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) structures for mechanical loads is influenced by the development, growth, and coalescence of microcracks leading to the formation and propagation of macrocracks. A systematic approach to interrelate distributed defects and observed macroscopic behavior can be provided by continuum damage mechanics (CDM). It deals with the behavior of deformable material under the action of known forces and has been extensively used and proved for constitutive modeling of concrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056789511410457">Peerlings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789511410457">Geers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789511410457">Sumarac et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789511410457">Jirasek et al., 2004</xref>). Even though in real sense damage is anisotropic, models employ scalar damage variables mainly because of the simple formulation and ease in interpreting the computed damage values with observed physical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789511410457">Al-Rub and Voyiadjis, 2009</xref>). Besides these, scalar damage models offer advantage in numerical implementation and parameter identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789511410457">Burlion et al., 2000</xref>). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056789511410457">Voyiadjis et al. (2009)</xref> presented a formulation which is based on coupled elastic–plastic anisotropic damage model for concrete using the strain energy equivalence concept. The model includes separate criteria for the growth of damage in concrete to suit the different response under tensile and compressive loadings. In addition, the stress is decomposed into tensile and compressive components in order to satisfy these damage criteria. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056789511410457">Zhang et al. (2008)</xref> investigated damage-induced anisotropy in quasi-brittle materials using component assembling model. Damage model used within the CDM framework is capable of reproducing the softening response of the concrete and promising results had been obtained in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789511410457">Comi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789511410457">Jirasek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789511410457">Labadi and Hannachi, 2005</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789511410457">Sageresan et al. (2010)</xref> integrated the concepts of damage mechanics with meshless method of modeling to evolve an efficient approach for numerical analysis of fracture in concrete. The concepts of CDM have been used to study simple RC beams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789511410457">Sumarac et al., 2003</xref>) as well as indeterminate RC frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056789511410457">Rajasankar et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In constitutive modeling, physical interpretation of the damage variable depends on the microscopic mechanism that underlies the observed macroscopic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789511410457">Desimone et al., 2001</xref>). When concrete is under tension, exponential curves have been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789511410457">Jirasek et al. (2004)</xref> for damage evolution based on an equivalent strain concept. This model is capable of capturing the nonlinear response behavior but fails to give local element level details. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789511410457">Comi (2001)</xref> defined two separate damage variables, each for tension and compression, to describe stiffness degradation. This model consists of a failure criteria defined based on experimental results. The tension-softening models available in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789511410457">Bazant and Oh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789511410457">Kratzig and Polling, 2004</xref>) predict the stress in concrete after cracking but fail to give local state information of finite element which is used in the analysis. Certain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789511410457">Yamamoto and Vecchio, 2001</xref>) use damage parameter to represent the decay in stress–strain relation of concrete under tension, which is just a curve fitted with experimental results and not related to the internal state of the material.</p>
<p>To simulate the effect of crack propagation, damage mechanics concepts can be combined with rotating crack models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789511410457">Jirasek et al., 2004</xref>). These models combine the advantage of standard rotating crack and isotopic damage models. Incorporating damage in rotating crack model not only removes the spurious stress transfer across widely opened cracks but also prevents the model from losing material stability due to negative shear stiffness terms that may arise in the standard rotating crack model formulation. Using such model is advantageous over the other models which completely remove the element after the cracking when strain exceeds some critical value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056789511410457">Rots, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, a damage mechanics-based tension-softening model is proposed using a scalar damage variable. This model has been coupled with smeared rotating crack models to simulate the effect of crack propagation when the concrete is under tension. The damage variable varies between 0 and 1, which means uncracked and ruptured conditions, respectively, at local level. The damage evolution law is formulated using strain equivalence principle within CDM framework. The proposed model has been validated by analyzing a RC beam for its response behavior and by comparing the responses with that of experimentally measured values. Further, a RC chimney has been analyzed up to a drift of 1.75% using displacement-controlled nonlinear finite element analysis to show the practical applicability of present model. To the best of author’s knowledge, no research work has been reported till date on the nonlinear analysis of RC chimney either at local or at global levels. This study is capable of providing details on the behavior of each finite element at local level and predicts the response behavior of RC structures at global level.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1056789511410457"><title>DAMAGE MODEL</title>
<p>Damage mechanics principles can be used to quantitatively represent deterioration of concrete and its effect on the performance of the associated components to mechanical loads. This effectively enables reproduction of the softening response of a concrete/RC structure without necessarily paying attention to capturing permanent deformation. In the proposed model, this is realized by introducing a damage variable, <italic>d</italic>, whose value can vary between ‘0’ and ‘1’. These extreme values of the damage variable represent undamaged and ruptured conditions, respectively.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1056789511410457"><title>Damage Variable</title>
<p>Damage variable is treated internally in the formulation and hence no physical significance can be attached to it unlike the conventional response variables such as displacement and strains. Therefore, it is necessary to associate one of these conventional response variables with damage variable for its numerical definition. In general terms, state of a structure or its component can be known by comparing the value of a response variable against the corresponding permissible value. By virtue of establishing a relation between response and damage variables, and again due to its particular definition, damage variable can be used to know the state of a structure. Again by conventional terms, criticality in the state of a structure can be judged from the proximity of damage variable to ‘1’.</p>
<p>The response variable to be associated with damage variable is normally chosen according to the engineering properties of the material, and the expected mechanism of damage initiation and propagation in the material. In the proposed model, tensile strain in concrete is selected as companion for damage variable as it is ideal to represent cracking which is the dominant mode of damage initiation in RC structure. Besides, choosing the companion response variable, a matching relation is to be formulated between such response and the damage variable in order to have its continuous definition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1056789511410457"><title>Strain Equivalence Using CDM</title>
<p>Strain is identified as an independent variable and strain equivalence principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789511410457">Lemaitre, 1992</xref>) has been considered to develop the damage model. The post-peak behavior of concrete is controlled by the strain characteristics of concrete and hence used to derive the effective continuum material properties of a damaged concrete in terms of the undamaged concrete properties and a scalar damage variable. The scalar damage variable is then used to develop a consistent damage evolution equation. The advantage of using this combination is that local damage can be obtained using a strain energy equivalence principle and a consistent damage evolution equation yields a simple yet powerful local approach for continuum damage analysis at the structural level.</p>
<p>Hence, for undamaged state, strain is expressed as a function of stress as,
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1056789511410457"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511410457-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
whereas for damaged state, strain is modeled as a function of stress and damage variable (strain equivalence principle),
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1056789511410457"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511410457-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Value of <italic>d</italic> = 0 corresponds to the undamaged or uncracked state and value of <italic>d</italic> in between 0 and 1 corresponds to partially damaged state, whereas <italic>d</italic> = 1 corresponds to a fully damaged state (rupture).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1056789511410457"><title>Damage Criterion</title>
<p>In the present context of defining the behavior of concrete for tensile load, the macroscopic evolution of crack is considered as damage. A crack is assumed to be initiated when tensile stress in concrete exceeds its tensile strength (<italic>f</italic><sub>ct</sub>). In the tension region, concrete is considered as linear elastic until the tensile strength <italic>f</italic><sub>ct</sub> is reached, described by principal stress criterion of the Rankine type as

</p>
<p>From the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789511410457">Noh et al., 2003</xref>), a hyperbolic softening path as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789511410457">Figure 1</xref> is adopted to represent the behavior of concrete in tension after crack initiation. The stress in concrete after cracking is expressed as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-1056789511410457"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511410457-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>In the above expression, <italic>γ</italic><sub>t</sub> controls the area below the stress–strain curve, <italic>l</italic><sub>eq</sub> is the equivalent length, <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> initial modulus of elasticity of concrete in MPa, <italic>f</italic><sub>ct</sub> tensile strength of concrete in MPa, and <italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic> denotes the fracture energy. The strain <inline-formula id="ilm2-1056789511410457"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-1056789511410457"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ɛ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>icr</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789511410457">Figure 1</xref>) after which crack widens is estimated by expressions like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789511410457">Kratzig and Polling, 2004</xref>)
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-1056789511410457"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511410457-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>And the equivalent length is defined as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-1056789511410457"><label>(6)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511410457-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The expression given in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1056789511410457">4</xref>) is a classical approach of representing tension softening and is mesh dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789511410457">Noh et al., 2003</xref>). It further leads to size effect for obtaining stress–strain curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056789511410457">Petryna et al., 2002</xref>). This is due to the usage of expressions such as equivalent length in finite element analysis. In this study, an attempt is made to circumvent the need for mesh-dependent constitutive laws by making use of damage mechanics principles, and at the same time the hyperbolic path of tension softening is maintained. For this, crack widening has been modeled by imposing a dependency of damage variable on an independent variable strain by eliminating the usage of equivalent length (<italic>l</italic><sub>eq</sub>). The stress after cracking is introduced as effective stress using concepts of damage mechanics. Effective stress <inline-formula id="ilm3-1056789511410457"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-1056789511410457"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> after cracking is defined as

where <italic>d</italic> ranges from ‘0’ to ‘1’. From Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1056789511410457">7</xref>), it is clear that when <italic>d</italic> = 0, the strain in concrete reaches cracking strain and stress in concrete is equal to the tensile strength of concrete. Further, when <italic>d</italic> is greater than zero, the stress in concrete is less than the tensile strength due to the damage occurred to concrete. Hence instead of using Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1056789511410457">4</xref>), the expression given in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1056789511410457">7</xref>) is capable of representing the tension softening by proper definition of damage evolution equation. Also, the effective stress provides an essential mechanism by which the damage variable is coupled with constitutive models. Therefore, a proper definition of the damage variable is important. To find the growth of damage, it is necessary to arrive at a damage evolution law which is described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1056789511410457"><title>Damage Evolution</title>
<p>A constitutive model based on damage mechanics is formulated by incorporating a damage variable in stress–strain relation. Microscopic tensile cracking (damage) is modeled using the damage variable, <italic>d</italic>. Continuous deterioration of concrete due to tensile cracking, which reflects as reduction in structural stiffness, is represented by gradual increase in the value of the damage variable. Based on these, the stress in concrete under tension has been quantified in terms of damage variable and tensile strength of concrete. The main advantage of using damage mechanics approach is that stress in concrete after cracking is not dependent on the fracture energy or equivalent length unlike those described in classical approaches. Both Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1056789511410457">4</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1056789511410457">7</xref>) express the tensile stress in concrete. Therefore, by equating them and making use of Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1056789511410457">6</xref>) along with the simplification <inline-formula id="ilm4-1056789511410457"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math4-1056789511410457"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ct</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ɛ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>icr</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> based on the stress–strain curve of concrete given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789511410457">Figure 1</xref>, the damage variable is expressed as

<p>The proposed model has been implemented in finite element analysis program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789511410457">FINEART, 2006</xref>) to predict the damage growth due to cracking in a RC structure.</p>

Damage initiation is correlated with strain corresponding to the tensile strength of concrete. The strain range for the plot is decided based on the normal working range of strain in which tension-softening behavior is expected in concrete. This value can be approximated to <inline-formula id="ilm5-1056789511410457"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math5-1056789511410457"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ɛ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>icr</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi/><mml:mrow/></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789511410457">Figure 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec8-1056789511410457"><title>Rotating Crack Model</title>
<p>The crack model adopted in this article takes into consideration a possible change in crack direction during various stages of loading. This is done by postulating that the crack direction is perpendicular to major principal strain direction, which may vary due to increase in load level or change in load direction. This assumption results in consistent formulation throughout the behavior allowing for change in crack direction till yield state. In this model, concrete resists only the compression parallel to crack. Normal forces are resisted by reinforcement only and shear stress by reinforcement in orthogonal directions and compression in concrete. The above assumption, with compatibility of strains and equilibrium of forces, requires a unique crack direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1056789511410457">Figure 3</xref> shows the rotating crack model for a RC element under plane stress condition. It is to be noted that average crack direction is parallel to the direction of maximum concrete stiffness. This direction is found to be approximately perpendicular to the major principal strain direction. Thus, the average crack direction is considered to be the controlling parameter to decide on crack direction at any stage of loading. The effect of change in crack direction is incorporated in the analysis by modifying the material matrix [D<sup>0</sup>] and adding [G] matrix, which reflects the presence of crack along with its direction.

<p>The proposed damage mechanics-based tension-softening model is implemented in the nonlinear finite element analysis program module of FINEART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789511410457">FINEART, 2006</xref>) software. This program module can predict the response behavior through the entirely increasing monotonic load range. The program module employs four-noded layered shell element with five degrees of freedom (DOF) per node. The structure is idealized as the sub-assemblage of thin constant thickness shell elements with each element subdivided into number of layers. Each layer is assumed to be in plane stress condition, and can be in a state among uncracked, partially cracked, fully cracked, not-yielded, yielded, and crushed depending on the stress conditions. The reinforcing steel is modeled as smeared layer in the respective concrete layers. The thickness of smeared steel layer (<italic>t</italic><sub>s</sub>) is obtained by equivalent area approach from the reinforcement bar details. Stress–strain relationship of the reinforcing steel is described using elasto-perfectly plastic material model. Analysis is performed using displacement-controlled incremental-iterative tangent stiffness approach.</p>
<p>Two examples have been solved to demonstrate the performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The first example problem is so chosen such that comparison with other comparable models available in the literature is possible. Second problem is the analysis of a RC chimney using damage mechanics concepts proposed in this article, which gives an understanding of the applicability of the present model for practical applications.</p>

<p>Nonlinear finite element analysis has been carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1056789511410457">Figure 6</xref> and the response is compared with the experimental responses reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056789511410457">Oliveira et al. (2008)</xref>. It can be observed that the simulations using coarse and fine meshes predict almost identical results. Slight differences are observed near the peak load; however, the differences are within the margin of error expected for a numerical simulation. These results confirm the mesh objectivity of the proposed model.
<fig id="fig6-1056789511410457" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Load–deflection curve of doubly RC beam.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511410457-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As both the meshes predict identical results, detailed responses of coarse mesh alone are discussed further. This study predicts an ultimate load of 37 kN for a displacement of 7.4 mm. The beam is found to behave linearly up to a load value 6.5 kN. Maximum deformation in the elastic range was about 0.4 mm. It is observed that in all ranges of response behavior, the proposed model predicts results very close to the experimental values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056789511410457">Alvares, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789511410457">Figure 7(a)</xref> gives the information about the number of finite elements cracked at different displacement levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789511410457">Figure 7(b)</xref> depicts the cracking sequence and damage map of the beam. It is clearly shown that as the load increases, the formation of cracks and damage value also increase. Maximum cracking and damage occurred where the bending moment was maximum. The damage initiated at 22% of the ultimate load level and reached maximum value at 80% of the ultimate load. It remained constant till the ultimate load, revealing the fact that as the cracks became static, the load was redistributed from the damaged element to the neighboring element.

<p>Further, to show the evolution of damage in different elements, damage variables have been plotted with different load and displacement levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789511410457">Figure 8(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789511410457">b</xref>) shows the damage variables for different elements at various displacements and loads, respectively.

Further, cracking details of concrete are obtained at all displacement levels of every finite element, thereby capturing the local stress state of the structure accurately.

<p>Nonlinear analysis has been carried out and the computed load–drift curve is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1056789511410457">Figure 10</xref>.

<p>Since a damage variable was introduced, the present model is capable of predicting the detailed physical state of all elements of the chimney. Details on damage growth for some selected elements at particular drift levels along the height are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1056789511410457">Figure 12</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1056789511410457">Figure 12</xref>, it is observed that the finite elements at the bottom portion show higher value of damage compared to the elements at the top region. This is because the bending moment and shear force will be maximum at the base of the chimney and there is a higher possibility of cracking at this location. Further, the damage growth along the circumference is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1056789511410457">Figure 13</xref>. Along hoop direction also, damage values are higher at the base of RC chimney. Apart from the above studies, to understand the local state of elements more elaborately, the formation of cracks, yielding, and corresponding damage variable are represented schematically according to the sequence of the occurrence of damage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1056789511410457">Figure 14</xref>. The horizontal lines depict the cracking of concrete and the vertical lines the yielding of reinforcements. The damage variable gives a clear idea about the intensity of damage occurring at various displacements for different elements.

<p>The advantage of using the present model is that the elemental status is obtained in a detailed manner, which means the occurrence and propagation of cracking of concrete and yielding of steel can be traced. Further, the variation of damage variable gives the clear information about the sequence of occurrence of damage in terms of cracking. From the above results, it is noted that the maximum damage occurred in elements which experience high stresses or strains. When the damage variable reaches its maximum value, it remains constant till the ultimate load. The reason for this is that the additional load is re-distributed to the neighboring element.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1056789511410457"><title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS</title>
<p>An isotropic scalar damage model has been proposed to represent the behavior of concrete in tension. Damage evolution law has been formulated by making use of strain equivalence principle using damage mechanics framework. Damage variable takes a value between 0 (uncracked) and 1 (ruptured). A hyperbolic tension softening is assumed to represent the behavior of concrete in tension after cracking. Further, the scalar damage variable has been coupled with rotating crack model to represent the effect of crack propagation direction accurately in the nonlinear analysis. For this, variational approach of Young’s modulus has been made use of. The main advantage of the proposed model is that the local behavior of finite elements can be easily understood and interpreted. It gives an understanding about the physical behavior of the structure. The proposed model is validated by analyzing a doubly reinforced RC beam and comparing the response behavior with experimental as well as with other numerical models available in literature. To extend the application of present model to practical structures, a RC chimney has been analyzed for its response behavior and to find out the local damage state at various load levels. In both the example problems, it is observed that as the load increases the formation of cracks and damage value also increases. Also, it is noted that the maximum damage occurred in elements which experience high stresses or strains. When the damage variable reaches its maximum value, it remains constant till the ultimate load. The reason for this is that the additional load is re-distributed to the neighboring element. Hence the present model is capable of deriving conclusions of the physical behavior of the structure using damage mechanics framework and also capable of predicting the response behavior of RC structures.</p>
