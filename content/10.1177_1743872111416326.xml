<p>The trial of the core members of the terrorist group the Red Army Faction (RAF) provided the backdrop to what was the final crescendo of the most tumultuous period in West German history. The proceedings began in a courthouse adjoining the Stammheim prison in May 1975 with the verdict in Spring 1977 giving way to the “German Autumn,” a violent few months that climaxed with a kidnapping, a hijacking and the prison deaths of the RAF leaders. The defense strategy for the trial developed by the prisoners and their legal team was to frustrate the process and ignore the charges in favor of using the proceedings to present the RAF cause and RAF identity. They conceded what they termed the “legal terrain” inside the courthouse, and used the high-profile case as a platform to communicate an established discursive attack against the Federal Republic to an audience beyond the courtroom. This article outlines how this extralegal defense strategy of the RAF was grounded in an instrumentalization of international conventions on “political prisoners” and “prisoners of war” as hooks for its rhetoric of anti-fascism and anti-imperialism.</p>
<p>The RAF emerged from the radical periphery of the broad-based, West German student movement of the late 1960s. Provoked in particular by the 1966 formation of a ruling “grand” coalition between the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), protestors took to the streets to demand more open dialogue about West Germany’s National Socialist past, reforms to the authoritarian university system, the abandonment of proposed legislation that would allow for the suspension of certain civil rights in the case of an emergency, and an end to the Vietnam War. By the end of the decade, however, the student movement was winding down: a version of the “emergency laws” had been passed in 1968 despite the demonstrations, and the grand coalition had come to an end with the 1969 election. In the context of this waning protest scene, high-profile journalist Ulrike Meinhof helped liberate Andreas Baader from prison on May 14, 1970, before entering the underground. The Baader-Meinhof Group, as they were dubbed by the popular press, spent a short time in the deserts of Jordan receiving arms training before returning to West Germany where it took the name Red Army Faction and spent the next two years avoiding capture, robbing banks, and solidifying a theoretical position via a series of statements. The statements were written predominantly by Meinhof and developed along two broad themes framing the Federal Republic of Germany both as a continuation of the Third Reich and as part of the frontline, along with Vietnam, in the worldwide struggle against US imperialism.</p>
<p>In May 1972 the group planted a number of bombs targeting the US military presence in West Germany, the police, representatives of the judiciary, and the offices of the Springer publishing house. The bombing spree led to the arrests in June of the leaders: Baader, Meinhof, as well as Gudrun Ensslin, Jan-Carl Raspe and Holger Meins. The following incarceration of the prominent RAF members was an important period for the group with campaigns building up around prison conditions, hunger strikes, the 1974 death due to self-starvation of Meins, and the forced feeding of prisoners. These campaigns not only sustained a RAF media presence, they revitalized its cause by radicalizing a second generation of members who carried out further attacks such as the 1975 occupation of the West German embassy in Stockholm that claimed the lives of two terrorists as well as two civilians.</p>
<p>In April 1977 Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were sentenced to life in prison. Meinhof had committed suicide in her cell a year earlier, in May 1976. On September 5, 1977 second-generation RAF members kidnapped industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer and, as with the Stockholm siege, the ransom they demanded was the release of the high-profile Stammheim prisoners. Schleyer had been held hostage for 38 days when the stakes were raised by a group of Palestinians that hijacked a Lufthansa flight on October 13. The hijackers also demanded the release of prisoners, including Baader, Ensslin and Raspe. Neither set of demands was met. Instead, a specialist operations group from West Germany stormed the airplane and killed all the hijackers. The next morning, on October 18, Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were found dead in their cells, and upon hearing this news Schleyer’s captors killed their hostage, leaving his body in the boot of an abandoned car just over the French border.</p>
<p>Attacks carried out in the name of the RAF continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s until the group’s official dissolution in 1998. However, the violence reached its highpoint in the “German Autumn” of 1977. The years leading up to this violent finale were dominated by the Stammheim trial. The protracted proceedings gave the state the opportunity to enact due process before the West German people, but it also offered the RAF a new forum. Having created a vehicle for their message with the prison hunger strikes from 1973 to 1974, the trial took on a similar function from 1975 with the defense strategy effectively repackaging the cause for this new arena.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872111416326">2</xref></sup> Central to this strategy were the group’s lawyers.</p>
<p>The numerous lawyers who represented RAF members in the Stammheim trial, as well as the series of smaller trials involving group members leading up to it, were not a homogeneous group. They did exhibit a common commitment to their advocacy of the group, but this commitment rested on a range of underlying “causes.” “Cause lawyering” describes legal advocacy that “shifts cause and moral commitment from the margins to the core of legal practice,” and the RAF lawyers were in this sense cause lawyers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1743872111416326">3</xref></sup> At one extreme, the lawyers internalized completely the RAF’s rejection of the judiciary’s legitimacy as well as the group’s political cause, moving these to the center of their legal, and later illegal, activities. The most prominent example of this overlap between advocate and comrade was Horst Mahler, who was a founding member of both the Socialist Lawyer Collective, which would later defend many RAF members, and shortly after, the RAF itself. Other examples would follow with Eberhard Becker, Jörg Lang, and Siegfried Haag, who at various points represented RAF members, going on to join the ranks in the underground.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1743872111416326">4</xref></sup> At the other extreme of the spectrum were leftist lawyers who did not sympathize with RAF terrorism. They acted strictly within the legal boundaries of the role of the defense lawyer, but at the same time they brought the anti-authoritarianism and generational conflict of the student movement into the courtroom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1743872111416326">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The West German legal profession in the postwar decades was dominated by judges, professors and lawyers who had been active during the Third Reich.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1743872111416326">6</xref></sup> This older generation presided over a system that understood the role of the defense lawyer as forming a bridge between the judiciary and the accused. Administering justice was a cooperative process greased by reverence and compliance. Direct confrontations and attacks on judges were avoided and political motivations suppressed. Just as students were calling for reforms of the higher education institutions, a new generation of leftist lawyers confronted the traditions of the legal institutions. “We attacked the judiciary,” recalls former RAF lawyer Klaus Eschen, “and its members in their outdated organizations and mindsets with the manner and content of our appearances [before the court]. We felt […] the judiciary was only capable of being reformed if it were fundamentally questioned.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1743872111416326">7</xref></sup> They abandoned the idea of consensus and embodied instead the independence of the defense lawyer to advocate solely in the interests of his or her client.</p>
<p>While the RAF lawyers brought a new adversarial spirit to the court, the state, for its part, codified its own position in preparation for Stammheim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1743872111416326">8</xref></sup> In late 1974, the West German parliament passed “Lex RAF,” a series of amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (<italic>Strafprozessordnung</italic>, StPO) aimed at curtailing the activities of RAF’s defense lawyers. The new legislation formalized the ability to exclude a defense lawyer from the proceedings if he or she were “strongly suspected” of colluding with their clients or helping them communicate with the outside world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1743872111416326">9</xref></sup> The changes also saw lawyers prohibited from defending more than one defendant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1743872111416326">10</xref></sup> In combination with the new legal construct of the “criminal association” (<italic>kriminelle Vereinigung</italic>), it meant the RAF could not be defended collectively but could be tried collectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1743872111416326">11</xref></sup> As a result, many RAF lawyers felt that in Stammheim their attack on the judiciary and the judicial process was at once a defense of their own role and a defense of the proper administration of justice itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1743872111416326">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of content, leftist lawyers of the 1960s felt compelled to present the political motivations for their clients’ actions. This tactic was both a deliberate affront to the traditional suppression of the political nature of trials as well as part of the adversarial effort to maximize results for their client.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1743872111416326">13</xref></sup> The approach in Stammheim was therefore surprisingly homogeneous, despite the broad spectrum of causes at the core of the RAF’s defense. Whether motivated by an internalization of the terrorist group’s position, or a commitment to a new form of advocacy, the trial strategy revolved around courting confrontation and frustrating or sabotaging the legal process, as well as ignoring the specific charges and presenting instead RAF political identity.</p>
<p>When the trial began, all of the RAF prisoners refused to participate in the <italic>Vernehmung zur Person</italic>, a procedural step in which the accused are questioned on their biographies and are required to give their name, date of birth, place of birth, marital status, nationality, occupation and address. This refusal is representative of the RAF stonewalling of the process that swung between absolute silence and verbal provocation. Abusive tirades usually aimed at the judges were a conscious move to force the presiding judge to remove the prisoners in question from the courtroom, and it often led the prisoner’s exclusion from the proceedings for a period of days to weeks. A more serious concern for the state, however, was the tactic of the prisoners removing their own defense lawyers.</p>
<p>RAF prisoners demanded a loyalty that verged on complete obedience from their legal representatives. Switching lawyers can therefore be seen as an emotional reaction or an act of punishment. In many cases, however, it was also a very deliberate ploy to slow the legal process. Not only did the judges have to adjust, each new counsel required time to get up to speed with the proceedings to date. Federal prosecutors were wary of the maneuvering of legal counsel as a trial strategy as early as the beginning of 1974 and cited Meinhof’s and Ensslin’s already established pattern of behavior in particular as the basis for their concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1743872111416326">14</xref></sup> “Lex RAF” had already limited the number of lawyers a defendant could choose to three to prevent overly cumbersome defense teams slowing the proceedings,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1743872111416326">15</xref></sup> and prisoners were now assigned legal counsel (<italic>Pflichtverteidiger</italic>) or, as the RAF called them, “enforced lawyers” (<italic>Zwangsverteidiger</italic>), to ensure a degree of continuity.</p>
<p>Lawyers, too, sought to frustrate the proceedings with the first forty days of the trial dealing almost exclusively with repeated petitions calling for the recusal of one or all of the judges on grounds of bias, the reinstatement of excluded defense lawyers, and examination of the accused by doctors of their choice. The submissions had to be addressed one after the other, which slowed, even stalled completely, progress in the trial. The major stalemate of these first weeks were the applications to have the prisoners examined by their own doctors in the context of the effects of self-starvation. The numerous hunger strikes were not embarked on as an eventual trial strategy, but the accused recognized the potential advantage of exploiting their failing health and arguing that they were not fit to stand trial. The prosecution, too, feared that provisions for considering a prisoner’s fitness to stand trial could be abused by the RAF prisoners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1743872111416326">16</xref></sup> The impasse was eventually resolved when the court conceded the accused were not fit to stand trial, but argued, supported by amendments made as part of “Lex RAF,” that the trial could continue in their absence as the prisoners had contributed to their condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1743872111416326">17</xref></sup> After this ruling, the defendants and their defense team no longer clashed as vigorously with the prosecution and the court over procedural technicalities and issues of legitimacy, and they had long since decided to ignore the charges brought against the RAF members inside the courtroom. The focus instead was presenting the RAF narrative via the trial to an audience beyond the courtroom.</p>
<p>RAF lawyer Gerd Temming outlined in 1975 how beyond the broader defense strategies of challenging the authority of the court, no discussion should be entered into regarding the specific charges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1743872111416326">18</xref></sup> The RAF prisoners, too, considered such “legal stuff” to be “unimportant,” and increasingly the key question being discussed by the RAF leaders was not how to counter prosecution evidence or arguments, but “who will use the publicity that stammheim has for their own ends: them or us.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1743872111416326">19</xref></sup> This strategy recognized an audience beyond the courtroom and the extralegal function of political trials to present a narrative. Despite Hannah Arendt’s argument regarding the Eichmann trial that its sole purpose should be to “render justice” and nothing more, a clear hope for, and expectation of, a didactic function accompanied the proceedings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1743872111416326">20</xref></sup> In the trial of Klaus Barbie, too, the French government promised a “pedagogic trial,” and sought to use the proceedings to present France in distinction to Nazism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1743872111416326">21</xref></sup> Jacques Vergès, Barbie’s lawyer, countered by using the defense of a Nazi war criminal as an opportunity to define French colonialism to be the same as Nazism, and the deeds of the French army in Algeria as crimes against humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1743872111416326">22</xref></sup> This “theater” of political trials, and the desire to shape the show, cannot be separated from the narrow execution of legal procedure, and the trial of the RAF was no exception. Stammheim was a chance for both sides to present competing narratives, to stage opposing identities. The prosecution narrative was one of a democratic state performing due process in the prosecution of common criminals. The RAF, conversely, presented Stammheim as a political trial, and identified itself as part of a broad international conflict. Central to this extralegal narrative were the constructions of the “political prisoner” and the “prisoner of war” respectively, which both rested on interpretations of international legal conventions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1743872111416326">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a television appearance to coincide with the beginning of the trial, Judge Prinzing declared the proceedings in Stammheim were not a political trial, but a “normal criminal case” (<italic>normaler Straffall</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1743872111416326">24</xref></sup> For the prisoners, however, the trial was undoubtedly political. In a statement supporting her latest recusal motion from July 1975, Meinhof triumphantly described the Stammheim trial as “the first political trial in the Federal Republic since 1945.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1743872111416326">25</xref></sup> Moreover, prison correspondence reveals that she considered it to be the most important political trial that would set the scene for all political trials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1743872111416326">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond their own conviction that Stammheim was a political trial, the RAF prisoners believed the idea of a “normal trial” (<italic>normales Strafverfahren</italic>) to be part of a cynical collection of tactics designed to eliminate a political defense, thereby robbing the proceedings, and by extension the deeds of the RAF, of the legitimacy the group sought to impose on them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1743872111416326">27</xref></sup> This interpretation was based on the official and constant emphasis on the purely criminal nature of the case, such as Prinzing’s comments before the trial as well as statements such as those of Defense Minister Hans-Jochen Vogel, who in July 1976 reiterated that the “proceedings [were] directed exclusively at the criminal activities and not their supposed political motivation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1743872111416326">28</xref></sup> Such sentiments very much informed the RAF defense:<disp-quote>
<p>defense becomes political opposition against the politics of the federal prosecutor, the domestic strategy of the new fascism: counterinsurgency, or it is part of the project of the federal prosecution – by contributing to their deception – their deception in the form of the feigned “normal trial.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1743872111416326">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The strategy to counter this was clear:<disp-quote>
<p>the point here is to destroy the “normal trial.” […] destruction of the normal trial is precisely not sabotage of the trial but exposure of the truth of these proceedings against us and with it the truth about the social democracy and with that the truth about the west german state as a function of us [US] imperialism, a function of the main enemy of the peoples of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1743872111416326">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To expose these truths, the group needed to reinforce the notion that this was a political, not a criminal trial. This included monitoring not only their own lawyers to ensure they did not fall into the trap of “playing the role of the ‘normal trial’,” but also the strategic use of the term “political prisoner.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1743872111416326">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The RAF members clearly understood themselves to be political prisoners in the sense that theirs was a political organization and they were in prison. The term “political prisoner,” however, was less straightforward. In the lead up to the trial the term and its merits were fiercely contested within the RAF and among the group’s sympathizers. A document found during a search of Meinhof’s cell in July 1973, outlined the position of the prisoner advocacy group Red Aid (<italic>Rote Hilfe</italic>) on the meaning and use of the term “political prisoner”:<disp-quote>
<p>In normal usage the term “pp” [political prisoner] covers two groups: 1.) from the pigs’ perspective, every offender who has transgressed §§ 80–109k of the criminal code (treason, law of association etc.) and §§ 125–131 (breach of the public peace […]) 2.) in liberal/traditionally leftist usage, every prisoner who is locked up for political reasons, that is, (is said to have) committed a crime due to political motivations. […] Under the guidance of RA [Red Aid] the term has been widened to include 3.) every prisonologist that understands prison as a ruling-class political tool of oppression and finally 4.) indeed all prisonologists who resist it, even if they’re still politically “unconscious.” […] As a result, this had led to everyone understands the term “pp” to mean something different, and even RA generally uses the term in the sense of 2.) (despite assertions to the contrary).</p>
<p>Such a hazy term is not usable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1743872111416326">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Volker Speitel, a later RAF member whose first contact with the radical leftist scene was via the Red Aid organization in 1972, has also described definition of “political prisoner” as a central sticking point for the diverse groups that supported the RAF members in prison. Some thought all prisoners were political prisoners, others only wanted to support the RAF prisoners, “and others still, voted for the support of the revolutionary working class, whatever that meant.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1743872111416326">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was part of a wider debate at the time about the usability of the term. A further document confiscated during the same search of Meinhof’s cell describes the discussion at a meeting of RAF lawyers and representatives of committees formed by supporters,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1743872111416326">34</xref></sup> and a number of non-militant left-wing organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1743872111416326">35</xref></sup> The discussion took place in the context of a protest in February 1973 where RAF lawyers and other groups staged a four-day hunger strike in solidarity with the striking prisoners outside the highest appellate court in West Germany. The protesters disagreed about the relationship of the protest to the hunger strike campaign, and a heated debate over the meaning of “political prisoner” ensued. A summary of the meeting on 5 and 6 May 1973 is evidence of the confusion:<disp-quote>
<p>All lawyers, with the exception of two, are for the slogan “political prisoners.” Also for the concept pp [political prisoner] are the IZRU [Information Centre of the Red People’s University] and the KSV [Communist Student Union], although they both understand the term to mean different things.</p>
<p>The Red Aids and former prisoners (Schiller, Herzog, Mauer) think this term is divisive and not of any use in prison.</p>
<p>In contrast, the lawyers argue along the same lines as the prominent RAF prisoners. Although doubts have emerged as to whether the lawyers are correctly communicating the opinions of the prisoners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1743872111416326">36</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The differences centered around two distinctions: some did not want any discrimination between RAF and other prisoners and justified the term by arguing all prisoners were political prisoners, not just those whose motivations for the crime were ostensibly “political,” while others used the term in the sense of their “avant-garde and cadre theory.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1743872111416326">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The broader setting for the debate were the RAF hunger strikes, which aimed to mobilize entire prison populations. Categorizing some prisoners as “political” was divisive and made it more difficult for non-RAF prisoners to identify with the strikes. Meinhof’s sister reported to the meeting mentioned above that Meinhof for one saw this as a problem. The strikes had by that time not developed a prison-wide following or inspired solidarity among prisoners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1743872111416326">38</xref></sup> The potentially problematic nature of the term within the penal system meant a compromise was necessary for internal purposes such as the hunger strike declarations. In a draft hunger strike declaration from June 1974 Meinhof adopts a very broad definition:<disp-quote>
<p>a political prisoner is any prisoner who recognizes his position, who has recognized himself as the prisoner of the ruling class – of money, who offers resistance against the incarceration of extermination of the isolated prisoners and cretinizing treatment of all prisoners, and is therefore in solitary confinement or threatened with solitary confinement at any moment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1743872111416326">39</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This compromise was reflected in a committee publication from October 1974:<disp-quote>
<p>To be a political prisoner means to stand opposed to the political class justice: the <italic>Staatsschutz</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1743872111416326">40</xref></sup> To be a political prisoner in the FRG is to be a prisoner of the state that incriminates revolutionaries in the interests of the enemies of the people, the enemies of the RAF (Red Army Faction) […]</p>
<p>Also political prisoners are those who as prisoners comprehend that the prison system’s disciplinary instrument, institution of the permanent fascism against the sections of the people, is for the maintenance of the capitalist regime and behaves accordingly; those who have overcome the divisive, private attitude “keep your mouth shut – and nothing will happen to you – then you’ll make it” as an expression of misery, oppression, unconsciousness and lean on other prisoners.</p>
<p>In the end, to be a political prisoner in the FRG means to be subject to a creeping execution, bloodless and externally untraceable torture by social isolation/sensory deprivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1743872111416326">41</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Inherent in these compromise positions is the attempt to allow the existing prison population access to a RAF definition of political prisoner status. Separate from such internal use, however, a different more exclusive sense of “pp” featured prominently in the RAF’s attempted co-option of international legal conventions as part of its defense.</p>
<p>In 1973 RAF lawyers made an application on behalf of Meinhof, Baader, Meins and Wolfgang Grundmann to the European Commission of Human Rights. The complaint gathered around prison conditions and isolation suffered by “political prisoners,” the exclusion of defense counsel as well as the assertion that through these conditions the “authorities thus [had] created a status of political prisoners whose rights are reduced in comparison to other prisoners.” Similar allegations had already been rejected by Federal Court and the Constitutional Court in West Germany, now the European Commission was to rule on whether these decisions violated articles 3, 6, 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1743872111416326">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The application was eventually declared inadmissible to the European Court of Human Rights and “[w]ith regard to the applicants’ allegation that as ‘political prisoners’ they are being subjected to torture by isolation,” the Commission found that the applicants were “not in custody because of their political convictions but because they are suspected of offences dangerous to the community. For this reason they cannot be regarded as ‘political prisoners’.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1743872111416326">43</xref></sup> For the RAF this was not an unexpected decision, but nor was it swift. The human rights complaints had been drafted despite a clear recognition that the Commission on Human Rights would no doubt uphold West German penal practice. The application would nevertheless provide fertile discursive ground for the RAF campaign, as the Commission would take years to uphold the conditions. In the meantime “human rights,” as RAF lawyer Groenewold argued, would be “our field of operation” (<italic>unser Operationsfeld</italic>) as opposed to the legal “terrain” of the prosecution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1743872111416326">44</xref></sup> In fact, the delay in reaching a decision was due largely to the RAF defense team.</p>
<p>After the Federal government requested one extension on the date it was given to comment on the application, the applicants were invited to submit their observations by December 10, 1974. This deadline passed before a further extension was requested and granted, before a second extension was requested and granted on January 23, three days after the new deadline. When nothing had been sent to the Commission by February 28, 1975, the case proceeded without the observations of the applicants and a ruling was given on May 30, 1975.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1743872111416326">45</xref></sup> By not making any submissions the lawyers ensured information provided by the West German government would provide the sole basis for any decision, essentially denying the application any chance of success. Perhaps more importantly, however, it dragged out the period of time that a RAF human rights complaint was before the Commission and that a decision on West German “political prisoners” was pending.</p>
<p>Despite being contentious among the prisoners, their lawyers, the committees and other sympathetic groups responsible for maintaining a media presence for the RAF, the term “political prisoner” became important to the discursive construction of the Stammheim trial as a political event. In internal prison communication the group insisted “[legal] petitions are only a vehicle and a lever, nothing more,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1743872111416326">46</xref></sup> and the applications to the European Commission of Human Rights was one such lever employed with the clear goal of countering the idea of the proceedings as a “normal trial.” Another discursive lever was the use of the Geneva Conventions to frame the RAF members as “prisoners of war” and establish an international context for their actions and their arguments.</p>
<p>On May 4, 1976 RAF lawyers moved to call General Michael S. Davison, the Commander of the US Army in Europe, to testify that RAF bombing of a US Army base in Heidelberg had a discernible effect on military operations in Indochina by destroying computers that were used to coordinate the movement of troops and air raids. They also called Richard Nixon to attest to the numerous attacks on US facilities on US and foreign soil contributing in a material way to the US decision to retreat from Indochina and cease operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1743872111416326">47</xref></sup> These were two of a number of high profile figures, including former West German Chancellors Ludwig Erhard, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Willi Brandt and former President of the Federal Republic Gustav Heinemann, that the defense sought to have called before the court in an attempt to frame the RAF bombing spree as part of an international conflict with its epicenter in Vietnam. They presented a justification for the May bombing spree as “self-defense” and launched a project for international recognition that rested on the securing of the status of prisoner of war (POW) for the RAF prisoners.</p>
<p>The use of the term POW was intended to boost the flagging interest in the group’s struggle. In attempts to revitalize the prison campaign while maintaining the primacy of the armed struggle, the prisoners rejected the tired slogans of the committees as too wishy-washy (<italic>seicht</italic>) and standard cries to “build up the red army” as purely “verbal.” The compromise was a slogan tailored to further enshrine the RAF prisoners as the focus of the struggle and fill the need for a rhetoric appropriate for the courtroom: “prisoners of war” was settled on as the central pillar in a project for “international recognition of the RAF.” Speitel described the term POW as not only a catch-cry, with which to thematize the prison conditions but one capable of expressing the content of the armed struggle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1743872111416326">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term POW needs to be understood in the context of RAF calls to be treated as “normal prisoners” (<italic>normalgefangene</italic>). It must first be noted that the discourse of the POW is not necessarily inconsistent with explicit requests made by RAF members within the penal system to be treated as “normal prisoners”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1743872111416326">49</xref></sup> as the two served different functions. Much like the controversy surrounding the term “political prisoner,” the campaign for normal treatment was geared towards securing solidarity with non-RAF prisoners and can easily be reconciled with the push for external POW-status, as the goals and forums remain distinct and separate. The term must also be understood within the context of contemporaneous negotiations on its legal definition.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 1960s and in the light of the changing nature of armed conflict since the end of World War II, there was an increasing international push to reform the four traditional criteria defining a “privileged combatant”: operating under military command; wearing a fixed distinctive sign (or uniforms for regulars); carrying arms openly; conducting military operations consistently with the laws and customs of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1743872111416326">50</xref></sup> It was felt there was a growing discrepancy between the legalities and reality of war and that these criteria imposed impossible obligations on “irregulars” in conflicts in which guerilla tactics were used.</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) prompted negotiations in 1965 when it raised its concerns about the protection of civilian populations and the risk of indiscriminate warfare. At its 1968 Tehran meeting, the International Conference on Human Rights adopted a resolution requesting the General Assembly of the United Nations invite the Secretary-General to investigate the measures necessary to ensure better application of the existing humanitarian law. The General Assembly in turn invited the Secretary-General to undertake a study in consultation with the ICRC, which resulted in reports handed down in 1969, 1970 and 1971. These reports pointed to particular inadequacies in the existing law of armed conflict and prompted the ICRC to convene the first Conference of Government Experts on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts in May and June 1971. A second conference in May and June 1972 and at which the need for reduced criteria for “irregulars” was broadly acknowledged, revised the draft protocols produced at the first. The draft ICRC protocols were in turn considered at the Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts (Diplomatic Conference), which met once a year, for four years beginning in 1974.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1743872111416326">51</xref></sup> Important for the discussion here are, in particular, amendments made to articles 1, 43 and 44.</p>
<p>Article 1 outlines the general principles and scope of application of the conventions. The ICRC commentary of 1973 acknowledged the argument for amendments to the 1949 protocols to cover “armed struggles waged by peoples for the exercise of their right to self-determination,” that is, national liberation movements. At the 1974 Diplomatic Conference the ICRC draft was amended to make the law governing international conflicts apply also to conflicts of “self-determination,” a wording that was adopted as Article 1(4) in 1977:<disp-quote>
<p>The situations referred to in the preceding paragraph include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their rights of self-determination as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1743872111416326">52</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This article was designed to encompass national wars of liberation; the term “right to self-determination” used because it was an accepted legal concept of the United Nations Charter. The accepted interpretation of CAR (Colonial, Alien and Racist) regimes was narrow to avoid encouraging secessionist movements while still recognizing national liberation movements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1743872111416326">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Article 43 sets out the legal definition of the parties to a conflict. The ICRC draft of 1972 reads that “armed forces shall be organized and subject to an internal discipline system, which should enforce respect for the applicable rules of international law.” In a 1973 draft “armed forces” was expanded to include “the armed forces of resistance movements.” This definition was further widened at the 1976 conference (and later adopted in 1977) to read:<disp-quote>
<p>The armed forces of a Party to the conflict consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that Party for the conduct of its subordinates, even if that Party is represented by government or an authority not recognized by an adverse Party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1743872111416326">54</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is representative of the desire to include guerillas, but is not completely novel as article 4A(3) provides privileged status to regulars represented by an unrecognized government or authority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1743872111416326">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Article 44 addresses the definition of POWs. As early as the 1971 conference a number of experts argued that two of the traditional criteria – the fixed distinctive sign and the open carrying of arms – were inconsistent with the requirements of guerilla warfare. A subsequent 1972 ICRC draft article stipulated that “organized resistance or independence movements” were entitled to POW status when captured, even if represented by an unrecognized government or authority. This protection was, however, on the conditions they comply with the law, distinguish themselves from civilian population by carrying arms openly or by wearing a fixed distinctive sign, and are organized under a responsible commander. These conditions were retained in the 1973 draft “New category of prisoners of war” with one amendment, which clarified “compliance with the law” as the conducting of “military operations in accordance with the Conventions [of 1949] and the present Protocol.” The adopted article proceeds on the assumption that contemporary nature of warfare dictated that an armed combatant cannot always distinguish himself, but he is still entitled to POW status if he carries his arms during military engagement and “during the time he is visible to the adversary while he is engaged in a military deployment preceding the launching of an attack in which he is to participate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1743872111416326">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>The RAF defense sought to pick up on these contemporaneous developments to create an international context for the group’s activities. The two-part strategy consisted of presenting the “international context of oppression” and countering it with the “international context of the guerilla movement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1743872111416326">57</xref></sup> Piggy-backing international law was central to the latter and the RAF prisoners made this clear to their defense team: “we demand only, that you defend the prisoners from the urban guerilla within the political LINE of defense, that is with a human rights’ perspective in an international context.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1743872111416326">58</xref></sup> Meinhof in particular advocated this line of defense and was seemingly convinced that the legal negotiations occupying the UN General Assembly were prompted in part by the RAF:<disp-quote>
<p>in addition – prisoners of war:</p>
<p>you simply have to transpose what the un [UN] has long since done, these definitions (partisans etc.) onto the specifics of this trial.</p>
<p>and we would <italic>remind</italic> assholes like pfaff that the development of these un [UN] initiatives was thanks in large part to us – at least in terms of western europe, the un [UN] definition includes us too in this term of this term “international [illegible],” not defined as self-interest or psychological, but as “committed to a cause.” this is definitive.</p>
<p>this is expressed in the Moynihan amendments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1743872111416326">59</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The negotiating history suggests the General Assembly instead had liberation groups in colonized African nations in mind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1743872111416326">60</xref></sup> This intention was evident at the 1974 Diplomatic Conference where “genuine” movements, that is, those recognized by their regional intergovernmental organizations were invited to participate. The RAF was not among them, nor was any other European group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1743872111416326">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the argument underpinned the RAF approach of ignoring the specific charges and arguing instead for an international context. The POW argument was also made explicitly in the courtroom. In a motion to hear evidence (<italic>Beweisantrag</italic>), RAF lawyer Axel Azzola – who also drew up RAF submissions to the European Commission of Human Rights<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1743872111416326">62</xref></sup> – argued that the trial should be abandoned and that, even if the accusations against them were found to be true, the accused should be found non-guilty and taken into captivity as prisoners of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1743872111416326">63</xref></sup> The prisoners, he argued, found themselves at war with the imperialist forces of capital within the Federal Republic and in alliance with other liberation movements such as the Front National de Liberté (FNL) in Vietnam, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). This framed the RAF as being at war with “the imperialism of international capital and its agents”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1743872111416326">64</xref></sup> and presented the argument that this form of warfare should fall under the Geneva Conventions despite there being no provision for it. International law had, it was argued, lagged behind developments in modern warfare and legal categories needed to be adapted to this new form of warfare:<disp-quote>
<p>A viable definition of what we understand war to be in terms of international law must accommodate this new mode of warfare. It can no longer depend on the customary, formal criterion that the parties to a conflict must be nation states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1743872111416326">65</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The new form were national wars of liberation fought across borders and in an international context: “national” in the sense that the goal of oppressed peoples was the founding of independent nation states, and “international,” because they attack the “imperialist world-system.” Azzola named a number of examples including the treatment and status of IRA prisoners.</p>
<p>Despite including the legal negotiations surrounding POW in the defense this was less a legal, and more a communicative, discursive strategy that played not to the judges but to the wider public beyond the courtroom. In a letter to her lawyer in December 1975, Meinhof wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>international publicity is only attainable through the trial and the defense – the point is not to appeal to committees from which we can only expect to be knocked back – the point is to develop a political initiative in the trial and out of the confrontations during the trial. […] there is a project: prisoner of war status […] the tactic in the trial can only be: resistance. […] and that makes sense in stammheim and only in stammheim, because the publicity is here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1743872111416326">66</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was also explicitly conceded that prisoner of war status per se was not the immediate goal; rather it was primarily a means to an end:<disp-quote>
<p>and struggle for prisoner of war status. of course, we couldn’t care less about the status. It is the operator for mobilizing international publicity for our struggle against the incarceration of extermination.</p>
<p>and indeed for the recognition under international law of socially revolutionary movements as parties to a conflict</p>
<p>it is the only possibility for conducting our defense on the level of the judiciary: international law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1743872111416326">67</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even Meinhof’s death was used to promote the argument that the RAF prisoners were prisoners of war.</p>
<p>The minutes of a meeting between lawyers after the press conference regarding her death on May 9, 1976 mention a further press conference scheduled for May 12 in Paris concerning the demand to treat the RAF prisoners as POWs under the Geneva Conventions. The demand was to be made alongside the simple assertion that the “FRG cannot be allowed to murder any more prisoners in its prisons.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1743872111416326">68</xref></sup> Later that month, lawyers Croissant and Keller discussed in communications with prisoners a complimentary publication. They planned to produce a text with the working title “guerilla and prisoner of war status” that was to include: a foreword; a declaration; a number of submissions to halt proceedings; and a weighty documentation section. The “whole thing,” the letter continued,<disp-quote>
<p>should be released by a publisher or a cooperative of different publishers.</p>
<p>texts should be placed between the individual documents that make it clear that the application of the geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war is necessary to prevent the extermination of the prisoners under the cloak of the “normal criminal case.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1743872111416326">69</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this plan the discursive strategies came together. Just as the term “political prisoner” created discursive ground, in which the defense could operate, the “project prisoner of war status,” too, was used to carry the RAF’s established anti-imperialism and anti-Americanism via the trial. The instrumentalization of international law did not introduce new themes into the trial, instead the construction of the RAF prisoners as POWs repackaged well-known lines of argument in a manner appropriate for the forum. The affinity with liberation groups and revolutionary struggles in the third world established in RAF texts was expressed in Stammheim via the campaign for POW-status. The legal status itself was not the point; the aim was to communicate the analogy to a broader, hopefully international public.</p>
<p>The stakes were high during the Stammheim trial from 1975–1977, both in terms of the outcome of the legal proceedings and in terms of which side could communicate their extralegal narrative more effectively. The RAF defense conceded the ground in front of the judges, but used international conventions as a vehicle for the their longstanding rhetoric before an audience beyond the courtroom. Most importantly, they and their defense team employed a discourse of human rights, applications to the European Commission of Human Rights and the term “political prisoners” to underpin the framing of the trial as a political lynching. Similarly, they used the Geneva Convention and the term POW to mount the case that the RAF was part of a worldwide movement. In neither case was the recourse to international law intended to deliver a victory in the courtroom, it was designed instead to fit the group’s message into this new forum and transform the judicial process into a mouthpiece for their own message.</p>

<p>The critique of the judiciary in West Germany had a predecessor in the Communist Party lawyers of the 1950s who had to face being shut out of trials and the suppression of political motivations in court. The leftist lawyers of the 1960s, however, coupled this established critique with a new and confrontational anti-authoritarianism, see Reinecke, “Die linken Anwälte,” p. 949.</p>

Despite precedents for the practice of excluding defense lawyers, the Federal Constitutional Court (<italic>Bundesverfassungsgericht</italic>) ruled on February 14, 1973, that it had no legal basis.

<p>Active attempts to manage the reception of the trial were not limited to the RAF.

This nation-wide search for twenty-three suspects in November 1974, which drew a lot of attention but resulted in no charges, was seen by Head of the Federal Criminal Police as an end unto itself: while such operations were almost never great successes, but they made a measurable and positive impression on the population (Ditfurth, <italic>Ulrike Meinhof</italic>, pp. 397–8). Similarly, a bundle of documents found in RAF cells and safe-houses was released to coincide with the operation, and they proved highly influential in terms of reporting on radio, television and in the print press both domestically and abroad (Bakker Schut, <italic>Stammheim</italic>, pp. 124–5). Judges also drew accusations during the trial that attempts were made to steer its reception after Judge Eberhard Foth wrote to the <italic>Stuttgarter Zeitung</italic> condemning the newspaper’s reporting of the trial and Judge Prinzing reportedly regularly telephoned the <italic>Südwestfunk</italic> radio (Brunn and Kirn, 314–15; Hanno Balz, “Gesellschaftsformierungen. Die öffentliche Debatte über die RAF in den 70er Jahren,” in Nicole Colin, Beatrice De Graaf, Jacco Pekelder, and Joachim Umlauf, eds, <italic>Der “Deutsche Herbst” und die RAF in Politik, Medien und Kunst. Nationale und internationale Perspektiven</italic> (Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2008), p. 175). A petition from August 1975 against all sitting judges also argued the influence went the other way as well, with Prinzing repeatedly referring to the reception of the trial in the courtroom as well as in judgments (Bakker Schut, <italic>Stammheim</italic>, p. 238). Journalist Ulf Stuberger also writes of a “secret meeting” between the Director of Public Prosecutions (<italic>Anklagebehörde</italic>) and editors of the major media outlets at which, according to Stuberger’s sources, Attorney General Buback expressed his “particular desire” for reporting on the RAF to refer to the Baader-Meinhof Gang (<italic>Bande</italic>) instead of the Baader-Meinhof Group (<italic>Gruppe</italic>) (Ulf G. Stuberger, <italic>Die Tage von Stammheim. Als Augenzeuge beim RAF-Prozeß</italic> (Munich: Herbig, 2007), pp. 43–4).</p>

<p>As cited in Aust, <italic>Der Baader Meinhof Komplex</italic> (Munich: Wilhelm Goldmann, 1998), p. 361. Balz argues numerous factors undermine the notion that the authorities considered this a “normal criminal trial,” such as: the fact that politicians openly speculated on the verdict before the trial concluded; the attention paid to prisoners, which manifested in tailored prison conditions and the building of the Stammheim courthouse, see Balz, “Gesellschaftsformierungen,” p. 174.</p>

<p>“Im normalen Sprachgebrauch umfaßt der Begriff des ‘pG’ [politischen Gefangenen] zwei Gruppen: 1.) von den pigs aus jeden Straftäter gegen die §§ 80-109 k StGB (Landesverrat, Vereins-/Parteiverbot etc.) und §§ 125-131 (Landfriedensbruch […]) 2.) im liberalen/herkömmlich linken Sprachgebrauch, jeden Gefangenen, der aus politischen Gründen eingelocht worden ist, d.h. aus politischer Motivation heraus ein Delikt begangen hat (haben soll). […] Unter Führung der RH ist versucht worden, diesen Begriff zu erweitern auf 3.) jeden Knastologen, der den Knast als politisches Unterdrückungsmittel der herrschenden Klasse begreift und schließlich 4.) auf jeden Knastologen überhaupt, der dagegen Widerstand leistet, auch wenn er noch politisch ‘unbewußt’ ist. […] Im Ergebnis hat das alles jedoch dazu geführt, daß jeder unter dem Begriff ‘pG’ etwas anderes versteht, und auch die RH in der Regel den Begriff im Sinne 2.) benutzt (trotz gegenteiliger Beteuerungen) / Ein derart schillernder Begriff ist daher unbrauchbar,” see BA, H B362, F 3370: XIII/16: “Einige individuelle GEDANKENSPLITTER.” The term “prisonologist” (<italic>knastologe</italic>) is used to lend an air of professionalism to someone who has been in and out of prison.</p>
