<p>Do you know where the term <italic>RF</italic> (<italic>radiofrequency</italic>) comes from? What is the difference between “cut” and “coag” setting on you electrosurgical unit? Or did you know that “cut” is actually a more efficient mode for sealing blood vessels that “coag,” or that the grounding pad is actually not a link between your patient and the ground?</p>
<p>There probably isn’t a single case done today without some form of electrosurgical device. We study and practice for years to perform procedures safely and effectively, yet our knowledge of the energy sources we routinely use is poor: at the last SAGES meeting, the authors of this manual presented the results of a small study. They identified 49 SAGES leaders who were submitted a questionnaire of 11 critical knowledge questions on this topic. The median number of correct answers was only 6.5 (or 59%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350613483927">1</xref></sup> This manual provides an efficient solution to this knowledge gap.</p>
<p>The <italic>Manual</italic> has 13 fundamental chapters and 9 hands-on chapters. The fundamental chapters include an interesting and very well illustrated historical perspective followed by 2 very detailed chapters on the general principles of electrosurgery. These describe in detail the physics behind the generation of the different energy sources and the expected effects on tissue, as well as the underlying mechanisms of potential adverse effects of electrosurgical energy. In the following chapters, every modality of surgical energy available is described and specific situations reviewed such as use in children, during pregnancy, or in patients with pacemakers. The last 9 chapters describe practical (sometimes very creative) hands-on sessions.</p>
<p>The thoroughness and detail of this book, while commendable, might also be its weakness: it sometimes falls a little short on answering some practical questions. The emphasis is on the fundamental aspects with some repetitiveness across chapters. However, the authors have deliberately avoided discussing individual proprietary devices. In the crowded and competitive field of electrosurgical devices this neutrality is necessary, but it reduces the possibility for the authors of being more specific and practical.</p>
<p>This book will not only allow us to better use and understand electrosurgical instruments but is also a unique source of either useful or important knowledge: what to do in case of a fire in the operating room? How to set up a practical workshop with hands-on demos for residents and trainees? And many more.</p>
<p>So unless you are an expert in this field, you will want to read this book: the only other way of accessing such detailed and similar information on electrosurgical energy sources in during one of the FUSE courses. This makes the <italic>Manual</italic> a must read not only for any intern or resident going to take the FLS examination but also for any surgeon who wants to understand what lies behind the “coag” button.</p>
