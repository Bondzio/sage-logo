<p>“To accept one’s past—one’s history—is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it.” This quote from James Baldwin, as cited in Meira Levinson’s recently published, <italic>No Citizen Left Behind</italic>, aptly summarizes the book’s central issue: the importance of engaging minority students, who’ve grown up in poverty, in purposeful civic action. Throughout her book, Levinson addresses what she calls the “civic empowerment gap,” likening it to the more notable achievement gap in U.S. public schools. Both disparities highlight the unequal access to quality education between middle class White students and youth of color; the civic empowerment gap specifically highlights the lack of engagement of urban youth of color in meaningful civic learning. In particular, Levinson details educators’ moral obligation to engage disempowered youth in real-world civic action. She says that, “schools need to teach young people knowledge and skills to upend and reshape power relationships directly, through public, political, and civic action” (p. 13).</p>
<p>Employing a conversational tone, Levinson uses compelling anecdotes from her work as middle school teacher in Boston and Atlanta. She also relies on social sciences research to outline the problem. Her use of both types of evidence is engaging and accessible to multiple audiences, including classroom teachers, experiential practitioners, and researchers.</p>
<p>Throughout her book, Levinson describes the challenges and triumphs of working with underresourced youth in what she calls “guided experiential civic education.” She explains a two-step theory of action: (a) teaching young people to “recognize the particularity of their own perspective, including the ways in which their ethnoracial and cultural identities help shape those perspectives” (p. 84) and (b) analyzing power with students. She presents a model for guided experiential education that includes six stages: picking an issue and examining it, developing knowledge and practicing skills, taking action (i.e., “to learn <italic>through</italic> citizenship and not <italic>about</italic> citizenship” (p. 225), and reflecting on the process, with an eye toward future civic action.</p>
<p>Importantly, Levinson notes the difference between guided experiential civic education and service learning, providing a detailed critique of the latter. She writes, “Most service learning is justified on intentionally apolitical and hence also apparently nonpartisan grounds” (p. 221). She claims that this work is more common in part because of the potentially easier route to achieving short-term change; but she warns of the consequences of implementing service learning with urban youth of color and calls it an “inadequate tool” (p. 222). She says,<disp-quote>
<p>most service-oriented experiential education is driven by—and hence teaches—a conception of citizenship that is voluntary, based on individual rather than communal action . . . At its best (which isn’t very good), this vision of citizenship promotes an apolitical motivation for civic engagement. (p. 222)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She argues convincingly that this can serve to further disempower disenfranchised youth rather than engaging them in the development of lifelong, civic-action skills.</p>
<p>Although Levinson discusses how to equip teachers with the skills and resources to civically engage youth, more details are needed to help educators who themselves have not engaged in guided experiential civic education. Levinson acknowledges that this work takes skill and is time-consuming; but how to actually teach teachers to do this work?</p>
<p>Also, although she touches lightly on it, the learning theory that encompasses meaningful civic action is left unarticulated. Levinson speaks of communal and community-based work, of not isolating students, of shared practices, and of apprenticeships alongside community members. These concepts point toward a social, cultural, and historical approach to learning and development; toward learning as becoming a member of a community. Theories of learning that centralize the social nature of learning (i.e., Wegner’s “communities of practice” or Rogoff’s “intent participation”) would fit conceptually and practically.</p>
<p>In the end, Levinson’s message is clear: “<italic>all</italic> [italics in original] schools teach experiential lessons about civic identity, expectations, and opportunities—even when they have no intention of doing so” (p. 174). Therefore, educators need to purposefully engage disenfranchised youth in civic action—for the health of students and their communities. Without doing so, these youth will become further disempowered and set upon a lifelong trajectory of being uninvolved in democratic processes.</p>
