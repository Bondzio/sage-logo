<p>Thomas and Lobo, editors of the <italic>Advance Care Planning in End of Life Care</italic>, have assembled an informed and articulate cadre of experts in end-of-life care to provide an impressive resource to health professionals and administrators charged with implementation of advance care planning. Whether one is involved in local, national or international efforts to influence the agenda for open, honest communication about care preferences at end of life, or one seeks to advance the rights of individuals to give or refuse consent to end-of-life treatments and practices, this well-organized text has much to offer.</p>
<p>Organized into five sections and twenty-four chapters, the text covers an array of relevant subtopics, such as advance care planning for specific populations, specific settings, listening to the patient voice and ‘the tough questions: do not attempt resuscitation discussions’. One example is the chapter on the <italic>Spiritual Aspects of Advance Care Planning –</italic> a topic that knows no geographical or jurisdictional boundaries. As the chapter author states: ‘Advance Care Planning has a profoundly spiritual and existential dimension that needs to be acknowledged and supported’ (p.46).</p>
<p>Several book features enhance the reader’s ability to know exactly what to find. For example, every chapter but one begins with a bulleted summary of the key topics under discussion, as well as a summary of the key points of the chapter. Well-chosen case studies illustrate the points under discussion. The book is eminently readable, with effective use of boxes to frame key messages. The one disconcerting element in the readability was the surprising number of typographical errors.</p>
<p>Contributing authors draw on current research, clinical experience and policy developments to articulate a multiplicity of perspectives. While this is written primarily from a UK experience, six chapters describe Advance Care Planning perspectives from the US, Canada and Australia. As a Canadian health professional responsible for implementing Advance Care Planning in a health region, I found many relevant topics in the chapters that shed light on important aspects of advance care planning.</p>
<p>This text offers good value for the investment. Health care providers, health professionals and administrators, legal professionals and educators alike will benefit from the comprehensive nature of the book. Moreover, this text can serve as a beacon to light the way in the implementation of advance care planning in end-of-life care, not only in the UK, but around the globe.</p>
