<abstract>
<p>Age and ethnic group differences in cold weather and contagion or germ theories of infectious disease were explored in two studies. A cold weather theory was frequently invoked to explain colds and to a lesser extent flu but became less prominent with age as children gained command of a germ theory of disease. Explanations of how contact with other people causes disease were more causally sophisticated than explanations of how cold weather causes it. Finally, Mexican American and other minority children were more likely than European American children to subscribe to cold weather theories, a difference partially but not wholly attributable to ethnic group differences in parent education. Findings support the value of an intuitive or naïve theories perspective in understanding developmental and sociocultural differences in concepts of disease and in planning health education to help both children and their parents shed misconceptions so that they can focus on effective preventive actions.</p>

<p>The belief that exposure to cold, and particularly damp, weather causes colds dates back at least to Hippocrates and his theory of bodily humors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111407187">Harwood, 1971</xref>). Yet it is a misconception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111407187">Cecchin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111407187">Murphy &amp; The Editors of Time-Life Books, 1981</xref>). Colds and flu do reach their peak incidence in the winter—or, in more tropical climates, during the rainy season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111407187">Murphy &amp; The Editors of Time-Life Books, 1981</xref>); however, colds are actually least prevalent in the coldest parts of the world, so cold temperature cannot be the critical factor. More likely, the season of worst weather is also the season when people spend a good deal of time indoors, swapping germs, and when certain cold and flu viruses may also be more prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111407187">Murphy &amp; The Editors of Time-Life Books, 1981</xref>). Although a credible argument can be made that extreme and prolonged exposure to the cold, just as other significant stressors, can weaken the immune system’s ability to defend against ever-present viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111407187">Cecchin, 1993</xref>), one cannot take this argument too far. The Common Cold Unit in Britain performed a series of critical experiments on the causes of colds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111407187">Douglas, Lindgren, &amp; Couch, 1968</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111407187">Goldmann, 2001</xref>). In one, participants were infected with cold viruses or required to stand in a cold room in wet bathing suits for half an hour, or both. People who were merely exposed to the cold did not develop colds, whereas the two inoculated groups did, and at equal rates.</p>
<p>Oblivious to such evidence, many parents continue to believe that exposure to cold weather or extreme temperature changes causes illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111407187">Crocetti, Sabath, Cranmer, Gubser, &amp; Dooley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407187">Taveras, Durousseau, &amp; Flores, 2004</xref>), and many children blame cold weather when they are asked to explain how colds are caught or how people get sick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111407187">Goldman, Whitney-Saltiel, Granger, &amp; Rodin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111407187">Gratz &amp; Piliavin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111407187">Johnson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111407187">Perrin &amp; Gerrity, 1981</xref>). Because a cold weather theory of disease seems to be so tenacious among both children and adults, and because it competes with the scientifically based theory that germs cause infectious disease and leads to quite different conclusions about how to prevent illness, it deserves our attention. How do beliefs about the role of cold weather in causing colds change with age as children learn more about the role of germs in causing disease? Are cold weather beliefs applied to influenza—and might they therefore come to mind and breed confusion about effective preventive behavior when children hear about SARS, avian flu, swine flu, or other such emerging infectious diseases? Finally, to what extent do children’s beliefs in cold weather and germ theories differ across sociocultural groups that are known to differ in folk beliefs about illness?</p>
<p>Research on children’s concepts of illness, guided primarily by Piagetian theory, has tended to focus more on the causal complexity of children’s thinking than on its content until recently. The Piagetian approach, advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111407187">Bibace and Walsh (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111407187">Perrin and Gerrity (1981)</xref>, and others, assesses the complexity of children’s explanations of disease in terms of developmental levels leading from magical and unexplained associations to concrete cause–effect relationships involving internalization of a disease agent and finally to more complex physiological explanations involving multiple, interactive causes within the body. Importantly, this approach gauges the complexity of children’s thinking regardless of the correctness of their ideas. In the Piagetian view (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111407187">Piaget, 1971</xref>), children’s understandings change as they encounter new information, especially information that is inconsistent with their current understandings; they both assimilate it (incorporate it into their existing schemas) and accommodate to it (modify existing schemas or develop new ones to better fit the new information).</p>
<p>In this article, we focus on both the casual complexity and the content of children’s ideas (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111407187">Davies, Sigelman, Bridges, Rinehart, &amp; Sorongon, 2004</xref>). We conceptualize children’s thinking about disease in terms of intuitive or naive theories that children construct at early ages to define, organize, and explain different domains of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111407187">Inagaki &amp; Hatano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111407187">Keil, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198111407187">Wellman &amp; Gelman, 1992</xref>). Such theories include theories of physics (e.g., early understanding of gravity’s influence on the movement of objects), psychology (as examined in “theory of mind” research on the young child’s understanding that mental states, such as desires and beliefs, guide and explain people’s behavior), and biology (e.g., understanding of germs as a cause of disease). Each intuitive theory has at its heart causal mechanisms that are specific to that domain of knowledge. This study examines age-related differences in both the complexity of children’s reasoning about the causality of colds and flu and their intuitions about what causes these diseases.</p>
<p>Even preschool children, when they are asked simple, structured questions, demonstrate an awareness that germs are living and contagious organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111407187">Keil, 1992</xref>). Moreover, they prefer contagion explanations of disease to immanent justice explanations that view illness as punishment for misbehavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111407187">Siegal, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111407187">Siegal, Patty, &amp; Eiser, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111407187">Springer &amp; Ruckel, 1992</xref>). Mastery of the germ theory of infectious illness increases over the childhood years, however. Preschool children may not understand germs fully as a biological mechanism for disease transmission; they tend to view symptoms caused by germs and poisons as equally contagious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111407187">Solomon &amp; Cassimatis, 1999</xref>). And not until age 7 to 10 years are children able to construct explanations of illness that focus on internalization of other people’s germs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111407187">Bibace &amp; Walsh, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111407187">Lieberman, Clark, Krone, Orlandi, &amp; Wynder, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111407187">Perrin &amp; Gerrity, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>We know far less about the development of cold weather thinking about illness. It appears to be common among young children but it is not entirely supplanted by the germ theory as the latter takes hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111407187">Gratz &amp; Piliavin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111407187">Johnson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111407187">Raman &amp; Winer, 2002</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111407187">Gratz and Piliavin (1984)</xref> found that more than 90% of both kindergartners/first graders and fourth/fifth graders agreed that weather could make you sick whereas the percentage agreeing that other people could make you sick was lower and increased with age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111407187">Johnson et al. (1994)</xref>, interviewing disadvantaged, African American children in first, third, and fifth grade, observed that more of these children cited cold weather than cited contact with infected people as the cause of colds, and that only 17% mentioned germs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111407187">Bibace, Sagarin, and Dyl (1998)</xref> have argued, early-developing concepts and modes of thinking about illness may continue to be available and to be invoked under certain conditions even as later-developing thinking becomes the dominant response. Consistent with this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111407187">Bibace et al. (1998)</xref> reported that even among college students, magical, concrete, and abstract explanations of illness coexisted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111407187">Raman and Winer (2002)</xref>, by forcing elementary school children and college students to choose between alternative explanations and combinations of explanations, reported even more direct evidence that not only children but, to a lesser extent, college students also give credence to cold weather explanations of colds. However, college students were more likely to implicate biological mechanisms, such as germs, in explaining how cold weather could cause disease.</p>
<p>In work that served as the springboard for the present research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407187">Sigelman, Maddock, Epstein, and Carpenter (1993)</xref> asked fourth, sixth, and eighth graders and college students open-ended questions about the main cause of AIDS, colds, and cancer and then had them rate 16 behaviors as possible causes of the diseases. Mention of cold/wet weather as “the main way” people get colds decreased significantly with age from 62% among fourth graders to 29%, 12%, and 19% among the older age groups, respectively, whereas mention of getting colds from other people or from germs increased from 27% to 54% to 82% from fourth to sixth to eighth grade and decreased to 52% among college students, largely because almost 20% of them cited stress as the primary cause. In response to structured questions about risk factors, 84% of college students and at least that percentage of each group of children said cold, rainy weather could probably or definitely cause colds (but hardly ever endorsed cold, rainy weather as a cause of AIDS or cancer). Items about kissing and being sneezed on by someone with a cold were similarly popular, endorsed by at least 76% of participants in each age group as a probable or definite cause of colds.</p>
<p>These data suggest that cold weather thinking survives at least into emerging adulthood but that a germ theory of disease comes to dominate it with age, consistent with other evidence that scientific and nonscientific theories of illness come to coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111407187">Bibace et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111407187">Raman &amp; Winer, 2002</xref>). However, children in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al. (1993)</xref> study wrote their responses, did not have to explain them, were asked to cite only one main cause of colds, were no younger than age 9 or 10 years, and were predominantly European American and middle class. As a result, these data leave several questions unanswered. Do most children construct a coherent dual-process theory of colds, believing that two very different causal mechanisms are involved, do they blend the two competing theories by assimilating cold weather thinking into their new germ theory, or do they uncritically allow them to coexist as separate theories without thinking much about it? How do children of different ages explain how germs and cold weather cause disease? Does cold weather thinking extend beyond colds to a similar well-known infectious disease, influenza? Finally, since most relevant studies have focused on European American, middle-class children, do cultural background and socioeconomic status (SES) influence children’s thinking about infectious illness?</p>
<p>With respect to sociocultural differences, several studies have reported little variation in children’s illness concepts as a function of parent education, SES, and/or racial/ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111407187">Goldman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111407187">Gratz &amp; Piliavin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111407187">Sigelman, Mukai, Woods, &amp; Alfeld, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111407187">Schonfeld, Johnson, Perrin, O’Hare, &amp; Cicchetti, 1993</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111407187">McCann-Sanford, Spencer, Hendrick, and Meyer (1982)</xref> concluded that relatively advantaged European American children know more than disadvantaged minority children about upper respiratory illness. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111407187">Zhu, Liu, and Tardif (2009)</xref> found that high SES Chinese 5-year-olds are more likely than their lower SES peers to give biological rather than behavioral or symptomatic explanations of illness. Moreover, although the study did not have a non-Chinese comparison group, Chinese children made frequent reference to cold and wind in explaining illness, which was attributed by the researchers to folk beliefs about balance between hot and cold forces in Chinese traditional medicine. In support of this argument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111407187">Au et al. (2008)</xref> reported that elderly Chinese adults in Hong Kong are more likely than children there to advance cold weather theories of both colds and flu (but did not separately report findings for the two diseases).</p>
<p>There is good reason to expect cold weather thinking about disease to also be especially common among Hispanic and other minority children in the United States, especially those from lower SES families. The Hispanic folk belief system known as the “hot–cold theory” of illness, a descendant of the ancient Greek theory of bodily humors, maintains that extremes of heat or cold or sudden changes in temperature cause illness and that balance can be restored to the body with foods and other remedies of the opposite temperature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111407187">Castro, Furth, &amp; Karlow, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111407187">Currier, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111407187">Harwood, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111407187">Krajewski-Jaime, 1991</xref>). Hot–cold beliefs about illness are more strongly embraced by less educated and lower SES than by more educated and higher SES Mexican American and other Hispanic adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111407187">Crocetti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111407187">Krajewski-Jaime, 1991</xref>). They are also more popular among Mexican American women, especially less acculturated ones, than among Anglo-American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111407187">Castro et al., 1984</xref>), and they seem to be prevalent among African American and other minority populations in the United States as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111407187">Harwood, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407187">Taveras et al., 2004</xref>). Studying children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111407187">Au and Romo (1996)</xref> found that Latino children from a low-income area were slower than middle-class European American children to learn about the biological nature of germs; however, the researchers could not separate the effects of ethnicity and SES and did not examine ethnic differences in cold weather thinking.</p>
<p>The present study investigates the developmental origins of subcultural differences in naive theories of illness, asking whether Mexican American and other minority children are more committed to a cold weather theory and less committed to a germ theory of infectious disease than European American children. Controls for parent education were introduced because it is the aspect of SES most likely to be related to exposure to folk beliefs and scientific health information and most predictive of parents’ and children’s misconceptions about illness in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407187">Taveras et al., 2004</xref>). Preliminary analyses revealed that the employment status of children’s parents (full time vs. part-time vs. unemployed) was not a relevant predictor in the present studies and it was therefore dropped. Controls for parent education allow exploration of the extent to which ethnic differences in children’s theories of disease may be because of something more than group differences in parental education. Attention is also paid to whether ethnic differences diminish with age, as might happen if minority children were developmentally delayed in shifting from a cold weather theory to a germ theory, or enlarge with age, as might happen if minority children were increasingly being socialized into their subculture’s distinct folk beliefs.</p>
<p>We report two studies, both of which rely on open-ended questioning to encourage children to elaborate on their thinking. The first investigates the development of thinking about colds among European American and minority (mainly Mexican American and African American) children, and the second specifically focuses on Mexican American children and examines age and ethnic group differences in the application of cold weather and germ theories to another infectious disease, flu. There is reason to expect that young children in particular might have difficulty distinguishing flu from colds and might therefore extend their cold weather thinking to it. It was hypothesized that cold weather theorizing about both colds and flu would decrease with age as understanding of contagion and the disease-causing role of germs increases. Since parents’ warnings about cold weather are unlikely to be backed by sound explanations and since the cold weather theory is incorrect in any case, it was also predicted that children would offer more causally sophisticated explanations of how contact with infected persons causes illness than of how exposure to cold weather does. In addition, we expected more Mexican American and other minority children than European American children to offer cold weather theories. Finally, we assess whether any ethnic differences observed survive controls on parent education.</p>

<p>Study 1 examined age and ethnic group differences in children’s explanations of how cold weather and contact with sick people cause colds, examining both the content and the causal complexity of their theories.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In a project primarily concerned with understandings of AIDS, 189 children and adolescents ranging in age from 6 to 18 years were recruited from 10 after-school care and recreational facilities in socioeconomically diverse areas of a southwestern city. Most (66.1%) were European American, 11.6% were African American, 16.4% were of Mexican American or other Hispanic descent, and 5.8% were of other ethnic backgrounds. Consenting parents, 80.5% of them mothers, reported years of education ranged from 10 to 18 (<italic>M</italic> = 14.8). In all, 50.8% were white-collar workers; 30.7% were clerical, sales, or skilled workers; and 18.6% were unemployed or unskilled workers or homemakers. Because the sample was too small to permit comparisons of all the racial and ethnic groups represented, and because some research has revealed similar cold weather beliefs among both Hispanic and African American parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407187">Taveras et al., 2004</xref>), minority children were compared with European American children.</p>
<p>IRB approval was secured and both written parental consent and written child assent were obtained. Parent consent forms were offered to parents in either Spanish or English (and were usually taken in English), typically at the after-school care facility when they picked up their children; 33% were returned signed, so it must be borne in mind that this was a volunteer sample. Children were interviewed in English by trained male and female, European American and Hispanic, interviewers.</p>
<p>After a few preliminary questions about AIDS, children were asked this question: “A cold is a disease too. What makes people get colds?” They then were asked follow-up questions, using standard guidelines for probing, about the causal mechanism (s) involved, particularly about what they regarded as the disease-causing agent, and they were encouraged to offer and explain any additional ideas they had. Answers were coded for causal factor(s) mentioned (cold weather, lowered resistance, a specific form of contact with someone who has a cold such as being sneezed on, vague reference to other people, and “other wrong ideas”). Interrater agreement for a subsample of 103 transcribed interviews was 97.5%. The causal agent identified by the child was also coded (none, cold air, the disease/sickness itself, germs/viruses, the <italic>cold</italic> germ/virus specifically, and “other”); interrater agreement = 85.4%.</p>
<p>Finally, complexity of reasoning about cold causality, or conceptual understanding, was assessed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111407187">Bibace and Walsh’s (1980)</xref> coding system as adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111407187">Walsh and Bibace (1991)</xref>. Complexity of reasoning is scored regardless of whether the explanation is factually correct or incorrect. Possible scores were as follows: 0 (no response or don’t know), 1 (a largely magical association between some phenomenon and illness), 2 (the association of a specific cause and a specific effect without causal explanation), 3 (an account of how an external cause leads to internalization of a disease agent and symptoms involving the whole body), 4 (a mechanistic sequence of specific causes leading to specific changes in internal organs/processes and symptoms), 5 (an entire causal sequence involving the interaction of multiple causes and multiple effects, with the body playing an active role), and 6 (a full physiological explanation involving interactive causes and effects). Because of modest interrater agreement (<italic>M</italic> = 68%), all transcribed responses were independent scored by two coders, who reached a consensus if they differed before assigning a final code.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111407187">Table 1</xref> also shows the proportions of children who explicitly identified either cold air or a germ or virus as the agent causing colds. Since not all proponents of the two broad theories were able to identify a causal agent, these percentages are lower than the percentages citing bad weather or contact with infected people as causes. However, the age trends are similar: Identification of cold air as the agent decreased from 52% in the youngest age group to 34% in the middle school–aged group to 0 in high school, <italic>F</italic>(2, 182) = 25.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, whereas identification of a germ or virus as the causal agent increased substantially with age, from 20% in early elementary school to 44% in fifth through eighth grade to 83% in high school, <italic>F</italic>(2, 182) = 33.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. In each case, all three age groups differed significantly.</p>
<p>The complexity of children’s explanations of the causality of colds also increased systematically with age, <italic>F</italic>(2, 182) = 13.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. High school students gave significantly more sophisticated explanations than either of the younger groups but their mean score of 3.26 suggests that even they often had difficulty linking a specific causal agent to specific internal changes. To test the hypothesis that germ theorists would offer more causally sophisticated explanations than cold weather theorists, we first excluded the oldest age group because it had no pure cold weather theorists and then compared the causal complexity scores of 56 pure germ theorists with those of 47 pure cold weather theorists, using analysis of covariance to control for age differences between these two theoretical camps. Age-adjusted mean complexity scores were significantly higher for germ theorists than for cold weather theorists, 3.04 versus 2.33, respectively, <italic>F</italic>(1, 99) = 19.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111407187">Table 1</xref> also presents data regarding ethnic differences. Across age groups, more minority than European American children cited cold weather as a cause of colds, <italic>F</italic>(1, 182) = 8.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Moreover, significantly fewer identified germs as the cold-causing agent, <italic>F</italic>(1, 182) = 4.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. These ethnic differences were equally evident across age groups, as indicated by the absence of significant age by ethnicity interactions, and were the only ethnic differences observed. To control for ethnic group differences in the consenting parent’s years of education, analyses of covariance were then conducted on these measures. The ethnic difference in identification of germs as the cause of colds was no longer significant, but the greater tendency of minority children to cite cold weather as a cause of colds remained significant even with parent education controlled, <italic>F</italic>(1, 167) = 8.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>In the context of an AIDS intervention study, exploration of cold weather thinking about disease was extended to flu, an infectious illness very similar to the common cold and yet perhaps not as closely linked in the public mind to cold weather or temperature changes. Study 2 also focused on the ethnic group most likely to subscribe to a cold weather or hot–cold theory, Mexican American children, to determine whether they are more likely than European American children to engage in cold weather thinking about flu.</p>
<sec id="section5-1090198111407187">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Open-ended interviews about flu and AIDS were completed at pretest by a randomly selected subsample of 149 children, 93 Mexican American and 56 European American, in a southwestern city. They attended three Catholic parochial schools. Two were located in lower income, predominantly Mexican American neighborhoods; according to school officials; 44% and 69% of children in the two schools, respectively, qualified for the free lunch program. The third school’s student body was predominantly European American and served primarily middle SES families but was still ethnically diverse. Children from other ethnic and racial backgrounds were omitted from the analysis.</p>
<p>Participants were in Grades 3, 5, and 7 (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 8.8, 10.7, and 12.6 years, respectively); 59 were boys, 90 were girls. Responding parents, 80.9% mothers, reported 5 to 18 years of education (<italic>M</italic> = 14.3), a wider range than in Study 1; 63.4% of the parents worked full time, 16.5% worked part-time, and 20.1% did not work. Individual interviews about the two diseases (with order of AIDS and flu sections counterbalanced) were conducted individually in English, taped, and transcribed. Explanation and consent materials for parents were printed in English on one side, Spanish on the other; the large majority was returned in English, suggesting a fairly well-acculturated sample. As in Study 1, written consent was obtained from both parents and children; here, the overall positive response rate by parents was 87.2%.</p>
<p>The flu questions of interest were as follows: “Can you tell me a way someone could get the flu?,” “How would [the specific risk factor mentioned by the child] give someone the flu?,” “If someone gets the flu from [this risk factor], does something get in their body that makes them get sick? What?” From these answers, coders scored each of 22 categories of risk behavior as 1 (<italic>mentioned</italic>) or 0 (<italic>not mentioned</italic>). For the present analysis, responses regarding flu were given two 0 or 1 scores based on whether they cited 1 (<italic>cold weather</italic> [or temperature changes]), and 2 (<italic>contact with other people</italic>; saliva exchange or ingestion of contaminated food or drink, touching an infected individual, or airborne transmission when infected individuals sneeze, cough, and so on). Interrater agreement between pairs of trained raters averaged 98% across categories. In addition, children’s identifications of the agent(s) causing flu were coded using a 15-category system (agreement = 86%). Each child was given two 0-1 scores based on whether he or she identified 1 (<italic>coldness or cold air</italic>) and 2 (<italic>germs</italic> or viruses or <italic>flu</italic> germs or viruses) as causal agents for flu.</p>
<p>Bibace–Walsh complexity of reasoning scores were also assigned based on the entire flu interview, which also included questions about what happens to people who get flu and how the disease agent identified by the child makes them experience the main symptoms they experience (interrater agreement = 67%; as in Study 1, any differences between pairs of coders were resolved before final codes were assigned).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111407187">Table 2</xref> reports the proportions of children at each grade level and in each ethnic group offering cold weather and contagion theories of flu. Comparison of these data with those obtained in Study 1 suggests that cold weather theories of flu are less prevalent than cold weather theories of colds but are still quite common among elementary school children. As in Study 1, late elementary school proved to be an age at which both germ and cold weather theories were especially prevalent. A 3 (Grade Level) × 2 (Ethnicity) ANOVA indicated that cold weather thinking was significantly less evident among seventh graders than among fifth graders, <italic>F</italic>(2, 143) = 4.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Meanwhile, theorizing about contact with infected individuals increased significantly from 52% in third grade to 77% in fifth grade and 88% in seventh grade, <italic>F</italic>(2, 143) = 9.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Among European American children, none of the third graders, 6% of the fifth graders, and 12% of the seventh graders offered both cold weather and contagion explanations of flu. Among Mexican American students, the corresponding percentages were 0%, 30%, and 3%, respectively. Thus 10- and 11-year-old Mexican American children were most likely to put forward both theories. Examination of transcripts suggested that children usually offered them as separate hypotheses rather than integrating them.</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111407187">Table 2</xref> also shows, fewer than 10% of students at each grade level explicitly identified coldness or cold air as the disease-causing agent for flu, although cold air was cited frequently as the cause of colds in Study 1. Meanwhile, 46% of the third graders, compared with a significantly higher 79% of the fifth graders and 92% of the seventh graders, identified germs as the cause of flu, <italic>F</italic>(2, 143) = 16.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001.</p>
<p>Overall, 29% of Mexican American children, compared with 14% of European American children, cited exposure to cold weather as a cause of flu, a significant difference, <italic>F</italic>(2, 143) = 4.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. As in Study 1, the interaction between age group and ethnicity was nonsignificant. Controlling for mother’s years of education weakened both the age group difference and the ethnic difference for the cold weather variable, rendering both effects significant at the .10 rather than the .05 level. Mexican American and European American children did not differ on the other theory variables.</p>
<p>Causal complexity scores increased significantly with grade level, with third and seventh graders differing significantly; <italic>F</italic>(2, 143) = 5.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Mexican American children tended to score higher than European American children on average (3.31 vs. 3.09), but the difference fell short of significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Nor did it become significant when the 3 × 2 ANOVA was repeated using mother’s education as a covariate. Finally, comparison of pure cold weather theorists with pure contagion theorists (<italic>N</italic> = 22 and <italic>N</italic> = 92, respectively) revealed, as in Study 1, that cold weather theorists offered less causally sophisticated explanations than contagion theorists; mean scores, adjusted for age differences between comparison groups, were 2.75 and 3.40, respectively, <italic>F</italic>(1, 111) = 21.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001.</p>
<p>To illustrate children’s thinking about the role of cold weather in causing colds and flu, most children were unable to offer a physiological explanation of how exposure to cold, rainy weather causes illness. Some said they did not know, and others merely asserted that getting cold leads to <italic>having</italic> a cold without saying how. For example, an 8-year-old girl explained how eating ice or ice cream might cause a cold: “Because, you know how it starts to hurt you head if you eat [ice cream] too fast? That’s what happens to me, and then I start coughing a lot.” Similar numbers of children set forth “hot–cold” versions of the cold weather theory of colds, emphasizing dramatic temperature changes. One 9-year-old boy explained it this way: “Like, your body starts getting numb, and when you come in, it’s warm inside and it gives your body like a shock and you just get sick.” Although integration of cold and germ theories was rare, a few children, when pushed, explained how cold weather causes disease by referring to germs, as illustrated by this Mexican American girl, aged 9 years:</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The two sets of data presented here, combined with the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al. (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111407187">Raman and Winer (2002)</xref>, tell a straightforward story about the development of competing theories of colds and, to a lesser extent, flu. A cold weather theory of infectious disease was invoked by more than half of the children studied here to explain colds and by about a quarter to explain flu in response to open-ended questions. Judging from both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111407187">Raman and Winer (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al. (1993)</xref>, this folk belief develops early in childhood and coexists with a germ theory of disease even after the latter becomes dominant, being endorsed to some extent by a large majority of children and adolescents and even college students when they are asked directly whether someone can get a cold from going out in cold, rainy weather.</p>
<p>As predicted, cold weather thinking became less central in children’s thinking as they got older and gained a firmer understanding of the disease-causing role of germs. During a transition period in middle childhood, a sizable minority of children set forth both cold weather and germ theories. However, few integrated the two views; most suggested that bad weather and contact with sick people cause disease through different mechanisms. Children consistently provided more causally complex explanations of how contact with other people causes disease than of how exposure to cold weather causes it. Finally, sociocultural background influenced children’s theories; in both Studies 1 and 2, cold weather theories were more common among minority, primarily Mexican American, children than among European American children. Controlling for parent education did not eliminate the greater tendency of minority children to cite cold weather as a cause of colds, although it did largely account for the other ethnic differences observed.</p>
<p>Why is the folk belief that cold weather causes colds so persistent, even after the germ theory of infectious disease is solidly mastered? Perhaps because a cold is, after all, called a <italic>cold</italic>. In addition, children may notice that going out in cold weather produces cold-like symptoms, such as teary eyes, runny noses, and chills, and that colds and flu are more common during the colder weather months. Then too, children undoubtedly trust their parents to give them sound health advice. Finally, cold weather thinking may resist extinction because children do not necessarily subject beliefs acquired earlier in life to close scrutiny, revise or reject them as they learn more scientifically correct ideas, or insist that all of their beliefs cohere in a tightly organized system. Rather than weeding out flawed theories as they master more scientifically correct ones, many children appear to leave their folk beliefs intact, continuing to invoke them later in life. In this view, children neither assimilate new information about the germ theory of infectious disease into their cold weather theory or vice versa. And they do not, through a Piagetian process of accommodation, integrate their cold weather and germ theories in a new theory or replace the cold weather theory with the more scientifically correct theory. Instead, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111407187">Bibace et al. (1998)</xref>, they simply allow the two theories to coexist. As a result, ridding children of incorrect folk beliefs is likely to require more than teaching them correct information. It probably calls for directly and convincingly demonstrating to children that their folk beliefs are wrong—that is, for forcing an accommodative process that, while it may underlie increases with age in the causal complexity of thinking about disease, does not seem to ensure the replacement of wrong ideas with more correct ones.</p>
<p>Some adolescents and adults, meanwhile, having discovered that being run down or stressed increases their vulnerability to colds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al., 1993</xref>), may think about their folk beliefs and conclude that the stress of prolonged exposure to cold temperatures can weaken the immune system and thereby contribute to illness. In this way, cold weather thinking acquired in childhood may persist among at least some adults because it can be explained scientifically and assimilated into a virus-centered account of infectious disease (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111407187">Au et al., 2008</xref>, for evidence along these lines). The explanations adults of different sociocultural backgrounds offer for their cold weather thinking clearly demand further attention if we are to understand the evolution of cold weather and germ theories over the course of development.</p>
<p>Although most children in the United States appear to acquire a cold weather theory of colds, our data indicate that Mexican American and other minority children are more likely than European American children to both adopt and maintain this view. Whereas previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111407187">Au &amp; Romo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111407187">McCann-Sanford et al., 1982</xref>) could not separate the effects of ethnicity from those of education and other socioeconomic factors, we found evidence of both at work, with one ethnic difference remaining significant but two others diminishing in size when controls for parent education were introduced. Moreover, the absence of interactions between age group and ethnicity suggest that sociocultural differences in beliefs are acquired early and remain evident into adolescence. Children whose parents have limited education may be more strongly socialized into folk beliefs and/or less exposed to scientific information about disease than children whose parents are more educated. At the same time, this study provides at least limited evidence that cold and hot–cold theories, although especially prevalent among Mexican Americans, do not interfere with their ability to master in addition the germ theory of infectious disease or to reason complexly about disease causality.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that these findings are based primarily on open-ended interviews. Although open-ended interviews have the advantage of revealing children’s own conceptualizations of phenomena rather than their reactions to ideas that they might not otherwise have entertained on their own, open-ended questions tend to underestimate the understanding of younger and less verbal children, who can often give more sophisticated answers when choosing among alternatives than when they must generate their own explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111407187">Bibace, Dillon, &amp; Sagarin, 1999</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al. (1993)</xref> offered direct evidence that both children and college students are more likely to claim that both cold weather and contact with infected people cause colds when they are asked to rate specific risk behaviors than when they are asked an open-ended question about what causes colds. In future research, then, it would be informative to ask both open-ended and structured questions.</p>
<p>In addition, more should be done to tease out the implications of relevant cultural beliefs tied to ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, and acculturation for theories of disease. Study 1 was limited in that low <italic>N</italic>s required pooling minority group members, despite their different cultural traditions. Study 2 overcame this limitation by comparing Mexican American and European American children but, similar to Study 1, continued to focus on education as the indicator of SES and involved what appeared to be a highly acculturated sample, given low use by parents of Spanish versions of the study materials. Future research should control for income, occupational prestige, and other indicators of SES to determine more conclusively whether ethnic group differences in beliefs are more than a function of socioeconomic or cultural differences between groups. It should also expand and improve on the current study by examining both parent and child beliefs—and relationships between the two—in diverse Latino populations. This should be done with attention to variation associated with country of origin, regional cultural differences, degree of acculturation (e.g., time in the United States, resident status, and language use), and health socialization experiences and information sources, including possible effects of differences in health education across schools. Similar examinations of folk theories of disease in African American and other racial and ethnic populations would also be instructive. Finally, the intuitive theories approach illustrated here can readily be extended to other diseases about which people hold mistaken beliefs—diseases such as HIV/AIDS and human papilloma virus (HPV), for example. Much remains to be learned about the extent to which mistaken folk beliefs about disease negatively affect health behavior and, in turn, health outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090198111407187">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>An intuitive or naïve theories perspective focusing on the ways in which humans organize their knowledge of phenomena around causal concepts is useful in assessing both developmental and sociocultural differences in children’s conceptions of health and illness. It can also inform the planning of public health initiatives to educate the public—especially parents—about newly emerging diseases and about sound family disease prevention strategies. Moreover, it can provide a framework for developing health education programs to teach children accurate theories of disease and disease prevention and to challenge their incorrect beliefs and any ineffective or counterproductive health behaviors that follow from them. Attempts on the part of researchers, health educators, medical personnel, and parents to understand what children know and think about disease should illuminate both how children reason and what they think—that is, both the complexity of their causal arguments and the nature and accuracy of their beliefs. Such assessments should be just as concerned with uncovering children’s mistaken ideas as with assessing their mastery of scientifically correct ones. That is, parents and other adults who teach children about disease should be aware that children come to instruction with their own theories about a whole range of health matters and that even children (and, for that matter, adults) who have learned scientifically accurate information have not necessarily shed misconceptions that they acquired earlier in life and that are embedded in their culture.</p>
<p>The belief that cold weather or a sudden temperature change causes colds is not as dangerous as some misconceptions about health and illness. Still, when new influenza epidemics strike, this misconception may get in the way of learning and adhering to key rules of illness prevention (e.g., appreciating that “Wash your hands” is more important advice than “Wear your coat”). It is clear that children can be taught scientific theories of the causes of disease and will adopt behaviors to protect themselves as a result; they can even be taught to use the information that germs live longer in cold weather to help them integrate their cold weather thinking into their germ theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111407187">Au et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, Mexican American children have proven just as responsive as European American children to education based on an intuitive theory’s perspective on disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111407187">Sigelman et al., 1996</xref>). By identifying the theories that guide children’s thinking about disease and being sensitive to cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence their thinking, educators will be in a better position to design health education that not only conveys a coherent, meaningful, and scientifically correct explanation of what causes a disease and how it can be prevented, but also deliberately challenges learners to question and revise folk beliefs that do not fit the facts.</p>
