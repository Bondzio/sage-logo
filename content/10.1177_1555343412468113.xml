<abstract>
<p>This article provides an integration and synthesis of the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing simulation-based training environments for research. It provides information for researchers interested in exploring complex, dynamic, and high-stakes decision making in critical incidents. The article proposes that immersive simulated learning environments (ISLEs) are an effective naturalistic decision making tool for examining strategic and tactical multiteam decision making. Specifically, they are useful for researching environments whereby decision characteristics of anticipation, preparation, mitigation, adaptation, and coping are treated as interconnected elements. The article presents the simulation tool Hydra as an example of an ISLE by describing a worked example known as Operation Pandora. It demonstrates how the use of ISLEs can assist research on expert, high-stakes, and high-consequence critical incident decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Critical incidents are high-risk, high-stakes, or uncertain events that leave a long-term negative commercial, behavioral, and/or emotional effect on a community. They can diminish the level of trust and confidence placed in the individuals responsible for interacting with or responding to the incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison &amp; Crego, 2008</xref>). Critical incidents often originate from a specific event (or series of events) with their “level” of criticality defined by both endogenous features (specific to the event) and exogenous features (nonspecific to the event such as team coordination; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Crego, 2012</xref>). For example, with regard to the BP deep-water oil rig leak in 2010, critical endogenous features included the scale of the event, its impact on the environment, and its short- and long-term impacts on health; exogenous critical features included the speed with which planners coordinated a response to the event, their readiness to implement actions, and the efficiency of their decision making. Other exogenous factors such as the reporting style and hostility of the media have also been found to affect the level of criticality by influencing the trust and confidence of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1555343412468113">Merry, Power, McManus, &amp; Alison, 2012</xref>). In other words, endogenous features are the situational specific characteristics and isolated reactions to the critical incident, whereas exogenous features refer to the effectiveness of the multiagency coordinated response to these effects by those responsible for managing the critical incident.</p>
<p>Because of critical incidents’ inherent complexity, their unique features, and the serial, cumulative, and/or parallel nature of key decision challenges (i.e., they are not a unitary disconnected set of problem solving tasks), they are hard to train for and challenging for researchers to make sense of. Examples of critical incidents include scenarios such as a dirty bomb, a siege, or a flood. They can also include multiagency failures in a child protection enquiries, allegations of institutional racism, or a company’s loss of service user account information. All of these pose high-level strategic and tactical challenges that, from a research perspective, are poorly understood. This is the result of confusion with regard to definitions of, and antecedents to, these events and a lack of a clear research methodology to unpack these factors. This article hopes to address these confusions, with a specific focus on outlining a clear methodological approach to critical incident research via the use of simulation-based training (SBT) tools. It articulates the authors’ more than 20 years of experience in designing and running such training with the emergency services and criminal justice sectors, the military, industry, and government. Specifically, the article</p>

<title>Step 1: Defining Simulation-Based Training</title>
<p>According to naturalistic decision making (NDM) paradigms, decision processes should be observed and analyzed “in situ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412468113">McAndrew, 2008</xref>), yet this is often impractical because of the rarity and unpredictability of such incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison &amp; Crego, 2008</xref>). As training is the process of managing people’s experiences to help them gain a requisite set of skills and knowledge to apply to real operations while in a safe environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1555343412468113">Rouse, 1991</xref>), it is neither possible nor desirable to have individuals learn through exposure to real events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412468113">Kolb, 1984</xref>). In lieu of access to real critical incidents, SBT methodologies have been used to train practitioners within domains such as the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison &amp; Crego, 2008</xref>) and the military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412468113">Jean, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1555343412468113">van den Bosch &amp; Helsdingen, 2007</xref>). SBTs provide high-fidelity replications of the complex, dynamic, and risky environments usually faced by individuals in real operations, thereby generating domain-specific challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1555343412468113">Jenvald &amp; Morin, 2004</xref>) while maintaining experimental control for the trainer to evaluate individuals’ abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412468113">DiFonzo, Hantula, &amp; Bordia, 1998</xref>). They allow participants to apply knowledge and skills and reflect on their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1555343412468113">Schön, 1987</xref>), and they have been found to aid team skills, expertise, efficiency, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412468113">Benn, Healey, &amp; Hollnagel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1555343412468113">
<title>Why Is SBT a Valid Research Tool?</title>
<p>NDM theorists criticize the value of research when it is devoid of contextual richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412468113">McAndrew, 2008</xref>). They argue that research should analyze decision processes “in vivo” using field studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412468113">Dunbar &amp; Blanchette, 2001</xref>) because “in vitro” laboratory studies do not generate the fidelity required to study complex and realistic decision tasks. Although the high level of control afforded in laboratory studies prevents interference and allows for firm conclusions to be drawn regarding observed interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412468113">Dunbar &amp; Blanchette, 2001</xref>), laboratory decision making tasks are devoid of important real-world influences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412468113">Orasanu and Connolly (1993)</xref> conclude that real-world decision events are characterized by time pressure, uncertainty, high stakes, conflicting goals, and organizational constraints, elements not easily replicated in the laboratory. Therefore, field research should be conducted to examine how experienced decision makers interact in “real life” within complex applied contexts to provide valid recommendations. Although traditional decision methods focus on objective hypothesis <italic>testing</italic> in controlled, context-free settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1555343412468113">Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004</xref>), naturalistic approaches seek to <italic>observe</italic> actual phenomena to formulate descriptive behavioral models or generate theories and hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412468113">Klein, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>SBT methodologies act as a “halfway house” between laboratory and field-based approaches by maximizing the strengths of these two methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412468113">DiFonzo et al., 1998</xref>). SBTs are useful for synthesizing seemingly disparate traditional and NDM approaches, allowing for both observation and testing of theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre, Crego, &amp; Alison, 2008</xref>). They enable researchers to develop an understanding of the social, organizational, cultural, and political contexts in which decisions are made, while maintaining experimental control by selecting the context they wish to expose decision makers to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). Simulations can be effectively designed with a dual emphasis on both researching and training the psychological (social and cognitive) processes and nontechnical skills involved during the effective management of dynamic and challenging situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412468113">Flin, O’Connor, &amp; Crichton, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Step 2: An Effective Framework for Using SBTs in Critical Incident Research</title>
<p>In explaining SBT events in more detail, this article now provides a recommended framework for how to apply SBT scenarios to assist in the research of critical incident decision making. Based on established methodological derivations from the literature, along with the authors’ more than 20 years of experience in SBT design, this article outlines three key elements that must be considered when designing an SBT event for research: utilizing experts, creating fidelity and immersion, and ensuring the valid measurement of social and cognitive processes. It is these three elements that make SBT research valid for naturalistic study, and they must be considered in great depth by researchers wishing to utilize this method.</p>
<sec id="section5-1555343412468113">
<title>Utilizing Experts</title>
<p>Experts have been found to outperform novices because of their superior declarative and procedural domain knowledge, their ability to construct more complete and accurate mental models, and their use of efficient and effective information processing and decision strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412468113">Glaser &amp; Chi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1555343412468113">Klein &amp; Hoffman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412468113">Lipshitz &amp; Shaul, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1555343412468113">Murphy &amp; Wright, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1555343412468113">Reimann &amp; Chi, 1989</xref>). The acquisition of expertise is a three-tiered process of improved performance accompanied by concomitant changes in domain specific knowledge (or mental models) and decision/information search strategies. Designing and implementing a scenario that elicits the cognitive and emotional responses evoked in real critical incident contexts requires the involvement of experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412468113">Crandall, Klein, &amp; Hoffman, 2006</xref>). These experts may provide details of the problem landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1555343412468113">Zimmerman, Sestokas, &amp; Burns, 2011</xref>) that are essential for developing an overview of the chronological and connected decision phases (anticipation, prevention, mitigation, adaption, and coping), as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison and Crego (2008)</xref>. Expert involvement in design and implementation is important for creating simulations that (a) possess fidelity and immersion and (b) facilitate sociocognitive processes, the importance of which is discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1555343412468113">
<title>Creating Fidelity and Immersion</title>
<p>The credibility of any simulation exercise is measured according to the extent to which experienced decision makers take them seriously and engage as they would in actual operational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412468113">Klein &amp; Woods, 1993</xref>). Fidelity is the level of similarity between the simulation and the real world and is an important factor for encouraging participant engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412468113">Caird, 1996</xref>). Rather than focusing on physical fidelity (i.e., the degree to which physical surroundings resemble the real-life environment), SBT research is more concerned with the mental reenactment of the process by which participants interact with other agents involved in the scenario (psychological fidelity). Psychological fidelity addresses essential underlying processes relevant to researching key decision-making performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1555343412468113">Kozlowski &amp; DeShon, 2004</xref>). For instance, the psychological impact of factors such as time pressure, uncertainty, and tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Crego, 2012</xref>) is often manipulated in studies exploring NDM. It is worth noting that because of the fundamental nature of simulations as replications of real-world settings, psychological fidelity is somewhat limited insofar as “real” risk to decision makers is not apparent; thus, participant behavior may be similar but not actually identical to that displayed in situ. It has been found that three crucially important factors can enhance psychological fidelity in real incident replications: complexity, dynamicity, and opaqueness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412468113">Brehmer &amp; Dorner, 1993</xref>) and are important to include when designing high-fidelity simulations.</p>
<p>First, complexity can be built into simulations by providing participants with a realistic large set of features or conflicting goals that they must consider to make decisions. This can create a sense of ambiguity and forces participants to make a conscious effort to engage with situation assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1555343412468113">Klein &amp; Klinger, 1991</xref>). Dynamicity can be built into simulation exercises via “feeds” or “injects” that offer participants judgmental choices where the consequence of choosing an option translates into either better or worse decisions, rather than right or wrong answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1555343412468113">Rittel &amp; Webber, 1973</xref>). The consequences of these better or worse decisions can occur in subsequent “information feeds,” enhancing the sense of gravity and personal accountability of the decision maker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). Third, opaqueness can be achieved by ensuring that elements of information remain inaccessible to participants. This creates psychological fidelity as participants must rely on their previous experiences to make inferences or develop hypotheses as they would in real life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412468113">Brehmer &amp; Dorner, 1993</xref>). Incorporating these three elements ensures that simulation exercises replicate the characteristics of naturalistic environments, such as time pressure, uncertainty, and tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412468113">Borodzicz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412468113">Orasanu &amp; Connolly, 1993</xref>), which are reflective of real-world decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Crego, 2012</xref>). Consequently, researchers may examine participants’ perceptions, cognitions, and emotional responses that are reflective of those that occur in real crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412468113">Cottam &amp; Preston, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Closely related to psychological fidelity is a participant’s sense of immersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). The concept of immersion is broadly defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment when one is physically situated in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1555343412468113">Witmer &amp; Singer, 1998</xref>). Immersion is crucial to NDM research as it reflects participants being involved, absorbed, engaged, and engrossed in the task at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1555343412468113">Lombard &amp; Ditton, 1997</xref>). This is important for SBT research as it makes the experience extremely stimulating. It has been found that highly immersive simulated environments can induce a high level of focus in participants that goes as far as to obliterate awareness of the “real” external world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1555343412468113">Murray, 1997</xref>). Participants often treat the exercise as if it were a real operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412468113">Crego, 1996</xref>). Developing a simulated environment that encourages participants to immerse themselves (both cognitively and socially) as they would in a real incident therefore increases the validity of the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1555343412468113">Witmer &amp; Singer, 1998</xref>). Theories and models formed on the basis of immersive simulation data will be representative of, and generalizable to, behavior in realistic NDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412468113">Lipshitz, 2010</xref>). Therefore, for SBT methods to be effectively utilized for research, they must provide both a realistic training experience and an ecologically valid application to real-world decision making by being designed to induce both high-fidelity and subjective feelings of immersion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1555343412468113">
<title>Measuring Social and Cognitive Processes</title>
<p>When simulation exercises are designed with high fidelity and immersion, they provide the researchers with the opportunity to identify the social and cognitive processes that are associated with both optimal and detrimental critical incident management. SBT in research has produced a shift in the focus of analysis of decision making from <italic>what</italic> decision makers do to <italic>how</italic> they reach those choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1555343412468113">Reason, 2008</xref>). Specifically, the simulation research that has been carried out in high-risk industries such as aviation, the military, and policing has produced an understanding of the importance of exogenous, “nontechnical skills” that are crucial for maintaining safety, but not directly related to technical expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1555343412468113">Reader, Flin, Lauche, &amp; Cuthbertson, 2006</xref>). SBT methods allow for a thorough exploration of exogenous social and cognitive <italic>processes</italic> utilized during critical incident decision making through analyzing nontechnical skills. Nontechnical skills can be related to social needs, such as leadership, mutual trust in teamwork, coordination, and shared mental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412468113">Cesna &amp; Mosier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008b</xref>), as well as cognitive requirements such as the ability to process, manage, and update situation awareness to improve decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412468113">Flin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1555343412468113">Salas &amp; Cannon-Bowers, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In assessing nontechnical skills, behavioral marker systems have been developed in areas such as aviation with crew resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412468113">Flin et al., 2003</xref>) and medicine with anesthetists’ nontechnical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412468113">Flin, Patey, Glavin, &amp; Maran, 2010</xref>) to assess an individual’s competencies as well as to systematically examine the cause of ineffective performance and errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1555343412468113">Reason, 2000</xref>). This not only extends understanding of adaptive cognitive processes but also can provide individual, tailored corrective feedback to assist the training of decision makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1555343412468113">Reader et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the use of SBT for researching high-risk, high-stakes, and critical decision domains can be used to generate endogenous domain-specific conclusions with regard to how individuals cognitively process their domain and also exogenous general models for how teams interact in critical incident decision making.</p>

<title>Step 3: Potential Weaknesses of Using Simulation Data for Research Purposes</title>
<p>Although SBT for research has many advantages when designed with an awareness of the importance for expertise, fidelity and immersion, and social and cognitive processes, any researcher wishing to utilize SBT methods should also be aware of the potential weaknesses of this approach. These weaknesses are based on two main factors: the intricate complexity on outcome measures and the need for scientific rigor. By taking an approach to data collection and interpretation that incorporates defenses against <italic>known</italic> threats to validity, such limitations can be overcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412468113">Lipshitz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section9-1555343412468113">
<title>Intricate Complexity and Outcome Measures</title>
<p>If simulations serve the purpose of replicating real-life scenarios, then performance within those exercises should be as complex as in the real world. Often the data collected from SBT for research involves prompting participants to enter electronically recorded decision logs to monitor decisions and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison &amp; Crego, 2008</xref>). This method provides a composite outcome measure that reflects the result of many dynamic and complex decision processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008a</xref>). Such performance data are useful but limited as it is difficult to examine the process for how a team reached an outcome by observing that outcome alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412468113">Lipshitz, 2010</xref>). Information about intrateam processes such as communication, coordination, and dissent is necessary to create a complete picture of team decision making in these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412468113">Flin et al., 2008</xref>). The observation of decisive behavior may provide interesting indicators of underlying processing; however, such observations are not sufficiently robust enough to capture the amalgamation of social and cognitive factors involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>A potential way to overcome the drawbacks of observation is by utilizing technology. Videotaping the SBT event and subsequently coding and analyzing each individual participant’s behavior after the event allow for a deeper insight of the complex interactions between individuals during decision making. This means that any potentially interesting observations are not lost in the complexity of the situation and can be revisited for further analysis as research develops. Videotaping has been found to be a useful method for observational data when researching complex simulated research designs such as the critical incident decision making during police hostage negotiation training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Power, 2012</xref>). In addition, structured observation protocols may improve the reliability of observed data by allowing the opportunity for different researchers to assess the exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008a</xref>). Videotaping and subsequent interrater coding allow for a more thorough and accurate analysis of interactive team decision-making processes, despite the complexity of the environment from which they are drawn.</p>

<title>Scientific Rigor</title>
<p>Quantitative researchers often assume that scientific rigor in qualitative research is poor because of problems associated with confounding variables, reduced experimental control, and nonstatistical conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412468113">Chiovitti &amp; Piran, 2003</xref>). Qualitative data often utilize research methods that are rich in information to study phenomena in-depth, yet this often results in limited sample sizes and a mass of descriptive, nonstatistical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412468113">Chiovitti &amp; Piran, 2003</xref>). Despite these criticisms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412468113">Lipshitz (2010)</xref> argues that the consideration of rigor is irrelevant for methods engaged for naturalistic, qualitative research. Although quantitative approaches strive to achieve <italic>technical rigor</italic> through the strict application of prescribed methods and statistical rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412468113">Allende, 2004</xref>), qualitative studies are strengthened by <italic>substantive significance</italic>, which pertains to the adaptive selection and application of appropriate methodologies to ensure findings have a firm basis in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412468113">Lipshitz, 2010</xref>). In this respect, substantive significance supersedes technical rigor as it is closely related to real-world validity (i.e., general findings are valid in naturalistic settings). Technical rigor pertains only to applications and therefore relates to reliability (i.e., discrete findings are predictive in the experimental context). Therefore, if SBT research is designed with substantive significance in mind, then issues pertaining to scientific rigor may be overcome.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412468113">Lipshitz (2010)</xref> suggested that naturalistic studies can overcome criticisms relating to scientific rigor by maintaining four operational components: objectivity, reproducibility, plausibility, and generalizability. Objectivity is important for ensuring conclusions are not biased, and so establishing interrater reliability of the collected data (e.g., multiple raters coding the same decision logs) may enhance objectivity. Furthermore, the utilization of subject-matter experts to produce “gold standards” of decision making can be useful in increasing the objective evaluation of decision effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Crego, 2012</xref>). As simulation training exercises are often used repeatedly for training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>), this means that SBT for research inherently supports the operational component of reproducibility to be consistently applied. Plausibility can also be supported by engaging with established abductive reasoning methods such as generating key themes and hypotheses from the thematic analysis of decision logs (“bottom-up” searching from the data to provide the “best explanation” of findings) and also applying established theory in “top-down” coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412468113">Buchler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412468113">Chi, Feltovich, &amp; Glaser, 1981</xref>). The generalizability of SBT data may be criticized because of the specificity of the training event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412468113">Lane &amp; Meissner, 2008</xref>). However, exercises are often designed to measure comparatively standard tasks common to all real-life events and so can translate to other incidents. For example, police decision-making research includes the priorities of preserving life, declaring the operation a critical incident, securing forensic evidence, identifying victims, and identifying suspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412468113">Association of Chief Police Officers [ACPO], 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Step 4: Two SBT Designs for Researching Critical Incident Decision Making</title>
<p>This article has so far evaluated the great benefits, along with the potential pitfalls, associated with utilizing SBT methods for research and provided recommendations for their useful application. There are several forms of SBT design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412468113">Farmer, van Rooij, Reimersma, Jorna, &amp; Moraal, 1999</xref>, for a review), but this article now specifically focuses on those that support complex and dynamic decision making. Broadly, there are two interrelated designs that are amenable to research conducted within simulated high-stakes environments: (a) microworld simulations and (b) ISLEs.</p>
<sec id="section12-1555343412468113">
<title>Microworlds</title>
<p>Microworld simulations have been developed and utilized all over the world in countries such as Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412468113">Brehmer, 1990</xref>), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412468113">Dorner, Kreuzig, Reither, &amp; Straudel, 1983</xref>), and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412468113">Brehmer, Leplat, &amp; Rasmussen, 1991</xref>). They traditionally involve complex, computer-driven, behavioral simulations to study dynamic decision making skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412468113">Brehmer &amp; Dorner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412468113">Brehmer et al., 1991</xref>) and complex problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412468113">Dorner &amp; Scholkopf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412468113">Funke, 1991</xref>). Dynamic decision-making skills are associated with effective decisions in environments that are interconnected, constrained by previous actions, adaptive, and time bounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412468113">Brehmer, 1992</xref>). Similarly, complex problem-solving skills are associated with decision making in environments characterized by lack of transparency (only some variables are directly observable), polytely (multiple goals), complexity (difficulties because of situational demands), interconnectedness (changes in one variable affect another), dynamics (need timely response), and time delayed effects (delayed consequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412468113">Funke, 1991</xref>). Microworlds have been used to examine critical decision making by placing participants in an interactive environment whereby their decisions influence the current and future situation, allowing for a realistic measurement of decision making as it would be in a naturalistic dynamic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412468113">Christoffersen, Hunter, &amp; Vicente, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555343412468113">Funke, 1988</xref>). Although some studies have applied microworlds to team-based situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412468113">Bolton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1555343412468113">Johansson, Persson, Granlund, &amp; Mattsson, 2003</xref>), the focus of such studies tends to remain on the individual decision making of each participant. Microworlds tend not to focus on the shared mental models and reciprocal cognition of critical incident decision-making teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412468113">Gonzalez, Vanyukov, &amp; Martin, 2005</xref>). Instead, as the name suggests, they are useful for exploring how decision makers react within an isolated decision-making arena by responding to task-related, situation-specific decision problems within a microscopic world.</p>
<p>As critical incidents are defined by high-risk, high-stakes, and uncertain characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison &amp; Crego, 2008</xref>), it may be possible to apply microworld methods for studying dynamic decision making and complex problem-solving skills. However, a key element in critical incident decision making is the interdisciplinary nature of the team interaction that produces tactical and strategic decisions over time. Critical incidents involve a multitude of independent teams from diverse organizations operating collectively, and so successful decision making is dependent not only on endogenous, situation-specific training of individuals, but also on the interconnected exogenous factors associated with interteam coordination and strategic response. As outlined above, critical incidents such as the BP oil spill are exacerbated by both endogenous, situation-specific features (such as the ability to prevent the spread of oil) and exogenous, interactive influences associated with the strategic response to the situation. Therefore, although microworlds may be useful in training specific endogenous reactions of individuals and teams to a <italic>specific</italic> critical incident, ISLEs are more appropriate for researching and training more <italic>general</italic>, strategic, non-task-specific, exogenous decisions.</p>

<title>Immersive Simulated Learning Environments</title>
<p>Simulation-based work within the NDM paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412468113">Klein &amp; Woods, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1555343412468113">Lipshitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412468113">Orasanu &amp; Connolly, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1555343412468113">Roth, Woods, &amp; Pople, 1992</xref>) explores complex, multiteam, multiagency events with short- <italic>and</italic> long-term consequences. As such, the notion of expertise and the inherent complexities derived from macrocognitive issues to do with context, teams, and interpersonal communication are defining properties of the decision making environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1555343412468113">Rouse, Cannon-Bowers, &amp; Salas, 1992</xref>). NDM research highlights the importance of the context-specific declarative and procedural knowledge based around the central tenet of situation assessment, a mental construction of a situation based on environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412468113">Endsley, 1995</xref>) while also taking into account the conditional basis of appropriate decision making depending on the complex context within which the “problem is to be solved.” Experienced decision makers are open and receptive to dynamic changes in both relevant and redundant cues and are able to process information quickly, monitor and detect inconsistencies, and resolve those inconsistencies. Cognitive representations, schemata, and narratives help decision makers to choose between options and competing goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412468113">Alison, Barrett, &amp; Crego, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, NDM research can greatly benefit from utilizing SBT methodologies for the observation and testing of critical incident decision making (especially at strategic and tactical levels). The integral complexities important to the NDM paradigm can be input by the experimenter in the simulated decision environment, and responses can be recorded for training and analysis. However, whereas microworlds have been well utilized in the past for NDM in complex, situation-specific, endogenous environments, ISLEs provide a specific tool adapted for the training and research of exogenous, team-based decision making in naturalistic settings. The key characteristics of ISLEs include (a) the involvement of experts (in terms of construction, design, implementation, and participation), (b) recognizing the connectedness of the “problem” landscape (in terms of anticipation, prevention, mitigation, adaptation and coping), and (c) valuing immersion and psychological fidelity. ISLEs are not distinct from microworlds but extend the simulation to incorporate exogenous team-based complexities associated with non-task-specific critical incident decision making. As such, this tool can be valuable in broadening our understanding of critical incident decision making in interactive team-based settings. This article now presents a worked example of the ISLEs simulation tool named Hydra.</p>

<title>Step 5: A Practical Example of Hydra as an ISLE for Research (Operation Pandora)</title>
<p>Based on the central ethos of safe learning, the Hydra Immersive Simulation system was designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412468113">Crego (1996)</xref> as a unique high-fidelity training tool “that enables the monitoring of real-time leadership and decision-making in critical incidents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>, p. 40). Hydra simulations are not simply computerized scenarios but complex, multimodal, multidisciplinary events that illustrate the complexity, uncertainty, time pressure, and levels of stress that are characteristic of real-life critical incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412468113">Crego &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>). Hydra immersive learning has assisted in the decision making of fire officers, police officers, social care professionals, and the military and private sectors in the United Kingdom and internationally. The simulations are designed to focus on team dynamics and aim to re-create the internal uncertainties of critical incident management as well as external pressures of accountability through the inclusion of media, government engagement, and international consequences. Participants have to use both their technical knowledge and their leadership skills to negotiate, guide, and deliver on their objectives. Delegates have to weigh up potentially career limiting risk appraisal with the need to demonstrate their grip on the resolution of often intractable problems. Not only are the delegates tested, but the validity of existing workplace policies within the organizations they work for are also explored. Thus, Hydra simulations provide an example of an ISLE because of their focus on the training of individual, team, and organizational decisions relating to nontechnical, exogenous skills. Significantly, this system allows both trainers and researchers to observe complex decision-making processes under controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008a</xref>) and is applicable to a wide range of critical incident decision-making scenarios.</p>
<p>An example of a Hydra exercise is “Operation Pandora” (O’Hara, unpublished master’s thesis). This simulation was designed to test and train police officers by presenting competing incidents at various times throughout the scenario that officers had to respond to in real-time. Specifically, it involved a time-sensitive suicide investigation that arose alongside the management of a community-sensitive public demonstration. Operation Pandora developed from recommendations made in an internal review by Merseyside Police following disturbances in Liverpool and other major cities in the United Kingdom during 2011. Its objectives included demonstrating use of the national decision making model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412468113">ACPO, 2011</xref>), the roles of gold and silver command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412468113">ACPO, 2009</xref>), and developing officers’ abilities to manage a critical incident. The experts involved in developing the scenario were two senior police officers, one of whom acted as a silver commander during the disturbances in Liverpool in 2011. Another police officer, trained and experienced in setting up Hydra exercises, collaborated in the design. All delegates who took part were senior police officers at the inspector rank or higher.</p>
<sec id="section15-1555343412468113">
<title>Delivering a Hydra Exercise: Operation Pandora</title>
<p>Simulated events generally incorporate five phases: information, demonstration, practice, feedback, and remediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1555343412468113">Salas, Wilson, Burke, &amp; Priest, 2006</xref>). A Hydra exercise also follows these five phases: initial briefing, instruction session, syndicate sessions, plenary sessions, and a postexercise debrief (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412468113">Figure 1</xref>). The following section discusses Operation Pandora as a Hydra exercise.</p>

</fig>
<sec id="section16-1555343412468113">
<title>Initial briefing</title>
<p>At the start of a Hydra exercise, the facilitator established a set of “rules of engagement” for the participants. For Operation Pandora, participants were informed that they were required to carry out “weekend duty superintendent cover for Liverpool north.” Syndicate teams consisted of two or three delegates, with each person in the team taking a turn as the authoritative “silver commander” during the scenario, which is an established senior command position in U.K. police practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412468113">ACPO, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1555343412468113">
<title>Syndicate Sessions</title>
<p>Following the initial briefing, the facilitator demonstrated how the Hydra system would work during each syndicate session. A Hydra simulation is made up of a number of syndicate sessions, which are the points during the simulation where delegates are placed in the syndicate room and are engaged with the simulated event as they would be in the real world. Syndicate rooms are fitted with pan and tilt cameras that allow for monitoring and recording of the teams’ behavior as the scenario evolves. Audio and video links connect the syndicate and control rooms using closed-circuit television (CCTV) and microphones. These are inconspicuously placed to minimize “performance” and maintain immersion. Monitoring the teams as they work is beneficial to the researchers and exercise facilitator as it informs them of the process by which decisions were reached by a team, as well as identifying appropriate moments to freeze an incident and implement a plenary feedback session.</p>
<p>Syndicate rooms are also fitted with a telephone, fax machine, and television to receive incoming information feeds as the scenario unfolds. Information feeds can vary in their presentation, from paper formats, such as preconstructed maps, demographic profiles of fictitious cities, crime statistics, and charts of available staff and other resources to video files for simulated news or media broadcasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412468113">Figure 2</xref>). Rooms also have an appointed “loggist” who is usually someone in an administrative position within the respective agency and is tasked (after a 20-minute training period) with recording the decisions and communications made by the decision-making team members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412468113">Figure 3</xref>). Delegates must approve decisions and requests for information before they are officially “committed” and sent to the exercise control room (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1555343412468113">Figure 4</xref>). This two-way information flow between syndicate and control rooms allows for interactive decision-making consequences, thereby ensuring dynamicity of the exercise and increasing a sense of responsibility and accountability for decisions. Pandora had multiple syndicate rooms operating at once, which is a further benefit of Hydra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1555343412468113">Figure 5</xref>). Syndicate rooms could not communicate with one another, but it allowed for multiple teams to undergo the exercise simultaneously. Training multiple teams at the same time enriches the subsequent plenary sessions as the likelihood of alternative decision-making and problem-solving tactics is increased.</p>

<p>The unfolding information feeds in the Operation Pandora simulation were presented to the delegates at prearranged points according to a scripted timeline. The initial information feeds were presented in quick succession. The Pandora simulation required decision makers to respond to and manage a planned demonstration and also deal with a suicide. Information feeds consisted of (a) an audio file (simulated phone call) relaying initial information about the planned demonstration, (b) a “seized” pamphlet from a preceding protest event, (c) a written background report on a person of interest “Kamran Ahmed,” and (d) a written feed giving details of a confidential informant “Kumar” (an acquaintance of Ahmed). Although information feeds were already prepared, the pace and quantity of information delivered were dictated by the team’s decisions and actions. The information feeds during Pandora introduced a key decision event: the apparent suicide of Ahmed’s daughter, alongside developing information from the planned demonstration (possible counterdemonstration by English Defense League activists). The key decision at this point was whether and how to inform Ahmed of the death while protecting the informant Kumar. Concomitant consideration was necessary in the overall management of the demonstration and was further compounded by the unknown role of Ahmed (as potential suspect, witness, or innocent grieving father) in his daughter’s suicide. This reflected the complex and opaque nature of a developing critical incident.</p>
<p>Additional feeds were available if requested by teams; for example, one team requested the assistance of an Asian community mediator who then became involved in the investigation. The decided-on actions following these information feeds can vary from “slow-burn” tasks, such as the analysis of witness statements, to “fast-burn” tasks, such as the active chase of a suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412468113">Crego &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>). An example “fast-burn” task in Pandora involved informing Ahmed of his daughter’s suicide before he returned home, which aligned with the standard “golden hour” principle for responding to suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412468113">ACPO, 2007</xref>). To ensure that delegates were immersed, time was compressed during the simulation so that events that would usually take place over several days were experienced within a shorter time frame. Time was also frozen at both a priori and iterative points in the simulation to discuss recent decision-making developments. This allowed delegates to examine the critical facets of the fast-paced scenario and optimized learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412468113">Crego &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>). However, as these manipulations of time can confuse or frustrate participants and reduce the associated psychological immersion, they were applied minimally with additional cues to maintain the participants’ perception of simulation time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1555343412468113">
<title>Plenary Sessions</title>
<p>Syndicate sessions during Hydra simulations are usually interjected by three or four plenary sessions. Plenary sessions are moments within the training exercise where the scenario is frozen and all teams join together in one room to discuss the decisions that were made up until that point. These sessions create an environment in which exercise facilitators can provide guidance, information, analysis, and feedback regarding the expected learning outcomes and tasks they have dealt with thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1555343412468113">Salas et al., 2006</xref>), allowing for learning via reflective experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1555343412468113">Thiagarajan, 1993</xref>). During Pandora, a plenary session was interjected to discuss the considerations made by delegates when deciding whether and how to inform Ahmed of the apparent suicide of his daughter. Another plenary session discussed whether delegates had declared a “critical incident.” Facilitators also used these sessions to discuss crucial nontechnical skills and team behaviors, providing corrective feedback to aid subsequent decision making in the following syndicate sessions. Feedback has been found to be the most important feature of SBT methods, as it improves participants’ understanding of the impact of multiple organizational and psychological factors on their own and others’ behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412468113">Issenberg, McGaghie, Petrusa, Gordon, &amp; Scalese, 2005</xref>). Debriefing in these plenary sessions allowed participants to enter a reflective state and to absorb and transfer learning for use in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412468113">Crego, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1555343412468113">
<title>Debrief Session: The 10,000 Volts System</title>
<p>Learning from real-life critical incidents is different from learning from simulations. The process of developing best practice is dependent on both of these forms of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412468113">Crichton, Ramsay, &amp; Kelley, 2009</xref>). In line with this, Hydra sessions are followed up with a debrief session using the “10,000 Volts” (10KV) anonymous electronic focus group system. This was developed by Jonathan Crego, at the request of ACPO, to debrief police officers following real critical incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). Following Pandora, all delegates received a laptop computer on which they reflected on their decision making. All laptops were connected so that all comments made by all delegates were anonymously recorded and distributed to the other laptops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). Other individuals could then comment, question, or respond to these entries, thereby facilitating an engaging and detailed exposition of important points.</p>
<p>Because of its electronic nature, the 10KV system provides several distinct advantages over other focus groups. First, anonymity ensures that participants may comment freely, without fear of the consequences, ensuring that ideas are weighted on merit rather than source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1555343412468113">Nunamaker, Briggs, Mittelman, Vogel, &amp; Balthazard, 1996</xref>) and controversial topics can be more easily discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412468113">Clapper &amp; Massey, 1996</xref>). Anonymity has been found to reduce inhibitions in focus groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412468113">DeSanctis &amp; Gallupe, 1987</xref>) and fear of retribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412468113">Easton, Easton, &amp; Belch, 2003</xref>). The system also has the ability to recognize when one individual is dominating the discussion via anonymous electronic tagging. This allows the researcher to “hold back” comments when appropriate and avoid potentially skewed data (e.g., a facilitator may find multiple negative comments by one individual, thus identifying the absence of general group negativity). Comments entered into the system are also time coded, allowing the opportunity to conduct sequential analyses on the resulting data. Furthermore, in comparison to other focus group methods, the 10KV system has been found to induce more comments overall and encourage equal participation across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the 10KV system provides participants with the opportunity to identify potential causes of their decision-making error during the simulation, without fear of retribution or accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1555343412468113">Reason, 2008</xref>), and allows for a rapid collection of large quantities of data for research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Step 6: Analyzing the Data From Hydra</title>
<p>The complexity involved in analyzing team performance often makes the measurement of exogenous, non-task-specific incident management skills difficult. Yet Hydra provides an ISLE that aids realistic and controlled insight into the nontechnical exogenous skills required to manage critical incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is important that the data collected from Hydra training events are analyzed appropriately. This article now provides recommendations to ensure that researchers generate robust, rigorous, and fruitful conclusions on the data collected during a Hydra event.</p>
<sec id="section21-1555343412468113">
<title>Observations</title>
<p>The researcher responsible for analyzing simulation data must be present when the exercise is being delivered. Focusing on observable behaviors “in action” has been termed as a “best practice” skill for analyzing performance in simulation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008b</xref>). The use of unobtrusive CCTV and microphones in the Hydra system provides a stable environment that allows observations to be made in the control room. Observations in simulated environments have been found to constitute a sound technique for creating performance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1555343412468113">Reader et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, structured observations around identified behavioral markers (e.g., decision logs) have been found to be useful for assessing nontechnical skills, as well as for identifying commonly occurring errors that may, at a later stage, be directly associated with outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412468113">Flin et al., 2008</xref>). During the Pandora exercise, facilitators observed nonverbal and informal dynamics within the teams during the exercise (e.g., offhand comments and reactions that were not recorded in decision logs). This created a more holistic understanding of the processes leading up to the subsequently logged decisions (e.g., whether decisions were the result of democratic agreement or autocratic dominance). In addition, as Pandora involved multiple syndicate groups engaged in the same exercise at the same time, it was possible for researchers to compare observed behavior between groups. This can aid plenary sessions as facilitators can compare and contrast the good and bad points from differing team dynamics (teamwork, trust, leadership, etc.) that lead up to the implementation of decisions in the decision log. This provides triangulated data, aiding the development of a robust theory of team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1555343412468113">
<title>Analyzing Decision Logs, Communication Logs, and Debriefs</title>
<p>Hydra is a versatile research tool because of the high quantity of data that are produced during a simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). For example, collective decision logs provide researchers with the opportunity to empirically analyze team decisions during critical incident management, whereas transcribed communication logs (i.e., verbal communications during scenario) provide insight into the interteam collaboration processes that led to these decisions. To optimize scientific rigor when building theoretical models of intra- and interteam processes in critical incident decision making, Hydra decision and communication log data should be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412468113">Chiovitti &amp; Piran, 2003</xref>). This mixed-methods approach is useful for combining theoretical psychological processes with statistically significant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1555343412468113">Schulenberg, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As simulated data attempt to reflect naturalistic settings, it is possible to use these data for theory and model building by utilizing qualitative bottom-up processing (e.g., thematic analysis), whereby logs are analyzed and coded and then worked forward into new or recognized theories of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1555343412468113">McLeod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1555343412468113">Reader et al., 2006</xref>). For example, one of the themes identified during Operation Pandora was “adherence to police policies,” as reflected by comments discussing the protocol for responding to a suicide investigation according to various governing bodies (e.g., European Commission for Human Rights). It is also possible to utilize qualitative top-down post hoc assessment in terms of searching for established cues in the logged or transcribed data that reflect known decision processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1555343412468113">Tesch, 1990</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, and Power (2012)</xref> explored transcribed hostage negotiator simulation data and found evidence for the RAWFS heuristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412468113">Lipshitz &amp; Strauss, 1997</xref>), as officers utilized decision-making techniques such as “reflection in action” to cope with uncertainty. Likewise, post hoc delegate questionnaires from Pandora facilitated top-down analysis by searching for decision cues influenced by existing theories on accountability, decision confidence, and team dynamics.</p>
<p>During such coding tasks it is important to ensure objectivity and rigor are maintained. These can be achieved by testing for interrater reliability, whereby multiple researchers code the data (i.e., decision and communication logs) and then compare findings to check for consistency. This provides objectivity to coded data by utilizing statistical techniques (e.g., Kappa values) to quantify the level of consistent qualitative coding. When elements of coding are inconsistent, investigators can work through these elements until they reach consensus. A further technique for enhancing rigor is utilizing subject-matter experts to provide an expert basis for decision accuracy by providing a “gold standard” for which types of decisions should be made and when delegates should be making them. This comparative approach, between the decisions made by teams during the training exercises and those of a set of recognized experts, has been previously utilized in police training events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1555343412468113">Stewart, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1555343412468113">Waring, Alison, Cunningham, and Whitfield (in press)</xref> utilized an expertly generated “gold standard” to examine the effects of accountability on motivation and advice quality in police decision making. This technique allows researchers to obtain a valid measure of decision making performance and has been useful for identifying the reasons why individuals may avoid decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Crego, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Following qualitative thematic coding, it is possible for the researcher to then convert the resulting coding schemes into numerical scores for quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1555343412468113">Hoc &amp; Amalberti, 2005</xref>). Coding schemes (i.e., when themes are coded into a dictionary guide that outlines the cues to look for in the transcribed data that reflect said theme) have been found to be effective tools for modeling cognitive activities in dynamic situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1555343412468113">Hoc &amp; Amalberti, 2005</xref>) and have been previously used police research such as quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1555343412468113">Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, by objectively outlining themes, it is possible to carry out quantitative analysis. Decision log data, for example, can be analyzed using a variety of sequential analyses, such as time series and lag sequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412468113">Brillinger, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1555343412468113">Sackett, 1980</xref>), to capture, model, and compare chronological decision processes. Regression analyses may also be applied by, for example, regressing the frequency of certain codes against “gold standard” derived quality of decision outcome. Furthermore, it may be possible to utilize techniques such as social network analysis to quantify the effects of contact and communication within teams on decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412468113">Knoke &amp; Yang, 2008</xref>). However, it is important that quantitative results from simulated data are supplemented by the use of qualitative participant quotes to ensure that the unique complexity and richness that are characteristic of Hydra are not lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412468113">Chiovitti &amp; Piran, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A final strength of Hydra as an ISLE for research is that findings not only aid psychological theory but also can be utilized pragmatically to tackle highly specified problems within practitioner domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412468113">Eyre et al., 2008</xref>). A recent Hydra exercise was utilized to explore the reasons why counterterrorist officers derailed their decision making away from “save life” to “save self” motivations and provided recommendations for how practitioners might overcome this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412468113">van den Heuvel, Alison, &amp; Crego, 2012</xref>). Hydra ISLEs are beneficial for practitioners as they provide the opportunity to identify best practice in decision making along with assessing training needs for tailoring training exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412468113">Rosen et al., 2008a</xref>). Measures of individual differences can add further depth to understanding behavioral observations. For instance, delegates involved in Operation Pandora completed a questionnaire that included the examination of demographic (e.g., rank) and experience (e.g., of taking lead role in critical incident/major crime management) differences. This was to explore whether individual differences may moderate decision making outcomes, such as decisions regarding whether to inform Ahmed and, if so, how they would choose to do this.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>SBT methodologies for research have traditionally been criticized for their lack of scientific rigor, reliability, and validity. This article has provided a useful example for how SBT events may be tailored to aid empirical research. Microworlds have traditionally been used to explore endogenous, domain-specific decision making predominantly in individuals. However, critical incident decision making is dependent on the ability for managers to respond to the situation by utilizing non-task-specific, exogenous, team-based skills. ISLEs extend microworld simulations by focusing on these non-task-specific skills, and this article has presented Hydra as an example of this technique. ISLEs provide a methodological arena in which one can (a) approximate “real-life” research through using high-fidelity and immersive exercises, (b) maximize the strengths of both in vitro laboratory and in vivo field research, and (c) focus on the nontechnical social and cognitive processes needed for effective critical incident management within teams, across agencies, and within communities. Data collected within such simulations are dense, richly textured, and contextualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412468113">Alison &amp; Crego, 2008</xref>) and have been successfully applied to police research (e.g., Operation Pandora). Findings not only provide practical recommendations for delegates involved, but also can add to or extend existing psychological theories on decision making. Therefore, ISLEs can be used for research purposes and can be a fruitful method to gain a greater understanding of the complex social and cognitive processes that occur when teams need to make decisions in real-life uncertain, dynamic, and extreme situations.</p>
