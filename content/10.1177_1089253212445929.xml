<p>Peripheral vascular trauma is not uncommon in the civilian setting, and can be uniquely challenging because of the limited time during which intervention can salvage an ischemic extremity. Injuries can be from a blunt or penetrating mechanism, and these injuries can be isolated or in the setting of a complex multi-system trauma. The intent of this review is to discuss the perioperative management of peripheral vascular trauma with an emphasis of predicting, preventing and managing common post-operative complications.</p>
<sec id="section1-1089253212445929">
<title>Preoperative Evaluation</title>
<p>As with any trauma patient, it is recommended that the initial evaluation be systematic and thorough, in accordance with American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. The priorities are immediately life-threatening or debilitating injuries followed by less critical injuries. Life comes before limb, and thus at times, peripheral vascular trauma and its repair are not the first priority. At times, applications of tourniquets, ligation of major vessels, and/or early amputation of the extremity are indicated. For the sake of this review, we will focus on the otherwise stable patient with a suspected or known vascular injury and the management of specific complications postoperatively from the perspective of the intensivist.</p>
<p>Risk factors for peripheral vascular injury include major fractures or dislocations in blunt trauma or any penetrating injury, particularly with high energy missiles. As with any patient, the diagnosis starts with a good history and physical exam. In the multiply injured, obtunded trauma patient, the history is difficult, but one of the most critical pieces of history to obtain in reference to arterial injury is the time of injury or how long without perfusion. The importance of this is that ischemic time is one of the major predictors of functional outcome, and this can be weighed against other life-threatening issues when the decision to embark on a complex vascular repair is entertained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253212445929">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212445929">2</xref></sup> Also, any previous vascular disease would be beneficial to know but cannot always be obtained.</p>
<p>The physical exam should include the full patient. The physical evaluation of the extremities for evidence of perfusion is still critically important and is the first step in the exam for vascular trauma. Lack of palpable pulses in the stable, healthy patient warrants rapid evaluation to determine the site or sites of injury. Fractured extremities should be reduced and splinted and the pulses reassessed. Although vasospasm from direct injury or shock can result in diminished pulses, it is prudent to proceed as though this represents an injury in need of rapid correction. The physical exam should include a full preoperative neurological exam of the injured extremity if possible. A good preoperative neurological exam can be helpful for comparison postoperatively. However, vascular perfusion should be ensured before attributing weakness, paralysis, or parethesias to a nerve or muscular injury because ischemia is a major cause of neuromuscular dysfunction. As to the vascular physical exam, traditionally hard and soft signs of vascular trauma have been taught. The hard signs of vascular injury are pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, obvious thrill/bruit and evidence of ischemia. Evidence of ischemia is commonly listed as “The 6 ‘Ps”: <italic>p</italic>allor, <italic>p</italic>aresthesia, <italic>p</italic>aralysis, <italic>p</italic>ain, <italic>p</italic>ulselessness, <italic>p</italic>oikilothermia. Hard signs usually indicate definite vascular trauma and require further evaluation or operative exploration and repair (more often with penetrating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445929">3</xref></sup> than blunt injuries). However, so called soft signs are poor predictors and have largely fallen out of favor. In lieu of “soft” signs, the suspected vascular injury should be further assessed with the arterial pressure index (API) as an adjunct to the physical exam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212445929">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212445929"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212445929">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To obtain an API, a handheld Doppler and a manual blood pressure cuff are required. The systolic blood pressure distal to the suspected injury is obtained with the aid of the Doppler signal and compared with the uninjured contralateral artery as well as the other 2 extremities. The pressure in the lower extremities should be the same or a bit higher than the upper extremities, so a normal arterial pressure index (also can be called the ankle -brachial index) is 1. One article demonstrated that compared with arteriography, an API less than 0.90 had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 97% for arterial disruption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212445929">4</xref></sup> In another smaller series, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of an API lower than 0.90 were 100%, whereas the negative predictive value of an API that reached 0.90 or higher was 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212445929">5</xref></sup> Thus, if the pulse is normal and the ratio between these 2 systolic blood pressures is &gt;0.9, the likelihood of vascular injury is very low, and no further workup is needed. However, if the ratio of these systolic pressures is &lt;0.9, then rapid further evaluation is indicated to rule out an acute traumatic vascular injury</p>
<p>Historically, formal arteriography was recommended. However, computed tomography (CT) technology has improved and CT angiography (CTA) has been shown to be as effective at ruling out vascular injury and is the preferred initial choice for arteriographic evaluation. CT can also give more information about surrounding trauma. It has been reported that CTA has a sensitivity of 90% to 95% and a specificity of 98% to 100% for arterial injury in the extremities after trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212445929">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253212445929"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212445929"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212445929">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intraoperative management is outside the scope of this review. The decision tree for intraoperative management of the injury is complex and involves the hemodynamic and metabolic status of the patient, associated long bone fractures, associated soft tissue injury, primary repair versus interposition, choice of conduit, venous repair or ligation, timing, and need of fasciotomies and ischemia reperfusion issues among many other factors. For this review, we continue with the postoperative management of the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1089253212445929">
<title>Postoperative Management</title>
<p>Postoperatively, most peripheral vascular patients should be admitted to a unit where the patient can have at minimum, evaluation and/or intervention every hour. Especially in the first 24 to 48 hours, hourly neurovascular checks are beneficial for identifying problems and complications while there still may be time to intervene. The extremity should initially be elevated to assist in reducing edema formation. This is especially true if a major vein has been ligated. Venous congestion can produce tissue edema to the extent that tissue pressures exceed capillary pressures; in this scenario, capillary flow is reduced to zero even though an arterial pulse may be present. Different compartments within an extremity may be variably affected by this phenomenon. Venous congestion can be a substantial contributor to compartment syndrome, which is discussed below. Thus, judicious use of fluids, elevation of the extremity above the right atrium, and some form of wrap/compression may be useful in limiting edema. When using some form of compression, arterial pressure should not be exceeded. Those who are at the bedside should evaluate and document the status of the extremity on arrival to better evaluate any change should it occur. Clear communication between the operative team and the intensive care unit team about the operative course and clinical expectations is paramount to clearly prepare for and identify any possible complications.</p>
<p>One complicating factor in the multiply injured patient is that there will be other ongoing challenges, and the extremity may not take top priority during resuscitation. Also, in the sedated and intubated patient, relying solely on the patient’s exam may miss various potential complications. Thus, a high index of suspicion is necessary to have a chance of diagnosing problems while there is still hope for preventing any long-term disability. In relation to the vascular injury, initial priorities are to follow the pulse/Doppler exam for changes, evaluate for compartment syndrome, follow for any signs of hemorrhage, and evaluate for any evidence of rhabdomyolysis or reperfusion electrolyte disturbances. Each of these will be discussed further below. After the initial stabilization and initial postoperative period, other issues become more prominent such as infections, wound breakdown, mobility, longer term antithrombosis, and rehabilitation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1089253212445929">
<title>Neurovascular Monitoring</title>
<p>In the initial postoperative period, neurovascular checks of the injured extremity are necessary. The sooner a loss of a pulse or Doppler signal is identified, the sooner it can and should be addressed. A pulse is the best postoperative evidence of flow and is the normal state, especially if the patient had pulses preoperatively. If there is no pulse, a Doppler signal is the next best thing. That being said, a Doppler signal is considered more objective by most as it is more easily reproducible, and the examiner’s pulse cannot be mistaken for the Doppler signal. Traditionally, there are 3 levels of Doppler signals that are described—monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic. Triphasic is the best, “most normal” Doppler signal, followed by biphasic down to monophasic. However, exactly how the various signals have been described and what they signify has varied as was recently demonstrated in a review calling for a more clear definition of the terms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212445929">11</xref></sup> What is important is that the signal the patient first arrived with in the intensive care unit should at least be what he or she has on subsequent evaluations. For example, a monophasic signal may gradually become a triphasic signal, and this would be considered encouraging. However, a clear triphasic signal that is now barely monophasic likely represents impending loss of flow. Any change in the signal/pulse should be compared against evidence of perfusion to the supplied extremity. Capillary refill, warmth, and color, for example, should all be evaluated and documented. Loss of a pulse or signal, representing loss of flow, in the first 48 hours is typically related to a technical issue with the anastomosis or related to suboptimal inflow or outflow. Almost all of these early failures need to be addressed surgically to attempt to restore flow. Inflow issues could relate to a more proximal injury that was missed or the shock state and hypotension of the patient. An outflow issue could be related to residual thrombus distal to the repair that was not evacuated and is blocking appropriate egress from the repair. Outflow issues causing thrombosis also include increased distal compartment pressures or unidentified distal injuries. Perhaps more common, than these inflow and outflow issues however, is a technical issue with the repair itself. For example, the anastomosis is too narrow, the conduit size does not match the native vessels, there is too much tension on the anastomosis, or there is an intimal flap. In any event, the most common management of an acute loss of pulse or signal after vascular repair is to return to the operating room for exploration and likely revision. There is the possibility of arterial spasm causing the loss of flow, but this is a diagnosis of exclusion. There is a surgical axiom that says, “Spasm is spelled C-L-O-T.”</p>
<p>In summary, a postoperative loss of pulse or signal should be considered a thrombus until proven otherwise. The decision to intervene for this thrombus depends on evidence of tissues ischemia and the overall status of the patient but should be emergently evaluated and a decision made so that an attempt at “re-revascularization” may be made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1089253212445929">
<title>Compartment Syndrome</title>
<p>One of the more common extremity trauma complications is compartment syndrome. This can occur in any extremity proximally or distally. Compartment syndrome is an increase in pressure against the fixed fascial or skeletal boundaries that compromises perfusions to the tissue within that compartment. It can be caused by a variety of injuries: crush injuries, large soft tissue injury with bony fractures, ischemia–reperfusion, and hemorrhage into a compartment among other less common causes.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of compartment syndrome relies primarily on a high index of suspicion and vigilant surveillance postinjury. If the patient is awake, surveillance can be facilitated by the patient’s ability to notify caregivers of pain or paresthesias. “Pain out of proportion to exam” has been seen as a potential sign of compartment syndrome. Numbness and tingling also may indicate compartment syndrome as sensory nerves are more susceptible to ischemia, and thus, they will exhibit dysfunction before motor loss occurs. Increased or severe pain with passive flexion of the appropriate joint also can indicate increased pressure in the affected compartment, for example, increased pain in the lower leg with passive flexion of the ankle. However, making the diagnosis more difficult, pain and paresthesias can be common in a patient with extremity trauma and potentially damaged nerves. On exam, the patient will have tense and tender involved compartments. No particular signs or symptoms are pathognomonic for compartment syndrome, but the overall clinical picture is most important. In the more confusing and difficult cases, measuring compartment pressures is a critical adjunct and is discussed below.</p>
<p>For the comatose patient, pain and paresthesias cannot be assessed. The tense compartments may be all that is appreciated and only if it is examined. Importantly, loss of pulses from compartment syndrome is an ominous sign as it occurs very late in the process and permanent nerve and/or muscle damage has likely already occurred. For the comatose patient, measuring the compartment pressures becomes a much more important diagnostic tool. It cannot be overemphasized however, that the diagnosis is primarily clinical in the appropriate setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212445929">12</xref></sup> There are various ways to measure the compartment pressures. There are proprietary devices manufactured for this purpose; however, a transducer and pressure tubing function just as well. At Denver Health, similar to the method described by Wilson et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212445929">13</xref></sup> we use a 16- or 18-gauge needle attached to pressure tubing and connected to the central venous pressure or arterial line pressure monitor. The needle is flushed and then zeroed at the level of the compartment of concern. After zeroing, the catheter is sterilely passed into the compartment and the pressure recorded. Of note, when measuring compartment pressures, all potentially involved compartments should be measured (eg, 4 in the lower leg, 3 in the thigh).</p>
<p>The absolute compartment pressure of concern is a matter of some debate. Some discuss absolute pressures above which fasciotomies should be performed, whereas others discuss pressures in reference to the patient’s diastolic or mean arterial pressure to calculate a perfusion pressure. Both side of the discussion have their merits, but it again should be emphasized that overall the diagnosis is clinical, and the numbers should not be the focus of the clinician as much as the overall picture. Various pressure thresholds have been advocated in the literature. Recent clinical guidelines from the <italic>Australia and New Zealand Journal of Surgery</italic> recommended that any pressure more than 30 or a pressure differential (diastolic pressure − compartment pressure) less than 30 be highly considered for surgical decompression but that the ultimate decision was not based solely on any numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212445929">12</xref></sup> Also using a side port needle instead of a standard needle has been advocated as being more accurate and, thus, if available may be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253212445929">14</xref></sup> No laboratory tests are particularly helpful in early compartment syndrome and, thus, are usually not considered part of the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Once the diagnosis of compartment syndrome has been made, efforts should be made to rapidly perform appropriate and complete fasciotomies to release the pressure in the affected compartments. Similar to the initial insult, the longer the ischemic time, the more likely there is to be long-term damage, especially to the nerves. The discussion of the surgical technique for decompression of each compartment of the upper and lower extremities is outside the scope of this review. To our knowledge, there are no effective nonsurgical treatments for compartment syndrome, and rapid surgical decompression should be sought. A reasonable aphorism in this setting is, “You will not regret doing a fasciotomy, but you will regret not doing one.” Tissue loss from compartment syndrome should be considered a preventable surgical disaster in the extremity at risk. If decompression is too late or the diagnosis is late, the neuromuscular components of the compartments are often lost and functional disability results. Initially the dead muscle can cause systemic issues as discussed below and may need debridement. Individual compartment debridement may be indicated, or in certain severe cases amputation may be necessary.</p>
<p>If decompression is done soon enough, then the long-term outcome of the extremity likely will have more to do with the remainder of the injury and vascular repair. Fasciotomy site closure should be done expeditiously but not immediately. The timing of the closure has not been studied to know the best time, but the principles are to close it as soon as the risk of repeat compartment syndrome is lower than the risk of leaving the wound open,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212445929">15</xref></sup> usually at least several days. Often, if there was significant compartment syndrome and wounds have to be left open for a while, skin grafts are required to obtain epithelialized closure of the wounds. Although it is not cosmetically appealing, this is better than a nonfunctional extremity from a potentially preventable complication. Of note, if the risk is high enough, many advocate prophylactic fasciotomies and this should be strongly considered in the high risk patient at the time of the initial surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1089253212445929">
<title>Rhabdomyolysis</title>
<p>Another complication of extremity trauma is rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome where toxins from necrotic muscle cells are released into the systemic circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212445929">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253212445929"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212445929">18</xref></sup> A dominant feature of the syndrome is renal toxicity from myoglobin. The pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis implies ischemia leading to necrosis of myocytes and then reperfusion that allows the circulation of the contents of the necrotic cells systemically. This can be in the setting of a repaired vascular injury but doesn’t have to be. Prolonged unconscious down time, crush injuries, and large soft tissue injuries with or without associated fractures are all risk factors for rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can be also be caused by many other causes outside of trauma such as infectious causes or toxins. The diagnosis is usually associated with elevated creatine kinase in the appropriate clinical setting and often dark urine, but the urinary changes are not required. If the patient is alert, he or she may complain of pain and or weakness; however, this is expected in the setting of trauma. Again, clinical suspicion plays a critical role after vascular trauma.</p>
<p>When suspected, serum creatine kinase (CK) levels should be obtained, and these are usually above 5 times normal with the diagnosis. Not uncommonly, they are in the 10 000 to 100 000 range. Again, however, absolute numbers are less important in the appropriate setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212445929">19</xref></sup> Myoglobin is released from the dead muscle as well as CK. The myoglobin released is excreted in the urine. This is why some recommend obtaining a urinalysis (UA) with microscopic evaluation. The UA will show positive for hemoglobin, but the red blood cell count will be zero or low, especially relative to the hemoglobin positivity. This is because the UA cannot distinguish the myoglobin from hemoglobin and thus reports positivity without a large number of red cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253212445929">20</xref></sup> In short, elevated serum CK levels in the appropriate clinic setting are usually diagnostic.</p>
<p>Treatment priorities in rhabdomyolysis involve managing acute electrolyte abnormalities, identifying and correcting the source of the rhabdomyolysis, and preventing renal toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212445929">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212445929">18</xref></sup> Elevated potassium concentration is the most concerning electrolyte disturbance that commonly occurs with rhadbomyolysis. This can be a direct result of the myocyte lysis and not only from the potential renal failure. Even without signs of renal dysfunction, chemistries should be checked and the electrolyte and metabolic disturbances treated accordingly. Identifying the source of the rhabdomyolysis and correcting it is the next priority. This is not necessarily difficult in isolated extremity trauma but can be more challenging in the multisystem trauma. In the case of vascular trauma and reperfusion, the source is likely distal to the injury. If compartments have not already been released, then compartment syndrome may have been missed, and this issue should be rapidly addressed. However, rhabdomyolysis can still occur after release of compartments as the muscle may have already died. Also, the possibility of incomplete fasciotomies should be considered even after they have been performed if no other clear source can be identified. In extreme and unfortunate circumstances, dead muscle must be debrided to protect the kidneys and prevent further damage from the rhabdomyolysis. Also, any offending medicines or drugs that may have caused the rhabdomyolysis should be eliminated. Simultaneously, while correcting electrolyte disturbances and controlling the source of the rhabdomyolysis, protecting the kidneys is a leading priority. Not all patients with rhabdomyolysis will develop renal failure, but each should be approached as if he or she will.</p>
<p>There have been various opinions on the best way to prevent renal toxicity, but current consensus appears to be that hydration is the most important factor. Some favor hydration with a bicarbonate drip to alkalinize the urine with or without diuresis, whereas others prefer to simply hydrate the patient to the point that he or she has adequate urine output. Alkalization of the urine with a bicarbonate infusion has the theoretical benefit of helping prevent cast formation and in the mitigation of the direct toxic effect of myoglobin to the kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212445929">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212445929">21</xref></sup> Others, however, have argued that adequate hydration with any crystalloid solution will effectively alkalinize the urine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253212445929">22</xref></sup> The generally agreed on therapy, however, is hydration. The goal is a urine output of around 2 mL/kg of body weight/h, which is usually around 100 to 200 mL urine per hour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253212445929">23</xref></sup> There have been no randomized trails showing benefit of alkalization of the urine. However, it is commonly practiced. Others have advocated diuretics to “flush” the kidneys with or without alkalization. Lasix and more popularly mannitol have been advocated. Using diuretics, in the usually hypovolemic trauma patient carries its own set of risks and should be considered carefully before use. Mannitol seems to be a popular choice. Its proposed benefits are that it is an osmotic diuretic, which pulls fluid in from the interstitium, as well as potentially a free radical scavenger. There is not clear, unequivocal evidence for or against the use of forced alkalinized diuresis. The current trend is that hydration to good urine output alone is the critically important treatment for preventing renal toxicity.</p>
<p>In summary, for rhadomyolysis, the keys are to a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and, when treating, to address immediate metabolic and electrolyte derangements, correct the source, and protect the kidneys with hydration to a urine output of around 2 mL/kg/h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1089253212445929">
<title>Infection</title>
<p>Another complication postoperatively that should be sought and aggressively treated after vascular repair is infection. Infection is not always preventable in the trauma scenario, especially with gross contamination and tissue destruction. It is wise to ensure that appropriate tetanus prophylaxis has been given. Although it would seem conceptually attractive to give longer courses of antimicrobials, the wound cannot be sterilized, and prolonged antibiotic exposure is likely to favor the growth of hospital-acquired, resistant organisms. Recent Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines for prophylactic antibiotics in open extremity trauma were published in the <italic>Journal of Trauma</italic>. Open fractures that also involved an arterial injury were considered high risk. The recommended course of antibiotics was to give the first dose as soon as possible after the trauma and to continue antibiotics for 72 hours if skin closure not possible or no longer than 24 hours after soft tissue closure of the wound. For these high-risk injuries, both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage should be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253212445929">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following closely for infection and treating it appropriately after peripheral vascular trauma can be beneficial in preventing vascular complications down the road. Also, it has been shown that soft tissue infections can increase the risk of late amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212445929">25</xref></sup> The specific details of managing vascular graft infections themselves are outside the scope of this review. However attempting to mitigate the risk factors for vascular graft infection is critical. There are many risk factors for graft infection that are unpreventable in the emergent, contaminated trauma situation, but attempts must be made. Risks for vascular graft infection include lower limb infection, seroma, hematoma, lymph leak, other surgical site infection, groin incision, bacteremia, and graft thrombosis among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253212445929">26</xref></sup> The specific graft complications of infection can involve anastomotic dehiscence with hemorrhage or in a delayed fashion pseudo aneurysms and graft failure. The signs of infection in these patients are not necessarily different from any other trauma patient. Fevers, pain, erythema, or drainage should all raise the suspicion for infection. In the workup for potential infection, early and frequent evaluation of the wounds should be used in addition to other standard investigations.</p>
<p>In the treatment of an infection, drainage and/or debridement of dead tissue should be considered early and antibiotics narrowed to culture results as soon as possible. Early signs of infection or known risk factors should be managed aggressively and judicious use of antibiotics should be used.</p>

<title>Antithrombotic Therapy</title>
<p>After a vascular repair, another question that often arises is the need for any antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy. Notably, this does not include venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, which should be initiated as soon as possible based on the overall injury pattern and status of the patient. This may or may not affect the patency of the vascular repair.</p>
<p>As to antiplatelet therapy, this is commonly prescribed after various vascular interventions and is felt to be more helpful in arterial interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212445929">27</xref></sup> For application in trauma, lessons are taken from surgery performed for chronic vascular disease and its interventions. There are often differences in these populations involving underlying comorbidities and indications for surgery that make comparisons less than perfect, but lessons can be learned. Antiplatelet therapy in the form of aspirin (acetylsalicyclic acid [ASA]) has been shown to benefit patients in terms of graft patency when it comes to infra-inguinal bypass for peripheral arterial disease. It has not been shown that the addition of clopidogral is better than ASA alone in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253212445929">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253212445929">29</xref></sup> The optimal timing of the ASA initiation is an area of debate. In the trauma patient, many will use ASA after peripheral arterial repair at least temporarily. When to start ASA in the trauma patient obviously depends on the patient’s other injuries and their bleeding status. The length of ASA therapy is variable and may depend more on follow-up and age than on other factors, but it should last at least 6 to 12 weeks to theoretically allow time for healing of the intima.</p>
<p>As to anticoagulation for bypass grafts, it has been shown to improve patency rates in infra-inguinal bypass for peripheral arterial disease, perhaps more so in high-risk grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1089253212445929">30</xref></sup> The extrapolation of this to the trauma repair does not seem to be as common. Also, it may initially be limited by the remainder of the patient’s condition. When there are venous injuries involved in a trauma patient, anticoagulation appears to be more commonly used. It has the theoretical benefit of prolonging the time until the venous repair fails and thus allowing for the development/dilation of venous collaterals. It appears to be prudent to start a repaired arterial vascular trauma patient on ASA, when the overall status of the patient allows, and to consider anticoagulation in these patients as well. When there is venous injury or combined arterial and venous injury, then both ASA and anticoagulation are more commonly prescribed.</p>

<sec id="section8-1089253212445929">
<title>Mobilization</title>
<p>When to resume full mobility in the peripheral vascular injury patient is often more dictated by the concomitant orthopedic injury and its weight-bearing status. The general rule is that the patient should begin physical therapy as soon as feasible and advance this therapy as tolerated. The extremity should be elevated when not in use or when out of bed to help with edema. Some would recommend that below knee repairs and certain upper extremity repairs not resume immediate activity, but this would relate to specific injuries and repair patterns and be dictated by the operative surgeons. Outside of a unique circumstance, mobility should be resumed as with any trauma patient, as soon as possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1089253212445929">
<title>Outcomes and Follow-up</title>
<p>Surveillance of the graft for late failures is usually outside the realm of the immediate postoperative course, but it should not be forgotten. Obtaining and documenting an ankle–brachial index or brachial–brachial index postoperatively will help with short-term and long-term comparisons. Follow-up should be arranged for ultrasound/duplex evaluation in regular intervals usually starting around 3 months.</p>
<p>There is obviously a range of injury when it comes to extremity trauma. Isolated vascular injuries caught early should have a high chance of a good long-term outcome. The other extreme is the severely mangled extremity. A recent article from the Western Trauma Association discusses in detail their proposed algorithm for managing the difficult mangled extremity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253212445929">31</xref></sup> Of note, there have been a variety of scoring systems published in the past to attempt to predict outcomes in the mangled extremity. These scoring systems use a variety of factors to predict outcome. The neurological function, bone and joint status, and soft tissue all play a major role in the long-term functional outcome of these injuries and not only the vascular status. These scoring systems are suboptimal for any one patient, no one system has been able to consistently predict outcome well enough to dictate management or amputation. Throughout the management of these complex injuries, the priorities may shift and the status of the patient will dictate various interventions, including amputation. When possible, including the patient and his or her family in the decision process will help the patient with the transition to his or her altered life with a partially functional or lost limb.</p>
<p>Outcomes after peripheral vascular trauma are assessed mainly in 2 ways, saving the limb itself and the function of the salvaged extremity. The first neither implies nor guarantees the second. It has been discussed that perhaps physicians are more optimistic than the long-term statistics report when it comes to long-term outcomes and return of function in regard to severely injured extremities. Long-term outcomes of major lower extremity trauma below the knee are often reported to be not that much different than amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253212445929">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253212445929">33</xref></sup> This obviously must be individualized to each injury and patient. Not surprisingly, the socioeconomic status and resources available to the patient have been reported to affect the long-term functional status of the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253212445929">34</xref></sup> Upper and lower extremity injuries have unique sets of issues that relate to the patient’s recovery. Amputation rates have been reported higher for blunt over penetrating injuries to the extremity, and an 18% amputation rate was reported in one recent review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1089253212445929">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1089253212445929">36</xref></sup> Mortality for blunt extremity injuries has also been reported to be higher than for penetrating injuries, with mortality rates of 5% to 10%.</p>
<p>In conclusion, peripheral vascular trauma is a common occurrence. Key components of optimal perioperative care of these patients are a thorough and full evaluation of the patient, a full initial postoperative assessment for ongoing comparison, and a high index of suspicion for common complications. Major postoperative complications include hemorrhage, thrombosis of the graft, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and infection. The course of many of these and other postoperative complications can be improved by an appropriate index of suspicion and timely, appropriate treatment.</p>
