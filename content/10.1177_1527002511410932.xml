<abstract>
<p>Most research on competitive balance (CB) in North American sport leagues examines regular-season outcomes only, and does not analyze the potential impacts of postseason playoff tournaments. This article finds that playoffs do matter in a CB sense, in that they can substantially reconfigure regular-season outcomes. More importantly, they may reconfigure outcomes in a way that is not neutral with respect to payroll. The article finds, for example, that in the NHL over the 1994-2004 time period, team success in the playoffs was much less dependent on payroll than it was during the regular-season. The article also analyzes the differential impacts of the specific type of playoff tournament employed, and finds that the choice of playoff “pooling” structures directly impacts the probability of “upsets” occurring in the playoffs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Competitive balance (CB) has been perhaps the most extensively studied topic in the sports economics literature over the past decade. The issue has been examined from many perspectives—for example, the manner in which it can be measured, the extent to which it varies across leagues and time, the degree to which it might matter to fans, and the means by which CB can be improved. The latter issue has spawned a related literature examining the relative merits of salary caps, revenue sharing, and luxury taxes. In fact, the literature on CB is now sufficiently vast that numerous review articles now exist that attempt to summarize and synthesize the literature to date, and to provide perspectives on possible directions for the future (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511410932">Fort, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002511410932">Sanderson &amp; Siegfried, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It is the argument of this article, however, that despite the vastness of the literature, it is incomplete in that it has focused almost exclusively on regular-season outcomes and has largely ignored the playoff seasons. For example, while authors like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511410932">Fort and Quirk (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511410932">Sanderson (2002)</xref> made observations as to the potential importance of playoffs to CB—noting, for example, that the introduction of playoffs reduces the likelihood that the best team will win the league championship—neither pursued the issue in any depth. And, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002511410932">Lee (2009)</xref> found that greater uncertainty as to which teams would make the playoffs increased regular-season attendance, he did not analyze the nature or impacts of the playoff tournaments themselves.</p>
<p>In a CB sense, playoff tournaments are important in that they potentially alter regular-season outcomes in systematic ways. Since regular-seasons tend to be relatively long (for example, 82 games in both the NBA and NHL), and are structured as play-against-the-field competitions, they should be relatively effective in revealing the true underlying quality of teams. To the extent, then, that team quality is positively related to team payroll, and, by extension, to market size, large-market teams should, all else equal, perform better than small-market teams during the regular-season.</p>
<p>Thus, the introduction of playoff systems should, by their very nature, favor small-market/lower quality teams at the expense of large-market/higher quality teams. In essence, playoffs give the former a “second-chance,” and, conversely, discount many of the regular-season successes of the large-market teams, effectively forcing these teams to “reprove” themselves. The value of this second chance is further enhanced by the fact that the nature of the competition now changes. The “play-against-the-field” structure of the regular-season is replaced in the playoffs by a shorter seeded-tournament structure, characterized by a series of head-to-head matches between the two teams in a knockout-style competition. The fact that these head-to-head matchups are short “sprints” relative to the “marathon” of the regular-season competition further increases the possibility that a lower quality team will eliminate a higher quality team.</p>
<p>It would seem clear that fans do, in fact, care greatly about the playoffs and do not view regular-season outcomes as the definitive measure of their team’s success. Fans are likely to forgive a team’s “mediocre” regular-season if that team goes on a playoff run that results in a championship. Conversely, teams that perform well during the regular-season but suffer an early exit from the playoffs are viewed by their fans as a disappointment. And yet, almost all research on CB examines regular-season outcomes only, and does not consider that these outcomes may be considerably reconfigured following the playoff tournament.</p>
<p>While all four major North American professional sports leagues employ playoff seasons, this article focuses on the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA). Each of these leagues have over 50% of their teams—16 out of 30—advance to the playoffs, a much higher proportion than either Major League Baseball (MLB) or the National Football League (NFL). Furthermore, the playoff tournaments in both the NHL and NBA are lengthy—consisting of four separate rounds of best-of-seven competitions—and add-on another 2 months to the 6-month long regular-seasons.</p>
<p>The article finds that playoffs do matter, in that they can substantially reconfigure regular-season outcomes. More importantly, it also finds, at least for the NHL, that playoffs reconfigure outcomes in a way that is not neutral with respect to payroll, and that team success in the playoffs is much less dependent on payroll than it is in the regular-season. The article also finds that the natural reconfiguring effect of playoffs can be further enhanced by the choice of playoff structure employed by a league.</p>

<sec id="section2-1527002511410932">
<title>Theoretical and Empirical Outcomes Under the “Conference-Based” Playoff Format</title>
<p>We begin the analysis by examining the expected and actual outcomes of the playoff format currently used by both the NHL and NBA. This format could be termed a “conference” system, in that the league divides itself into two conferences, with eight teams from each conference making the playoffs. The NHL has used this format since the 1993-1994 season, while the NBA has used it since 1983-1984. In essence, each conference conducts its own separate playoff tournament,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527002511410932">1</xref>
</sup> with the conference winners meeting for the league championship. In other words, there is no “crossover” in playoff matchups until the championship series.</p>
<sec id="section3-1527002511410932">
<title>Theoretical Issues</title>
<p>Once a playoff tournament is introduced, the possibility exists that the regular-season outcomes will be altered. The extent to which these outcomes will be altered depends, in large part, on the specific nature of the playoff tournament. In this regard, both the NHL and NBA employ playoff systems where the top seeds in each conference play the lowest seeds in the conference, the second-highest seeds play the second-lowest seeds, and so on. Thus, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> plays <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> plays <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub> plays <italic>S</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub> plays <italic>S</italic>
<sub>5</sub> during the opening round. If one takes regular-season win percentage as measures of team quality,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511410932">2</xref>
</sup> then the probability that <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> will win any given game against <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub> is defined by (<italic>w</italic>
<sub>1</sub> / (<italic>w</italic>
<sub>1</sub> + <italic>w</italic>
<sub>8</sub>), where <italic>w</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is the regular-season win percentage of <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, and <italic>w</italic>
<sub>8</sub> is the regular-season win percentage of <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub>. In a best-of-seven series, with, say, <italic>w</italic>
<sub>1</sub> = 0.60 and <italic>w</italic>
<sub>8</sub> = 0.40, the probability of <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> winning the series, denoted by <italic>P</italic>
<sub>18</sub>, is .71.</p>
<p>Once one moves beyond the first round, a complication arises in that the NHL and NBA use slightly different tournament structures. The NHL employs what could be termed a “reseeding” system, where the highest remaining seed in a conference plays the lowest remaining seed, and the second-highest plays the second lowest. For example, should <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub> defeat <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, this lowest seed will then face the highest remaining seed in the second round. Conversely, the NBA uses a “bracket” system, where each of the eight playoff teams in a conference are locked into subsequent playoff rounds such that early upsets do not change future matchups. Under the bracket system, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>5</sub> would be in the same bracket, with <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>, and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>6</sub> being in the other bracket.</p>
<p>If all higher seeds advance (i.e., <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>, and S<sub>4</sub> win in the first round), then a reseeding system will be identical to a bracket system. However, any “upset” will result in different second-round matchups. For example, if <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub> survive the first round—implying that <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub> upsets <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>—then a reseeding system has <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> playing <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub> in the second round, with <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub> playing <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub>. But under the bracket system, second round matchups stay within the brackets such that <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> plays <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub> and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub> plays <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub>. Thus, the reseeding system provides maximum reward to the highest seeded teams, and always ensures that the highest seeded team plays the lowest seeded team, while the bracket system does not guarantee such an outcome.</p>
<p>One can then calculate the probability of each team advancing to various stages of the playoffs under each of the two different systems. Starting with the bracket system, the probability of <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, for example, winning three successive playoff matches (i.e., winning the conference championship) can be expressed as:<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1527002511410932">

<sub>5</sub>). Thus, one must first calculate the probability of <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> meeting <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>5</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub> in the second round, and then calculate the probability that <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is victorious over each of these teams. Similarly, in the third round, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>’s opponent could be any team from <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> through to <italic>S</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, depending on the results from the first two rounds.</p>
<p>For both the bracket and reseeding system, the probability of each of the other seven seeds ultimately winning the conference championship (i.e., <italic>C</italic>
<sub>2</sub> through to <italic>C</italic>
<sub>8</sub>) was calculated in a manner similar to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1527002511410932">Equations (1)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1527002511410932">3</xref>). To calculate this, each possible combination of second and third round matchups was considered, and weighted appropriately. For example, under the reseeding system, there are 16 different sets of second-round matchups—<italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub> and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>; <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>5</sub> and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>; <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>6</sub> and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>5</sub>, and so on.</p>
<p>From these equations, actual average win-percentage data (for each of the eight seeds) from the NBA and NHL over the 1994-2004 time period was then substituted into the equations to determine the probability of each of the eight seeds advancing to various stages of the conference playoff tournament.<sup>

<p>Starting with the NHL, the calculations show, for example, that there is a .347 probability that <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> will win zero playoff series, that is, they will be eliminated in the first round. Additionally, there is .249 probability they will win one series (eliminated in the second round), a .168 probability they will win two series (i.e., eliminated in the third round), and a .236 probability they will win three series (i.e., they win the conference championship). Also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511410932">Table 1</xref> is the “expected” number of series won—designated by <italic>E</italic>(<italic>SW</italic>)—for each seed. For example, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is expected to win 1.29 series in any given NHL season, while <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub> can be expected to win about 0.54 series in a season. Thus, if one were to extrapolate these figures over, say, a four-season time period, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> could be expected to win only about five series in total, meaning, for example, that on average it loses in the conference finals in one of these years (i.e., wins two series), and loses in the conference semifinals the other 3 years (i.e., wins one series each year). On average, then, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> will not even make it to the conference finals in any of the four seasons, let alone win the conference.</p>
<p>In the NBA, the results are generally similar, although higher seeds are expected to fare somewhat better than their NHL counterparts. For example, the NBA’s <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is expected to win 1.52 series per season, compared to 1.29 in the NHL. At the other extreme, the NBA’s <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub> is expected to win only 0.37 series, compared to 0.54 in the NHL. Thus, while the bracket system of the NBA suggests higher seeded teams should fare worse than in the NHL, our data show the opposite. This incongruence can be explained by the greater dispersion in the quality of teams within the NBA. In the NBA, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> had an average win percentage of 0.74, versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub> with a win percentage of 0.51. In contrast, the top seeds in the NHL were less dominant, with a win percentage of 0.67, while the eighth seeds had a slightly higher win percentage than their NBA counterparts, at 0.52. This greater dispersion in the NBA can more than offset the effects of the bracket system.</p>
<p>Next, we compare these theoretical predictions to actual playoff outcomes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511410932">Table 2a</xref> shows these actual outcomes for the NHL over the 1994-2004 time period, while <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511410932">Table 2b</xref> does likewise for the NBA.<sup>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511410932">Table 2a</xref> shows that for the NHL, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> won, on average, 1.60 playoff series per year, slightly more than the 1.29 series as predicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511410932">Table 1</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> won the conference championship (i.e., three series) in only 6 of the 20 cases—again slightly more often than the predicted value of 4.72. For <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, the actual results are worse than expected—<italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> lost 12 times in the first round, well more than the roughly eight times predicted. In fact, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> averaged less than one series win per year. In contrast, seeds like <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub> fared comparatively well in the playoffs, averaging the same number of series wins (0.90) as <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, despite finishing five places lower during the regular-season. In fact, if one uses <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511410932">Table 2</xref> to rank seeds by series-won, the ordering is: <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub> tied with <italic>S</italic>

<sub>5</sub> tied with <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p>In the NBA, the top seed (i.e., <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>) fared considerably better, winning an average of 2.45 series, well above their NHL counterparts, and also well above the predicted value of 1.52. As mentioned, one reason why top seeds in the NBA perform better in the playoffs than predicted may be because the greater dispersion in team quality in the NBA allows high-quality teams to clinch playoff spots and/or seeding earlier in the regular-season. For example, in the NBA, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> had a win percentage that was 0.072 higher than <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, compared to only 0.0526 in the NHL. This could then cause these top NBA teams to rest players near the end of the regular-season, and/or to have diminished motivation levels as they “play out the string,” thereby decreasing these teams' regular-season win percentage from what they would otherwise be (and hence causing playoff performance to be under predicted).</p>
<p>However, this issue notwithstanding, the overall predictive ability of our model is relatively high for both the NHL and NBA, and is actually higher overall for the latter. For the NHL, a simple univariate regression shows that the <italic>expected</italic> number of rounds explains about 64% of the variation in the <italic>actual</italic> number of rounds across the various seeds, whereas in the NBA the comparable figure is 74%.<sup>

<title>The Effects of Payroll</title>
<p>While the previous analyses have shown that playoff tournaments do result in considerable reranking of regular-season outcomes, what is more important, at least for the purposes of this article, is to examine whether such a reranking is systematically related to payroll. To examine this, several different tests are conducted.</p>
<p>First, a simple correlation matrix is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511410932">Table 3</xref> that shows the basic relationship among payroll, regular-season performance, and playoff performance,<sup>

<p>First, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511410932">Table 3</xref> shows that payroll and regular-season performance were much more highly correlated in the NHL (0.38) than in the NBA (0.16), likely owing to the fact that the NHL had no salary cap during the data period. However, this correlation between payroll and performance in the NHL decreased dramatically for the playoffs, falling to 0.14. In the NBA, the correlation between payroll and performance in the playoffs (0.13) was relatively unchanged from the regular-season. This result for the NBA is not surprising, since the previous subsection showed that playoffs do not have a significant reranking effect, thus the correlations between payroll and performance should be generally similar in the regular-season and the playoffs.</p>
<p>In the NHL, however, playoff tournaments not only had considerable reranking effects, but this reranking decreased the importance of payroll to performance. To examine this further, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511410932">Table 4</xref> shows the payrolls (relative to the league average) of the league’s top-eight teams during the regular-season, compared to the top-eight teams during the playoffs (with the latter defined as those teams that win their first round series, i.e., advance to the conference semifinals).</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511410932">Table 4</xref> shows that the top-eight regular-season teams have a payroll ratio of 1.172 (i.e., on average, these teams have a payroll that is 17.2% above the league average), compared to 1.106 for the top-eight playoff teams, a result that approaches significance at the 10% level. Thus, teams that finish in the top-eight during the regular-season generally have higher payrolls than the corresponding teams that make the final-eight in the playoff tournament. Taking this a step further, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511410932">Table 4</xref> also shows a similar comparison for the top-four and top-two teams in both the regular-season and playoffs. In both of these cases as well, the payroll ratio is considerably higher in the regular-season, compared to the playoffs, although the results are not statistically significant.</p>
<p>As a final piece of empirical evidence, we also looked at across-season concentration for both the regular-season and the playoffs. One would expect the dominance of large-market high-payroll teams across seasons to be stronger during the regular-season. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1527002511410932">Table 5</xref> shows the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) for the concentration of teams reaching, respectively, the top-eight, top-four, and top-two positions during the regular-season and playoffs. It measures the frequency across seasons with which a given franchise reaches these various levels. The data are normalized so that perfect concentration is denoted by an HHI of 1.00—for example, in the case of the top-eight measure, an HHI of 1.00 would indicate that the same eight teams filled these eight slots each and every year.</p>

<title>The Impacts of the “Conference” Structure</title>
<p>The previous section treats the “conference” as the unit of study, since this conference structure has long been the system employed by both the NHL and NBA. Under such a system, the leagues are divided into two conferences, with each team having its own eight-team tournament, and with the two conference winners meeting in the league finals.</p>
<p>This section will show, however, that this choice to adopt a conference system can have, in and of itself, CB impacts. To explain, while the introduction of a playoff tournament subsequent to the regular-season forces, by its very nature, the best teams to reprove themselves, these tournaments also attempt to reward regular-season performance by giving the better teams (during the regular-season) some type of advantage in a playoff series. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002511410932">Monks and Husch (2009)</xref> discuss, tournaments are usually structured to accomplish objectives like “delayed confrontation”—where the top seeds do not meet until late in the tournament—and “sincerity rewarded,” where the top-seeds are given more favorable early-round matchups. On the surface, these principles seem to be followed in the NHL and NBA, where the best team in a conference (<italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub>) faces the poorest team (to make the playoffs) in the conference (<italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub>), the second-best team (<italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>) faces the second poorest team (<italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub>), and so on.</p>
<p>However, this section will demonstrate that once a league splits its playoff teams into smaller subgroups, such as conferences or divisions, and conducts a playoff system within these subgroups, it is no longer guaranteed (and, in fact, it is quite unlikely) that the <italic>league’s</italic> (as opposed to <italic>conference</italic>) best team during the regular-season will get the most favorable first-round playoff matchup. Ultimately, then, this increases the probability that these high-quality teams will be “upset” in the first round. To illustrate the issue, the remainder of this section compares the typical “conference-pooling” system, as discussed in the previous section, with three alternative systems: league pooling, divisional pooling, and modified conference pooling.</p>
<sec id="section6-1527002511410932">
<title>League Pooling</title>
<p>The 1979-1980 NHL season was the first in which 16 teams made the playoffs (up from 12 the year prior). For that year, and the following year (1980-1981), the league determined its playoff matchups by essentially aggregating all of its (21 at the time) teams into a single pool. The top 16 teams (in terms of regular-season points) made the playoffs, with the best team playing the 16th-best, the 2nd-best team playing the 15th-best team, and so on.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1527002511410932">9</xref>
</sup></p>
<p>The system of combining all playoff teams into a single pool is considered the base case, and is termed the “league-pooling” system. To formalize this notion, assume that these 16 teams can be ordered by their quality, with <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> denoting the best team and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub> denoting the poorest team. Because there is only one league-wide pool, there is also only a single seeding system, with teams seeded 1 through 16, and denoted by <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> through <italic>S</italic>
<sub>16</sub>. Under this system, the league’s best team, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, is always guaranteed to play the league’s poorest (playoff) team, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>; the second-best team is guaranteed to play the second-poorest team, and so on.</p>
<p>In this regard, one could term the league-pooling format as a “stationary” playoff system, in that it provides the maximum reward to the best teams—in other words, the most stationary playoff system can be defined as the one that provides the greatest likelihood of preserving the regular-season ordering. Thus, with 16 teams making the playoffs, the best team during the regular-season would prefer to play the weakest team in the first-round of the playoffs, that is, the 16th-best team. This gives the best team the highest probability of advancing to the second round. If, however, a particular playoff system resulted in the best team best playing, say, the 10th-best team, the probability of the best team advancing to the second round is now lower than it was if it played the 16th-best team. In other words, there is a greater chance that the best team will be the victim of an “upset” in the first round.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1527002511410932">
<title>Conference Pooling</title>
<p>Let us now modify the tournament structure to examine what could be termed as a “conference-pooling” system. Under a conference-pooling system, the league’s teams are divided into two conferences, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, with eight teams in each conference making the playoffs. Under this system, teams in each conference are seeded one through eight, resulting in the following playoff matchups: <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>8</sub>, <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>3</sub> versus <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>4</sub> versus <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>5</sub>, where <italic>S<sub>A</sub>
</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is the first-seeded team in conference <italic>A</italic>, and so on. Similarly the first-round matchups in conference <italic>B</italic> are <italic>S<sub>B</sub>
</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>S<sub>B</sub>
</italic>
<sub>8</sub>, <italic>S<sub>B</sub>
</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>S<sub>B</sub>
</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, and so on.</p>
<p>However, this simple splitting of teams into two conferences now dramatically complicates the playoff matchups. A given team’s first-round playoff opponent will not only depend on the quality of that particular team but will also depend on the quality of the other teams in the conference. For example, if a team has the good fortune to be in a “weak” conference, then it would get a more favorable matchup than what would occur under a league-pooling system, and vice versa.</p>
<p>If one assumes that conference distributions are unrelated to long-term team ability, then, at least for the purposes of this article, the distribution of teams to conferences can be considered a random process. With two divisions of eight playoff teams, the number of combinations of outcomes is then given by:<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-1527002511410932">

</disp-formula>With 16 teams making the playoffs (<italic>n</italic> = 16), and eight teams in each conference (<italic>k</italic> = 8), there are actually 12,870 different combinations of conference outcomes. For example, one scenario could be that conference <italic>A</italic> includes <italic>Q</italic>

<sub>2</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>3</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>

<sub>9</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>10</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>12</sub>, and <italic>Q</italic>

<sub>7</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>8</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>11</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>14</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub>, and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub> Under this scenario, the first-round matchups in conference <italic>A</italic> would be: <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>13</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>12</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>3</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>10</sub>, and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>6</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>9</sub>. Similarly, in conference <italic>B</italic> the matchups would be: <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>4</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>5</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>7</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>14</sub>, and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>8</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>11</sub>. In this particular case, every team in conference <italic>A</italic> has a less favorable matchup, in the sense they play a higher quality team in the first-round, than what they would have had under a league-pooling system.</p>
<p>Each of these 12,870 combinations was delineated, and the resulting playoff matchups that corresponded to each were recorded. From this, the probability that a given team would face another in the first round was calculated. This information is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1527002511410932">Table 6</xref>

<sub>8</sub> all fare worse under a conference-pooling system, compared to a league-pooling system. Each of these eight teams now has an expected opponent that is a better team than what would have been the case under a league-pooling system. The degree of loss is greatest for <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, whose expected opponent is one position better (i.e., <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub>) than under a league-pooling system, while the degree of loss is lowest for <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p>Conversely, all eight of the lowest quality teams (i.e., <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>9</sub> through <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>) will gain from a conference-pooling system. For example, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>, instead of having a 100% probability of playing <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, now has an expected first-round opponent that is <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>2</sub>. This degree of gain is greatest for <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>, and successively decreases as one moves to <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>9</sub>.</p>
<p>Thus, moving from a league-pooling system to a conference-pooling system has the effect of “compressing” the first playoff matchups—the best teams in the league as a whole get a less favorable matchup than they otherwise would, whereas the poorest teams get a more favorable matchup. In a sense, this should increase the likelihood of first round “upsets.” Thus, having a good regular-season is less rewarded under a conference-pooling system than under a league-pooling system.</p>

<title>Divisional Pooling</title>
<p>From 1981-1982 to 1992-1993, the NHL employed what could be termed a divisional-pooling system. The league’s teams were divided into four divisions, with the top four teams in each division making the playoffs, and with all first-round (and second-round) matchups being intradivisional—that is, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>4</sub> and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub>, in each division.</p>
<p>Again, assuming random assignment of teams to divisions—at least random in the sense that divisional assignment is not related to long-term team quality—there are 1,820 different combinations of outcomes for any given division. As with the conference-pooling system, each of these 1,820 combinations was delineated, and the resulting playoff matchups that corresponded to each recorded. From this, the probability that a given team would face another in the first round was calculated. This information is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1527002511410932">Table 7</xref>

<sub>4</sub> in the first round. This would occur in the unlikely event that the four best teams are all in the same division.

<title>Modified Conference Pooling</title>
<p>A tournament structure that, in some sense, falls somewhere between a conference-pooling and divisional-pooling system is what could be termed a modified conference-pooling system. As with the conference-pooling system, this modified system also sees eight teams in each conference making the playoffs. However, under this modified system, each conference is further subdivided into two divisions. While the eight teams are still aggregated into a single pool—with <italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> playing <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub>, <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub> playing <italic>S</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, and so on—the manner in which these seeds are determined changes slightly from the pure conference system. With the pure conference system, the seeding is determined entirely by that team’s points during the regular-season—the team with the most points is seeded first, the team with the second-most points is seeded second, and so on. However, under the modified system, the first-place teams in each of the two divisions are automatically guaranteed the top two seeds (<italic>S</italic>
<sub>1</sub> and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>2</sub>) in the conference, with the other six teams falling in behind and occupying the <italic>S</italic>
<sub>3</sub> through and <italic>S</italic>
<sub>8</sub> spots. This was the system used in the NHL from 1993-1994 to 1997-1998, and in the NBA from 1983-1984 to 2003-2004.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1527002511410932">11</xref>
</sup></p>
<p>Under this modified system, the team with the most points in the conference is still guaranteed the top seed, but now the team with the second-most points in the conference is no longer guaranteed the second seed. For example, if the two best teams in a conference happened to be in the same division, the second-best team would be “bumped” from the second seed spot by the first-place team in the other division. In the extreme, the 15th-best team in the league (i.e., <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub>) could end up being a second seed in a conference. This would occur if the best six teams in the conference (assuming, say, a 24-team league, with four divisions of six teams) in which <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub> plays were all in the same division, leaving <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub> as the winner of the other division. In this instance, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub> (as the 2nd seed) could conceivably have <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>14</sub> (as the 7th seed) as a first-round opponent.</p>
<p>To mathematically calculate the “expected opponent” of any of the 16 teams under the modified conference system, two steps are now required. First, the various combinations of the breakdown of the eight playoff teams between the two divisions must be analyzed. For example, within any (12-team) conference, four teams could come from each division, or five could come from one division and three from the other, or six could come from one division and only two from the other. Then, with each of these scenarios, the probability that any given team is a divisional winner (and hence being awarded the 2nd seed) is calculated.</p>
<p>Summaries of the modified-conference results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1527002511410932">Table 8</xref>
, along with summaries of the conference-pooling and divisional-pooling systems. In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1527002511410932">Table 8</xref> provides empirical results for all three of these systems, the details of which are discussed in the following subsection.</p>

In general, poorer teams gain at the expense of better teams, since poorer teams now have a chance to “jump” the seeding queue by being fortunate to finish first in their divisions, that is, by being fortunate to be in a relatively weak division, where most of the best teams in the conference are in the other division.</p>

<title>Empirical Results</title>
<p>The NHL and NBA provide a convenient empirical outlet to examine these theoretical propositions. The NHL employed a league-pooling system during the 1979-1980 and 1980-1981 seasons, then a divisional-pooling system from 1981-1982 to 1992-1993, and then switched to a modified conference-pooling system for the 1993-1994 through 1997-1998 seasons. The NBA used a modified conference system from 1983-1984 to 2004-2005.</p>
<p>By definition, the league-pooling system used in the NHL during 1979-1980 and 1980-1981 was “stationary,” in that <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> played <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>2</sub> played <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub>, and so on. However, what is more interesting is what outcomes resulted from the divisional pooling and modified conference-pooling systems.</p>
<p>For each season under consideration, the 16 teams that made the playoffs were ranked based on their regular-season point total (that is, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> to <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>). Using these rankings as measure of team quality, the various playoff matchups were then analyzed to see how closely these matchups conformed to the predicted results. The findings are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1527002511410932">Table 8</xref>, where it is shown that the actual results conform very closely to the predicted outcomes. For the NHL’s divisional-pooling system, the correlation coefficient between a team’s actual and predicted first-round opponent was +0.86. For the NHL’s modified conference pooling, the corresponding correlation coefficient was +0.95, and for the NBA’s modified conference pooling the correlation coefficient was +0.99. Thus, the theoretical model was remarkably effective in predicting the actual empirical results.</p>
<p>As predicted, the divisional-pooling system proved to be the least stationary. For example, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub>’s actual first-round opponent under divisional pooling had an average ranking of 12.75, very close to the predicted value of 13.00, and well above the stationary level of 16.00. Conversely, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub>, rather than facing <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> in the first-round as with the league-pooling system, had an average first-round opponent close to <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>6</sub> (5.75 to be exact). Looking at some of the other noteworthy results, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>10</sub> had the fourth most-favorable average first-round matchup in the league, and superior to the six other teams (<italic>Q</italic>
<sub>4</sub> through <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>9</sub>) that finished immediately ahead of it. Similarly, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>14</sub> had a more favorable average matchup than any of <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, or <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p>In terms of specific extreme examples, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>3</sub> and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, instead of meeting <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>14</sub> and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>13</sub>, respectively, actually faced each other one year in the first-round. Thus, for one of these teams, their superior regular-season performance would be nullified early in the playoffs, not necessarily because the team played poorly, but simply because they were unfortunate to face such a strong opponent in the first round. At the opposite end, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>14</sub> and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>15</sub>, instead of meeting <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>3</sub> and <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, respectively, faced each other, thus ensuring that a relatively weak team advanced to the second round. Clearly, the previously discussed objectives of “delayed confrontation” and “sincerity rewarded” were far from being met in these instances.</p>
<p>While the modified conference-pooling system resulted, as expected, in less extreme examples, there were still numerous noteworthy cases in both the NHL and NBA. For example, both leagues had an instance of a <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>12</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>13</sub> first-round matchup. The NBA also had examples of a <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>2</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>7</sub> matchup and a <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>4</sub> versus <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>6</sub> matchup. There were also more persistent examples of the random nature of the matchup process. For example, over the 21-year NBA sample, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>9</sub> actually had a more favorable (average) first-round matchup than any of <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>7</sub>, or <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1527002511410932">Table 8</xref> analyzes only first-round matchups, the choice of pooling system has impacts throughout later rounds as well. For brevity, we focus here only on <italic>Q</italic>

<p>In comparing the extremes of the league and divisional pooling, the latter is particularly penalizing to <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> in the early rounds. For example, in the NHL under the divisional system, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> has a .4046 probability of advancing past the second round, compared to .4775 under a league-pooling system. Thus, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is 15.27% (i.e., [.4775 – .4046] / .4775) less likely to advance past the second round under a divisional system than under a league system. If one moves to later rounds, this difference between the systems is somewhat reduced. Note that while the probability of <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> winning four rounds (i.e., winning the championship) is still lower under a divisional system, the relative gap between the systems has narrowed, as under the divisional system <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is only 12.05% (i.e., [.1460 – .1284] / .1460) less likely to win the championship. This reduced difference reflects the fact that under the divisional system, <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is much more likely to play high-quality teams early in the playoffs (i.e., first and second round), and, should they win these rounds, then have a higher chance of playing lower quality teams in later rounds than under other systems. Thus, for high-quality teams, some (but certainly not all) of the disadvantage of divisional systems gets evened-out later in the playoffs, should the team make it that far.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article attempts to begin to address the dearth of literature surrounding the CB impacts of playoff tournaments—to date, the overwhelming majority of the CB research has focused on regular-season outcomes only. The first part of the article finds that playoffs do in-fact matter, in that they can substantially reconfigure regular-season outcomes. More importantly, they may reconfigure outcomes in a way that is not neutral with respect to payroll. The article found, for example, that in the NHL, over the 1994-2004 time period, team success in the playoffs was much less dependent on payroll than it was during the regular-season. The second part of the article focused more on the <italic>type</italic> of playoff tournament employed, and showed that different playoff tournament structures will provide different levels of advantage to the best teams.</p>
<p>This latter issue raises an important question. From the league’s perspective, how important is it that the playoff system rewards the best teams? In terms of profit-maximization, the most stationary playoff system is not necessarily the optimal system. First, leagues generally divide into conferences and divisions based on geography, thereby both reducing travel costs and increasing regional rivalries (and, correspondingly, increasing revenues). Thus, league pooling, while the only system that is stationary, does not allow leagues to capture these geographic benefits that are found with conference and/or divisional pooling. For example, in 1980-1981, when the NHL employed league pooling, a first-round matchup involved the New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings, a cross-country matchup that would never have occurred under a conference or divisional system.</p>
<p>Second, adopting a playoff format that specifically provides a disproportionate benefit to poorer teams may provide other advantages to a league. For example, it may increase fan interest in the playoffs, by increasing the likelihood of upsets occurring. To the extent fans like “underdogs” and “Cinderella stories,” playoff systems that provide a lower relative reward to high-ranking teams will increase the likelihood of underdogs upsetting the favorites. In addition, to the extent that regular-season records are significantly influenced by payroll expenditures, playoff systems may reduce the effects of market size, and hence exert a positive influence on CB.</p>
<p>In this regard, less-than-stationary playoff systems could be quite ingenious in that they <italic>appear</italic> quite legitimate and fair in the sense that they seem to reward the best teams—that is, the highest seed always plays the lowest seed in the pool—but at the same time these systems are <italic>actually</italic> providing a disproportionate benefit to the lower quality teams. In other words, legitimacy is maintained, while at the same time the probability of a “Cinderella story” emerging has now been increased.</p>
<p>However, there may be limits to these benefits. The less stationary a playoff system is—that is, the less it rewards the best teams for their regular-season performance—the less meaningful is the order-of-finish during the regular-season. To the extent, then, that fans recognize that a superior regular-season performance does little to improve their team’s chances of a championship, they may correspondingly decrease their interest in the regular-season, thus reducing regular-season revenues. In a sense, the regular-season loses some of its legitimacy and importance. Thus, leagues must ultimately trade-off these conflicting impacts.</p>
<p>Finally, the nature of playoff tournament structures may have incentive effects. Less-than-stationary structures may result in a moral hazard problem developing, in that teams may have less incentive to perform to their maximum potential during the regular-season if they know that such performance may not be fully rewarded in the playoffs. Such a possibility raises additional questions and complications, and provides a possible direction for future research.</p>

<label>1</label>
<p>Tournament theory has frequently been applied to sports settings (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002511410932">Ehrenberg &amp; Bognanno, 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511410932">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511410932">Orszag, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511410932">Taylor &amp; Trogdon, 2002</xref>), but we are unaware of any previous application to <italic>playoff</italic> seasons in professional team sports.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1527002511410932">
<label>2</label>
<p>We recognize that, for a variety of reasons, regular-season win percentage may be an imperfect measure of team quality. True team quality may not be completely revealed during the regular-season due to injuries, moral hazard (where the goal is to simply <italic>make</italic> the playoffs, and not expend unnecessary energy attempting to get a higher seed), a particularly difficult schedule, and so on. However, because these factors are difficult to systematically quantify, we feel that regular-season win percentage is still the single best measure of team quality.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1527002511410932">
<label>3</label>
<p>The calculations assume all series are best-of-seven, even though the NBA used a best-of-five format in its first-round for part of the data period (until 2001).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1527002511410932">
<label>4</label>
<p>All calculations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511410932">Table 1</xref> account for home ice/court advantage. Each team’s overall season-long win percentage is divided into a home win percentage and a road win percentage, and <italic>game-by-game</italic> calculations are then done for each series to arrive at the probability of each team advancing.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1527002511410932">
<label>5</label>
<p>The NHL did not adopt the conference-based playoff system until 1994—prior to that, the league used a division-based playoff system (discussed later in the article). The final season in the dataset is 2003-2004. Following that season, the NHL made numerous structural changes that make comparisons with earlier seasons difficult. For example, the league adopted a hard salary cap, and instituted a “shootout” rule—both of which had the effect of decreasing the standard deviation of win percentage during the regular-season, and thus reducing the potential impact of the playoffs as a reranking mechanism. Thus, the dataset is, by necessity, relatively small—as such, the empirical results presented here should be viewed more as a reporting of outcomes, rather than as formal statistical evidence.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1527002511410932">
<label>6</label>
<p>Over this period, each league had a season shortened by a labor stoppage—the NHL in 1995, and the NBA in 1999. These seasons were dropped from the dataset.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1527002511410932">
<label>7</label>
<p>As an alternative to using season-long win percentages, we tried using win-percentages from late in the regular-season—we tested both win percentages over the last 10 games, and win percentages over the last 20 games—to account for teams that were “hot” entering the playoffs. Both of these had low correlations with season-long win percentages, and resulted in the predicted probabilities being much further from the actual outcomes than when we used season-long percentages.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-1527002511410932">
<label>8</label>
<p>Playoff performance was also measured by using playoff games-won, rather than series-won, but the results were not materially different.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-1527002511410932">
<label>9</label>
<p>During the two seasons in which this format existed, the league was still organized into two conferences of two divisions each—it was just that these conferences and divisions had no real impact on the playoff pairings. During these two seasons, the league also employed a fully “balanced” schedule, with teams playing four regular-season games against each of the other 20 teams in the league.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1527002511410932">
<label>10</label>
<p>Instead of four divisions of four teams making the playoffs, one can hypothetically examine the effects of constructing even smaller divisions. For example, with eight divisions of two teams making the playoffs, there is now only a 6.7% probability of <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub> playing <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>16</sub> in the first round.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-1527002511410932">
<label>11</label>
<p>Both the NHL and NBA still use a modified conference system, but both leagues have now switched to three divisions in each conference, rather than two. This further complicates the seeding, with each of the division winners now automatically getting the top three seeds.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-1527002511410932">
<label>12</label>
<p>The calculations use actual win-percentage data from the NHL and NBA over the sample period, and then hypothetically impose each of the pooling systems. In calculating <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>1</sub>’s future (i.e., beyond first-round) opponents, we assume that the higher seeded team always advances in any given playoff matchup.</p>
