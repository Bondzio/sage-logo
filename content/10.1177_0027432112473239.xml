<title>John J. Mahlmann Conference Room Dedicated at NAfME Headquarters</title>
<p>On December 6, 2012, the National Association of Music Education hosted a group of education dignitaries rarely seen together. MENC Past Presidents <bold>Paul R. Lehman</bold> and <bold>Barbara L. Geer</bold>; current NAfME President <bold>Nancy E. Ditmer</bold>; <bold>Sam Hope</bold>, executive director of the National Association of Schools of Music; <bold>James Gates</bold>, former executive director of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; and <bold>Kendall Starkweather</bold>, executive director of the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (who retired at the end of December), gathered with headquarters staff at 1806 Robert Fulton Drive in Reston, Virginia, for a luncheon and dedication ceremony.</p>
<p>Following opening words by NAfME Executive Director <bold>Michael A. Butera</bold>, his predecessor, MENC Executive Director <bold>John J. Mahlmann</bold>, was honored (and roasted a bit!) by Paul Lehman and Barbara Geer, whose presidencies were the first and last during Mahlmann’s twenty-seven years of service to music education. Nancy Ditmer also shared memories of her encounters with Mahlmann.</p>
<p>After a ribbon-cutting ceremony, a new executive conference room on the second floor of the headquarters building was officially dedicated in Mahlmann’s name. The space contains a large table that will accommodate a dozen people and has several high-tech amenities, including a large flat-panel television/computer screen that will allow presentations of several kinds. The room looks out over woodland to Sunrise Valley Drive beyond.</p>
<p>Mahlmann and his wife Ning-Ning were delighted with the event. Near the end of the ceremony, Mahlmann quipped, “Now when I visit NAfME, I’ll always have someplace to go!”</p>
