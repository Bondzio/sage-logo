<abstract>
<p>This study explored Wyoming school leaders’ perceptions about the traits of incompetent teachers, strategies used to work with incompetent teachers, and the barriers to their dismissal. Most importantly, this study differentiated how principals and superintendents viewed incompetency issues. Some major findings include school leaders’ beliefs that classroom management problems were an indicator of incompetence, counseling to leave the profession was a strategy used with incompetent teachers, and teacher unions were a barrier to their dismissal.</p>

<p>Research suggests the most persuasive factor in increasing student achievement is teacher effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192636512459554">Owings et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0192636512459554">Rutledge, Harris, &amp; Ingle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192636512459554">Sanders &amp; Rivers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0192636512459554">Stronge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0192636512459554">Wright, Horn, &amp; Sanders, 1997</xref>). Although variables such as class size, per pupil expenditures, curriculum, and student demographics all contribute to student learning, the strength of instruction delivered by teachers is the most critical factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192636512459554">Leithwood, Seashore Louis, Anderson, &amp; Wahlstrom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192636512459554">Stronge &amp; Hindman, 2003</xref>). However, how to define teacher effectiveness and how to accurately measure it are polarizing debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192636512459554">Armour-Garb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192636512459554">Futernick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192636512459554">Jacob &amp; Lefgren, 2008</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0192636512459554">Stronge, Ward, and Grant (2011)</xref> stated that “effectiveness is an elusive concept to define when we consider the complex task of teaching and the multitude of contexts in which teachers work” (p. 340). Nevertheless, policy makers are highly vested in defining teaching effectiveness as evidenced by the emphasis on teaching quality within the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192636512459554">No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (2002)</xref> and this interest will not likely diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192636512459554">Armour-Garb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge, n.d.</xref>). For example, states that applied for Race to the Top funds had to report the percentage of teachers rated competent in each district, indentify how information from observations was used to evaluate teachers, and describe how tenure was acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192636512459554">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act [ARRA], 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192636512459554">Stoelinga, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although teachers have the greatest impact on student achievement, school leaders also have a powerful, albeit indirect, impact on student success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192636512459554">Leithwood et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192636512459554">Nettles &amp; Herrington, 2007</xref>). The primary method by which principals influence student achievement is by helping teachers improve their practice, a process termed <italic>instructional leadership</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192636512459554">Green, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192636512459554">Nolan &amp; Hoover, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2012</xref>). Within this role, principals formatively supervise teachers by routinely visiting classrooms to collect data on performance and use data to summatively evaluate teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192636512459554">Cooper, Ehrensal, &amp; Bromme, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192636512459554">Pratt, 1996</xref>). Both the supervision and evaluative processes work in tandem as principals use multiple data sources to evaluate teacher effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192636512459554">Range, Scherz, Holt, &amp; Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2007</xref>). In the end, the primary role of evaluation is “to provide evidence to support recommendations for retention or nonretention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192636512459554">Pratt, 1996</xref>, . 32) and to ensure teachers are held to rigorous, common standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192636512459554">Nolan &amp; Hoover, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>One of the most important roles of school leaders as they undertake supervision and evaluation duties is the identification of incompetent or ineffective teachers. However, researchers have argued that little is known about how incompetent teachers are identified, what procedures are in place to remediate or dismiss them, and how school leaders’ views differ based on their roles as principals or superintendents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg, Haynes, Wragg, &amp; Chamberlin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>). This study attempts to fill this void and explores school leaders’ (principals and superintendents) perceptions about teacher incompetency issues. Attempting to clearly define ineffective teaching characteristics and identify barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers are important research endeavors within the context of whole school accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512459554">Platt, Tripp, Ogden, &amp; Fraser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192636512459554">Reeves, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0192636512459554">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192636512459554">The New Teacher Project, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192636512459554">Tucker, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The literature review that follows is designed to frame the problem of teacher incompetency. The review begins by providing a background for the problem and then progresses into defining effective teaching and incompetency within the literature and within statute and case law. Additionally, a description of administrative strategies used with incompetent teachers is presented. The literature review concludes by highlighting barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers and provides a context for the study.</p>
<sec id="section2-0192636512459554">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The theoretical backdrop for this study is grounded in the role of school leaders as formative supervisors and summative evaluators of teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192636512459554">Green, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192636512459554">Ovando &amp; Ramirez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2007</xref>). The distinct purposes of formative supervision and summative evaluation tend to confuse both educators and policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192636512459554">Nolan &amp; Hoover, 2008</xref>). Supervision hinges on the ability of principals to provide constructive feedback to teachers to improve their practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192636512459554">Kimball, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2012</xref>). Conversely, evaluation’s primary purpose is to judge teachers’ competency in relation to standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2012</xref>). Despite these differing frameworks, most school districts funnel both supervision and evaluation into the same process, and principals must understand how to connect both to make teacher evaluation meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192636512459554">Green, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192636512459554">Nolan &amp; Hoover, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge (n.d.)</xref> connected supervision and evaluation by stating that “teacher evaluation is, first, about documenting the quality of teacher performance; then, its focus shifts to help teachers improve their performance as well as holding them accountable for their work” (p. 1). In the end, when supervision and evaluation are linked, they serve two purposes: (a) teacher improvement and (b) individual accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0192636512459554">Wise, Darling-Hammond, McLaughlin, &amp; Bernstein, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>As school leaders undertake supervisory and evaluative roles, many identify incompetent teachers as a significant problem in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192636512459554">Last &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192636512459554">Menuey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512459554">Platt et al., 2000</xref>). Incompetent teachers present a host of problems for school and district leaders, such as producing poor student achievement results, distracting other faculty members, and consuming large amounts of administrative time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>). However, when asked to define the traits of incompetent teachers under an evaluative lens, school leaders’ descriptions become vague (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512459554">Platt et al., 2000</xref>). A primary reason for this is that school leaders do not like to admit they are supervising incompetent teachers and are reluctant to confront them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192636512459554">Fuhr, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512459554">Haefele, 1992</xref>). School leaders “will do their utmost to hide their shortcomings. Common feelings of frustration and shame are obscured by a layer of denial and false description” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>, p. 151).</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192636512459554">Jacob and Lefgren (2006)</xref> found that principals, when allowed to remain anonymous, could identify ineffective teachers based on correlations between classroom observations and students’ test scores. Internationally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al. (1999)</xref> found that headmasters were also perceptive in identifying “a cluster of factors” that signaled incompetency. Finally, although researchers have highlighted principals’ perceptions about incompetent teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192636512459554">Blacklock, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512459554">Brieschke, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192636512459554">Last &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192636512459554">Phillips &amp; Young, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512459554">Torff &amp; Sessions, 2005</xref>), limited studies focus on how superintendents view teacher incompetency issues. A likely explanation for this is principals conduct summative teacher evaluations while superintendents may play a supportive role in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0192636512459554">Weisberg, Sexton, Mulhern, &amp; Keeling, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Effective Teaching</title>
<p>Scholars argue there is little consensus within the education community about how to define effective teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192636512459554">Ingersoll, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192636512459554">Lewis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192636512459554">Popp, Grant, &amp; Stronge, 2011</xref>). Researchers have equated teacher effectiveness to student achievement results or by positive supervisor evaluations of teachers’ performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0192636512459554">Stronge &amp; Hindman, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0192636512459554">Stronge et al. (2011)</xref>, a primary debate about teaching competency includes whether teaching qualifications, teaching processes, products of teaching, or a combination of elements affects teacher performance.</p>
<p>Researchers have argued that effective teachers increase student achievement scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192636512459554">Nye, Konstantopoulos, &amp; Hedges, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192636512459554">Palardy &amp; Rumberger, 2008</xref>), whereas others have highlighted the measurable differences between effective and ineffective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0192636512459554">Stronge, Ward, Tucker, &amp; Hindman, 2008</xref>). More specifically, effective teachers have fewer classroom disruptions, have better classroom management skills, and exhibit better rapport with students than ineffective teachers. Additionally, effective teachers vary instructional strategies, have high student engagement, employ various levels of thinking when questioning students, and view the profession as a service to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192636512459554">Popp et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0192636512459554">
<title>Incompetence</title>
<p>It is estimated that 5% to 15% of the teacher workforce is incompetent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0192636512459554">U.S. Department of Education, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>), yet the dismissal rate is less than 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512459554">Nixon, Packard, &amp; Douvanis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>) because “the expense of a dismissal, not to mention the risk of a lawsuit, makes school districts reluctant to embark on formal discharge proceedings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192636512459554">Fossey, 1998</xref>, p. 61). The negative effects of incompetent teachers on student achievement are cumulative and have been found to be measurable even up to 3 years after initial student contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0192636512459554">Sanders &amp; Rivers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0192636512459554">Wright et al., 1997</xref>). Researchers argue that removing incompetent teachers would immediately improve student achievement in all schools; however, not confronting them sends the message to other teachers that evaluation is not a serious business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0192636512459554">Wise et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Incompetent teachers display common traits. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512459554">Brieschke (1986)</xref> reported principals described incompetent teachers as individuals who continue to accumulate small mistakes, such as disregard for school norms, exhibit low commitment, develop poor student relationships, and have low student achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192636512459554">Phillips and Young (1997)</xref> reported principals identified excessive parent, student, and colleague complaints as evidence to support incompetency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512459554">Torff and Sessions (2005)</xref> found principals perceived weak classroom management skills and poor lesson implementation as significant factors in categorizing teachers as ineffective. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0192636512459554">Stronge (2002)</xref> argued that “the ultimate proof of teacher effectiveness is student results” (p. 65), inferring that lack of student progress was also an indicator of teacher ineffectiveness.</p>
<sec id="section5-0192636512459554">
<title>Statutory definition of incompetence</title>
<p>Grounds for terminating tenured teachers include immorality, misconduct, neglect of duty, good or just cause, insubordination, and incompetency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192636512459554">Alexander &amp; Alexander, 2001</xref>). Although 31 states use incompetency as a grounds for remediation or termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192636512459554">Tucker, 1997</xref>), its definition is usually quite vague causing school leaders to create their own definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512459554">Essex (2012)</xref> defined incompetence as “inefficiency, a lack of skill, inadequate knowledge of subject manner, inability or unwillingness to teach the curricula, failure to work effectively with colleagues and parents, failure to maintain discipline, mismanagement in the classroom, and attitudinal deficiencies” (p. 255). Courts usually consider a host of factors when making a decision concerning incompetency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192636512459554">Alexander &amp; Alexander, 2001</xref>), and teachers are rarely found incompetent by exhibiting one trait alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192636512459554">Fischer, Schimmel &amp; Kelly, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512459554">Nixon, Packard, and Dam (2011)</xref> called this assessing teacher merit by looking at “a pattern of behavior rather than a single event” (p. 3).</p>
<p>In the end, because teachers have been awarded a certificate by the state and deemed competent, the burden of proof to dismiss incompetent teachers is on school leaders. As a result, proper evaluation, documentation, and adherence to deadlines are critical when proving incompetence within courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512459554">Essex, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512459554">Platt et al., 2000</xref>). Although labor intensive, when proper procedures are followed, courts will uphold the dismissal of incompetent teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512459554">Essex, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192636512459554"><italic>Johnson v.

What these mechanisms look like differ from district to district, but the most common strategy used with incompetent teachers is attempting remediation through professional improvement or remediation plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192636512459554">Bridges, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512459554">Essex, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2010</xref>). Professional improvement plans require principals to directly address deficiencies and create professional development plans with teachers to remedy weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2007</xref>). However, the remediation process is difficult because of the lack of resolve of principals to be upfront with concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, some teachers who require remediation seldom take ownership of the plan which truly impacts improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192636512459554">Range et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another strategy used by school leaders is to pressure incompetent teachers to resign, a maneuver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192636512459554">Phillips and Young (1997)</xref> termed <italic>induced exit</italic> or out-counseling. Out-counseling might appeal to school leaders because they are able to avoid dismissal hearings, which if violated, may lead to legal challenges or grievances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192636512459554">Pratt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192636512459554">Stoelinga, 2011</xref>). Finally, transferring incompetent teachers to another school, assigning them a different role within the district, assigning them less challenging work, and moving them to noninstructional positions are also common administrative strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512459554">Platt et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Barriers to Dismissing Incompetent Teachers</title>
<p>Regardless of levels of teacher incompetency, school leaders are reluctant to remove ineffective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0192636512459554">Zirkel, 2010</xref>) and cite various barriers as deterrents to their dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192636512459554">Coleman, Schroth, Molinaro, &amp; Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192636512459554">Menuey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192636512459554">Mock &amp; Melnick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192636512459554">Phillips &amp; Young, 1997</xref>). For example, a major barrier to the dismissal of incompetent teachers is the personal stress the process can inflict on school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al., 1999</xref>). Dismissal means making a decision that will financially affect teachers, and as a result, school leaders spend tremendous time mulling the ethics of the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192636512459554">Pratt, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512459554">Nixon et al. (2010)</xref> described this hardship by stating, “The principal is made to feel as if she/he is on trial rather than the teacher’s performance” (p. 45). When faced with this extraordinary stress, many school leaders choose to ignore ineffective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192636512459554">Bridges, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512459554">Haefele, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0192636512459554">Zirkel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The tremendous amount of bureaucratic hurdles that must be cleared in order to establish incompetency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192636512459554">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0192636512459554">Stossel, 2006</xref>) creates another barrier. The process involves frequent observations, detailed documentation, and burden of proof on administrators to show a reasonable effort was made to remedy deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512459554">Brieschke, 1986</xref>; Essex, 20112; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512459554">Haefele, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192636512459554">Stoelinga, 2011</xref>). This laborious process is especially true for teachers who have acquired tenure. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192636512459554">Kersten (2006)</xref> found school board presidents viewed tenure as a roadblock to dismissing incompetent teachers because tenured teachers are required to have a hearing that requires copious amounts of time and money. Furthermore, there is no certainty results of the hearing will be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Teacher unions and legal expenses have also been reported as barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0192636512459554">Sowell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0192636512459554">Stossel, 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter (2000)</xref> found 25% of principals complained about the obstacles of unions and legality issues when collecting needed documentation to dismiss teachers. With regard to teacher unions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192636512459554">Coleman et al. (2005)</xref> stated that “teachers unions and associations play key roles in establishing the ground rules regarding the conditions under which teachers work, especially laws relating to teacher tenure, dismissal for cause, and due process” (pp. 226-227). Additionally, unions are sometimes responsible for defending teachers during dismissal hearings, which might cost school districts more than $200,000 in legal fees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Still another barrier to the dismissal of incompetent teachers is the evaluation tools. Most evaluation tools require formal observations that are too infrequent and unfocused to provide constructive feedback to teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512459554">Haefele, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192636512459554">Hinchey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192636512459554">Jacob &amp; Lefgren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192636512459554">Kersten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192636512459554">Phillips &amp; Young, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192636512459554">Stoelinga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192636512459554">The New Teacher Project, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192636512459554">Tucker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0192636512459554">Wise et al., 1984</xref>). Additionally, many evaluation instruments do not differentiate between incompetent and effective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2011</xref>), and most school districts lack the staff and expertise to fully evaluate all certified employees with rigor and breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0192636512459554">Weisberg et al. (2010)</xref> reported that most evaluation procedures required two or fewer annual evaluations, each lasting 60 minutes or less, regardless of current job performance. Many evaluation tools require a single preplanned lesson in which teachers have prior knowledge that they will be observed, which skews observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192636512459554">Marshal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0192636512459554">Stoelinga, 2011</xref>). As a result, school leaders must depend less on evaluation instruments and more on formative supervision to detect incompetency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512459554">Brieschke, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192636512459554">Earnshaw, Marchington, Ritchie, &amp; Torrington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0192636512459554">Zepeda, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192636512459554">Pajak’s (2003)</xref> discussion on diverse teaching styles implies an additional barrier affecting the identification and dismissal of ineffective teachers: disconnect among “languages and communication dialects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192636512459554">Pajak, 2003</xref>, p. vii). Unidentified cultural and linguistic diversity between teachers under scrutiny and principals attempting to guide teachers’ practice presents a frequently unrecognized barrier in two ways: (a) defining ineffective teachers and (b) communicating effectively with teachers regarding reasonable expectations for performance. In many cases, principals are not sensitive to “legitimate perspectives and practices [of teachers] that differ from their own preferred styles of perceiving, judging, and communicating about reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192636512459554">Pajak, 2003</xref>, p. 4). When this occurs, it becomes difficult for principals and teachers to reach a shared understanding of evaluation outcomes, making communication about the evaluation process meaningless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge, n.d</xref>.).</p>

<title>Context of the Study</title>
<p>According to the 2010 Wyoming Education Summary compiled by the Wyoming Department of Education (WDE), Wyoming has 48 school districts, each of which has one superintendent. A total of 286 principals serve 354 Wyoming schools and elementary and middle (K-9) schools (274) outnumber high (9-12) schools (74) and K-12 (6) schools. Wyoming requires all teachers to be evaluated each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192636512459554">National Council on Teacher Quality, 2010</xref>), which includes the following: (a) initial contract teachers who have taught in the same school district for 3 years or less and (b) continuing contact teachers who have taught more than 3 years in the same school district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192636512459554">The Education Laws of Wyoming Annotated, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>During the 2011 Wyoming legislative session, legislators passed the Teacher Accountability Act requiring all Wyoming school districts to adopt certified personnel evaluation systems approved by the WDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192636512459554">Memorandum No. 2011-048, 2011</xref>). An important component of this act was the requirement to use student achievement data to assess teacher competence. In the end, the Teacher Accountability Act requires teacher evaluation instruments to rate teachers as highly effective, effective, or ineffective. Teachers deemed ineffective would be targeted by school leaders for remediation, suspension, or termination.</p>
<p>Finally, the Wyoming Education Association (WEA) is the primary teacher union in the state with more than 6,300 members. With association membership, educators receive 1 million dollars in Educators Employment Liability (ELL), which protects them in job-related matters. Finally, WEA provides legal counsel for members who might encounter employment issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0192636512459554">WEA, n.d.</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Method</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to illuminate the perceptions of Wyoming school leaders concerning the traits of incompetent teachers, administrative strategies used with incompetent teachers, and barriers to their dismissal. Three research questions guided the inquiry:</p>
<list id="list1-0192636512459554" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What are school leaders’ perceptions concerning the traits of incompetent teachers?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What are school leaders’ perceptions about administrative strategies used with incompetent teachers?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: What are school leaders’ perceptions concerning barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The study was descriptive and used an online survey to measure school leaders’ perceptions. In April 2011, an e-mail with the link to the online survey was sent to all Wyoming school leaders (principals = 286; superintendents = 48). Up to two reminder e-mails were sent over a period of 2 weeks requesting school leaders to complete the survey.</p>
<sec id="section10-0192636512459554">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>The instrument used in the data collection was a survey adapted with permission from a previous study about incompetent teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192636512459554">Menuey, 2005</xref>). Because Menuey’s study was conducted in another state and targeted only teachers’ perceptions, not all survey items were appropriate for this study. In the end, the wording of some items was changed and modified to reflect both Wyoming terminology and school leaders’ responsibilities. In its final version, the survey contained a total of 46 Likert-scaled items in three sections. The first section included 18 Likert-scaled items (1 = <italic>very uncommon</italic> to 4 = <italic>common</italic>) aimed to identify behaviors school leaders believed to be factors that contributed to teacher incompetence. The second section included 18 Likert-scaled items (1 = <italic>very uncommon</italic> to 4 = <italic>very common</italic>) and sought to identify strategies school districts used to deal with incompetent teachers. The third section, which included 10 Likert-scaled items (1 = <italic>no strength</italic> to 4 = <italic>high strength</italic>), aimed to identify what school leaders believed were the greatest barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers. The survey concluded by collecting demographic data about respondents along with one open-ended question in which school leaders were asked to estimate the number of incompetent teachers with whom they had worked in the past and to describe their traits.</p>
<p>Cronbach alpha coefficients were calculated in order to determine internal consistency for the instrument. The overall alpha level for all 46 Likert-scaled items was .76, which is an acceptable coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192636512459554">George &amp; Mallery, 2003</xref>). Reliability coefficients for the three separate sections were school leaders’ perceptions of traits of incompetent teachers (.86), administrative strategies used with incompetent teachers (.61), and barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers (.74). Content validity was also supported by the correspondence between literature on incompetent teachers and items on the survey, along with expert review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0192636512459554">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Although not all Wyoming principals and superintendents responded to the survey, a significant sample provided perceptions about how they react to incompetent teachers. Of the 334 possible respondents, a total of 100 usable surveys were returned, a response rate of 30%. Seventy percent of the respondents were principals whereas 30% were superintendents. School configurations as reported by principals were (a) 40% supervised elementary schools, (b) 23% supervised middle schools, (c) 25% supervised high schools, and (d) 12% supervised K-12 campuses. Superintendents reported the average size of their districts was 1,527.71 students, with a range of 100 to 13,000. Respondents’ years of administrative experience averaged 13.74 years, with a range of 1 to 37 years.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0192636512459554">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Three types of analysis were computed on the surveys. First, quantitative data were coded and analyzed descriptively for the purposes of summarizing the ratings for each Likert-scaled item on the survey (means and standards deviations). Second, independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine differences in means between principals and superintendents. Third, open-ended responses were coded into themes individually by two researchers and then collaboratively until 100% agreement about appropriate themes was reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192636512459554">Jones, Torres, &amp; Arminio, 2006</xref>). The findings of the study are presented in relation to the three research questions followed by a description of themes derived from the analysis of the open-ended item.</p>
<sec id="section13-0192636512459554">
<title>School Leaders’ Perceptions of the Traits of Incompetent Teachers</title>
<p>To answer Research Question 1, which asked what were school leaders’ perceptions about the traits of incompetent teachers, differences in means between school leaders (principals and superintendents) were compared using independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests on the 18 Likert-scaled items (1 = <italic>very uncommon</italic> to 4 = <italic>very common</italic>) in Section 1 of the survey. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192636512459554">Table 1</xref> displays principals’ and superintendents’ responses concerning the traits of incompetent teachers.

<title>School Leaders’ Perceptions About the Teacher Incompetency Problem</title>
<p>One open-ended question provided school leaders an opportunity to estimate the number of incompetent teachers with whom they had worked with in the past and to describe their traits. Ninety-five school leaders responded to the question and indicated they had worked with an average of 8.44 incompetent teachers with a range of 2 to 50. School leaders first reinforced the notion that defining truly incompetent teachers was difficult. Several school leaders believed incompetent teachers were not a rampant problem; marginal teaching was much more common. School leaders stated they out-counseled incompetent teachers from the profession and most incompetent teachers they identified were close to retirement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identifying the causes of teacher ineffectiveness is important for whole school reform as well as when designing school accountability systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192636512459554">Darling-Hammond &amp; Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192636512459554">Futernick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512459554">Torff &amp; Sessions, 2005</xref>). This study used an online survey to measure school leaders’ (principals and superintendents) perceptions about the traits of incompetent teachers, strategies school leaders and districts use to deal with incompetent teachers, and barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers. More specifically, the authors wanted to know how school leaders’ perceptions about incompetency issues differed based on role as either a principal or superintendent, a focus seldom found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192636512459554">Last &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192636512459554">Mock &amp; Melnick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192636512459554">Tucker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al., 1999</xref>), and we argue our findings are valuable within this line of research. However, the results of this study are limited in that the response rate to the survey was 30% and included only Wyoming school leaders. Nevertheless, results support previous inquires about teacher incompetency issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>), yet highlight unique variations in how principals and superintendents differ in their views about incompetent teachers.</p>
<p>Overall, school leaders indicated they had worked with an average of 8.44 incompetent teachers, higher than other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0192636512459554">Tucker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>). Additionally, within open-ended responses, school leaders identified mediocre teachers, those who are competent but add little to the profession, as a problem, which concurs with other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192636512459554">Platt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al., 1999</xref>). These perceptions are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192636512459554">Jacob and Lefgren (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv (2004)</xref>, who found principals can easily identify the best and worst teachers, yet have difficulty identifying those who are mediocre.</p>
<p>With regard to the traits of incompetent teachers, both principals and superintendents perceived weak classroom management skills as a common trait of incompetent teachers, a finding that concurs with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512459554">Torff &amp; Sessions, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0192636512459554">Yariv, 2004</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0192636512459554">Stronge et al. (2011)</xref> reported the primary discrepancy between effective and ineffective teachers was their ability to manage classrooms. Additionally, our findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al. (1999)</xref>, who have found school leaders viewed weak communication with parents as a common trait of incompetent teachers. Finally, superintendents agreed significantly more than principals that poor reading and writing skills were traits of incompetent teachers. In interpreting this finding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0192636512459554">Torff and Sessions (2005)</xref> classified poor reading and writing skills as deficiencies in teachers’ content knowledge and not a pedagogical limitation. If this is accurate, our findings suggest superintendents believed content knowledge limitations were a stronger source of teacher incompetency than principals.</p>
<p>Both principals and superintendents believed counseling to leave the profession and retirement were common administrative strategies used with incompetent teachers, findings that concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0192636512459554">Wragg et al. (1999)</xref>. Specifically, principals viewed counseling to leave the profession as a strategy used with incompetent teachers significantly more than superintendents. For principals, out-counseling might be seen as an attractive administrative strategy used with ineffective teachers because school leaders can avoid full dismissal hearings. As discussed previously, formal dismissal procedures require copious amounts of both administrative time and documentation and typically end in a hearing, in which principals must present evidence that supports their dismissal recommendation.</p>
<p>Finally, we argue that the most significant findings of this study highlight the similarities and differences in how principals and superintendents viewed the barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers. First, both principals and superintendents viewed protection of incompetent teachers by professional associations as a barrier with some strength. This finding aligns with other researchers who have identified teacher professional organizations as an obstacle to removing ineffective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0192636512459554">Sowell, 2000</xref>). Although Wyoming is a right work state in which teachers have the flexibility to decide whether they support teacher unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192636512459554">National Right to Work, n.d</xref>.), school leaders in this study believed WEA was an obstacle when addressing incompetent teachers.</p>
<p>Second, principals’ and superintendents’ attitudes about the barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers differed in notable ways. Principals perceived lack of support by their superiors as a stronger barrier to dismissing incompetent teachers than superintendents. What this support for principals may look like differs based on the circumstances of the teacher’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512459554">Brieschke, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>). To make their efforts worth the time and stress, principals attempting to remove ineffective teachers from the classroom require the support of superintendents and boards of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192636512459554">Bridges, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our results concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0192636512459554">Wise et al. (1984)</xref> in that superintendents viewed lack of resolve and skill by principals as barriers to removing incompetent teachers. Superintendents must adopt a conviction that their primary duty is to develop principals into instructional leaders and devote considerable time discussing supervision and evaluation issues with principals, including addressing incompetent teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192636512459554">Fink &amp; Resnick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0192636512459554">Waters &amp; Marzano, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-0192636512459554">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Based on the findings of this study, we make three recommendations regarding supervision and evaluation procedures in Wyoming. However, these recommendations can be applied to any state, school, or district that is revamping their teacher evaluation mechanisms. First, evaluation instruments adopted by Wyoming school districts to comply with reform efforts should rely on multiple data sources regarding teacher effectiveness and exhibit four characteristics, namely, propriety, utility, feasibility, and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0192636512459554">Stronge, n.d.</xref>). Because teacher evaluation reform has been a focus of Wyoming policy makers and the WDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192636512459554">Memorandum No. 2011-048, 2011</xref>) in recent years, it is important for Wyoming school districts to understand incompetency is not solely based on student achievement scores, but may be attributed to multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192636512459554">Fischer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192636512459554">Nixon et al., 2011</xref>). In the end, the evaluation of incompetent teachers is a complex process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192636512459554">Painter, 2000</xref>) and should hinge less on subjective judgments about teacher performance and more on standardized instruments. This recommendation is supported by the finding that Wyoming school leaders acknowledged incompetent teachers were a problem in schools.</p>
<p>Second, Wyoming school leaders and the WEA must work together to ensure that both teachers and administrators understand the definition of ineffective teachers as outlined by the Teacher Accountability Act. Additionally, school leaders should seek out WEA’s assistance in providing professional development to principals so they acquire the skills to addresses incompetent teachers in a fair and legal manner. This recommendation is based on the finding that school leaders perceived the WEA as an organization that protects ineffective teachers and was a barrier to their dismissal.</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, the capacity of preservice and practicing principals must be developed so that they are prepared to be instructional leaders equipped with the skills necessary to address ineffective teachers. Wyoming school districts must provide training to principals concerning proper documentation, available support from superiors, and legal ramifications when building a case against incompetency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192636512459554">Hinchey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192636512459554">The New Teacher Project, 2010</xref>). Additionally, university principal preparation programs should partner with Wyoming superintendents to determine instructional leadership skills principals lack. Principal preparation programs must work to ensure principals are “instructional leaders who have the skills and knowledge set that is correlated with increased student achievement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0192636512459554">Waters &amp; Marzano, 2008</xref>, p. 13). School leaders must be trained in how to provide feedback that instigates instructional change and how to follow through with remediation plans for struggling teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512459554">Chait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192636512459554">Range et al., 2011</xref>). This recommendation is based on the finding that there were significant differences in how principals and superintendents viewed barriers to dismissing incompetent teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0192636512459554">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>School leaders play a significant role in the socialization of teachers to the profession and are charged with ensuring they are competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512459554">Brieschke, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192636512459554">Brown &amp; Wynn, 2009</xref>). This pressure will not likely vanish as educational reform and accountability efforts place the onus of student success directly on teacher effectiveness. In order to fairly evaluate all teachers and remove incompetent teachers from the system, school leaders must be able to identify ineffective teachers, create a plan to remediate them, and identify barriers that make their dismissal difficult. Most importantly, school leaders must understand effective teacher evaluation rests on their ability to adopt technically sound evaluation instruments, provide adequate training for all supervisors, and intervene immediately if they sense teachers are ineffective.</p>
<p>As with other studies, results from this study generate more avenues for research. This study did not differentiate school leaders’ perceptions of incompetency between initial contract and tenured teachers. Because school leaders differentiated between mediocre and incompetent teachers, additional research about school leaders’ definitions concerning mediocre teachers would be valuable. Additionally, this study did not measure the perceptions of principals, those on the front-lines when managing incompetent teachers, as to what direct supports they need to make the task manageable. Finally, because this study relied mainly on quantitative data to draw conclusions, a qualitative analysis around the problem would be a beneficial and reinforce our findings.</p>
