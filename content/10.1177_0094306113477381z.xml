<p>The desire that launches and sustains academic initiatives is all too often lost or forgotten. <italic>Discovery of Hidden Crime</italic> presents an erudite effort to invigorate criminology by exploring the motivations that excited our forebears. Far from a simple corrective on the gaps left by official statistics, the self-report crime survey promised to turn on its head not only criminology, but the entire criminal justice field. Such researchers were motivated by sentiments such as the following expressed by no less a luminary than Winston Churchill, “[Unnecessary imprisonment] is an evil which falls only on the sons of the working classes. The sons of other classes may commit many of the same kind of offences and in boisterous and exhuberant moments, whether at Oxford or anywhere else, may do things for which the working classes are committed to prison, although injury may not be inflicted on anyone” (p. 8).</p>
<p>Janne Kivivuori notes that while such ideas may sound strange to “our punitive minds,” they are important to examine “precisely because they do sound strange to us” (p. 10). And we might also rekindle our own desire to forge social change through the study of crime. Who would have thought a mere method could be so revitalizing?</p>
<p>According to Kivivouri, the impetus behind the self-report survey arose from a missionary zeal (often based in religious roots) to reveal the hypocrisy of upper, punitive classes. Edwin Sutherland was integral to this effort, administering the first self-report survey among his college students, yet Austin Porterfield was the first to publish such findings in 1943. Kinsey’s is likely the most well-known self-report study, although it was faulted for its nonrandom (although numerous) selection of respondents. An especially important development that preceded these was Sophia Moses Robison’s pathbreaking 1936 book, <italic>Juvenile Delinquency: Can It Be Measured?</italic>, which compared cases taken to court with those treated in various unofficial facilities and charities. In the years following her book’s publication, she piloted the idea of a central register to record every detected juvenile offender, by involving all public agencies dealing with such children. While Robison’s work contributed to the turning point of criminology, it failed to include still more hidden delinquents.</p>
<p>Especially important in the advocacy and presentation of such approaches to studying crime was the use of social satire. Kivivuori notes, “The satire could be demanding in a mild and self-ironic manner, as in Churchill; it could be morose and vengeful, as in Edwin Sutherland’s attack against the white-collar offender; or it could be almost hilarious, as in Austin Porterfield’s exposure of hypocritical country club elites in rural America” (p. 9). In addition to serving as social commentary, satire was also directed against academic competitors, such as Lombroso’s “born criminal,” or the view of crime as degenerative or psychologically abnormal. Robert Merton was especially important in differentiating sociological from psychological explanations of delinquency; Kivivuori explores in great detail how he was successful in stalling the interdisciplinary goals of a 1955 Children’s Conference.</p>
<p>While such approaches were considered breakthroughs for overcoming the official control barrier in crime measurement, they were notably deficient by overlooking the <italic>frequency</italic> of crime among various classes. Once frequency was taken into account, many of the old stereotypes were reaffirmed. This is especially so in Kivivuori’s chapter on Nordic social science, which was particularly taken with demonstrating the parity of crime rates between the upper and lower classes, overlooking evidence to the contrary. Although Kivivuori does not emphasize the point, his book is important for demonstrating how presumptions may bias research findings just as much as they may compel them.</p>
<p>One would be hard-pressed to find any precursor or justification to self-reports not uncovered by Kivivuori. Unfortunately, the analysis was repetitive at times, and basically stopped at 1960. For a book that does not reach 200 pages, one wonders why more space was not devoted to the importance of victim surveys, especially those focusing on violence against women, as correctives to the assumptions that motivated self-report surveys.</p>
<p>Despite such shortcomings, we need this archaeology. Along with the obsession to keep up with current trends, students must also stay in touch with their discipline’s roots. <italic>Discovery of Hidden Crime</italic> is exhaustive in probing the backgrounds of those who fought against the official control barrier and the politics within which they maneuvered. Students will be delighted to discover how a seemingly innocuous survey could be laden with political and social controversy and importance.</p>
<p>What is visible in hindsight that may be just as evident, if not so clearly, in contemporary scholarship. Kivivuori’s painstaking analysis could provide a great way to enliven courses on methodology and the history of sociology, prompting queries such as: What is the place of personal beliefs in motivating research? How might the use of satire help to bolster or diminish the distribution and acceptance of social science results? What are the roles of politics and religion in science, both prescriptively and empirically? What alternative methods, theories, and comparative findings might be overlooked by social scientists concerned with advocating the results of their own research? Sociology can only be strengthened by opening up the discussion of the deeply personal and sometimes flawed aspects of seemingly objective research.</p>
