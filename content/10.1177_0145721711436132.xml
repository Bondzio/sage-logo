<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of a 12-month weight loss intervention with either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet on quality of life (QOL) among obese patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a low-carbohydrate to a low-fat diet in type 2 diabetes. QOL was assessed with the Diabetes-39 questionnaire, which measures QOL within 5 distinct scales: anxiety and worry, diabetes control, energy and mobility, social burden, and sexual functioning. Repeated measures ANOVA compared change in QOL scales at baseline and 6 and 12 months.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Forty-six participants completed all measures. Following 12 months, there was a significant reduction in the scores related to sexual function and energy and mobility, suggesting improvement in QOL related to these domains. These changes were not significantly different between dietary arms. Changes in weight, A1C, and dietary composition were not significantly correlated with changes in QOL.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Participants with diabetes have various options for weight loss. Dietary interventions with either low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets may lead to some improvements in QOL in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity is associated with impairment in quality of life (QOL) measures, and weight loss in obese individuals may improve some aspects of QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721711436132">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436132">2</xref></sup> The comorbid conditions of obesity and diabetes may lead to an even greater impairment in QOL. Adults with diabetes report lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) when compared to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721711436132">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436132">3</xref></sup> Health factors contributing to this lower QOL in patients with diabetes include treatment regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436132">4</xref></sup> presence of co-morbidities and/or presence of diabetes-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436132">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Weight loss in obese adults with diabetes may improve mobility, may improve glycemic control, and may decrease the need for some medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721711436132">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711436132"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721711436132">8</xref></sup> The multicenter Look AHEAD study conducted among 5 145 adults demonstrated significant improvement in HRQOL among overweight and obese adults receiving an intensive lifestyle intervention that included a low-fat, reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436132">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strategies for weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes include low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, which have been shown to achieve similar one year weight loss outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711436132">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721711436132"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436132">12</xref></sup> These diets differ in macronutrient composition, and certain foods are restricted or greatly reduced in each diet. For example, a low-fat diet restricts full-fat dairy products, fried foods, and other high fat foods, while a low-carbohydrate diet restricts sugars, starches, and other high-carbohydrate foods. While any dietary restriction could potentially impact QOL, little is known about the impact of differing diets on HRQOL among patients with type 2 diabetes. In patients without diabetes, low-carbohydrate diets improved the physical and mental aspects of HRQOL, while low-fat diets improved only the physical aspects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721711436132">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously reported on the effects of a low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet on weight, glycemic control, and endothelial function in type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436132">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721711436132">14</xref></sup> The objectives of the present analysis was to examine the impact of a 12-month weight loss intervention with either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet on diabetes-specific quality of life among obese patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721711436132" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was conducted as a single center, randomized clinical trial in which overweight or obese adult patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 105) were randomized to a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. Details of the dietary trial methodology and results regarding dietary intake, weight, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors have been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436132">12</xref></sup> Adults age ≥18 years were eligible for participation if they had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, body mass index ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a A1C between 6% and 11%. Exclusion criteria included significant kidney, gallbladder, or heart disease. The low-carbohydrate diet was initiated with a 2-week phase of carbohydrate restriction of 20 to 25 grams daily, and carbohydrate intake was increased at 5 gram increments each week if weight loss was achieved. In the low-fat diet, participants were given a fat gram goal that was 25% of energy needed to achieve a 1- to 2-pound weight loss per week based on their baseline weight. Both dietary approaches were initiated using a 2-week menu plan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721711436132">15</xref></sup> Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center.</p>
<sec id="section3-0145721711436132">
<title>Quality of Life Assessment</title>
<p>Participants in both dietary arms were seen at 6-week intervals for counseling to support achieving intervention goals and outcome assessment. At baseline, 6, and 12 months we measured diabetes-specific QOL with the Diabetes-39 questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436132">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetes-39, which is a 39-item self-administered questionnaire, assesses QOL within 5 scales that measure distinct aspects of diabetes-related QOL: anxiety and worry (4 items), diabetes control (12 items), energy and mobility (15 items), social burden (5 items), and sexual functioning (3 items). Participants were asked to rate how much their quality of life has been affected in the past one month by factors related to diabetes such as: daily medication taking, food restrictions required to control their diabetes, feelings of weakness, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436132">16</xref></sup> Additionally two summary questions asked participants to rate their overall quality of life and the severity of their diabetes. Responses for each item were on a visual analogue scale that ranged from a score of 1 (not affected at all) to 7 (extremely affected). The Diabetes-39 has been validated among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Results of the Diabetes-39 correlate well with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, an often used measure of HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436132">16</xref></sup> Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for each of the questionnaire subscales range from .81 to .92. At each time point, questionnaires were self-administered. At baseline, participants additionally reported demographic data and medical history.</p>

<sec id="section4-0145721711436132">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Scores in each domain were linearly transformed to 0 to 100 scales where higher scores represented maximal impact on QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436132">16</xref></sup> Scores for the summary questions were not linearly transformed. Unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests or Wilcoxon ranks compared baseline scores in each domain between dietary arms. Pearson’s correlation tested correlations between baseline A1C, weight, and QOL scores. Repeated measures ANOVA compared change in QOL scores at baseline, 6, and 12 months. SPSS 17.0 was used for all data analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145721711436132">
<title>Approach to Missing Data</title>
<p>Missing data were addressed in two ways. Questionnaires were excluded from the analysis if more than 4 items were missing (excluding values from Sexual Functioning Scale). The mean scores for each scale were imputed for missing values on questionnaires missing 4 or less items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436132">16</xref></sup> This imputation is consistent with the scoring structure of each scale (personal communication with Dr Boyer). For the repeated measures ANOVA, missing 12 month QOL data were imputed using 6-month data. Analysis was done with and without imputation of missing 12 month data. There was no difference in the results with and without imputation, and data with imputation are presented. All analyses were done using SPSS 17.0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145721711436132" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 105 participants randomized in the parent study, 98 had completed QOL questionnaires at baseline. Overall study retention was 81% at 12 months (n = 85).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436132">12</xref></sup> Of participants who completed the study, 54 and 46 of them completed the Diabetes-39 questionnaire at 6 months and at 12 months, respectively. Data from these questionnaires were included in this QOL analysis. There were no significant differences in overall QOL or in any of the Diabetes-39 subscales among participants who completed 12 month questionnaires compared to those who did not. Weight and dietary outcomes for the overall sample have been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436132">12</xref></sup> Participants included in the present analysis had a mean (±SD) weight loss at 12 months of 11 (±11) pounds, which did not differ significantly between dietary arms (<italic>P</italic> = .58). The mean (±SD) 12 month carbohydrate intake was 142 ± 97 grams in the low-carbohydrate arm and 192 ± 90 grams in the low-fat arm (<italic>P</italic> = .12). The mean (±SD) fat intake was 57 ± 35 grams in the low-fat arm and 76 ± 33 grams in the low-carbohydrate arm (<italic>P</italic> = .09).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721711436132">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and QOL (Diabetes-39) scores for all participants at baseline. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721711436132">Table 1</xref>, participants reported being more affected in the scales related to diabetes control and anxiety and worry and less affected in the scales related to social burden, sexual function, and energy and mobility. There were no significant baseline differences between dietary arms; however, men were more likely to report that diabetes affected their sexual function compared to women (<italic>P</italic> = .04). Additionally, at baseline, A1C accounted for 35% of the variance in the diabetes control scale (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and 23% of the variance in the anxiety and worry scale (<italic>P</italic> = .02). There were no significant correlations between age, weight, and QOL scales at baseline.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An improvement in QOL related to sexual function and energy and mobility was observed after a 12 month weight loss intervention with both the low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. While QOL changes were expected to be related to weight and glycemic control changes, the improvements observed in QOL were independent of these clinical outcomes and independent of dietary arm.</p>
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated inconsistencies between QOL measures and clinical outcomes such as glycemic control and weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721711436132">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436132">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721711436132">17</xref></sup> Significant improvements in QOL observed in participants receiving an intensive lifestyle intervention was only partially mediated by changes in weight and physical function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436132">9</xref></sup> Thus, there may be less tangible or unmeasured factors such as contact with the research team, counseling, or changes in individual social lives that contribute to the improvements in QOL observed.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this analysis was to determine whether the dietary strategy used for weight loss would have differential effects on quality of life. Low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets differ greatly in macronutrient composition, which could contribute to changes in mood. Prior research has suggested that diets restricted in carbohydrate and high in fat and protein are associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721711436132">18</xref></sup> and decreased vitality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721711436132">19</xref></sup> However, findings in a short-term study (4-6–week duration) suggested that restricting carbohydrate intake did not adversely affect mood state in healthy, obese females treated with a hypocaloric diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721711436132">20</xref></sup> Yancy et al. found that mental functioning as measured by the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) had greater improvement in participants on a low-carbohydrate diet compared to a low-fat diet, while physical function improved more in participants on a low-fat diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721711436132">13</xref></sup> We, however, did not observe any changes in diabetes-specific quality of life measures that differed between dietary arms.</p>
<p>Variability in the specific measures used to assess QOL may contribute to the differences between our findings and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721711436132">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721711436132">22</xref></sup> HRQOL is often measured with the SF-36,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436132">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436132">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436132">9</xref></sup> which measures HRQOL in the domains of physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health, and is a generic measure that can be used in many disease states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721711436132">23</xref></sup> Our study used the Diabetes-39, which asks specific questions regarding factors that may impact the quality of life in patients with diabetes. Our findings suggest QOL improvement are limited to the domains of sexual function and energy and mobility independent of the dietary approach used and independent of changes in weight and A1C.</p>
<p>This study is limited by a small sample size secondary to incomplete questionnaires. While baseline values of QOL did not differ in the groups who completed or did not complete follow-up questionnaires, it is possible that participants who had greater improvement in QOL may have been more likely to complete the questionnaires at 12 months. Furthermore, the study used only one measure to assess QOL, which focuses on disease-specific scales, and did not collect information on other aspects of quality of life (eg, physical functioning, general health) that are commonly assessed with other instruments. Thus, improvements in other aspects of quality of life may have been missed. Finally, while participants in both dietary arms made dietary changes and lost weight, it is possible that the macronutrient intake at 12 months was not different enough to contribute to QOL changes; for example, participants in the low-carbohydrate arm did not maintain a carbohydrate intake low enough to maintain ketosis throughout the study.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Diabetes educators focus weight loss as an important component of self-management for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. However, diabetes education needs to support patient decision making regarding various dietary strategies. Based on the effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets for weight loss, guidelines from the American Diabetes Association state that for short-term weight loss either a low-carbohydrate or low-fat calorie-restricted diet may be effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721711436132">24</xref></sup> However, beyond the weight and metabolic effects of weight loss, patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life are an important measure of improved health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436132">9</xref></sup> It may seem intuitive that restrictions of either carbohydrate or fat intake could adversely impact quality of life in patients with diabetes. However, our findings suggest that randomizing study participants with diabetes to a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet achieved benefits in the diabetes-specific QOL scales of sexual function, energy and mobility, and a trend toward improvement in anxiety and worry. Understanding that such widely varying diets were associated with QOL improvements allows educators to counsel patients as to the potential weight, metabolic, and patient-related outcomes associated with different dietary strategies. Patients with diabetes have various options for weight loss, and low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets in this study did not appear to have differential effects on diabetes-specific quality of life measures.</p>
