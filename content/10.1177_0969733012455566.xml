<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to illuminate the meaning of professional carers’ experiences in caring situations when a conflict of interest arises with the older person receiving care. The findings reveal the complexity of the carers’ ambivalence when facing a conflict of interest, weighing up between the older persons’ right to self-determination and external demands. The carers are alone in their ambivalence, and the conclusion is that they need help and support to be more present in the encounter. The implication for this study is to focus on care as a person-centered practice and to focus on people as interdependent on support carers to maintain older people’s right to self-determination in the relationship.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, the older population (aged 60 years and older) is growing rapidly, and it is a challenge to meet the demands of caring for older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012455566">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012455566">2</xref></sup> In Sweden, the care of the old has been reorganized, and at the same time, sheltered housing for older people has been reduced. Older people in need of care are expected to remain in their own homes with help from the municipal home-help services for as long as possible. However, older people living at home today and dependent on help have more complex care needs, and work pressure for carers has increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012455566">3</xref></sup> According to the Swedish Social Services Act,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012455566">4</xref></sup> people’s rights for self-determination and integrity should be respected and the care provided should be of good quality. Attention is needed to enhance older people’s right to self-determination and a meaningful existence. It is unclear for older people what help they are entitled to, and they need clear information and support if their rights are to be fulfilled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012455566">5</xref></sup> The development is also toward care of older people in their own homes in several countries in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012455566">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012455566"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012455566">8</xref></sup> and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012455566">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research into carers’ experiences in care of the old has mainly focused on different municipal settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012455566">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012455566"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012455566">22</xref></sup> on registered nurses' experiences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012455566">23</xref></sup> municipal nurses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012455566">24</xref></sup> and nursing staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012455566">25</xref></sup> Studies on home care of older people have focused on registered nurses’ experiences of working in home health care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012455566">26</xref></sup> registered nurses’ values and norms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012455566">27</xref></sup> relationships between community nurses and older people,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012455566">8</xref></sup> and nursing aides’ experiences of caring for older persons with mental disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012455566">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies on care experiences within the municipal home-help services are rare. In this context, it is mainly nursing assistants and enrolled nurses who meet the needs of older people and help them with daily chores and nursing care. Studies on nursing home settings show older people’s lack of participation in their daily care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012455566">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012455566"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012455566">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The traditional individualistic approach of autonomy means that a person makes independent choices without interference from others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012455566">34</xref></sup> In care of older people, the traditional individualistic perspective on autonomy is an ethical issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012455566">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012455566"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012455566"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012455566">38</xref></sup> and a source of ethical conflict between older people and carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012455566">37</xref></sup> Older people’s vulnerability, due to an increased need of care, limits their opportunity for independence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012455566">35</xref></sup> Accordingly, being dependent on carers and their schedules in one’s own home might be a challenge to the older person’s autonomy. This underlines the need to study how carers in this context can improve their opportunities to help older people to strengthen their right to self-determination during care.</p>
<p>Studies on the carers’ experiences of conflict situations in the care of the old have mainly focused on municipal nursing home settings and problematic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455566">11</xref></sup> and ethical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012455566">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012455566">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012455566">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012455566">31</xref></sup> situations. In a study of staff members in nursing home settings, Persson and Wästerfors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012455566">22</xref></sup> found that carers trivialize older people’s complaints and allow them influence only if it does not conflict with procedures in the institution. There seems to be a lack of research concerning carers being in conflict situations with older people within municipal home-help services, and thus this study was considered useful.</p>

<sec id="section2-0969733012455566">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to illuminate the meaning of carers’ experiences of being in caring situations when a conflict of interest arises with the older person receiving care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0969733012455566" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study has a qualitative and a lifeworld approach emanating from how the carers’ everyday work is lived and experienced by them. The meaning of their lived experiences has to be understood in terms of the relationship between humans and their world as a lifeworld. The epistemological foundation of the lifeworld approach is rooted in phenomenological and hermeneutic philosophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012455566">39</xref></sup> A phenomenological hermeneutic method inspired by Ricoeur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455566">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455566">41</xref></sup> was chosen for the analysis of data to disclose the essential meaning of the carers’ lived experience through interpretation. To disclose the essential meaning, narrative interviews are appropriate, and the text needs further interpretation entering the hermeneutic circle. This involves a dialectic movement between explanation and understanding through three methodological steps: naïve understanding, structural analysis, and comprehensive understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455566">41</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012455566">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In lifeworld research, it is important to collect varied data to illuminate different meanings of the phenomenon studied. Therefore, the inclusion criteria for the carers were as follows: both men and women working in municipal home-help services in different municipalities, deemed experienced and skilled in their work with the old by their staff manager, and having a genuine interest in working with older people. The staff managers were given verbal information for all the carers at one work site during a staff meeting. Thereafter, with the aim of varied data collection, the staff manager chose carers with the inclusion criterion of only those who were interested in participation. In all, 13 carers were selected as participants, comprising assistant nurses and enrolled nurses, 1 man and 12 women, aged 31–58 years, with 2 to 17 years of experience of working within the municipal home-help services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012455566">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The interviews were conducted from February to September 2009. The first author (A.B.) contacted the participants and arranged a first meeting and interview. The interviews were carried out at their place of work and lasted for 40–70 min. The verbal and written information focused on the participants’ experiences of giving care to older persons, and how to act in situations where conflicts of interest between them and older persons arise. A conflict of interest could be any situation when they did not agree on decisions with older persons concerning their daily care, and the participants were encouraged to describe their experiences as freely as possible. An open-ended interview guide was used with open questions: “Can you explain how you help an older person with their daily care? Can you describe a situation when you and an older person did not agree on decisions concerning their daily care?” To deepen the understanding, follow-up questions were asked: “Can you tell me more about what you thought about that? Can you tell me some more about how you felt?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733012455566">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>Permission for the study was given by the managers for municipal home-help services in each municipality and was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (ref. 2008/256). Voluntary participation in the study was emphasized. The staff manager gave information and chose carers interested in participation. This procedure was preferred to avoid putting pressure on the carers to participate by being asked by a researcher. All interested carers were given verbal and written information, and they participated after giving informed consent. The written informed consent was collected before the interview was carried out. If stress arose in connection with participation, the participants were offered the opportunity via their manager to get in contact with the occupational health organization. Audiotaped interviews and the transcriptions were stored separately from the code key in a locked security cabinet at the university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733012455566">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The interviews were transcribed verbatim and a phenomenological hermeneutic method was used to analyze data following three methodological steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455566">41</xref></sup> The naïve reading commenced with several readings of the transcribed interview text as a whole in order to reach an understanding of the meaning beyond the author’s meaning as a first guess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455566">40</xref></sup> A naïve understanding was then formulated and guided the succeeding structural analysis. The structural analysis commenced with dividing the whole text into meaning units expressing one meaning. The meaning units were then condensed, and the essential meaning of each meaning unit was formulated as concisely as possible. The condensed meaning units were then abstracted into subthemes and themes. This was an ongoing process until the authors found that the structural analysis validated the naïve understanding. Finally, the comprehensive understanding was formulated. To broaden and deepen the understanding, the text needed to be interpreted as a whole. This was accomplished through critical reflections, where the interviews, naïve understanding, subthemes, themes, research questions, authors’ preunderstanding, and relevant literature were taken into account (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733012455566">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455566">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Naïve understanding</title>
<p>When a conflict of interest arises in a caring situation, carers weigh up the respect for older person’s right to self-determination against not harming his or her integrity. They also weigh up the older person’s needs against the pressures in the working situation. They assume different relationships with the older persons, founded on a personal feeling, which has developed over time. Being themselves and not pretending to be someone else enables them to have a good relationship with the older people. They emotionally interpret the older person’s expressions in every encounter. They have inner demands on themselves and feel insecure in actions taken; they seek to do what is right and take conflicts of interest personally. To choose between avoiding, confronting, and mediating, guided by laws, regulations, templates, and decisions about older person’s need of care, is difficult. They deal with mediation in conflicts of interest not only by explaining and persuading but also by giving alternatives or by avoiding mediation and drawing a line for the old persons, or by referring to decision makers. Avoidance of conflict means distancing himself or herself from the old person, if they do not know how to act in a given situation.</p>

<title>Structural analysis</title>
<p>The meaning of being in caring situations when conflicts of interest arise with older persons is illuminated in three themes: being ambivalent in facing a conflict of interest, being guided by doing what is best when facing a conflict of interest, and being intuitive when giving care (for subthemes, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733012455566">Table 2</xref>). </p>

<title>Being ambivalent when facing a conflict of interest</title>
<p>When <italic>facing a conflict of values</italic>, the carers balance between what they considered best for the old and their respect for the older person’s right to self-determination. In this subtheme, carers respect the older person’s right to self-determination and do nothing against their will. In conflict situations, when carers consider that the old cannot see what is best for them, it is difficult to know how to act. They are unsure whether they are violating and infringing on the older person’s integrity or right to self-determination, whether they should consider meeting the older person’s wishes or follow the procedures and decisions required by the organization. Another consideration is whether one should respect the relatives’ expectations or the older person’s right to self-determination as one carer puts it,<disp-quote>
<p>Well, it feels a little dual since the person can be dressed by himself and then it feels it feels hard in fact to face this knowing. Because some older persons have a greater or less integrity and this person had a great integrity and wanted although he was very ill he wanted to do everything himself and then be there in the morning and tell, well nicely and carefully that the shirt was a bit dirty. But you can of course do what you want but I can pick up a shirt I can pick up a clean shirt. Because if the relatives now would come sometime during the day and he has that dirty shirt on so, it is surely we who receive some form of order. (Carer 1)</p>
</disp-quote>The carers face difficulties wondering whether they have given too much or too little help when respecting the older person’s right to self-determination. To consider the older person’s wishes against the pressure of time and at the expense of other older person’s time and needs evokes a feeling of insufficiency.</p>
<p>The carers are <italic>being limited by preventive working routines</italic>, and it is difficult to follow a work schedule where decisions to help older persons are time-bound. They are required to follow decisions, just carry out what is decided and nothing more. Carers have to hurry the old and sometimes have to deny them help and thus face their disappointment and leave them when the two are in disagreement. When helping too much, without letting the old perform chores themselves, the work is done faster. Due to lack of time, they avoid conflicts and do as the old want and sometimes give up their time off instead:
<disp-quote>
<p>You get your own effort schedule if you stick to that it should preferably hold to avoid working overtime because you are not allowed to. Then it may entail that you get a ten minutes break just a quarter, but sometimes it has to be like that. It is not possible otherwise, you might take too much time of your own time but I have to, how would it be otherwise I have not found any good way to handle this … Well you have to … sometimes you have to remove one quarter of your lunch, we have half an hour, because it has been delayed from the start. Then I have to I cannot tell the [old person] listen I cannot be here any longer I have been delayed so I cannot help you with this. It is impossible then you rather take your own time. (Carer 2)</p>
</disp-quote>The carers have difficulty solving conflicts, and they refer conflict management to decision makers. When they have to follow given rules, this might prevent them from carrying out the older person’s wishes, and it is difficult to convince them against their will, yet they are forced to do so. It is frustrating to see the older person’s needs, when the working conditions prevent them from giving help.</p>
<p>When <italic>protecting oneself</italic>, the carers are in situations involving their own working environment where they confront the old and draw the line, even though this might restrict the older person’s right to self-determination. They need to set limits and defend their own priorities against the demands of the old, based on working conditions.
<disp-quote>
<p>They think you are late and they have no understanding, you cannot tell what happened in the other place. It may well have happened something that absolutely makes me unable to let go of … you try to explain that you work with people that there occurred something and you absolutely cannot get there … that one cannot work after hours … Sometimes it may feel hard since you know what you have done before you get there. It could have been a difficult situation, and then it comes up and the next asks where where have you been, why are you late or I have been waiting for so long … (Carer 3)</p>
</disp-quote>They set limits for the old in conflict situations where they consider the older person’s demands are too high and unacceptable, and conflicts may then arise. The carers want to be treated with respect in the same way that they show respect for the older people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733012455566">
<title>Being guided by doing what is best when facing a conflict of interest</title>
<p>The carers are <italic>guided by goodness</italic>, and in certain situations, when they think the old cannot see their own best interests, they make the decisions. In other situations, they need to remind the old person of things they previously did themselves or to intervene for safety reasons. They act resolutely and take command but quietly, so the old person does not notice:
<disp-quote>
<p>… if it would be so that I know she skipped the shower both Monday and Friday the week before and then I get there on the Monday after. Then I could be more demanding and think that well but it is more than a week since you took a shower … Well but then I can probably jokingly, yet seriously say, well but now, just think now when was the last time how long time has it been since you took a shower should we not still like that, well let's go in and take a shower … (Carer 4)</p>
</disp-quote>In some situations, the carers encourage the old to do more themselves in order to preserve their mental and physical capabilities. They respect the older person’s right to self-determination in their own homes and do not impose their private values on them.</p>
<p>The carers are <italic>guided by dialogue</italic>, and they are perceptive and find out the older person’s wishes and give choices and do not take for granted that they always want the same thing:
<disp-quote>
<p>… at the beginning he was vulnerable and you had to help him a little bit. But he had such pain at that time, he could not bend down and was faltering on the legs and needed the walker, and of course I helped him in other ways. But then when you talk with him it is very important to let him tell how it should be, what he wants for breakfast. I tend to always ask and offer my help to make breakfast. Well as I said he has done it himself, but since it is not obvious that he wants porridge every morning, he may just want a sandwich or tea or coffee or … or something else … (Carer 5)</p>
</disp-quote>In a conflict of interest, the carers discuss other options with the old to find different solutions and compromises. They use persuasion and inventiveness, are calm and cautious, and try to gently persuade or distract in the best interests of the old. This can be stressful and time-consuming for them, and sometimes, it is not possible to take the time, to be flexible and respect the older person’s wishes, to do exactly as they want, and to be there for them.</p>

<title>Being intuitive when giving care</title>
<p>The carers are <italic>caring in an unspoken way</italic> and do what the old want as long as nothing else is requested. They are affected by emotions and read the older people through their body language, facial expressions, and mood to know how to behave toward them. They learn gradually to adapt to the older person’s personalities and assume different roles depending on whom they meet. This is hard, especially if they assume a role they are not comfortable with:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well I thought it was if you were almost forced to add this really nice glossy façade. Well you could not be yourself there somehow. I felt as … well it was good we talked … but it was also very superficial, when we met each other … it was hello, we never stopped to talk or anything like that. (Carer 6)</p>
</disp-quote>They assess the situation in the best interest of the old, act in a way they believe older persons want to be treated, and are uncertain whether they have interpreted the older person’s expression correctly.</p>
<p>The carers are <italic>personally engaged</italic>, see themselves as persons <italic>in care</italic>, and try to understand how they would want to be treated in the same situation and then act accordingly. It is easier for carers to be themselves in their contact with the old and to not pretend to be someone else:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s good, fun, you can talk about anything. She can be very honest, she can swear, but I think we can have a good, open relationship … it can be relaxed, you do not have to be afraid or imagine, or I do not have to be afraid, you know exactly where you are with each other. It is pretty nice when you know someone you are caring for properly, then you know exactly where you are with each other, it can create a feeling of security for both. (Carer 2)</p>
</disp-quote>The carers place high demands on themselves, may get too personally involved, and thus face a conflict of interest. Feelings of being offended, devalued, and disadvantaged and the need to distance themselves from the old may arise. There is a fine line between one’s private and working life, since it involves oneself, and one could be privately engaged to fulfill the older person’s need.</p>

<title>Comprehensive understanding and reflections</title>
<p>The comprehensive understanding discloses different meanings of the carers’ experiences of being in caring situations when conflicts of interest with older people receiving care arise.</p>
<p>This is understood and interpreted as a complex phenomenon, whereas the carers are ambivalent when respecting the older person’s right to self-determination. When carers face a conflict of values they are uncertain whether they are violating and infringing on the older person’s integrity or right to self-determination, whether they should consider meeting the older person’s wishes or follow the procedures and decisions required by the organization. Similar findings are revealed by Jakobsen and Sörlie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012455566">21</xref></sup> with regard to care providers in nursing homes and their facing daily problems of being in ethically difficult situations, and their challenges of balancing between the ideal, autonomy, and dignity. Juthberg and Sundin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012455566">14</xref></sup> found that nurse assistants struggled and questioned themselves when hindered by predetermined working conditions, were overwhelmed by everyday duties, and found it hard to find time to be a good nurse. The findings reveal the carers’ difficulties when required to follow a work schedule where decisions to help older persons are time-bound. In Sweden, care managers in the municipalities assess the older people’s need of care according to the Social Service Act,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012455566">42</xref></sup> which states that people’s rights for self-determination and integrity should be respected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012455566">4</xref></sup> The carers in this study weigh up the older person’s right to self-determination, yet they are regulated by guidelines, and therefore are less able to be responsive to older person’s wishes. It may also be easier for them to strictly follow laws and regulations in the organization when conflicts of interest arise, not knowing how to act. Thus, when the carers have difficulties resolving conflicts of interest, they may also be less responsive to older person’s right to self-determination. When trying to uphold or strengthen autonomy, it is important to be aware that people may value it differently, and may not turn the norm into one that is easy to follow, allowing people to decide for themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012455566">43</xref></sup> In conflict situations or to avoid conflicts, the carers distanced themselves from the old when they got too close in the caring encounter. Similar findings were disclosed in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012455566">44</xref></sup> where caregivers distanced themselves from the old to solve the conflict between what they wanted to do and what the organization required. In this study, it is interpreted that when the carers weighed up between older person’s expectations and the regulations set by the working organization, they distanced themselves from the old, not knowing how to act when conflicts of interest arose.</p>
<p>The findings illuminate that carers are guided by wanting to do their best. They try to solve or avoid conflicts, guided by a sense of goodness and dialogue, and they may just follow the older person’s wishes. According to Aristotle, the goal of our actions is to strive for something good,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733012455566">45</xref></sup> but being good may not be the best outcome for the older person’s needs and self-determination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012455566">38</xref></sup> This is interpreted as the carers constantly have to find solutions when facing a conflict of interest. Aristotle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733012455566">45</xref></sup> states that a person searches within himself or herself and stops the search when he or she finds the necessary means. This is understood as the carers seek solutions without success, and this is stressful for them. Höggström et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012455566">17</xref></sup> stresses the importance of supporting carers in their personal development to enable them to maintain a committed relationship with older people. Another study shows that critical moral reflection in care of older people can stimulate moral consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012455566">20</xref></sup> Forsgärde et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455566">11</xref></sup> found that carers caring for older people felt lonely struggling to uphold their self-esteem and to be affirmed. This is understood as carers being alone, wanting to do the best for the old, while feeling insecure about their actions, which is difficult and stressful for them.</p>
<p>The carers act intuitively when giving care, affected by emotions in an unspoken way. They try to adapt to older person’s personalities and may assume different roles, pretending to be someone else. This adaptation is hard, especially if they assume a role they are not comfortable with. Li<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012455566">46</xref></sup> discusses the concept of “symbiotic niceness” in nurse–patient relationships in palliative care when they mutually benefit and sustain each other by “niceness,” to maintain an impression of a nice organization. This is understood in this study as the carers are trying to put on a nice face toward the old in assuming a role. They are also personally engaged and gauge how they would like to be treated in a similar situation. It is easier for the carers to be themselves, but if they get too personally involved, they may feel offended, devalued, and disadvantaged and need to distance themselves from the old. On the one hand, the carers are themselves, but on the other, they act as if they were someone else, and either way it is difficult for them. There seems to be a complex duality between being oneself or someone else. Ricoeur and Blamey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012455566">47</xref></sup> argue that the narrative identity discloses itself in the dialectic of selfhood and sameness, which opens up imaginative variations. Furthermore, “Oneself as another suggests from the outset that the selfhood of oneself implies otherness to such an intimate degree that one cannot be thought of without the other, that instead one passes into the other” (p. 3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012455566">47</xref></sup> This is interpreted as the carers being at opposite poles of a continuum with no movement between, accordingly being either oneself or another. According to Travelbee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012455566">48</xref></sup> when a person uses himself or herself to assess another person, the other person’s uniqueness could be ignored, negated, or belittled. Thus, if they use themselves to find solutions, they do not see the older person’s needs, and as a result, this might restrict their right to self-determination. According to Buber and Sällström,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733012455566">49</xref></sup> to become authentic in an encounter, everyone needs communication and participation with themselves to make the other person truly present. This is interpreted as the carers not being present, and they are either being themselves or someone else, and consequently, not being “oneself as another.”</p>

<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>In all, 13 participants took part in the study, and it is debatable whether the number was too small. In lifeworld research, it is more crucial to achieve a varied data collection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012455566">39</xref></sup> and this was taken into consideration when choosing participants from different contexts, gender, and experiences. When using a phenomenological hermeneutic, it is important to achieve rich narratives close to the lived experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455566">41</xref> </sup>During the interviews, the participants spoke willingly about their experiences and reflected without interruption. To enhance trustworthiness, the first author performed, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed the interviews. All the interviews were listened through in order to validate the transcription prior to analysis. Ricoeur et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733012455566">50</xref></sup> argue that there is a dualism between explanation and understanding with regards to ontology and epistemology of science. It is through the dialectic movement between explanation and understanding that the interpretation occurs, entering the hermeneutic circle in a circular process first from a naïve guess to validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455566">40</xref></sup> This was an ongoing process that was repeated several times until the authors reached an agreement. The first author conducted the data analysis, and the supervisors validated the whole analysis procedure. The trustworthiness was also enhanced by illustrating the analysis with examples to enable readers to follow and validate the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012455566">39</xref></sup> Interpretations have different meanings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455566">40</xref></sup> and the findings in this study disclose the most useful meaning for the authors. The interpretations could be transferred to other contexts if readers refigure them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455566">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion and implication</title>
<p>The findings reveal the complexity of the carers facing a conflict of interest balancing the older person’s right to self-determination against external demands. The conclusion is that carers are alone and feel insecure about their actions, and it is difficult and stressful for them. They need competence development, educational supervision, and support in their ethical reflections. A valuable support could be to stimulate carers to take an active role in older people’s daily care, to be more present in the encounter with the old. The implication for this study is to focus on a relational approach to autonomy to see older people in need of care as interdependent not only independent. This could be valuable with arrangements where carers discuss ethical issues with parties concerned and find their way to different solutions. This could allow carers to be more present in the encounter and also to strengthen the older people’s right to self-determination. Therefore, a care toward a person-centered practice could support carers to maintain older people’s autonomy through interconnectedness in the relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012455566">38</xref></sup> and to focus on people as interdependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733012455566">51</xref></sup> Further research is needed to gain knowledge and understanding of how carers can get support to improve opportunities for older people to make independent decisions when they live at home and are cared for by municipal home help services.</p>
