<p><italic>The Long Shadow of Emile Cailliet: Faith, Philosophy and Theological Education</italic></p>
<p>Abigail Rian Evans and Clemens Bartollas</p>
<p>Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, 2011. 205 pp. $25.00</p>
<p>In <italic>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</italic> (fifth edn, 2011), the description of a Renaissance man and a Renaissance woman is a person “who has broad intellectual interests and is accomplished in areas of both the arts and the sciences.” The book by Abigail Rian Evans and Clemens Bartollas, <italic>The Long Shadow of Emile Cailliet</italic>, presents to its readers just such a person. I place this volume on a “must read” list. (Readers should be on notice that this reviewer may want for objectivity.) The authors begin with five chapters. I will describe the vignettes within these chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: “The Man: A Journey Into Light.” This chapter sketches some of the major periods of Emile Cailliet’s life that helped to shape who he was, beginning with his conversion at age 23. His wife, Vera, almost by accident, found herself in the office of a Huguenot church edifice. Encountering the church pastor, she asked if he had a Bible in French. Receiving one, she brought it back to her husband. He grabbed the book and rushed to his study with it and read and read and read. This, Cailliet later wrote, “was the Book that would understand me.” And so it was. What follows are commentaries on his early years growing up in France (1894–1926), his French connections, his World War I military service (1914–17), his marriage and family life, his children, his Madagascar years (1923–1926), and his American years at the University of Pennsylvania (1926–1931 and 1941–1945), Scripps College (1931–41), Wesleyan University (1945–1947), Princeton Theological Seminary (1947–1959), and friendships (1959–1981).</p>
<p>Chapter 2: “The Believer: A Christian Centurion.” Cailliet gave great importance to the reading and study of Scripture as central to his own religious life. For him, prayer is acted rather than uttered. In this chapter, Cailliet reflects on the importance of reading devotionally and advocates a “spirit of solitude, not isolation.” He held a high view of the Salvation Army as well as the Young Life movement. The chapter ends with two prayers, well worth reading and praying.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: “The Teacher: The Princeton Years.” In this chapter the book’s authors deal with such issues as Cailliet’s decision to come to Princeton Theological Seminary, the initial impressions of him by students, which for the most part, were laudatory, though not all of course. To some, he would appear formidable and humorless. The chapter concludes with a brief description of the courses taught by Cailliet. Largely taught without notes and with the aid of a photographic memory, most students felt that they were having a first-rate learning experience and that what they were learning in his classroom had application to their ministries.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: “The Christian Scholar: An Evangelical Intellectual.” This chapter deals with Cailliet’s development as a scholar. Special attention is made to the relationship between Cailliet and Blaise Pascal and the emergence of such volumes as <italic>The Clue to Pascal</italic>; <italic>Pascal: Genius in the Light of Scripture</italic>; <italic>Great Shorter Works of Pascal</italic>; and Pascal’s <italic>Short Life of Christ</italic>. In addition to his studies of Pascal, Cailliet continued to reflect on the relationship between Christian faith and culture, resulting in his book <italic>The Christian Approach to Culture</italic>, published in 1953—a well-praised volume.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: “The Philosopher: A Christian Philosopher in a Theological Seminary.” This chapter deals with the issue about just what the role of the philosopher should be in a seminary. Cailliet’s appointment to the faculty at Princeton Seminary had two notable features: he was the first layman to hold a full professorship, and he was expressly appointed to a chair of Christian philosophy. This has, of course, changed over the years, as the authors of this book point out. Cailliet’s views of the Christian philosopher are clearly spelled out, including the distinctions between philosophy and science and the relationship between philosophy and theology. The chapter concludes with the observation by Evans and Bartollas that “the person with a vocation to be a Christian philosopher is one who sees how philosophy can be an expression of Christian existence.”</p>
<p>Finally, as Princeton Theological Seminary observes its bicentennial year, it is my hope that those alumni/ae and faculty who knew Emile Cailliet personally would come forth and share out of their own experiences what Papa Cailliet meant to them, and that those who knew him not would “take up and read.” It could prove to be the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
