<abstract>
<p>The implementation of response to intervention requires that interventions for struggling students be provided through general education prior to referral for special education. The authors surveyed elementary teachers (K–3) in one state to examine the characteristics of the supplemental reading interventions that their students receive through general education. Findings reveal differences among grade levels in the amount of time interventions are provided to students, the providers of the intervention, and the materials selected for the interventions. No differences among grade levels were noted in the frequency of intervention or instructional group sizes. Three fourths of the teachers reported providing the supplemental interventions to students in their class. The findings provide insight into the resources utilized by schools to implement supplemental interventions.</p>

<p>The addition of response to intervention (RTI) as a means to identify students with learning disabilities in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510383162">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004)</xref> has led many school districts to begin considering RTI models for implementation. RTI is a process implemented in schools in which varying levels of intervention are provided for students with learning difficulties, progress is monitored frequently to determine and document students’ responsiveness to the interventions, and instructional adaptations are made based on this information, thus providing information to assist in the identification of learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510383162">Vaughn &amp; Fuchs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510383162">Vaughn &amp; Klingner, 2007</xref>. Although descriptions of basic RTI frameworks and guidelines can be found in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510383162">Batsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510383162">Vaughn, Wanzek, Woodruff, &amp; Linan-Thompson, 2007</xref>), implementation of RTI requires the school district or individual school to define many aspects of the framework according to specific needs. Among the decisions that schools need to make for basic RTI implementation are (a) the criteria to determine entry and exit into various interventions, (b) instructors to provide the interventions, (c) materials to be used, (d) number of minutes and days per week a student receives the interventions, (e) size of instructional groups to be implemented, and (f) the duration of initial interventions prior to determining whether a student requires a more intensive intervention. Not unlike current practices in schools, many of these decisions require an examination of student needs as well as an analysis of resources. In addition, these decisions may be standardized within different levels of the RTI model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510383162">Vaughn et al., 2007</xref>) or may be changed continually based on individual student needs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510383162">Lau et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>RTI models described and examined in the literature often incorporate three levels or tiers of instruction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510383162">O’Connor, Harty, &amp; Fulmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510383162">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510383162">Vaughn et al., 2007</xref>). In a three-tier model for reading instruction, Tier I typically includes screening of all students at least three times per year, implementation of core reading instruction that is based on scientific reading research with use of student data to plan instruction, and ongoing professional development for teachers. The goal of Tier I is to ensure high-quality instruction for all students is provided in the classroom. Tier II involves additional intervention for students who demonstrate difficulties despite instructional efforts in Tier I. Tier II intervention typically includes instruction provided in small groups and more frequent progress monitoring (weekly or biweekly) to ensure the effectiveness of instruction for the students. The third tier, Tier III intervention, is provided to students who continue to demonstrate insufficient progress after receiving the Tier II intervention. Tier III interventions are designed to be more intensive than Tier II interventions by providing instruction in smaller instructional groups, for additional time, and/or with more specialized or individualized instruction. Although there is not yet a consensus on when special education referral occurs within an RTI model, it is clear that multiple tiers of instruction are provided through general education prior to referral and that implementation is aimed at identifying appropriate instructional services for students, including the determination of students whose needs may be best met with special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510383162">Gresham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510383162">Vaughn &amp; Fuchs, 2003</xref>). Thus, fully developed RTI models integrate general and special education and identify and integrate school resources to provide effective instruction and intervention.</p>
<p>The largest amount of development and research in RTI has occurred at the elementary (K–3) level and in the area of reading (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510383162">Denton, Fletcher, Anthony, &amp; Francis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510383162">O’Connor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510383162">Vaughn et al., 2009</xref>). Elementary RTI models in the area of reading are built on a substantial research base that has identified the critical elements of early reading intervention, provided extensive information on validated early reading interventions, and suggested that the incidence of reading difficulties can be reduced through early intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510383162">Blachman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510383162">Felton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510383162">Jenkins &amp; O’Connor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510383162">Lovett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510383162">Torgesen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932510383162">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>). The wealth of research on early intervention has resulted in consensus reports providing research-based guidance for effective early reading instruction (National Reading Panel, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510383162">Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998</xref>). Early reading interventions have demonstrated consistent effectiveness in improving students’ outcomes in the basic literacy skills of phonemic awareness, decoding, and word recognition through explicit, step-by-step instruction in manipulating sounds, letter–sound correspondence, and the use of sound knowledge to decode words in text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510383162">Bus &amp; van Ijzendoorn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510383162">Cavanaugh, Kim, Wanzek, &amp; Vaughn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510383162">Gaskins, Gaskins, &amp; Gaskins, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510383162">Lovett et al., 2000</xref>). There is also evidence that students’ fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension outcomes can be improved through early intervention, though these outcomes are often more challenging to effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510383162">Gunn, Biglan, Smolkowski, &amp; Ary, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510383162">Jenkins, Peyton, Sanders, &amp; Vadasy, 2004</xref>). Evidence also suggests that increasing the intensity of effective instruction (e.g., use of smaller groups, more time spent in intervention) may have positive effects on students outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510383162">Torgesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510383162">Vaughn, Linan-Thompson, &amp; Hickman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Effective RTI implementation requires application of instruction and intervention based on the scientific evidence along with the use of data to make key decisions regarding not only students’ instructional needs but also the intensity of intervention in terms of time, frequency, duration, and instructional group size. We were interested in the characteristics of general education reading interventions that are currently being implemented in elementary schools. Although current assessment practices have been examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510383162">Madaus, Rinaldi, Bigaj, &amp; Chafouleas, 2009</xref>), current reading intervention practices have not been investigated. Examining the features of the general education reading interventions that schools currently implement can provide some insight into the preparedness and the resources that schools currently have and how they use them in relation to RTI implementation in the area of reading.</p>
<p>The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and the What Works Clearinghouse recently released a practice guide with research-based guidelines regarding reading intervention in RTI for the primary (K–2) grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383162">Gersten et al., 2008</xref>). The guidelines for Tier II intervention recommend intensive, systematic instruction in small groups for students below grade level as determined by screening measures. Group sizes of three to four are suggested. In addition, the recommendation indicates groups typically meet between three to five times per week for 20 to 40 min. The guide suggests that the amount of time in intervention will likely increase through the grade levels as the students struggling with reading require more skills to reach grade level expectations. The expert panel writing this report stated that the evidence for the Tier II guidelines is “strong,” indicating there is causal and generalizable evidence in the literature to support the recommendation. A second recommendation provided in the guide is to increase the intensity of instruction for students who continue to struggle after participating in Tier II intervention. Recommendations for increasing the intensity include providing additional time in intervention, incorporating smaller instructional group sizes (including one-on-one instruction), and providing explicit, individualized instruction focused on high-priority skills with extensive practice and high-quality feedback. However, the panel states that the evidence for the Tier III intervention recommendations is “low,” indicating the recommendations are based on expert opinion (in this case the panel) that is derived from related findings or theories. In the case of the Tier III evidence, five studies meeting the What Works Clearinghouse criteria were obtained, but none of the studies reported statistically significant impacts on reading outcomes for participating students with severe reading difficulties. These guidelines provide initial support for schools in implementing effective interventions within RTI models. However, data on the types of reading interventions that schools are currently implementing have not been reported.</p>
<p>To address the lack of data regarding current school implementations of supplemental reading interventions, we surveyed elementary teachers in randomly selected schools in one state one year prior to mandated implementation of RTI. The following research question was addressed: What are the characteristics (e.g., time, group size, location, implementer, materials, decision making) of the reading interventions provided currently within general education at each of the early elementary grades (K–3)? These data provide information on how general education is serving students at risk for or with reading difficulties and provide information on some of the resources schools have in place for general education interventions.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>To identify participants, we randomly selected 1,666 public elementary schools stratified by school district or county in the state of Florida (each county represents one school district in Florida). Thus, we oversampled schools within each county to ensure a sufficient number of responses, estimating a 20% response rate. We then sent the survey via email to the 8,969 teachers listed as teaching kindergarten, first, second, or third grade at the school. A total of 1,142 emails bounced back as “no user found” or with replies that the teacher was no longer teaching reading at the K–3 level. Thus, a total of 7,827 teachers received the survey with a total of 1,759 teachers consenting and responding (22.5% response rate). Participation was voluntary and no incentives were offered. However, 717 responders provided only partial responses or data that appeared inaccurate because of contradictions in the responses through checks built into the survey questions, and thus their responses were not analyzed. As a result, a total of 1,042 responses were analyzed and are reported here. There were no differences in the partial responses of the 717 partial responders and the matching responses for the final sample of 1,042 full responders. The respondents represent 413 elementary schools (22% of elementary schools in Florida) in 42 districts or counties (63% of districts).</p>
<p>Characteristics for the final sample of respondents are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510383162">Table 1</xref>. The sample included 266 (25.5%) kindergarten, 267 (25.6%) first grade, 248 (23.8%) second grade, and 237 (22.7%) third grade teachers and 24 (2.3%) multilevel classroom teachers. We also collected demographic data on the schools where teacher respondents were currently working to examine the representativeness of the sample to schools in the state. A total of 510 respondents (48.9%) indicated they worked in Title I schools. The state of Florida grades schools yearly based on state performance standards using student achievement data from the state assessment. Schools receive points for each student scoring proficient on the exam and for each student making annual learning gains. Of the teacher respondents, 701 (67.3%) were employed at A schools at the time of the survey, with 156 (15.0%) at B schools, 128 (12.3%) at C schools, and 10 (1.0%) at D or F schools. There was no school grade available for the schools employing 47 of the respondents. These demographics are representative of all schools in the state of Florida (57.4% Title I; 55% A schools, 19% B schools, 20% C schools, 7% D or F schools.</p>

<title>Survey</title>
<p>Participants completed an investigator-developed survey. The purpose of the survey was to collect information regarding the characteristics and intensity of reading interventions offered through general education for students with reading difficulties. The survey was developed through a three-step process. First, relevant questions were drafted and reviewed by both authors. Second, a critical systematic review of the questions was conducted using checklists of standards for question characteristics provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510383162">Fowler (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510383162">2002)</xref>. As part of the critical review, a researcher who provides training in reading interventions across the state of Florida examined the questions and provided feedback on wording and areas of intervention implementation that helped to inform question selection and answer choices. The survey was then revised based on the information. Third, cognitive interviews were conducted with the revised survey. Cognitive interviews are designed to ensure the survey questions can be consistently understood and answered by the targeted population. Three elementary teachers participated in individual cognitive interviews. The teachers were each asked to take the survey while thinking aloud about the question and their answers. These cognitive interviews provided information on how respondents might interpret the specific words in the questions and answers and whether these interpretations were different from the intended purpose of the question or answer. After each cognitive interview, survey questions were revised if necessary. During the cognitive interviews we looked for consistent understanding of the questions and accurate answers that matched the information respondents shared regarding intervention implementation. When understanding or answering was not in line with the purpose of the question, we elicited additional information from the respondent to assist in revising the question.</p>
<p>The final survey consisted of a total of 24 closed questions, with 8 questions related to characteristics of the respondent or school of employment (e.g., “Is your school receiving Title I funds?”), 4 questions designed to assist respondents in identifying students receiving general education interventions (e.g., “How many students are currently receiving special education services for reading? School-based reading intervention other than special education services?”), and 12 questions addressing the characteristics of general education interventions (e.g., “How many students (receiving school-based reading intervention other than special education services) are receiving intervention for 1 session per week? 2 sessions per week? 3 sessions per week? 4 sessions per week? 5 sessions per week?”). Open-ended fields were included only to further clarify respondents’ answers of “other” and to allow additional comments at the end of the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741932510383162">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All potential participants were sent an email with a link to the consent form. Once the participants consented they were redirected to the survey questions. The survey was set up such that only one respondent per email link could provide answers. After 2 weeks, a reminder email was sent to all potential participants. A second reminder email was sent an additional 2 weeks later. The survey was available online for a total of 6 weeks. Data for each question were then analyzed descriptively to address the research questions. In addition, chi-square analyses were conducted to examine differences in intervention implementation by grade level. Because of the large number of analyses, we applied a modified Bonferroni correction for multiple chi-square tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510383162">Keppel, 1991</xref>), correcting for the number of chi-square tests and the degrees of freedom, and set the alpha level at .03. When a significant chi-square was noted, standardized residuals were used to determine the cells (i.e., grade level) with frequencies significantly different than expected.</p>

More than half of the teachers (57%) reported that homework or reteaching of skills from the core classroom program made up the intervention program for some students. Significantly more kindergarten teachers responded that students receive interventions developed by the teacher (<italic>p</italic> = .001). Teachers indicated that materials and programs for intervention are selected through a variety of methods, with 40% of the teachers noting that the chosen intervention materials are selected through a combination of methods including the person providing the intervention selecting the program from those available at the school or district, the person providing the intervention developing a program for the student, and the intervention program matching the core program.</p>

<title>Intervention Decision Making</title>
<p>The large majority of teachers also indicated a combination of information was used to make decisions regarding entry into (81%) and exit (75%) out of supplemental interventions. These decisions were most commonly based on students demonstrating failing or passing grades in reading, scoring below or above a level on assessments, and teacher recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a large majority of teachers (83%) indicated they were either extremely or somewhat informed about students’ progress in interventions. Analyses suggested that significantly more kindergarten teachers answered neutral for the question addressing how informed they are about student progress in the intervention. There were no other significant differences across grade levels in the proportion of teachers indicating the various levels of being informed. In addition, 74% of teachers reported they were extremely or somewhat confident that students were receiving the support they needed in reading.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of early reading interventions (K–3) currently being implemented in general education for students with reading difficulties. Teachers in one state nearing a mandate for RTI implementation were surveyed about the characteristics of the supplemental reading interventions their students were receiving through general education. The findings provide insight into the resources utilized by schools to provide these interventions.</p>
<p>Overall, teachers reported relatively small class sizes of approximately 18 students. This class size aligns with state requirements for K–3 grades to include no more than 18 students. However, the state requirement is being phased in and had not taken full effect when this survey was implemented, thus some larger class sizes were reported. Teachers also reported an average of about 4 students in the classroom receiving supplemental reading interventions through general education. Thus, it appears that schools are currently providing reading intervention to about 20% of their population, which is in line with estimates of the percentage of students who may need intervention after receiving effective classroom reading instruction in an RTI model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510383162">Harn, Kame’enui, &amp; Simmmons, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section12-0741932510383162">
<title>Intervention Intensity</title>
<sec id="section13-0741932510383162">
<title>Time in interventions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383162">Gersten et al. (2008)</xref> found strong evidence in the existing literature on RTI for the recommendation to provide intensive, systematic instruction in small groups to students who are below grade level in reading. The authors recommended intervention implementation three to five times per week for approximately 20 to 40 min. Our data suggest that interventions are being implemented in the schools according to these guidelines. We found daily interventions were occurring in the highest number of classrooms, with each grade level reporting similar information on the frequency of intervention implementation.</p>
<p>Teachers in this study reported the interventions were most commonly provided with session lengths of 21 to 30 min. However, the amount of time provided for intervention did differ by grade level. More kindergarten teachers reported having students in their class receiving intervention for shorter amounts of time, whereas more third grade teachers reported having students in interventions for longer amounts of time. Kindergarten reading interventions are likely to be more focused on the basic skills of phonological awareness, phonics, and beginning word recognition with application to short text, and students are likely to need fewer skill gains to meet grade level expectations. Thus, teachers may be able to accomplish the required instruction and practice in a shorter amount of time. In addition, shorter amounts of time may be more appropriate for keeping students at kindergarten age engaged. In contrast, students in third grade are likely to remain engaged for longer periods of time, have more advanced skills to work with lengthier text, and may have more needs than students at risk for or with reading difficulties in the younger grade levels. It is also possible that schools are providing longer interventions in third grade because of the state reading outcome tests that begin at this grade level.</p>
<p>An increase in time in intervention is one way to increase the intensity of interventions for students who are not responding to previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510383162">Torgesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510383162">Vaughn et al., 2003</xref>). The data suggest these schools seem to have some systems already in place to provide more intensive interventions in later grade levels when students may show more significant reading difficulties after not responding to previous intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0741932510383162">
<title>Instructional group size</title>
<p>Another way to increase the intensity of intervention is to decrease instructional group size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510383162">Torgesen, 2001</xref>). Teachers most commonly reported having students receiving supplemental reading interventions in small groups of two to five students. Although this group size is aligned with IES practice guidelines for interventions for students struggling with reading in the primary grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383162">Gersten et al., 2008</xref>), there was no difference reported among grade levels in the proportion of large group, small group, and one-to-one instruction provisions reported. Thus, there does not appear to be an overall increase in intensity of general education interventions through smaller group sizes as the grade levels increase. As students progress by grade level, the students demonstrating insufficient response to previous intervention may need more intensive interventions to meet their needs. Although the increase in time in intervention in third grade was noted above, many of these schools may not have sufficient resources already in place to provide more intensive interventions through the use of smaller group sizes.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section15-0741932510383162">
<title>Intervention Providers</title>
<p>Personnel resources can be a challenge for schools when implementing supplemental interventions. Of the classroom teacher respondents, 73% indicated they are providing supplemental interventions to students who are in their classroom. This finding is likely related to the finding that 73% of the teacher respondents indicated they have students in interventions that occur inside the classroom.</p>
<p>There were no differences found among grade levels in the proportion of teachers indicating they are the providers of supplemental reading interventions. Like many states and school districts, the state of Florida has been through several rounds of budget cuts in recent years, and this finding may be an effect of fewer resources for reading intervention implementation.</p>
<p>One problem with such a high number of interventions being provided by classroom teachers is the need for the teacher to manage instructional activities for other students in the class while also providing the supplemental interventions. It is imperative that meaningful learning activities be available for students not in the interventions and that management of these activities not lessen the quality of the interventions being provided. Also, scheduling a reading intervention in addition to core reading instruction in the classroom may be challenging for classroom teachers and could lead to teachers shortening the core reading instruction provided to all students to find time to provide the supplemental reading interventions for the students with reading difficulties. These areas of concern would need to be monitored in an RTI implementation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, RTI certainly does not require the implementation of pull-out interventions for effectiveness. Interventions provided by the classroom teacher could increase the alignment of core instruction and intervention instruction and may assist teachers in better following student progress during intervention. In this survey, three fourths of the teacher survey respondents did indicate they feel as though students are receiving what they need in reading intervention.</p>
<p>There were differences among grade levels in the proportion of teachers reporting providers of intervention other than the classroom teacher. Third grade teachers were significantly more likely to report having students receiving interventions provided by reading intervention teachers. It may be that schools have allocated these limited resources to the third grade level because of seeing more needs at this grade level or because of the high-stakes testing that begins in third grade.</p>
<p>In contrast, significantly more kindergarten teachers reported having students in their classrooms receiving interventions from paraprofessionals. It may be that schools and teachers are more comfortable having paraprofessionals provide interventions to students with limited reading difficulties and implementing more basic skill instruction. It is also common for kindergarten classrooms to include a part-time or full-time paraprofessional, and thus this finding may be a result of more access to the resource of a paraprofessional than in the older grades. The IES practice guide for RTI intervention implementation indicates that the research evidence supports intervention provided by noncertified teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383162">Gersten et al., 2008</xref>). However, the training that the paraprofessionals receive for implementing interventions would need to be monitored in an RTI implementation.</p>

<p>Overall, the schools in this study appear to have the resources already in place to provide small group supplemental intervention 20 to 40 min per session, three to five times per week for approximately 20% of their population with reading difficulties. RTI implementation does require resources for increasing the intensity of interventions for students who continue to struggle, and these schools may need additional resources to provide intervention for longer periods of time and in smaller groups to meet student needs through the grade levels. Given the high number of interventions provided by classroom teachers, it will be important for the schools to carefully follow the scheduling of these interventions, the fidelity of the interventions, and student progress as RTI is implemented to ensure effective instruction and to ensure that student learning in the general classroom is not interrupted by the implementation of these reading interventions.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study examined the features of supplemental general education interventions being implemented in K–3 through a teacher survey. The instructional content of the interventions was not examined. Thus, the findings provide information regarding current characteristics of general education intervention implementation that are related to intensity and allocation of resources, but we cannot provide information on the quality of intervention instruction that is being implemented. In addition, the survey did not yield detailed information on how decisions are made for individual students regarding intervention implementation. For example, the use of data and student response to instruction is important not only in determining a need for intervention but also for determining the intensity of intervention provided. Although we see some differences in intensity of intervention from these data, we do not know how decisions are made to provide a more intense intervention for a particular student.</p>
<p>The survey yielded a low response rate overall. However, given the historically low rate of return for Internet surveys, we anticipated the low rate and oversampled so that the return rate would yield an adequate sample of teachers, schools, and districts. In addition, our sample matched basic characteristics of all elementary schools in the state, suggesting the sample yielded a representative sample.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted one year prior to state-mandated implementation of RTI practices for all schools. Although we can provide information regarding the interventions in place at the time of the survey, we do not have comparable data of the interventions implemented under RTI (and whether significant changes occurred). Further research is needed to examine the changes in school intervention implementation as RTI models are used. In addition, these data rely on teacher report of current practices for their students. This type of data collection could introduce error into the data because we did not conduct observations to confirm the teacher reports of intervention implementation.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study provides initial information on the levels of intervention that general education provides for students with reading difficulties. The overall amount of time, frequency, group size, and providers are in line with recommendations from IES regarding intervention implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510383162">Gersten et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the large amount of interventions being provided by the classroom teacher in the classroom may need to be further examined within an RTI model to ensure effective core instruction is in place along with the appropriate intensity of supplemental intervention to meet student needs. Future research is also needed to assess the generalizability of the findings reported here from one state. Although the need for research on effective reading interventions is continuous, it is ultimately the interventions that are actually implemented in schools that make a difference in children’s lives, and thus it is important that we continue to be mindful of typical practice in the schools and generate ways to support schools’ efforts given the school context and the resources available.</p>
