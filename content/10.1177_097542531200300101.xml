<p><italic>Environment and Urbanization Asia</italic> enters into its third year of publication. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the contributors and subscribers for making it possible—I have no hesitation in sharing with all of you that there were fears about sustaining this journal; there were fears about garnering six–seven articles for each issue and so on. The four issues published so far have carried 31 articles—far more than what we had hoped for and planned for. More than the number, it is the variety and richness of the articles that has given to the journal a very distinct flavour. Just look at the variety—climate change, green urbanism, gender of marketplace workers, social exclusion, sustainability of river-bank settlements, urban form, contested and negotiated spaces, land-use disputes, urban electoral processes, potential and limitations of e-governance tools, politics of urban expansion, besides of course, articles on governance, infrastructure provision and the like. It is an amazing inventory of the themes that evidently are important for contributors to work on and write on.</p>
<p>The present issue is equally rich, comprising articles on themes as varied as climate-sensitive urban development, urban conflicts, institutional and governance issues related to water, and low-income housing policy. Patricia McCarney (in her article ‘City Indicators on Climate Change: Implications for Governance’) takes the lead in developing city indicators on climate change, arguing that as cities grapple with increasing challenges of urbanization, these challenges are likely to be exacerbated by concerns of climate change. Cities, particularly those in maturing economies, are not equipped to ‘measure’ the impact of climate change; a measurement of these impacts is difficult owing to a lack of standardized comprehensive set of indicators with a common accepted methodology to measure city climate impacts. Through this article, Patricia McCarney aims to bridge the gap by mapping the core climate risks that cities face, examines use of city indicators to assess and address these risks, and determines how knowledge derived can help to direct a more informed set of planning norms and practices, more effective infrastructure investment and urban management, and a more inclusive urban governance towards building climate resilient cities.</p>
<p>To assess urban vulnerabilities, McCarney draws lessons from past trends of a series of climatic indicators, namely temperature, precipitation, extreme climate events (storms) and sea level rise to map core climate risks that cities are facing. As cities become increasingly vulnerable to climate change, city governments need to be taken on board regarding the global negotiations on climate change. She then maps out a set of city indicators around green house gas emissions, mitigation strategies and adaptation strategies that cities are adopting, setting out issues of equity in responding to building urban climate resilience. She further attempts to use these learnings to influence long-term urban climate change vulnerabilities, highlighting that the urban poor remain the most vulnerable and due to lack of indicators and data to assess these, they continue to remain neglected in the overall decision-making structures. Patricia McCarney presents a framework of key requirements towards increasing cities’ resilience to climate change including use of appropriate indicators towards evidence-based policy formulation, and effective planning and management. This is how the city of New York was able to use this approach towards increasing its climate resilience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Patricia McCarney highlights the key challenges facing cities, namely the research challenge (generating adequate city-level evidence to influence decision making), the governance challenge (city governments needing to play a leading role in developing a long-term response to climate change) and the institutional–political challenge (multi-layered and multifarious regulatory, institutional and decision-making authorities). She recommends five core challenges that form the foundation of any successful city-level climate resilience action, including effective leadership, effective financing, effective citizen participation and access to information, jurisdictional coordination and sustainable land-use planning.</p>
<p>The article ‘Flood Risk in Asia’s Urban Mega-Deltas: Drivers, Impacts and Responses’ explores how vulnerable key economic centres located on the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) are to increasing flood risks and how well prepared the city governments are to respond to this risk. According to Faith Chan and his colleagues, flood risks are increasing due to urban growth, which creates an increase in the number of vulnerable people and economic assets. Chan et al. examine recent flooding instances in eight of Asia’s largest deltaic regions, with particular attention paid to the Pearl River Delta, which reports the highest density of all deltaic regions.</p>
<p>The authors (in Chan et al.) also review the measures adopted in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom for managing flood risks. The article explores the wide range of measures adopted by the Dutch over the last five decades for managing the threat of floods, including a range of physical, social and economic interventions. The approach of shifting from simple physical infrastructure creation to flood risk management and effective river basin management is highlighted. The United Kingdom’s approach to provide flood protection for London through a flood risk management plan with a 100-year vision period titled Thames Estuary Plan (TE2100) has also been studied. TE2100 explores options of maintaining and improving the current flood defence system, undertaking floodplain management through effective spatial planning, flood defence realignment and other alternatives. In the context of these international practices, cities in the Pearl Delta seem ill prepared to meet the challenges of river flooding; the authors suggest a host of possible actions and approaches that national/city governments in these cities need to adopt to be able to effectively mitigate the risk threat.</p>
<p>The article on ‘Greening of Jaipur’ looks into the environmental sustainability of Jaipur and investigates proposals in the Master Development Plan and other government plans with applicability to environmental concerns, and seeks potential areas for improvements. The authors, Subhash Datta and Holly Tappenden, undertake this assessment by developing a simulation model for scenario generation to assist the forecast of the number of trees remaining after each year. Three separate scenarios were generated and five different tree classifications were used to calculate the expected proportion of land covered by trees each year. This is an interesting model and presents a means of ‘testing’ the environmental sustainability of large-scale spatial/development plans that would be relevant to developing countries across Asia.</p>
<p>Jaipur is the capital city of Rajasthan and is one of the tourist/tourist-transit hubs in India. The city of Jaipur has recently put out a Master Plan that looks at promoting green development through a range of tools, including location of polluting industries and restricting industry types, focusing on public transportation and providing for a bypass to reduce regional traffic, ground water basin recharge and management, promoting green tourism through spatial planning, among others. In order to test the ability of the master plan to support green development at a city-scale, a model was built taking manpower, resources, soil quality, water quality, proportion of trees eaten by animals, proportion of trees chopped down, natural death of trees and unnatural death of trees as variables. The model solutions were obtained using three different options: the idealistic option of there being full resources (best case) and the more realistic option of having upper (realistic case) and lower (worst case) estimates of the land. In case of Jaipur, it was determined that resource scarcity meant that the best case scenario could not be followed; instead a hybrid solution has been prescribed that would ensure that available resources could be used towards achieving optimal results.</p>
<p>The debate between cities needing to develop even more rapidly to continually serve as engines of growth and the sustainability of the city environment in context of the planned growth trajectory remains a heated subject. In their article ‘The Physical Development of Mashhad City and Its Environment Impacts’, Mostafa Akbari Motlaq and Gholamreza Abbaszadeh look at how Iranian cities are responding to this debate, and try to assess the extent to which physical sprawl is directly affecting the environmental health of Mashhad city. This article looks at issues of urbanization beyond Tehran, Mashhad being the second largest metropolitan city in Iran with high urbanization and population increasing from 0.25 million in 1956 to 2.4 million in 2006.</p>
<p>Mostafa Akbari Motlaq and Gholamreza Abbaszadeh have structured their article into two sections. In the first section, the authors try and establish the extent to which the city grew naturally and the extent to which migration dictated its growth, and study the environmental impact of rapid urbanization on the city ecology. A set of six variables comprising air pollution, water pollution, sound pollution, soil pollution, magnetic contamination and visual pollution are identified and trends noted to establish the extent of environmental damage that the city has faced. A mix of qualitative and quantitative information is used for the assessment, and the authors establish that the present rapid unplanned growth of Mashhad would lead to substantial environmental repercussions for the city and its population. In the second section, the authors present a set of potential recommendations, drawn from international literature and best practices that can be effectively used by decision makers in Mashhad to tackle the problem identified. The authors advocate the concept of compact city growth needs to move towards increased use of public transportation and mixed land use planning. They also indicate that Mashhad can substantially benefit by taking a city development strategy approach wherein all key stakeholders can be engaged towards delivering a more sustainable urban future.</p>
<p>In their article on ‘Contesting Urban and Rural Space in Desakota Regions of Taiwan—A Case Study of I-Lan Country’, Stone and Chi analyze the <italic>desakotasi</italic> (village-city process) in context of I-Lan County of Taiwan. The authors pay particular attention to the manner in which political conflicts have strongly shaped urbanization processes in the region over the last two decades. The authors establish that regular cyclic change in political power in the region have led to local conflicts and a decline in the <italic>desakotasi</italic>. While this phenomenon may not be overtly visible in other Asian countries, political development ideologies play a role in shaping urban growth in many maturing Asian economies. This highlights the need for Asian cities to have long-term growth vision for the city region developed through a consultative process and political consensus, ensuring a healthy urban growth balanced with promoting sustainable rural–urban linkages.</p>
<p>The political conflict between the Kuomintang Party (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and a regular rotation of power between the two have not only led to local conflicts and demonstrations, but also led to a steady decline in agricultural growth in the region. KMT have largely focused on building international competitiveness of the region by establishing industrial areas and highways disregarding threats to environment and agricultural growth needs of the region. DPP, on the other hand, have focused on a ‘locals first’ ideology leading to increasing conflicts and demonstrations at the local level. The significant pull–push factor eventually led to decline in prosperity of the industrial regions created, decline in agricultural growth of the region and formation of a mix of urban–rural corridors across the county. I-Lan city has recently been integrated into the Taipei Metropolitan Region, and sustainable growth of the I-Lan County now depends on resolution of political conflicts on spatial reconstruction and environmental protection of the region, as well as preserving of the <italic>desakota</italic> region.</p>
<p>The article on ‘Urban Sprawl in Palestinian Occupied Territories: Causes, Consequences, and Future’ (by Musallam Abu Helu) seeks to better understand the often overlooked magnitude of sprawl in the Palestinian Occupied Territories (POTs) and explores the conditions that might make it possible to focus on this more traditional issue, in order to reframe thinking about occupation and spatial policy in Palestine–Israel. Learning from this article is useful in two ways; one, how urbanization can be managed in a at-conflict/post-conflict situation wherein rapid migration from rural areas on account of civil conflict is a common phenomenon, and two, how urbanization can be managed in a highly dense location, as POTs reports one of the highest population densities in the world.</p>
<p>Helu, in this article, explores how urban sprawl in POTs needs to encompass three perspectives as part of its future urbanization efforts, namely (<italic>i</italic>) a human habitation perspective where Palestinian cities, towns and refugee camps are overcrowded and undersupplied with basic urban infrastructure and dignified human habitation; (<italic>ii</italic>) a mobility perspective involving the flow of goods and people between farmlands and towns, towns and cities, and between Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) and the outside world; and (<italic>iii</italic>) a natural environment perspective, since the situation with regard to the supply of water, disposal of waste, consumption of energy, protection of sensitive land and access to outdoor recreation can be characterized as essential.</p>
<p>Helu offers a set of recommendations for alternative approaches to land-use development to sustainably manage growth and discourage unregulated urban sprawl in POTs. The greatest challenge is the legacy of city planning cumulated over the last five decades. Given that Palestine’s internal formal structure and capacities are inadequate for meeting current needs, new concepts for formalizing the structure and building capacities are essential.</p>
<p>Helu suggests that a smart growth model or managed development model could help begin a planning dialogue that may ultimately open the way towards thinking on addressing needs of a rapidly growing population, while also regulating sprawl, minimizing conflict over land use, making land available for urban development on an ecologically meaningful basis and, finally, designing infrastructure for future Palestinian economic development that is equitable.</p>
<p>In their article ‘Housing of Urban Migrants in India and China’, Darshini Mahadevia, Zhiyan Liu and Xiuming Yuan, present an important and interesting comparison between the approaches the two ‘giants’ of Asia, China and India, have been following in terms of providing housing to urban migrants, with a case for India to learn from the Chinese experience. The urbanization story in China and India presents contrasting scenarios. In China, urbanization is largely fuelled by rural–urban migration, while in India urbanization is largely fuelled by natural growth. China reports just below 50 per cent urbanization while India reports around 30 per cent urbanization. Rural–urban migrants in India are largely from the top-half of the population, while in China migrants come from relatively poorer rural households. The policy response in the two countries therefore differs considerably creating space to learn from one another.</p>
<p>On the one hand, China has a formal mechanism for controlling migration to urban areas through <italic>hukou</italic>, which allows the government to have a clear understanding on the number and type of urban dwellers. On the other hand, India does not have formal policies for controlling rural–urban migration, but has institutional arrangements that allow it to track migrants to a large extent. In India, housing available to low-income migrants are largely incremental while the <italic>hukou</italic> system in China restricts incremental housing possibilities. In terms of policy response to housing issues related to low-income migrants, China has a formal statement and has been able to provide formal support to its migrants, while in India, not much policy discussion on shelter security for the poor has happened. India also has recently launched two large centrally sponsored schemes that look towards providing housing to the urban poor, but do not respond to issues of housing the poor migrants.</p>
<p>In China, migrants have a host of housing options on migration including employer housing, rental housing, dormitory housing and so on while in India, these concepts remain largely unexplored for poor migrants. China also demonstrates some housing mobility among migrant workers, while this is not a formal process in India. The authors review a series of research and analytical papers exploring the role that the <italic>hukou</italic> system has played in ‘regulating’ social housing for low-income migrants in China. Findings demonstrate that while <italic>hukou</italic> largely constrains the housing movement of migrants in China, many have found informal ways of bypassing the institutional constraints towards moving up the housing ladder. Similar research studies on urban low-income migrant housing are not available in India but there are indirect evidence supporting the conclusion that these migrants in India are worse-off than low-income households residing in the urban areas for long, who usually follow an incremental housing approach. The authors also compare Dongguan in China and Surat in India to compare findings at the city level, but overall findings remain largely the same as observed at the national level. It is also observed that low-income migrants in Surat spend a considerable amount of their earning on housing, food and transport compared to migrants in Dongguan.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors of this article indicate that both countries need to focus on ensuring better policy response to the concerns of low-income migrant workers, although China seems ahead of India in responding to this. Both countries also have institutional barriers that need to be visited and resolved. India can learn from China in terms of ensuring employer housing for some sections of urban labour force, while China stands to learn from India in terms of policy responses to incremental housing for its migrant population.</p>
<p>Water is a big challenge in cities, and the problem is exacerbated in urban informal settlements where access to formal means of water supply is a big challenge. Many critiques have argued that increasing water scarcity in urban areas will soon become one of the leading causes for urban conflicts. Nitin Bassi and Dinesh Kumar’s article on ‘Addressing the Civic Challenges: Perspective on Institutional Change for Sustainable Urban Water Management in India’ focuses on the phenomenon of water scarcity in the context of India where they indicate that to meet these challenges the present public water supply system needs a set of overall reforms. Through their article, the authors highlight the core component of the institutional reform as (<italic>i</italic>) a combination of organizational change measures comprising decentralization, creation of autonomous utilities, private sector participation and community-based management; (<italic>ii</italic>) directive reforms; and (<italic>iii</italic>) human resource development. The authors indicate that such reforms are critical in smaller and medium urban centres and feel confident that a comprehensive reforms agenda can equip Indian cities face the threats arising from water scarcity.</p>
<p>As part of their research, Bassi and Kumar indicate anomalies in water pricing as one of the basic issues. Highly subsidized domestic connections in cities remain a challenge, further aggravated by use of block rates that lead to inequitable access with poor having to pay more for water. A caution on use of incremental block rates is also made as these can also lead to undesirable equity consequences unless adequately planned for. High unaccounted for water, primarily due to weak maintenance structures and unbilled illegal connections, and poor quality of water are identified as other challenges. The authors establish that in the context of present-day challenges, it is the lack of reforms—institutional, administrative, managerial and financial—that hamper progress, and equally if not more important than the actual reform action, is the political economy that dictates the poor performance of this sector, and thus needs to be targeted. The authors present a set of recommendations towards ushering in institutional change including decentralization, creation of autonomous water utilities, increased private sector participation, seeking community participation supported by a set of directive regulatory reforms and human resource development initiatives for the efforts to succeed. All these changes together can make cities better equipped to avert risks, in the face of rapid urbanization, climate change and water scarcity.</p>
<p>One of the major promises of decentralization is that it brings popular participation and accountability to local governance and, therefore, makes local government more responsive to citizens’ desires and more effective in delivering services. The Constitution (74th Amendment) Act 1992 in India provided a platform of decentralization to the local level of government. In his article, ‘Decentralized Urban Gov-ernance: Participation and Accountability in West Bengal’s Municipalities’, Soumyadip Chattopadhyay assesses implications of implementation of this Act towards change in participation and accountability at the municipal level in West Bengal. The author has based his findings on primary studies, and the sample of three cities has been identified based on their location (proximity to Kolkata) and political leadership (governed by ruling party and opposition). A mix of interview-based instruments and group discussions has been used to arrive at the results.</p>
<p>Soumyadip Chattopadhyay establishes that a large gap exists between the provisions of the enabling legislative framework and its actual implementation. While autonomy was provided to municipal governments, and they were made accountable to the citizens, the author demonstrates that proactive reporting to the citizens has not been initiated. The political nature of ward committees and weak accountability to citizens question the efficacy of the functioning of ward committees as the lowest level of governance. The lack of capacity with the citizenry towards demanding greater accountability from local governments, and the weak role that civil society organizations play in achieving this is also noted. This is a critical learning; empowering citizens only through regulatory mechanisms has little or no effect in achieving the overall goal unless citizens are aware of their rights and have the capacity to exercise these rights. The need to have strong political will to translate this into a reality is also indicated by the author.</p>
<p>Mumbai is facing significant challenges in terms of infrastructure deficit and paucity of land owing to its mismanagement and stringent regulations. The authors Abhay Pethe and his team argue in their article ‘Anatomy of Ownership and Management of Public Land in Mumbai: Setting an Agenda using Institutional Analysis and Development Framework’ that better management of public land would not only augment effective land supply in the city but would also enable public organizations to unlock potential value of their land assets, which in turn can be utilized for financing infrastructure projects. How-ever, finding an optimum solution is not easy considering the vast set of stakeholders and complex relationships between them that dictate decision making. In order to take a rational decision, the authors suggest use of analytical tools that can deconstruct these complexities, and suggest use of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, testing it in the context of Mumbai.</p>
<p>The case of Mumbai is unique considering that the city’s land market fails to adhere to economic principles leading to severe distortions, propagating rent seeking and marginalizing of the poor. In addition, the large amounts of land held by public institutions in Mumbai have made markets in Mumbai unresponsive to demand, leading to high incidence of land encroachment. The divergence between market forces, and large unutilized public land, coupled with large marginalized sections, has not only opened up spaces for collusion between real estate interest groups and the public actors but has also led to informal arrangements between slumlords and public actors. The IAD framework, originally developed by Elinor Ostrom and colleagues, is used by the authors to clarify the underlying institutions that work in tandem to influence the outcomes, based on which the authors suggest an agenda for further research.</p>
<p>Although at one end rapid urbanization has fuelled economic growth in many Asian countries, at the other end, it has led to fall-outs including reportedly increased income disparities, lack of availability of affordable housing, among others. The latter is primarily being fuelled by artificial rise in price of land due to ineffective land management practices, and is considered to be one of the primary causes for creation of slums. In his paper ‘Economics of Affordable Housing in Indian Cities: The Case of Mumbai’, Sahil Gandhi aims to demonstrate how the failure of government policies to adhere to basic economic principles result in massive distortions in land and housing markets, leading to failure in resolving problems of affordable housing and slums. To map the magnitude of the problem, the author presents a generic view of the overall slum situation in India, and carries on to test his thesis treating slums in Mumbai as case study.</p>
<p>The article starts by assessing the housing affordability in Mumbai taking information available in the public domain on income distribution, property prices, interest rates and institutional figures of savings rate. It establishes that only 5–6 per cent of Mumbai’s population can afford a house in Mumbai; the remaining households would be left outside the formal sector housing if all the households in Mumbai City <italic>ceteris paribus</italic> were to purchase a dwelling unit. Sahil Gandhi thus concludes that there is a distortion between the household’s income and the price of the house they live in; there is distortion between the household’s stock and its flow. He expands this model further and attempts to answer how dwellings should be priced for them to be affordable to the majority of the population, and establishes that providing low-cost housing in Mumbai—even at construction rates—does not achieve the target of 70 per cent households in formal housing sector. The author suggests that there is a need for affordable housing; he builds a case for supplementing policies that tackle affordable housing supply with policies that provide housing subsidies to the needy. The author, thus, advocates that the success of the slum-free cities initiative of India would depend upon its ability to understand the informal institutions in place, given the distortions in the extant land and housing markets.</p>
<p>Recent studies highlight that socially disadvantaged communities in urban India suffer disproportionately from poverty. Since independence, affirmative action to reduce this discrimination has been the agenda of public policies in India. Sohail Ahmad in his article ‘Housing Inequality in Socially Dis-advantaged Communities: Evidence from Urban India’ examines whether, and to what extent, scheduled castes/scheduled tribes (Dalits) and the largest religious minority (Muslim) community face discrimination in terms of access to housing relative to the main stream population. This study distinguishes from earlier studies undertaken on similar lines in two ways; it measures living standards in more literal meaning than earlier studies, which have been traditionally based on consumption expenditure, and adds a minority dimension to existing inequality literature.</p>
<p>Sohail Ahmad uses the 65th round of India’s National Sample Survey (NSS) data on housing conditions and amenities that for the first time disaggregated data based on religion, and uses two internationally accepted variables to measure living standards and housing inequality, namely floor area and index of housing facility. Results show that causes for the low living standards of Muslims are similar to those of Dalits, although the gap between Hindu and Dalit households is relatively high in comparison to Hindu and Muslim households. Sohail Ahmad also establishes that income improvement will augment living standards more in the Muslim community than other communities. He concludes that income improvement strategies and enhancement of occupational hierarchy would be one of the recommended strategies to reduce housing poverty and disparity among the minority and Dalit. In addition, improvement of minority and Dalit concentrated slum settlements would be also significantly helpful in reducing housing inequality. Importantly, from the context of newly launched slum-free cities programme of the Government of India, the study reiterates that smaller towns should be focused to improve facilities and larger towns should be focused to ease floor area through urban land supply, particularly aimed at the minority and Dalit communities.</p>
