<abstract>
<p>Using a combination of brief case studies and statistical analysis of probate disputes in eighteenth-century England, this article argues for an expanded interpretation of Georgian family life—an interpretation that understands the tugs and pulls of siblinghood. In the eighteenth century, emerging ideas about social equality based on idealized siblinghood tangled with engrained family hierarchies to produce messy, constantly shifting, sibling politics. Confronting competing social expectations that classified them as equals yet ranked them hierarchically by gender, birth order, and marital status, Georgian sisters and brothers fiercely wrestled over material and emotional investments from their parents and from one another. Sibling conflict was most common when reality sharply diverged from expectations of equality, such as between older sisters and younger brothers or between men and their brothers' widows.</p>

<body>
<p>1712 was not a good year—in a string of bad years—for the Punter family of Gloucester.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199011433123">1</xref>
</sup> In March of that year Robert, a prosperous apothecary, forced his wife, Dorothy, to leave their house; this was not a divorce or even the officially sanctioned separation of bed and board, but instead the more common and less-expensive way to practically dissolve a marriage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199011433123">2</xref>
</sup> When she returned, he allowed her to rejoin the household, but Dorothy did not regain her status as mistress of the home. Instead she was locked in a separate room and denied good food and water. Robert abused her physically and verbally, at times yelling loudly enough for neighbors to hear his invectives. According to the suit Dorothy filed, Robert had mistreated her since 1708, but by 1712 his abuse had escalated and incited his servants and sisters to abuse her as well. At times he “sent for” and “entertained” two or three of his sisters and “to … some or one of them he gave order … to affront beare rule and Domineere over his s[ai]d wife.” Dorothy seems to have found ways of managing the earlier years of abuse, but the usurpation of her role by her husband’s sisters became the proverbial last straw. The principal point of her suit against her husband hinged on the fact that his sisters “by his order did take [th]e government of his house upon them and would not suffer the s[aid] Dorothea his wife to intermeddle w[i]th the household affaires w[hi]ch belonged unto her as his wife.” The bruises Robert left on her body and the affronting “intermeddling” of her sisters-in-law motivated Dorothy to seek ecclesiastical-legal help from the Bishop’s court.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199011433123">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the documents recording the court’s decision in this matter have not survived, but this story has a sad postscript. In 1737, Dorothy Punter again came before the Diocese of Gloucester Court, this time to dispute her husband’s will. In his August 1732 will, Robert gave all of his property and money to his two single sisters: Mary and Sarah. In June 1737, Dorothy challenged the claims of this will, arguing that it was fraudulent and that the sisters had not legally probated Robert’s estate. Though she won the day by forcing her sisters-in-law to appear in court and produce the will, she succeeded only in providing them a legal seal of approval on the will. Mary and Sarah were sole beneficiaries and executrices of the will; Robert remained utterly silent about Dorothy and made no provision for her. We do not know whether Dorothy and Robert continued to live together between 1712 and 1732, but whatever the details of their relationship, it appears to have remained contentious and stressful. The continued presence of Mary and Sarah only made the atmosphere more strained.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199011433123">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Stories like Robert and Dorothy’s are not new to historians, because the “vagaries and varieties of marital fortune were too conspicuous to be ignored,” but Mary and Sarah’s part in this tragic family story often goes unnoticed. For example, Amanda Vickery and Elizabeth Foyster give examples of siblings mixing with marital and kinship concerns—rarely with pleasant results—but as the marital relationship was the focus of their analysis, they do not discuss the impact on sibling relations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199011433123">5</xref>
</sup> For the past thirty years, most family histories have focused on marriages and parent–child relationships. By putting married couples first, depictions of family politics tend to focus on the vertical relations between husband and wives and between parents and children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0363199011433123">6</xref>
</sup> The recent scholarship about kinship and marital status, however, highlights alternative views of family power.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0363199011433123">7</xref>
</sup> If an analysis of family life shifts its focus to the horizontal connections between siblings, a different picture of the relationship between the sexes and family power emerges. Like the Punters, eighteenth-century siblings had long-standing habits of behavior before spouses joined them and long before it was a settled matter that some siblings would marry and some would not. Focusing on siblings reveals the combined impact of birth order and gender on family dynamics before marital status began to play a role in their relationships and suggests that understanding how birth order, gender, and marital status interacted is necessary in order to understand how Georgian families operated. Sibling relationships predated marriage and parenthood and outlasted parents and even spouses. Despite assertions that “legitimate relationships in this world were vertical only,” the horizontal axis of sibling relationships sometimes paralleled, intersected, or conflicted with the vertical relationships between spouses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0363199011433123">8</xref>
</sup> Over twenty years ago, Davidoff and Hall remarked that “the latent element of power, the strong emotions aroused, the differing expectations for men and women, gave a fierce edge to fraternal ties.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0363199011433123">9</xref>
</sup> A study of eighteenth-century sibling probate disputes demonstrates that those latent elements of power and emotion were not just about differing gendered expectations but also about the practical impact of birth order and marital status.</p>
<p>Mary and Sarah’s role in the breakdown of their brother’s marriage reveals the convoluted links between marital status, gender, and birth order unique to sibling relationships. As single women, Mary and Sarah occupied an ambiguous position within Robert’s household and relative to Dorothy. As a prosperous apothecary, a freeman of the city, and the eldest brother, Robert had resources and certain responsibilities toward his sisters, but the limits of those responsibilities were ill-defined. Prescriptive literature often depicted a protective older brother providing for his young, single sisters until they married and safely secured a husband’s protection, but real families faced a very different reality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0363199011433123">10</xref>
</sup> High rates of singleness due to late marriage, no marriage, or widowhood meant that most adult sibling groups included at least one single sibling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0363199011433123">11</xref>
</sup> The combination of married and single brothers and sisters of various ages required brothers and sisters to know and practice careful sibling politics. The Punter experience reveals that sibling relations were a much messier place where multiple “claims and counter claims” were under constant negotiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0363199011433123">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A variety of approaches can be used to gain an understanding of power relations within families. What follows combines short case studies such as the Punters with a more statistical approach to over a hundred families. An analysis of probate disputes from the Gloucester Diocese and a sample of more detailed case studies, reveal power machinations between siblings that constituted an alternate power structure within families, with its own unique internal dynamics. The probate disputes offer an opportunity to see deeper fissures between siblings and the power conflicts behind those fissures. Despite recent assertions that primogeniture granted “the lion’s share of <italic>any</italic> inheritance to the firstborn son” and that sisters had “no legal leverage to compel … services” from their brothers, the evidence presented here shows sibling power constantly shifting based on gender, birth order, and marital status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0363199011433123">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Social scientists have long been fascinated by age and gender relations between siblings. Since at least the 1930s, social scientists have recognized the impact of birth order and gender on family relationships, but the connections among these factors and their connection to marital status has not received much attention in social scientific or historical literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0363199011433123">14</xref>
</sup> When discussing sibling relationships, historians of the 1970s and 1980s often emphasized primogeniture and its supposed power to “inevitably” generate a “gulf between the eldest son and heir and his younger brothers” and that “primogeniture sacrificed [younger brothers] for the sake of their elder brothers.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0363199011433123">15</xref>
</sup> Primogeniture and its connected inheritance schemes—entail and strict settlement (both increasingly popular in the eighteenth century)—explain only the property aspects of sibling relations and only for the landed classes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0363199011433123">16</xref>
</sup> Additionally, primogeniture established the position of elder sons, but it signaled paternal power more than fraternal. Fathers and grandfathers determined inheritance patterns that influenced generations; eldest brothers did not govern this system any more than their younger siblings did—they simply inherited it. The ecclesiastical-legal records of English dioceses are particularly suited for expanding the vision of sibling relations beyond primogeniture’s influence. Because dioceses did not have jurisdiction over real estate disputes, their records miss those aspects of family inheritance disputes most influenced by primogeniture and its related manifestations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0363199011433123">17</xref>
</sup> The families that appeared before the Diocese of Gloucester Court argued about personal property, not about houses and land, so disagreements over primogeniture cannot explain their conflicts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0363199011433123">18</xref>
</sup> Instead, they offer a view of sibling conflict where the claims between sisters and brothers were much messier.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s historians have reassessed families generally and siblings more specifically.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0363199011433123">19</xref>
</sup> Some have suggested that aside from primogeniture, eighteenth-century sibling relations were particularly strong. Leonore Davidoff and Catherine Hall classified sister relations, which were the least impacted by primogeniture and attendant privileges for elder brothers, as particularly close, but they also saw an especially strong closeness between sisters and brothers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0363199011433123">20</xref>
</sup> More recently, Linda Pollock’s 1998 article “Rethinking Patriarchy” and Leonore Davidoff’s 2005 article “Kinship as a Categorical Concept” used case studies to demonstrate the complex relationships between brothers and sisters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0363199011433123">21</xref>
</sup> When discussing nineteenth-century siblings, Davidoff noted that the “privileges” granted masculinity “effected [<italic>sic</italic>]brothers and sisters, but these were complicated by countervailing resources of age, personality and relationship to parents or other siblings on the part of sisters.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0363199011433123">22</xref>
</sup> Davidoff’s intriguing analysis of the Gladstone siblings is suggestive of the power struggles among brothers and sisters, which sometimes replicated and sometimes transcended inheritance schemes. Discussing seventeenth-century family relationships, Linda Pollock has argued that a full understanding of family power must take into account siblings and their ever-shifting “alliances.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0363199011433123">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The scholarship of Pollock and Davidoff and the work of Amy Froide and Naomi Tadmor on marital status and kinship have all hinted at the intricate power relations between siblings, but none of their work systematically analyzes a large group of siblings in the Georgian era, an era recognized as key in the history of English families. Studying probate disputes offers an opportunity to do so. The Gloucester Diocese, unlike other dioceses, kept probate disputes (testamentary causes) separate from the general probate files, allowing for their systematic analysis of the structures of sibling politics within multiple families over time. The diocesan court typically met once a month in a back corner of Gloucester Cathedral, where families brought suit against one another in instance causes—instances when the court did not know of any problem with an estate until the various litigants appealed for its arbitration. A final written decision by the court has not survived in most cases. However, as most petitioners merely asked the court to enforce the rules of probate (proving a will, granting letters of administration, requiring an inventory of the state to be completed), once these tasks were accomplished, the court need take no further action. For most cases, only the citation from the court and the granting of probate or administration of the estate survives. If the case consisted of more serious accusations of fraud or an undervalued estate, the court might have generated inventories and depositions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0363199011433123">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Gloucester Diocese sibling probate disputes cover 120 cases between 1715 and 1836, with one additional case in 1700 and 1842, respectively. The relatively low rate of sibling property disputes demonstrates how rarely sibling conflicted descended to this level. The families discussed here are not representative of all siblings, but they are representative of sibling conflict. The 122 cases provide raw data on several hundred siblings from a variety of occupations. Most families were yeoman or farmers, but many skilled trades (particularly those in textile-based trades) were also represented. Additionally, there were two gentlemen, a laborer, and a miner.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0363199011433123">25</xref>
</sup> The court did not routinely inventory the estates, so their average value is unknown. Of those with an inventory, the value ranged from less than £10 to £500.</p>
<p>Fully understanding the structure of sibling relations in these families required delving into parish registers to discover other siblings not involved in the cases in order to determine sibling set size, birth order, and marital status. Unfortunately, given the limited information on some of the petitions and the limited information in eighteenth-century parish registers and bishop’s transcripts, birth order and marital status could not be completely identified for all the families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0363199011433123">26</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the analysis that follows is based on two data sets: gender and some marital status data from the 122 families, and birth order and marital status data from 69 of those families identified in the parish registers. Those sixty-nine families contained 407 siblings—an average sibling set size of 5.89 (2.72 sisters, 3.17 brothers). If those numbers held true for the remaining fifty-three families, approximately 700 siblings would have been involved in the total number of cases.</p>
<p>Sibling conflict in the eighteenth century often grew from differing perceptions of fairness and equality stemming from the period’s contradictory messages to parents and siblings. In their families and households, brothers and sisters faced social and legal hierarchies that privileged elder children, males, and the married. They simultaneously confronted culturally and socially inscribed notions of sibling equality. Authors of eighteenth-century prescriptive literature, willfully ignoring the different property, financial, and educational resources invested in children, counseled parents to raise their children equally and advised siblings to treat one another equally. “[L]et all who have Brethren and Sisters possess their minds with a great and real kindness to them,” Richard Allestree wrote. Let brothers and sisters look on their siblings, he continued, “as parts of themselves, and then they will never think fit either to quarrel with them or to envy them any advantage … but will strive to advance and help forward the good of each other.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0363199011433123">27</xref>
</sup> These injunctions to encourage equality among siblings were complicated by the reality that most families did advance some children above others. Real families' experiences inspired and reflected prescription. William King, for example, did not want to make a will because he considered it an “Injustice in a parent to make an unequal Division of his Property amongst his Children,” but he threatened to cut off his daughter “with a shilling” if she married against his wishes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0363199011433123">28</xref>
</sup> In short, while he supported the idea of filial equality, King also reserved the right of parents to treat siblings unequally based on parental ideals.</p>
<p>Parents in early modern England bestowed their property on their children with a “remarkable equality.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0363199011433123">29</xref>
</sup> The phrase “share and share alike” was commonly used in wills to describe heirs' equal division of property. Though other heirs could receive similar admonishment, no other familial or social relation carried the same expectation to share and share alike not just in inheritance, but in all matters. The tension lay in how real life matched the expectation of equality. A father’s will might recommend that his wife distribute his estate among their children “in as equal proportions as may be,” but the phrase “as equal … as may be” seems to suggest that equality was graded on a curve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0363199011433123">30</xref>
</sup> Land, as William King also recognized, was the exception, the one place built-in privileges for elder sons went practically uncontested. As Amy Erickson has remarked, “the consensus … seems to have been that eldest sons ought to be privileged—but not too much.” She found that younger sons and daughters “usually had exactly equal provision,” or that they at least inherited fair proportions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0363199011433123">31</xref>
</sup> Yet, within the framework of fairness, parents still recognized hierarchies that ranked all siblings by birth order, gender, and marital status. Siblings enjoyed more equality and more familiarity than in any other mixed-sex relationship, but that equality was situated within a broader framework that ordered families, societies, and nations along hierarchal lines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0363199011433123">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>John Travell, a landowner from western Oxfordshire, demonstrated this pattern in his 1762 will. His eldest son (Francis) inherited the house and land in accordance with his grandfather’s will. The younger son received a university education and an inheritance, also provided by his grandfather’s will. The daughters received their various portions of the £5,000 granted their father’s “younger children” in his marriage settlement. The girls, however, did not receive equal portions; instead, their birth order determined the amounts given to them: the eldest (Frances Mary) received £1,400, and each younger daughter receiving £100 less than her next elder sister. Being male granted, the boys greater educational opportunities; being the eldest gave Francis the family property and Frances Mary the largest amount of money.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0363199011433123">33</xref>
</sup> The claims of equality were always in tension with the imposition of hierarchy.</p>
<p>Additionally, informal and formal forms of sibling social address replicated and grated against eighteenth-century hierarchies. Eldest brothers kept their surname with their fraternal designation. Siblings referred to younger sisters and brothers only by their forenames. In correspondence and diaries, the Travell sisters always labeled their eldest brother as “my Brother Travell” and their other brother as “my Brother Ferdinand.” The title of “Sister Travell,” ideally reserved for the eldest brother’s wife, also applied to the eldest single sister. Like other eighteenth-century families, the Sharp family of Northumberland, Durham, and London followed similar patterns and referred to their sisters-in-law by their brothers' names: “my sister James” or “my sister John.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0363199011433123">34</xref>
</sup> The formality and strict adherence families paid to such forms of address conflicted with the familiarity afforded siblings' use of nicknames. While letters might be addressed formally, references within the letters were often decidedly informal. The Travells referred to one another as Fanny, Kitty, and Nanny, suggesting that the formality demanded by genteel letter writing did not reflect the familiarity siblings enjoyed in face-to-face interactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0363199011433123">35</xref>
</sup> This type of labeling was common in eighteenth-century family correspondence and provides another example of the tension between equality in daily face-to-face association and the socially recognized practice of ranked titles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0363199011433123">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century social norms constantly placed siblings between the push and pull of equality and hierarchy. Probate disputes show the fault lines that developed when sisters and brothers did not manage the balance between encouragement of equality and inclination to internal hierarchies. The fissures cracked over gender, birth order, and marital status, but in such unexpected ways as to challenge our assumptions about the power of elder sons, primogeniture, and marriage.</p>
<p>Considering the dominance of primogeniture in the older literature and the assertions that brothers and sisters were particularly close, one would expect brother-versus-brother cases to predominate. But analysis of the cases demonstrates a more complicated, gendered power arrangement. Personal accounts prove that brother–sister ties were particularly close in many families, but this is juxtaposed against the probate disputes and the contentious brother–sister relations they expose.</p>
<p>In the 122 Gloucestershire cases, there were 152 incidents of sibling (including siblings-in-law) conflict. This number is derived from counting every sibling dynamic at play in each particular case. For example, if a case had an older sister and younger brother arguing against a middle brother, it would count as one incident of brother-versus-brother and one incident of sister versus brother conflict. In general, conflict was more likely between genders than within them. Mixed-sex disagreements made up 59.2 percent of the cases (ninety incidents) and same-sex conflicts made up 40.8 percent (sixty-two incidents; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363199011433123">Table 1</xref>). The single largest category was sister versus brother, with forty-eight incidents. Brothers argued against other brothers (thirty-nine incidents) almost as often as they argued against sisters (forty-two incidents). Sister-versus-sister conflict, however, occurred rarely, making up only 15 percent of the cases (twenty-three incidents). As men were more likely to be executors of wills, inheritance traditions set up brothers as the primary targets of disputes. However, with that tendency in mind, it is intriguing that brother-plaintiffs brought cases against their siblings of either gender in roughly equal numbers. When conflict arose, it took distinctly gendered turns. For women, sibling power struggles most often represented conflict with their brothers; for men, attempts to assert fraternal power could create conflict with either sisters or brothers. Sisters understood that their brothers and brothers-in-law could benefit not only from unequal inheritance practices but also “from unequal shares of the products of social labour.”<sup>

<p>That so many sisters had to resort to legal intervention fits with the notion that to combat the privileges granted to men, women had to use the legal system to enforce the equality they and prescriptive literature imagined as possible. As Amanda Vickery asserted, eighteenth-century women found patriarchy harder to take from brothers than from fathers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0363199011433123">38</xref>
</sup> These sisters also understood that they could use the legal system to their advantage. Sisters recognized that the law gave them equal share of any personal property of an intestate parent (as most parents were) and that judges were inclined to consider “fairness” in their decisions. In this way, sisters knew how to wield a general patriarchy embodied in the law to conquer a more immediate patriarchy embodied in their brothers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0363199011433123">39</xref>
</sup> Contributing to sister–brother conflicts were inheritance practices that supported sisters' demands against their brothers. Early modern fathers and judges, as Amy Erickson has argued, often tried to make inheritance fair between brothers and sisters, whereas mothers and aunts tended to privilege female heirs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0363199011433123">40</xref>
</sup> Alternatively, Ruth Perry argues that by the late eighteenth century, daughters' portions were declining and brother–sister conflict was on the rise.<sup>

</sup> In general, the Gloucestershire cases show spikes in brother–sister and sister–brother conflict in the 1730s and 1760s, but due to the small number of disputes, it is not clear whether this contradicts or confirms Perry’s argument.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0363199011433123">42</xref>
</sup> What is clear is that many cases show brothers pushing back against a parent’s efforts to equalize or privilege their sisters. William James, for instance, petitioned the court against his sister when their father’s will left her with a house, an orchard, and 1.5 acres, while he and his brothers received “one shilling each and no more.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0363199011433123">43</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The case of the Smith family underscores the pull between brothers and sisters' claims on equality. In her 1782 will, Hannah Smith, a coal miner’s widow, gave her “well-beloved” son Sampson her term in one house and her “well-beloved” married daughter Sarah her term in another house. Hannah indicated that Sampson and Sarah should equally share the payment of £3 to another sister. All of her personal property she instructed “to be Enjoyed by them share and equal share alike.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0363199011433123">44</xref>
</sup> Hannah made Sampson sole executor, but he delayed proving the will. His own reluctance to file and comply with their mother’s will did not stop him from filing a cause against his sister and brother-in-law in March 1784, demanding they take out letters of administration for their father’s estate. Equally disinclined to comply with her brother and the court, Sarah delayed taking out the letters until 1786. In the meantime, her patience with Sampson’s delay wore thin, and in June 1784, she demanded he bring their mother’s will to be proved. Sampson, however, dragged his feet until 1785 before surrendering executorship to his sister.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0363199011433123">45</xref>
</sup> With no freehold land to inherit, Sampson and Sarah were legally equal. That perception meant their conflict had no quick resolution. Sarah, the elder sister, may not have appreciated her younger brother’s efforts to obstruct her inheritance. In turn, Sampson, whose gender would have privileged him in most other interactions, may have resented Sarah’s control of their father’s goods.</p>
<p>In all of the delay-and-annoy tactics employed by Sampson and Sarah, their sister Hannah and Sarah’s husband were virtually invisible. Whatever conflict existed between Widow Smith’s “well-beloved” children, it centered on Sampson and Sarah. This was true throughout the probate cases. Of the forty-eight sister versus brother conflicts, forty were between blood siblings, and only eight involved in-laws. When it came to female versus male conflicts, blood proved more volatile than water. The Smith case also demonstrates that brothers, despite the privileges of their sex, sometimes had to rely on the court to enforce equitable sibling relations. The male versus female cases were the second most common occurrence, but with an important distinction in whom they argued against. Brothers argued against their sisters (nineteen times) nearly as often as they argued against their sisters-in-law (twenty times). This pattern will be discussed later, but it is notable that while sisters fought against consanguineal brothers, brothers fought against consanguineal <italic>and</italic> affinal sisters.</p>
<p>What about disagreements between members of the same sex? Generally conflicts between blood relations were more common than disputes between in-laws. Male versus male conflict made up thirty-nine incidents, approximately a quarter of all conflicts. The bulk of these were between blood brothers (twenty-nine of the thirty-nine). It was more common for brothers to go against other brothers than against their sisters (twenty-nine vs. nineteen incidents), perhaps highlighting men’s recognition of other men’s predominance in inheritance matters.</p>
<p>The smaller amount of sister–sister conflict supports claims that sisters had particularly close relationships; inheritance practices allowed the flourishing of amicability and equality among the have-nots.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0363199011433123">46</xref>
</sup> Further analysis, however, serves as a caution against the perception of conflict-free sisterly ties. Of the twenty-three incidents of female versus female conflict, twelve were sister against sister. Conflicts between a sister of the deceased and the widow of the deceased were uncommon (eight incidents), as were conflicts started by widows against their husband’s sisters, as in the Punter family (two incidents). So sororal conflict between women was much more likely with sisters one had shared a childhood with than with sisters who joined the family via marriage.</p>
<p>Compared to earlier periods, the likelihood of mixed-sex conflicts increased in the eighteenth century. In the middle ages, brother–brother conflict was more common. Barbara Hanwalt’s analysis of medieval interfamilial crime patterns revealed that in manorial land disputes, the biggest proportion of interfamilial conflict was between siblings—particularly brothers (55 percent of the cases). Sister-versus-sister conflict and brother-versus-sister conflict added up to less than 15 percent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0363199011433123">47</xref>
</sup> Some of this could be attributed to inheritance practices that privileged males as owners of land, but it is intriguing that in counties like Norfolk and Essex that practiced equal partible inheritance, land disputes were more likely to descend into homicidal rage than in counties like York and Northamptonshire where primogeniture was the practice. And in the seventeenth-century families, remarkably, seemed to have less conflict between brothers and sisters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0363199011433123">48</xref>
</sup> By the eighteenth century, however, social attitudes had changed sibling conflict. Strict settlement and entail were practiced more often, but a language of social equality was more pervasive as old ideas about the natural order started to crumble under the Enlightenment’s onslaught. Sibling conflict between the genders increased as women’s and men’s experiences more often paralleled one another and as debates over women’s position grew heated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0363199011433123">49</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Smith siblings' experience hints at the importance of birth order to sibling politics. Adding birth order to the analysis of the cases required searching for the squabbling families in parish registers. The sibling sets for sixty-nine cases were identified, representing 56.6 percent of the total cases. The sixty-nine cases involved 407 siblings (188 sisters, 219 brothers) and contained eighty-six incidents of sibling conflict. Because siblings not mentioned in the cases could not always be identified as living or dead at the time of the case, the sibling set size reflects the total number of children, not just those living, and not just those arguing over the probate. Again, if a dispute involved several siblings, all birth-order dynamics were counted, but not each sibling.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the overall pattern shows a slight preference for older siblings arguing against their younger siblings instead of the reverse (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363199011433123">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363199011433123">3</xref>); forty-six of the total cases, or 53 percent, were older siblings versus younger siblings. Even without factoring in gender, this slightly greater inclination for older siblings to bring cases against younger siblings indicates that age alone could not guarantee a sibling any power. Resorting to using the court exposed a sibling’s overall lack of power in persuading other brothers and sisters to administer the estate or distribute legacies. Apparently, being the oldest brother could grant one socially and culturally recognized power, but it did not promise any automatically privileged standing with younger siblings of either sex. Despite prescription that simplified sibling age structures by emphasizing protective older brothers and single younger sisters, real families encountered a variety of age and gender combinations that had older siblings seeking extrafamilial intervention slightly more often than younger siblings.</p>

<p>Considering the combination of gender- and birth-order information opens new ways of understanding eighteenth-century sibling interaction. Brothers were almost three times more likely than sisters to be defendants (sixty-two incidents to twenty-four). That is not particularly surprising, but what is surprising is that older brothers were slightly less likely than younger brothers to be defendants (twenty-nine to thirty-three). This tendency highlights the unstable nature of birth order. Childhood mortality might claim a quarter to a third of a sibling set.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0363199011433123">50</xref>
</sup> Even if siblings survived to adolescence, the vicissitudes of health, injury, and medicine meant death was a constant possibility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0363199011433123">51</xref>
</sup> Siblings squabbling in the diocesan court were typically older than thirty, and many of them were older than forty. This meant that whatever birth order had been established, mortality had reshaped it and the sibling politics it affected multiple times. A brief description of the Travell family’s shifting relative birth order illustrates its instability.</p>
<p>The John and Ann Travell family mentioned earlier had thirteen children between 1726 and 1748. Their first two children were boys, born in the 1720s, both of whom survived childhood. The next three children (two girls and a boy) all died in childhood, and the next three children, born in the 1730s (also two girls and a boy), survived. Of the last five children, two girls, born 1742 and 1748, survived. If there were a snapshot of the family in early 1749, the family would appear to have a secure birth order: the eldest brother, twenty-two-year-old John, trained in the law and destined to inherit the family property; twenty-year-old Francis educated at Oxford and preparing for an army career; the five younger children (four girls, one boy) all under thirteen and at home. However, if there were a snapshot from just a few months later, it would reveal that the birth-order hierarchy had completely reshuffled. John died in April 1749, and all the privileges intended for him, and for which he had had twenty years of training, passed to his younger brother Francis, who had never been groomed for such a role.</p>
<p>For the next fourteen years, while their parents were still alive, Francis and his siblings grew accustomed to his new position, but he did not have to interrupt his military career and assume any family responsibility. When their parents died within four months of each other during the fall and winter of 1762–1763, Francis was called home from a campaign in France to assume the role of family patriarch. After 1763, however, Francis' standing began to decline. In 1763 and 1767, he fathered two illegitimate sons with a woman not deemed a suitable marriage partner. As a man, these children did not ruin his chances of becoming an appropriately masculine head of family. He was not yet forty and possessed a comfortable estate; there was still a chance he would marry and produce legitimate heirs. He never did. At some point, his siblings must have realized that although he occupied their childhood home, he would not be able to pass it along; settlement stipulations in their grandfather’s will had already determined that the estate would go to his younger brother, Ferdinando.</p>
<p>Once the family realized Francis would not produce a legitimate heir, their expectations in the 1760s and 1770s must have centered on Ferdinando’s ability to inherit and then pass the property to his sons. Ferdinando, trained in the church, well married, and possessed of keen financial skills, seemed ideally suited to assume the role of heir if necessary, or at least to support his brother until his own children could inherit. By 1781, however, this proved impossible. Ferdinando’s wife died, leaving him with their two teenage daughters. Only in his early forties, he could have remarried and perhaps fathered a son, but he never did. Again, entail would make Ferdinando at best a life-term tenant on the family’s land, assuming he outlived Francis. In the mid-1780s, when the youngest Travell sibling, Agnes, produced three boys in rapid succession, Ferdinando began to direct his considerable talents toward the future of his nephews. First, he sustained their father and mother during a bankruptcy, and then he ensured that the lands he had acquired through his own efforts and patronage (most notably a fine manor and living in eastern Gloucestershire) would go to his nephews.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0363199011433123">52</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that while privileging eldest sons was supposed to guarantee the perpetuation of inheritance and lineage, it could take years before any individual family knew who would preserve family lines and property for the future. In 1749, the Travells assumed it would be John; in the 1750s and 1760s, they assumed it would be Francis; in the 1770s and 1780s, they assumed it would be Ferdinando. In the end, the property and associated prestige, passed not through the eldest son, or any of the sons, but through the <italic>youngest</italic> daughter. Not every family was like the Travells, but many families faced ever-shifting birth-order variations, and this may account for elder and younger brothers equally sharing the load as defendants against irate siblings. Additionally, if death could ravage a sibling set by the time they reached adulthood, by the time they reached middle age it could leave younger brothers as only brothers—rendering them simultaneously the younger brother and the oldest male heir.</p>
<p>Printed literature flattened the instability of birth order and emphasized younger brothers' unfair treatment. Eighteenth-century publications bemoaned the fate of younger sons, decrying the privileges of primogeniture that left younger sons exposed even when they were more suited to family governance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0363199011433123">53</xref>
</sup> The common proverb about making someone “a younger brother” referenced the unfair advantages given elder brothers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0363199011433123">54</xref>
</sup> The probate disputes, however, demonstrate that brothers brought cases against younger and elder brothers in almost equal numbers (thirteen and fifteen instances, respectively). The more common situation was an older sister versus a younger brother (twenty incidents), which represented 23 percent of the total cases and 43 percent of all occurrences of older versus younger disputes. Older sisters brought cases almost exclusively against brothers; the three cases of older sisters against younger sisters pale in comparison. Older sisters, like Sarah (Smith) Fudge, who had the advantage of age, may have chafed when her younger brothers thought they did not need to consider their elder sisters' wishes in administering an estate. Prescription and scholarship rarely considered this dynamic, where age privileged the female and gender privileged the younger, and the poor fit of this dynamic with prevailing social attitudes could explain its particular explosiveness. It is in such relationships that injunctions about equality and reminders of hierarchy mixed in volatile ways.</p>
<p>Birth order analysis underscores that sibling conflict was not just caused by resentment of gendered privileges for brothers. As stated, sisters were more inclined to go after younger brothers (twenty incidents) than after older brothers (fourteen incidents); younger brothers opposed older sisters on only seven occasions. Fourteen younger sisters who took their older brothers to court knew they could get the court to enforce a greater equality than their gender and birth order generally gave claims to. Younger brothers were more likely to be defendants than younger sisters (thirty-three to thirteen), but of those thirteen younger sisters, ten defended themselves against the claims of <italic>older</italic> brothers. The age and gender relationship seemingly entirely in favor of the brother appears to have been just as fragile and contentious as its reverse. While brothers and sisters who brought cases may have been lacking the sibling power to get their way outside of court, they clearly understood the rules of inheritance and knew that with the court’s backing they could get their share. In this way, they wielded a type of negative power—not strong enough to directly influence their siblings, but determined enough to employ the ecclesiastical-legal system to bend more powerful siblings to their will.</p>
<p>Overall, the addition of birth-order analysis to the larger pattern of gender conflict among siblings reveals that notions of equality butted up against real differences of circumstances in sometimes toxic ways. Where sibling relations best replicated accepted attitudes about equality (sister–sister, e.g.), there was relatively little conflict over inheritance. Where relations diverged widely, as they did between younger brothers and older sisters, siblings were less able to negotiate their disagreements without legal intervention.</p>
<p>Sisters and brothers' marriages further complicated sibling politics and efforts to maintain equitable relations. Marriage could upset the delicate balance of power among siblings—something parents, but not prescriptive authors, recognized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0363199011433123">55</xref>
</sup> Other than Mary Wollstonecraft’s remark that single brothers and sisters could get along with a “tolerable degree of comfort” until a brother’s marriage turned the sister into “an unnecessary burden on the benevolence of the master of the house and his new partner,” prescriptive literature rarely detailed what happened to brothers and sisters after a sibling married.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0363199011433123">56</xref>
</sup> Most prescriptive literature assumed that elder brothers cared for younger sisters and were in turn refined by their sisters until they both married. After marriage the role of protector and closest friend shifted to a woman’s husband. “A Woman without a Husband,” so the argument went, was “like a Ship without a Rudder; She may happen to get into Harbour well, but there are great Odds against it.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0363199011433123">57</xref>
</sup> Yet, brothers and sisters could not jettison sibling ties when they married. Many of them spent a considerable length of time as single young adults or as widowed older adults and entered matrimony after twenty or thirty years of established sibling relationships and shared memories. Parents, keenly aware of the greater financial instability for single daughters, inadvertently contributed to the uncertain world of sibling politics by allotting more resources to single daughters than to their married sisters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0363199011433123">58</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Determining sisters' marital status in the probate cases is easier than determining brothers' marital status; because marital status did not affect men’s legal status, the court records do not mention it. Despite a woman being legally under her husband’s protections, the court documents rarely listed sisters' husbands as colitigants. Instead, a sister’s husband’s name and perhaps occupation were listed much as her brother’s occupation was. While coverture made husbands the true litigant, it was her standing as a sister (not a wife or daughter) that gave her, and him, legal footing. The cases contain marital information on sixty-three female plaintiffs and fifty-four female defendants. Married sisters instigated probate cases more often than widowed or single sisters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363199011433123">Table 4</xref>). While some of this discrepancy comes from the higher numbers of married women versus single women, it is still remarkable that widowed and single women combined made up fewer of the plaintiffs than married sisters. Married sisters may have determined that a husband’s presence would strengthen their standing in a legal battle or engaged in the battle at his behest. The high number of married sisters seeking the court’s intervention reflects their diminished power among their siblings. Marriage may have bolstered a man’s position with his siblings because he was then able to benefit from his wife’s emotional and familial labor. Sisters, however, found their labor—always attached to domestic and familial concerns—diffused over three families: natal, conjugal, and affinal.</p>

<p>Married sisters, such as Frances (Jason) Perrott, could find themselves doubly disadvantaged. In 1731, Frances charged that her single sister, Ann, administratrix of their brother’s estate, had not distributed Frances' portion. When Ann died later that year, she gave money to aunts, friends, servants, a shilling to her brother Robert, and the rest of her property and money to “my two loving Sisters Catherine Jason and Celia Jason.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0363199011433123">59</xref>
</sup> Frances was not mentioned. The Jason family conflict, however, does not appear to stem from long-standing resentment between the sisters but rather appears to be a manifestation of marriage’s impact on a sister’s standing within her natal family (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199011433123">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Before the 1731 case, Frances and her siblings, excluding their eldest brother Warren, had received equal inheritances: either £1,000 or a comparable combination of money and land when they turned twenty-one or married.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0363199011433123">60</xref>
</sup> When their father inherited an additional £800 from his sister, each child received and additional £100, except Robert, who received £200. Warren was under thirty when he died, and he left no widow or children. He also left no will because the title and any land associated with it devolved to twenty-year-old Robert. Without a will, Warren’s five surviving siblings were entitled to equal portions of his personal property. It was this one-fifth Frances wanted the court to force Ann to distribute. Ann’s will is telling in the lack of information about Frances. Because Robert had inherited the title and land from Warren, Robert’s one shilling from Ann was not a “one shilling cut-off” but a place marker indicating her remembrance of him.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0363199011433123">61</xref>
</sup> Celia and Catherine—twenty-three and almost twenty-two years old, respectively—could still hope to marry and needed provision in the meantime. Frances, on the other hand, was married and established and presumably in no need of assistance from Ann. Ann, the eldest sister, decided her unmarried younger sisters needed her support more, either to maintain economic independence or to attract more eligible suitors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0363199011433123">62</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>All of the Jason siblings received their inheritance when they acquired the mantle of adulthood, either through age or marriage, but marriage shifted the sisters' roles and power within the family. Like Frances (Jason) Perrott, Ann Courtier Hart could not accept her father’s injunction that his married daughters “shall peaceably and quietly quit and surrender their right and power to the … unmarried.” She brought a suit against her brother Isaac despite their father’s further stipulation that if all his daughters should marry, they should “have no share, right, or title” to the property “but shall peaceably and quietly quit the same, after which I give and bequeath the same unto my son Isaac to his own proper use and behoof.” Isaac’s marital status did not affect his inheritance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0363199011433123">63</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the lack of information about brothers' marital status, who brothers fought against in court nevertheless appears to have been affected by their brothers' marital status. Brothers did not bring cases against their sisters as often as they did against their brothers' widows (twenty incidents, representing 13.2 percent of the total cases). In 1799, when Charles Park, brother of deceased William Park, had the court cite William’s “pretended” widow, he hoped to trump her rights as widow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0363199011433123">64</xref>
</sup> William’s widow, Ann, argued, correctly, that her rights as widow superseded his claims as brother. Both parties understood that if she could not prove she had married William, Charles, as William’s only surviving sibling, stood to inherit all of his brother’s estate. Despite the law’s long-standing recognition of widows' rights, eighteenth-century brothers may have considered that their claims to fraternal ties could conquer those based on conjugal ties, particularly when the in-law was female (brothers brought suits against their sisters' husbands only four times). Historians have interpreted this attitude as an indication of declining widows' property rights. Alternatively, they have seen the brothers' lack of success as an indication that conjugal rights were increasingly narrowing the scope and rights of other kin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0363199011433123">65</xref>
</sup> In light of sibling conflicts, however, it can also reveal deep-seeded expectations about the rewards of fraternal ties.</p>
<p>If James Walden's 1795 will and the Cowdall brothers' experience in 1740-41 are any indication, perhaps brothers had reasons to believe their brothers would pit fraternal against conjugal responsibilities. James Walden made his wife, Sarah, the principal heir of his freehold estate and personal property as long as she did not “diminish or demolish” any part of it because after her death he intended it for his brother, William, a shopkeeper. Unsurprisingly, given the explicit opposition of fraternal against conjugal ties, William based his complaint on Sarah’s inventory of her husband’s goods. Getting the property valued at just over £141 meant he could use that as evidence of what he stood to inherit at Sarah’s death and to ensure that she did not “diminish” it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0363199011433123">66</xref>
</sup> Some brothers tried to attack the validity of their brothers' wills in order to claim a larger portion of the property. The three Cowdall brothers accused their sister-in-law of producing a fraudulent will in 1741. Evocatively, despite the fact that the brothers equally inherited clothes, linen, and wool with their sister, their sister did not join in their suit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0363199011433123">67</xref>
</sup> Brothers like the Parks, Waldens, and Cowdalls seem to have considered their widowed sisters-in-law vulnerable to counterclaims on the deceased’s estate. Though the court rarely agreed, many men apparently considered fraternal connections to male inheritance privileges more lasting than conjugal ones. In-laws' assumption of the titles <italic>brother</italic> or <italic>sister</italic> positioned them as equal with consanguineal siblings. However, the acquisition of a spouse meant the supplanting of a sibling by an even closer relation. This proved difficult to manage for some siblings, such as the Punters, for some brothers and their sisters-in-law, and for married sisters trying to exert power among their siblings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Probate disputes constituted the last chapter in long stories about sibling power struggles. In 1799, when Thomas Bright anticipated his twenty-something sons would disagree over the estate, he recognized that they had already established patterns of disagreement, competition, or acrimony. He determined that those patterns made his sons unable to “agree in the partition” and that he would have to use his will “to prevent as far as possible any disputes which shall or may happen to arise between them.” He ordered that if they could not agree on the division, then they were to sell everything at “publick auction” and split the resulting cash “fairly and equally.” If the Bright brothers could not agree on the calculus of estate distribution, then perhaps simple division could stymie their battles. Instead, after Thomas had the will proved in 1805, he and John continued to bicker. Thomas had probated the will, but John argued that his brother had undervalued their father’s estate and demanded a new inventory in 1818. One can imagine the tension in fraternal relations during those thirteen years, a long-standing tension ignited by their father’s death and smoldering ever since. Whatever youthful resentments the Bright brothers had, they nurtured them well into middle age.<sup>

<p>Families, as R. W. Connell has remarked, are unique institutions: “In no other institution are relationships so extended in time, so intensive in contact, so dense in their interweaving of economics, motion, power and resistance.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0363199011433123">69</xref>
</sup> Sibling power struggles and resistance were sometimes connected with primogeniture, entail, and strict settlement but also, at times, transcended propertied inheritance schemes. These schemes did not “govern” all sibling relations but was one aspect of birth order and gender.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0363199011433123">70</xref>
</sup> The Diocese of Gloucester probate disputes reveal the tensions between normative expectations of gender, birth order, and marital status and the real-life implementation of sibling power. Birth order on its own, however, was not sufficient to determine power. Birth order may have determined who received the second- or third-best set of bedding—as it did for the daughters of the yeoman Samuel Courtier in his 1766 will—but it was their brother’s gender that determined he would receive <italic>the</italic> best set of bedding as well as the house, livestock, money, and husbandry tools.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0363199011433123">71</xref>
</sup> And it was the sisters' marital status that determined whether they would inherit at all.</p>
<p>In none of the Gloucester disputes did siblings resist the maintenance of family property in the hands of one brother, seemingly accepting this niche of inequality as long as other markers of equality were maintained. Primogeniture, strict settlement, and entail affected only a portion of testators, and much about them it was determined by earlier generations. Beyond that, siblings expected fair and equal treatment in matters of inheritance. They shared William King’s attitude. In the years before his death, King resisted his daughter’s pressures to make a will. He asserted that because he held his children in “equal esteem regard and affection,” they should divide his property equally. William understood the law, as shown by his statement “that he had no Houses or Lands to settle, and asked what he should make a Will for?”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0363199011433123">72</xref>
</sup> Siblings realized that if there were land, it would go to a son, in order of age, and if there were no land, then they stood to receive an equal portion. Conflict arose when reality did not match their perceptions of that equality. Siblings who appealed to the court tried to enforce a type of “equality” that, while not strictly equal, encouraged brothers and sisters to “share and share alike.”</p>
<p>Much of the tension described here resulted from a long-standing tradition of sibling equality and developing social and political ideals confronting other practices that privileged some siblings based on age, sex, or marriage. While medieval women “were never offered anything like equality with men within the family economy,” their early modern and Georgian counterparts expected a modicum of equality with their brothers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0363199011433123">73</xref>
</sup> As John Locke noted a century before, “a father may have natural right to some kind of power over his children, is easily granted; but that an elder brother has so over his brethren, remains to be proved.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0363199011433123">74</xref>
</sup> Eighteenth-century brothers and sisters still considered differential sibling privileges unproved and untenable.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, historians have just begun to explore the “fierce edge” of sibling relations.<sup>75</sup> More research, particularly about step-siblings and illegitimate siblings, is necessary to completely flesh out the picture of historical sibling relations. The Gloucester evidence demonstrates that the edginess of sibling politics developed when relationships diverged sharply from expectations of equality or when a sister or brother considered that he or she had not received the just rewards of siblinghood.</p>

Robert, Mary, and Sarah were three of the five children of Robert Punter and Mary Willmott, residents of St. Mary de Grace parish. Robert Sr. was a mercer of Gloucester and had been sheriff in 1680. Robert Sr.’s 1713 will, after providing for his wife, left the residue to be equally divided among his unnamed children. Robert and Mary were married in 1672 in Gloucester. Robert Jr. became a freeman of the city on May 29, 1702, and his brother Joseph became one on August 3, 1713.

<p>This is based on the combination of information on siblings with marriage, mortality, and remarriage rates. Most adult sibling sets averaged five siblings, with 5 percent to 25 percent never marrying, average marriage ages in the early to mid-twenties, life expectancies ranging between thirty-five and forty-five over the course of the eighteenth century and gaps between widowhood and remarriage of two to four and a half years.

<p>Because marital status for men usually went unmentioned in the records, it is not always possible to determine male marital status at the time of the dispute. Occupational mobility, multiple marriages, deaths far from home, and gaps in the parish records meant that it was not always possible to trace all siblings over their life course. Tracing the Punter siblings, for example, required searching the several urban parishes of Gloucester, searching apprenticeship and freeman’s records, and conducting an expanded probate search in two jurisdictions, and even then it was not possible to trace all of the siblings from birth to death, even for this family of relatively prosperous social standing.</p>

Hanawalt uses gaol delivery records and manorial dispute records to study both homicidal and less violent family crime. The rate of interfamilial crime was comparatively low in the fourteenth century; see pages 151–83. While Hanawalt recognizes other forms of sibling conflict and rivalry, her analysis tends to reduce it to brother-versus-brother conflict.</p>

<p>Mary Hartman, <italic>The Household and the Making of History: A Subversive View of the Western Past</italic> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004). Hartman’s powerful argument emphasizes the impact of late marriage for women in setting western Europe on a unique historical path. That path, according to Hartman, explains the increased tension between the genders and the fragile foundations for masculinity in the early modern western world. On the impact of age on social standing, see Holly Brewer, <italic>By Birth or Consent: Children, Law, and the Anglo-American Revolution in Authority</italic> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 360. Sibling contention over partible inheritance is also evident in revolutionary France and nineteenth- and twentieth-century Brittany.
