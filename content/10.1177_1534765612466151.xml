<p>The study of police officers’ trauma through the police culture perspective reveals a unique form of trauma with biological, psychological, and sociocultural implications. The author presents an inclusive and dimensional theoretical conceptualization of police trauma, termed Police Complex Spiral Trauma (PCST), which constitutes a symbolic representation of the cumulative and complex form of police trauma that often expands as a unified process and form through time, tension, and frequency of police officers’ multiple and potentially traumatic exposure during their life-long career. This perspective of police trauma will help us better understand its distinct nature, inspire the formulation of research questions for an exploration of multifaceted evidence-based treatments that correspond to the challenges of police work, and develop relevant curricula for police trainees and preventive intervention policy programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The studies from the scientific literature about the challenges of police work, the notions of police culture, and the multifaceted effects (physical, psychological, social, and cultural) of police officers’ exposure to a potentially traumatic incident lead to the realization about the unique nature of police trauma, which is cumulative over time, complex, and multifaceted; especially taking into consideration the unpredictability and variety of the threatening and stressful situations that police officers might encounter over the course of their career in police. Therefore, this author aims to give a systemic conceptualization of the complexity of police trauma that shows in a symbolic way the cumulative, complex, and multiple form of the intensity, frequency, and long-term exposure of police officers to potentially traumatic incidents during their career in police. Risk and protective factors and cultural background of police officers are also important contributors in the formulation of such a systemic conceptualization. This conceptualization is depicted by the symbolic representation of the spiral form. Thereby, it is an embodiment, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534765612466151">Pietrzak et al. (2012)</xref> suggests, of the importance for a more inclusive and dimensional conceptualization of police trauma. Such an endeavor intends to “give voice” to the suffering of many police officers who face adversities on the line of duty. This dimensional and inclusive conceptualization of police trauma is an effort to show that underneath the uniform there are human beings with their own needs, strengths, values, culture, and history. In other words, it symbolizes the need for police trauma recognition, better understanding, and further support for the people whose “ethic of care” makes them devote their lives to serving our communities.</p>
<p>Thereby, discussion about the inclusive and dimensional symbolic representation of police trauma facilitates its recognition, to better understand it along with the applications associated with such a conceptualization. The recognition and understanding of the complexity of police trauma with the symbolic formulation of it, aims to initiate a discussion for its multiple applications in the development of preventive intervention policy programs in police training and work. Such policy programs may include practice-based multifaceted preventive interventions on a systemic basis and police teaching curricula that correspond to the philosophy of the novel dimensional and inclusive conceptualization of police trauma presented in this article. These endeavors would, in turn, lead to the formulation of new research questions for the development of innovative evidence-based interventions in helping police officers deal with trauma-related issues and the transformation of certain stereotypes of the police culture that often prevent police officers to “call for help.”</p>

<title>Conceptualizing Police Trauma</title>
<p>Police officers can experience serious injury while on duty, injury or death of a colleague, life-threatening incidents against them or others, terrorist attacks, hostage negotiations, intense crime scenes, exposure to fatal traffic accidents, murders, suicides, and they may also deal with abused children, raped women, battered women, perpetrators of trauma, and other forms of traumata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612466151">Atkinson-Tovar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612466151">Karlsson &amp; Christianson, 2003</xref>). Although the traumatized person has a sense of unpredictability and helplessness, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612466151">Herman (1992</xref>, p.47) states, police officers are sworn and mandated to confront trauma on a “. . . predictable although episodic basis.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk, McFarlane, &amp; Weisaeth, 1996</xref>, p. 445). Thus, one might ask the following: Do police officers experience trauma?</p>
<p>It seems that there is a series of incidents that police officers very often have to face, taking into account that these incidents are part of their duties. Some may support the notion that police officers, who have to confront this kind of incidents, may have not been impacted because habituation or systematic desensitization may occur through time. However, these “. . . are not ordinary events, regardless of how many times they are experienced.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi, 2007</xref>, p.117). Although many people might believe that police officers are invincible and able to confront a threatening situation with no personal consequences, research shows that almost one third (~35%) of police officers who are exposed to a potentially traumatic incident develop posttraumatic stress and 10% of them encounter serious posttraumatic stress, which indicates that police officers are at a greater risk in the development of full or partial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) taking into account that the percentage of PTSD diagnosis in the general population is almost 8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612466151">Austin-Ketch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612466151">Dowling, Genet, &amp; Moynihan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612466151">Haugen, Evces, &amp; Weiss, 2012</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612466151">Darensburg et al. (2006)</xref> found that officers aged 50 years or older had 40% higher PTSD prevalence ratio than officers aged 40 years or younger. They contend that the long-term stressful nature of police work and officers’ exposure to potentially traumatic situations increases the risk of police officers’ diagnosis with PTSD over time of service. The situation of police officers in small towns and rural areas is not better than their urban or suburban counterparts considering the fact that they encounter other forms of stressors (e.g., working conditions or work activity) and they have limited access to stress management and critical incident stress management training programs and resources, which often makes them feel more insecure and less self-confident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534765612466151">Oliver &amp; Meier, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534765612466151">Rudofossi (2009</xref>, p. 59) states that police officers encounter a range from 10 to 900 plus events that could potentially be classified as traumatic over their career. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534765612466151">Pietrzak et al. (2012)</xref> studied a total of 8,466 police officers who were involved in World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery effort and their results suggest that police officers had lower rates of PTSD (6.2%) compared to other first response emergency workers (firefighters, construction and sanitation workers, and unaffiliated volunteers; 7.2%-21.2%), which reinforces the view of many scholars who support the value of the ongoing screening process during recruitment, work experience, and training. Preparation and expecting the possibility of such an exposure might have played a role into lower PTSD rates of police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534765612466151">Perrin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534765612466151">Piertrzak et al., 2012</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534765612466151">Piertrzak et al. (2012)</xref> found that the number of police officers with subsyndromal PTSD (symptoms below the necessary criteria for a PTSD diagnosis) was three times greater (~15%) than those with PTSD and, further, those police officers had significantly higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, panic disorder, alcohol abuse, and somatic symptoms).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk et al. (1996)</xref> stress the first, often overlooked, stage of trauma, which they call “anticipation of trauma.” (pp.446, 447) Thereby, the trauma exposure of police officers begins before their actual exposure to the actual traumatic event and this stage constitutes the anticipatory stage of trauma, which is common in some professional groups such as police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1534765612466151">Starcke, Wolf, Markowitsch, and Brand (2008)</xref> state that anticipatory stress can lead to disadvantageous decision making even when there are explicit and stable information in terms of the outcome of the task. Also, exposure to a prediction of a disaster may lead to mild PTSD-like reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612466151">Kiser et al., 1993</xref>). The aforementioned reactions during the anticipatory stage of trauma seem to be worse in individuals experiencing PTSD in comparison with others who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612466151">Grillon et al., 2009</xref>). Based on the aforementioned findings of the extant literature, it seems that the anticipatory stage of trauma leads to PTSD-like symptoms or to difficulty in the right decision making even when there is a clear prediction about the outcome of the event. However, in the case of the law enforcement field there is an uncertainty during the anticipatory stage and the outcomes are not clear. Moreover, it seems that the aforementioned PTSD-like symptoms and anticipatory stress do not pause through police officers’ lifetime. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1534765612466151">Terr (1990)</xref> states that “. . . traumatic anxiety does not spontaneously dissipate during one’s lifetime” (p. 214). Although critical and serious incidents constitute a “second life” of police officers, these unusual, extraordinary, incidents could traumatize them over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, police officers have to deal on a daily basis with extraordinary incidents and they are exposed to several unusual events. Also, part of police work is the anticipation of such incidents. Therefore, police officers may be traumatized not only through the anticipation of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk et al., 1996</xref>) but also directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1534765612466151">Terr, 1990</xref>), for example, threatening events of their own lives, and indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612466151">Atkinson-Tovar, 2003</xref>) (secondary or vicarious trauma), for example, child abuse cases and fatal traffic accidents. We should also take into consideration that these traumatic experiences and exposure of police officers is long-term due to the fact that they constitute a great part of their work. Thereby, police officers face a multitude of potentially traumatizing situations, which are interrelated and unified under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612466151">Herman’s (1992)</xref> concept of “complex post-traumatic stress disorder” (p. 112) because during their shifts a traumatic incident might occur (anticipation of trauma), for example, they receive a phone call to arrest a person who holds a gun, they have to face traumatic incidents, and/or they experience a traumatic event vicariously. In a more tangible way, they have to respond to a bank robbery (anticipatory trauma) shortly after they protected a battered woman from her violent husband (vicarious trauma) or after having to deal with a life-threatening incident (e.g., hostage negotiation). Although the traumatic incidents are different in nature, they are accumulated throughout a police officer’s career and they are manifested with the form of the prolonged and repeated trauma that is conceptualized as “complex post-traumatic stress disorder” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612466151">Herman, 1992</xref>, p. 112). Thus, all these traumatic incidents, as a whole, are intertwined and unified shaping the complex form of trauma. However, as already mentioned, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534765612466151">Pietrzak et al. (2012)</xref> found that police officers involved in WTC-related rescue and recovery effort had lower PTSD rates compared with the other emergency workers involved in the ground zero rescue and recovery effort and, hence, they argue that police officers’ training, experience, preparation, and the screening process during the recruitment might contribute to officers’ ability to deal with these incidents effectively. Other scholars contend that professional and peer supervision is important in helping police officers reflect on the critical incident they experienced which, in turn, leads them to personal development and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1534765612466151">Shochet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1534765612466151">Tehrani, 2010</xref>). The question is whether police officers ask for help or to what extent do they get support, and in what form, within the context of the police culture. In order to reach the whole concept of police trauma and the complexity of the effects of the police officers’ exposure to potentially traumatic incidents, we should focus on the police culture because this exploration will help the comprehension of the complexity of police trauma and its multifaceted nature.</p>

<title>Police Culture</title>
<p>The unique nature of the law enforcement field has developed a distinct subculture that encompasses its own tenets, rules, customs, language, and mentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1534765612466151">Woody, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1534765612466151">2006</xref>). This subculture within the law enforcement field is called “police culture.” Police culture is characterized, on the one hand, by internal solidarity, brotherhood, and support and, on the other hand, by isolation from the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1534765612466151">Woody, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1534765612466151">2006</xref>). The acculturation into police culture starts with the training in the police academy where emotional expression is shed doing countless and repetitive exercises training the body to abide to survival on the streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi (2007)</xref>, a uniformed police psychologist of New York City Police Department, states “at the police academy, open expression of fear was unacceptable, and skepticism of any sort was considered resistance.” (p. 24) Therefore, police officers belong to a unique culture. Even though there is the sense of security and brotherhood, the emotional expression and the sharing of a fear or a traumatic experience is not acceptable and, hence, viewing police trauma through the lens of the police culture helps us to see more clearly the complexity of the police trauma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534765612466151">O’ Cleirigh et al. (2003)</xref> point out the importance of the emotional expression of traumatized patients living with AIDS. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534765612466151">Stanton et al. (2002)</xref> come to the same conclusion in their work with breast cancer patients. However, police officers who often encounter cases that elicit intense negative emotions have difficulties in accepting, tolerating, and confronting their negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612466151">Berking, Meier, &amp; Wupperman, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612466151">Littrell (2009)</xref> highlights the importance of combining emotional expression with the reappraisal of past trauma so as to lead treatment to positive outcomes. Carlier, Lamberts, Fouwels, and Gersons (1997) contend that symptomatology of traumatized police officers was further predicted by their introversion and their difficulty in expressing their emotions. It seems that the last finding confirms the notion that police culture does not facilitate the emotional expressiveness taking into consideration that its masculine “hegemony” perceives the emotional expression as weakness.</p>

<title>Biological–Physical Perspective of Police Trauma</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612466151">Hennig-Fast et al. (2009)</xref> compared 10 traumatized male police officers with nontraumatized ones using magnetic resonance imaging and they found that the two groups did not differ concerning cognitive performance measures. However, they found weaker verbal memory and rapid mobilization of resources to process expected stimuli in the experimental group of traumatized police officers. They also found that reaction times for traumatized police officers were slower. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1534765612466151">Violanti et al. (2007)</xref> studied the cortisol responses of traumatized police officers. Their findings indicate that traumatized police officers show hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) overreactivity throughout the entire day. The high levels of cortisol secretion in traumatized police officers did not appear to return to basal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1534765612466151">Violanti et al., 2007</xref>). PTSD is associated with an excessive stress response influenced by neurochemical and neuroanatomic abnormalities controlled by the Central Nervous System (CNS) and overreactivity of the HPA axis activates the adrenal gland which secretes, among others, the hormone cortisol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612466151">Austin-Ketch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612466151">Durand &amp; Barlow, 2006</xref>). Chronic secretion of cortisol may have negative effects on physical and mental health and lead to difficulties such as misuse of alcohol and drugs, anxiety sensitivity, depression, memory, and threat-related decision making among active-duty police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612466151">Asmundson &amp; Stapleton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612466151">Austin-Ketch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534765612466151">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) Moreover, traumatized police officers experience sleep disturbances, nightmares, fatigue, headaches, changes in appetite, and exaggerated startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534765612466151">Mohr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534765612466151">Rajaratnam et al., 2011</xref>)). In turn, acute stress related to exposure to a threatening situation becomes a catalyst for posttraumatic reactions in police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612466151">Chopko &amp; Schwartz, 2012</xref>). Even simulated critical incident scenarios (e.g., a suspect who draws a gun and shoots the police officer) produce stress responses similar to actual occupational stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612466151">Groer et al., 2010</xref>)</p>

<title>Psychological Perspectiveof Police Trauma</title>
<p>Traumatized—either directly or vicariously—police officers often have sleep disruption, nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, extreme fatigue, depression, a variety of emotional reactions such as fear, anger, guilt, avoidance, feelings of helplessness, feelings of hopelessness, a loss of a sense of meaning in life, alcohol use, and disturbed time perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612466151">Atkinson-Tovar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612466151">Burke &amp; Rigsby, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612466151">Hyman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612466151">Karlsson &amp; Christianson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser &amp; Geiger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1534765612466151">Violanti et al., 2007</xref>). The frequency of officers’ exposure to violent-related incidents positively correlates with mental health problems such as severe anxiety, depression, hostility, burn out symptoms, and/or sleeping problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1534765612466151">van der Velden, Kleber, Grievink, &amp; Yzermans, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Alcohol and other drugs use may progress into abuse and even to dependence because this is the only way that officers see as the most effective because the “tough guy” image (“John Wayne Syndrome”) of the police culture is not “compatible” with seeking psychological help for the emotional, psychological pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser &amp; Geiger, 1984</xref>). Male officers with PTSD symptoms experienced difficulty in identifying, describing, and/or expressing their emotions and those with work-related stress show withdrawal (distance from others), irritability, and loss of interest in other things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612466151">Brodie &amp; Eppler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765612466151">McCaslin et al., 2006</xref>). As a result, alcohol use or abuse, food, gambling, and unsafe sex very often prevail within the field. In addition, secrecy about any difficulties or problems is an expression and sign of loyalty to the police culture that also hides the pain and the need for help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612466151">Atkinson-Tovar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612466151">Dowling, Moynihan, Genet, &amp; Lewis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612466151">Follette, Polusny, &amp; Milbeck, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534765612466151">Plaxton-Hennings, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534765612466151">Weir, Stewart, &amp; Morris, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612466151">Karlsson and Christianson (2003)</xref> found that police officers reported thorough and detailed memories of the event.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612466151">Miller (2005)</xref> states that three times more police officers die by their own guns than those killed in the line of duty and she notes that the suicide rate of police officers is two to three times greater than the rate of the general population.

(2008)</xref> point out that police officers who chose to get police officers to kill them had a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and one of them felt shame over not being able to perform his duties because of a serious physical injury he had while on duty.</p>
<p>Similarly, a civilian might use threatening behavior in an attempt to get killed by a police officer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534765612466151">Mohandie, Meloy, &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>). The suicide by a cop cases have multiple effects in police officers who were forced to shoot those who decided to commit suicide in that way. In such cases, police officers involved in shootings may experience a sense of failure, guilt. In addition, they are often stigmatized by the media for their “wrong decision” and, in turn, this egregious situation often results in PTSD symptoms, hence, rendering them the “real victims.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612466151">Burke &amp; Rigsby, 1999</xref>, p. 97). Moreover, traumatized police officers exhibit more dissociative symptoms, not only during the traumatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation), but also after the traumatic experience (posttraumatic dissociation) in comparison with the nontraumatized police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612466151">Carlier et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser &amp; Geiger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi, 2007</xref>). Also, police officers’ exposure to a series of critical incidents combined with their usual willingness to help and give support to the victims/survivors of trauma might lead them to experiencing compassion fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612466151">Figley, 1995</xref>, p.7). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1534765612466151">Tehrani (2010)</xref> measured the levels of compassion fatigue in people who work in caring professions and found that police officers along with counselors were the professional groups who mostly supported the belief that there is no justice in the world.</p>

<title>Sociocultural Perspectives of Police Trauma</title>
<p>Police departments very often have a hard time understanding the trauma police officers may experience and consider this either part of their job or something that only time can heal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser &amp; Geiger, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534765612466151">Plaxton-Hennings (2004)</xref> describes a police officer who was put on administrative leave by his department after he had been shot. He was assigned to fix patrol cars. Thus, this traumatized police officer lost his sense of power and control and he was left on his own to deal with the emotional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534765612466151">Plaxton-Hennings, 2004</xref>). In addition, whoever is occupied in such positions is furthered stigmatized by being called a “house mouse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi, 2007</xref>). In other words, stigma may follow the career of a traumatized police officer. Even the loss of a life of a police officer is not considered a loss and discussion about a traumatic event or a traumatized police officer is considered by the department as “soft civilian sentimentality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi, 2007</xref>, p. 10).</p>
<p>The exposure of the officers to different traumatic events is prolonged. Thus, this kind of prolonged exposure very often affects officers’ families, friends, health, spirituality, honor, commitment, and self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612466151">Atkinson-Tovar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>). This long-term exposure of police officers to traumatic events, without any support, even affects the police department financially because of high rates of officer attrition, sick days, and absenteeism. Furthermore, depersonalization and lack of emotional expression within the police organization and authoritarianism of some police leaders as their way to command their personnel are factors that lead some police officers to abuse alcohol in order to alleviate the pain of their trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612466151">Cross &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we can perceive the ways that the police organization itself further victimizes and stigmatizes the traumatized police officers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser and Geiger (1984)</xref> write the following description about injured police officers:
<disp-quote>
<p>If officers have been physically injured, invariably there will also be ego injury. The physical injury is relatively easy to handle; however, the accompanying ego injury may be more difficult . . . they have lost control over themselves and their environment and that their next work shift may be their last. (p. 319)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore the situation of police officers from minority cultural groups who experience trauma or trauma-related symptoms needs exploration. Police culture is dominated by White, masculine, heterosexual ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534765612466151">Myers, Forest, &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>). This means that officers of color, female, and homosexual police officers constitute a marginalized group within the police culture. In other words, they are marginalized within an already isolated subculture. The dominant group within the police culture is traditionally associated with images such as aggressiveness and physical strength and in the modern era it is also characterized by managerial and technical dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612466151">Miller, Forest, &amp; Jurik, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Even working in a sometimes racist environment, Black and Hispanic police officers have proved their effectiveness in developing close communication with community members and their perseverance in offering their services to our society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612466151">Cochran &amp; Warren, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612466151">Lashley, Larson, Kelso, &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). They have passed through a recruitment process that is defined by White criteria, they studied in an academy where the trainers perceived them as incapable of being police officers, they can rarely find a mentor from their own cultural group so as to plan their professional career, and they often have to deal with adversities (discrimination and punishment) if they challenge the norms of the traditional police culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612466151">Bolton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612466151">Kakar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1534765612466151">Rojek &amp; Decker, 2009</xref>). However, research findings reveal the effectiveness of Black and Hispanic police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612466151">Cochran &amp; Warren, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612466151">Lashley et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765612466151">Irlbeck (2008)</xref> studied the ethnic self-identity of Hispanic officers and their attachment to the communities they serve. She found that many Hispanic officers did not express a strong ethnic identity. Some even self-identified as White. She argues that the organizational culture of the police agency is one of the elements of the social context that may influence such an attitude of Hispanic police officers.</p>
<p>A 1994 survey in a metropolitan police department found that roughly half of female police officers did not feel accepted by their male colleagues and their male supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612466151">Daum &amp; Johns, 1994</xref>). Police culture attributes to female police officers stereotypical features such as emotionality and dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612466151">Leger, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612466151">Lilly, Pole, Best, Metzler, and Marmar (2009)</xref> contend in their study with traumatized female civilian and female police officers that emotional distress is strongly associated with somatization symptoms in female officers rather than in their civilian counterparts. They argue that police culture probably contributed to the emotional suppression of the traumatized female officers. The police culture appears to have a role in muting the emotions of female police officers. Moreover, the dominant group of police culture adopts a paternalistic attitude toward female police officers so as to “protect” them from dangerous situations (real or assumed) and this kind of behavior further stigmatizes female police officers as being deficient for police work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612466151">Martin, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The belief that female police officers are deficient appears to be part of what male and female police officers believe. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612466151">Carlan, Nored, and Downey (2011)</xref> found that male and female police officers prefer a male partner for backup. They believe that female officers adopt this preference toward male partners as their backup as a result of a conformity mechanism in order to save their self-image and to preserve their careers within the masculine culture of policing. However, other research findings contradict White males’ racism and negative attitudes against female police officers. Policewomen in New York City have the same productivity and handle violent citizens as well as policemen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612466151">Bloch &amp; Anderson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765612466151">Koenig, 1978</xref>). Moreover, the ability to think clearly and quickly and the capability of being emotionally stable as a peacekeeper and negotiator dealing with the people as a police officer has proved much more effective than the physical strength and the “macho” image that is characteristic of the dominant police group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612466151">Grennan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534765612466151">McDowell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534765612466151">Sherman, 1973</xref>). Furthermore, Black and Hispanic female police officers experience isolation, discrimination, workplace stress, limited opportunities for advancement and participating in the decision making procedures of the department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612466151">Hassel &amp; Brandl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534765612466151">Stroshine &amp; Brandl, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Even in small towns, female police officers reported more stress than male police officers which was associated with working in a male-dominated occupation but did not affect their job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612466151">Bartol, Bergen, Seager-Volckens, &amp; Knoras, 1992</xref>). Contradicting the general belief that female police officers are more vulnerable to experiencing trauma than male police officers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612466151">Gehrke and Violanti (2006)</xref> found that primarily the type of trauma and the frequency of the exposure are key-factors in terms of trauma onset between male and female police officers. Thereby, they argue that female officers are more vulnerable to experiencing trauma when they encounter abused children and male officers experience higher trauma risk when they are involved in a shooting incident.</p>
<p>Homosexual police officers have to work hard in order to prove that they are “real” police officers and their effectiveness in police work is often perceived as threatening for the values of “traditional masculinity” and middle-class morality of White heterosexual male police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534765612466151">Myers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534765612466151">Shilts, 1980</xref>). Although homosexual police officers support a humane and caring approach in policing, they may experience exclusion, overt sexism and antigay behavior within a police organization that is often dominated by heterosexism and masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612466151">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the efforts that have been made by many police policy makers to develop an inclusiveness and cultural sensitivity in their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534765612466151">Stroshine &amp; Brandl, 2011</xref>), it seems that those with a different color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or some other factor that might be outside the standards set by the dominant police group, are often considered as inferior, fake, nonreal, and ineffective, a threating the dominance of hegemonic masculinity of the White heterosexual male police group.</p>
<p>Police officers from minority cultural groups seem to be marginalized within the police culture by their own “blue brothers” and they are often considered inferior and ineffective. Therefore, how could police officers from minority cultural groups deal with trauma or trauma-like symptoms or even with a threatening situation within their own organization? Would they be able to share their experiences with their “blue brothers” or, if they do so, would they be characterized as ineffective and weak? The situation of police officers from minority cultural groups would shed light to unexplored parts of police trauma and the role of the organization to develop culturally competent preventive intervention programs.</p>

<title>Risk Factors of Police Trauma</title>
<p>Being cognizant of the risk factors of police trauma would help police policy makers not only to prevent it but also help them to collaborate with police officers in order to render them more resilient in coping with the hardships of police work. From the biological standpoint, it seems that prior trauma and acute and anticipatory stress contribute to cortisol differences observed between resilient and traumatized police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612466151">Arnetz, Nevedal, Lumley, Backman, &amp; Lublin, 2009</xref>). Also, from the neurological point of view, exaggerated physiologic reactivity to startling sounds and hypersensitivity to contextual threat are estimated as unique preexisting vulnerability factors for greater PTSD symptom severity following traumatic stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534765612466151">Pole et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>From the psychological perspective, prior civilian trauma such as child abuse, vicarious trauma, and family psychopathology such as mood and anxiety disorders and substance-related disorders may lead to greater trait dissociation which, in turn, constitutes a predictive factor for the development of peritraumatic dissociation during the police traumatic experience and, later, for the onset of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612466151">Follette et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612466151">Hyman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612466151">Inslicht et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765612466151">McCaslin et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, peritraumatic dissociation and severity of incident exposure during the traumatic experience strongly influence the traumatic stress symptoms that police officers experience later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612466151">Hodgins, Creamer, &amp; Bell, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies have been recruiting returning war veterans even though as a result of their combat experiences war veterans may have experienced PTSD, depression, have anger issues, physical health issues (e.g., back pain and headaches), and family problems. Even with these problems, their unique physical abilities, firearm training, leadership and combat experience, respect for discipline, and experience working in a diverse context make them exceptional candidates for a career in law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612466151">Daxe et al., 2009</xref>). Most law enforcement agencies across the country have employed various ways in order to support their transition process and reintegration back to the police service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1534765612466151">Webster, 2008</xref>). However, returning combat veterans might often have a low tolerance for citizen complaints. These difficulties often become apparent during their transition from being a war fighter to becoming a police officer, which is mostly related to a peacekeeping work in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612466151">Daxe et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, police officers who return to their agencies after their deployment in the National Guard or Reserve units face various mental health issues such as stress and PTSD. War veterans who become police officers are not exempt from the difficulties related to potential exposure to trauma.</p>
<p>For all who become police officers, personal stress, anxiety sensitivity, and negative responses to the investigation of others’ trauma—secondary or vicarious trauma—are predictors of police officers’ future trauma symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612466151">Asmundson &amp; Stapleton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612466151">Chopko &amp; Schwartz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612466151">Follette et al., 1994</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612466151">Follette et al. (1994)</xref> found that 40% of female police officers and 17% of male police officers of their sample reported childhood physical and sexual abuse, a number that indicates the vulnerability of a significant minority of police officers to the later development of police trauma because of a prior traumatic experience. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612466151">Burke and Shakespeare-Finch (2011)</xref> found that past traumatic incidents of police officers prior to joining the police force would not necessarily lead them to this vulnerability when they encounter a threatening situation as police officers. Instead, their findings suggest that prior traumatic events experienced by police officers before they entered the police can have a positive impact on their ability to deal with a critical incident. Researchers argue that in such cases officers might have considered the critical situation as challenging and the potential negative events were reinterpreted, hence, helping them to employ adaptive responses to potentially traumatic events might encounter while on duty in the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612466151">Hodgins et al. (2001)</xref> point out that lower levels of agreeableness and consciousness in police officers are also both important predictors of being more vulnerable to trauma. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612466151">Hodgins et al.’s (2001)</xref> finding it seems that adjustment is important in the protection of police officers against later trauma. It seems that agreeableness is a personality trait that enhances cooperation with the other members of the police team, and consciousness is a personality trait is an effective way to cope with the structured police context. These personality characteristics seem to help police officers be less vulnerable within the police field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612466151">Hodgins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser &amp; Geiger, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534765612466151">Reiser and Geiger (1984)</xref> found that police officers who are open-minded, flexible, and think positively tend to view incidents around them as challenges in their lives and, hence, they are less likely to negatively experience trauma in comparison with close-minded, rigid, and negatively thinking police officers.</p>
<p>From the sociocultural perspective, police officers that come from minority cultural groups are more vulnerable to risk their mental health and, in turn, to experience trauma due to the fact that they might face within the police field racism, negative stereotypes, and discrimination of their White, “macho” males “blue brothers.” Isolation and lack of social/peer support contribute to the later experience of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612466151">Follette et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612466151">Karlsson &amp; Christianson, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Introducing a New Concept of Police Trauma: Police Complex Spiral Trauma</title>
<p>According to this concept, police trauma exists and its form is complex. However, by viewing police officers’ trauma through the perspective of the police culture, we see the unique form and complexity of police trauma. Therefore, we do not only consider police trauma as a complex form of trauma but we also perceive it through the ecological context of the police culture. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi (2007)</xref> states “the ecological demands of complex trauma are frequent, intense, cumulative Potentially Traumatic Events (PTE), which is mainly disenfranchised from the officers who experience it.” (p. 13) Although police officers are at a great risk of experiencing trauma they are understudied in relation to other populations such as the combat veteran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534765612466151">Neylan et al., 2005</xref>). Considering that the anticipatory stage is part of the trauma and that police officers are exposed to a prolonged form of trauma, we view police trauma though the ecological context of the police culture and we refer to the term Police and Public Safety Complex PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612466151">Herman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk et al., 1996</xref>). This type of Police Complex PTSD expands through time and among different types of traumatic experiences, either direct or indirect (secondary or vicarious) ones. In other words, during their shift, officers may have to protect an abused child (exposure to secondary traumatic experience) and an hour later may be called to arrest a violent criminal (exposure to direct trauma through the anticipatory stage), and then may see an injured police officer (vicarious exposure to traumatic experience). This prolonged exposure to different types of traumatic experiences lasts at least 20 years because for most police departments, this is the minimum time for the police officers’ mandatory service until their retirement. Therefore, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi (2007)</xref> calls “Police and Public Safety Complex PTSD” (p. 12) through the lens of the police culture, may be changed taking into account a spiral form of police trauma that represents a unified form of police trauma through time, tension, and frequency of the multidimensional and multiple direct or vicarious exposure to various traumatic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534765612466151">Figure 1</xref>). The spiral form seems to correspond to the multifaceted nature of police trauma because of its plasticity and its singularity in expanding itself in the space through time. Thereby, its shape constitutes an accurate representation of the complexity and the long-term character of the police trauma that extends its impact through officers’ long-term career. The length of the spiral may represent police officers’ total time serving in their agency and the width of the spiral might symbolize the tension of the traumatic experiences that officers have to face on an almost daily basis. Also, the density of the spiral may symbolize the number of the traumatic events to which a police officer has been exposed to or anticipates being exposed to while on duty (frequency). In addition, each spiral ring might represent every single police officer’s exposure to a particular traumatic event. Therefore, this form of trauma is termed Police Complex Spiral Trauma (PCST). As mentioned above, the spiral form symbolizes the officers’ exposure to different types of trauma based on time, tension, and frequency of officers’ traumatic exposure during their career (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534765612466151">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>If there is no treatment or there is an absence of any kind of intervention the width and the density of the spiral would become larger considering the fact that direct or vicarious exposure to various past traumatic events accumulates through time and aggravates the traumatic suffering of untreated police officers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534765612466151">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, during their professional long-term career, police officers may have biological, psychological, and social effects, as described on the aforementioned paragraphs, closely related to the complexity of the PCST. The multidirectional conceptualization of the complexity of police trauma gives us a better understanding of its nature. Therefore, this theoretical metaphor opens the discussion about the complexity of police trauma which is related and interrelated to various biological, psychological, social, and cultural variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Police officers are human beings with personal, family, and social lives as well. This means that stressors, critical incidents, or potentially traumatic events in their out-of-police context life might affect them as well. For instance, a police officer might experience severe stress symptoms because her son had a traffic accident or a family member of her encounters a terminal illness. Such incidents in police officers’ lives would lead to a larger expansion of the PCST spiral form and they are factors that would lead to more severe PCST effects. This perspective of the potential adversities that police officers might experience in their personal lives shows that the PCST could not stand isolated from the personal lives of police officers. Therefore, it seems that the PCST stands on a context that is related to the police culture and the police officers’ personal life experiences. Thereby, negative experiences in the officers’ personal lives might worsen the effects of the PCST form of police trauma.</p>
<p>However, there are also protective factors that make police officers more resilient as well. For instance, homicide detectives and crime scene unit technicians experience death and potentially traumatic incidents over their career, however, the high prestige and social recognition of their work into the police culture and the society in general are factors that help them to make sense and meaning from the exposure to these types of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612466151">Henry, 2004</xref>, pp. 181-231). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1534765612466151">Yuan et al. (2011)</xref> found that greater sense of self-worth, greater social support, beliefs of positive world assumptions, and better social adjustment were associated with lower trauma symptoms. Therefore, it seems that protective factors and certain ways of helping officers find meaning to their work might make them more resilient and able to deal with the PCST effects. In other words, there are many possible ways that police officers might employ to “rescue” themselves from the effects of PCST spiral form which, in such cases, might not become larger over time but, instead, it might become smaller or it might not even exist. So, the PCST metaphor is not a dogmatic way of viewing the complex and cumulative form of police trauma but, rather, suggests a metaphoric form of the multifaceted nature of police trauma that its effects might become more or less serious or might not even exist depending on other factors as well such as risk and protective factors, officers’ cultural background, and officers’ personal life experiences.</p>
<p>The PCST conceptualization contributes to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi’s (2007)</xref> perspective of the “Police and Public Safety Complex PTSD (PPS-CPTSD).”(p. 12) In particular, PCST unifies the different elements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534765612466151">Rudofossi’s (2007</xref>, p. 12) viewpoint about the nature of police trauma that refers to the complexity, cumulative, and intense form of police trauma within an eco-ethological context. Analytically, PCST form suggests a symbolic representation that uses the spiral metaphor as a way to unify the complex, cumulative, intense, and long term nature of police trauma within a particular social and cultural milieu. Therefore, PCST constitutes a dimensional and inclusive form of the police trauma that offers a “tangible” way of understanding its multifaceted nature and, hence, keeping police policy makers, educators, trauma scholars, and other related professionals aware of its unique nature. Thus, the metaphor of spiral used for the representation of police trauma highlights the need for further research exploration of the police trauma and calls for a multifaceted support to those who serve our communities. The dimensional perspective of PCST underscores the multitude mode of the nature of police trauma and the necessity of the multiple factors (or dimensions) that need to taken into consideration in order to lead to a thorough conceptualization of its unique spiral form. Furthermore, the inclusive form refers to all different factors (or dimensions) that are unified over the police career, the police officers’ personal lives, and officers’ cultural backgrounds and are formulated in the metaphor of spiral.</p>
<p>PCST is a systemic representation of the multiple mode of police trauma and this multi-dimensional symbolic representation contributes to a better understanding of the police trauma nature. However, testing such a systemic conceptualization, as PCST is, constitutes an integral challenge for future studies taking into consideration that the different elements of the PCST interact over time. However, studying different groups of police officers who experienced a series of different potentially traumatic incidents over time would shed light to many aspects of PCST.</p>
<p>Groups of police officers might be divided based on officers’ cultural background (mainstream group of police culture and officers from minority cultural groups), seriousness of critical incident and its respective effects (direct or secondary exposure), risk and protective factors, number of threatening situations in which officers of each group exposed, and other criteria that would correspond to the different dimensions of the PCST concept. The findings of such studies would test the extension of the PCST form with the reality of police work and will identify strengths and weakness of the spiral metaphor of the complex and cumulative form of the police trauma.</p>
<p>Taking into account the distressed situation of police officers coming from cultural groups other than the dominant one, we can realize that the severity of their PCST effect is more serious considering that such an accumulation of the PCST impact is worsened through time because of racism, discrimination, marginalization, feelings of inferiority, isolation, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534765612466151">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, high-risk to the onset of trauma officers may suffer more than their colleagues coming from a low-risk population because the impact of the PCST effects and its accumulation through time would be much more severe in the former rather than in the latter group of officers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534765612466151">Figure 2</xref>). Case studies of police officers (e.g., a Latina lesbian police officer who has experienced a series of potentially traumatic incidents) might lead in a more detailed and subtle identification of the various elements of the PCST concept that would otherwise not be explored in a group study.</p>
<p>Police trauma encompasses a prolonged exposure to trauma through different types of traumatic experiences that may be direct or indirect and they may jeopardize the physical and mental health, and the personal, the family, and the professional life of police officers. These different traumatic events occur almost simultaneously through the spiral form of the police trauma and they negatively affect the officers. For instance, a police officer arrested a child molester helping at the same time the abused child (secondary traumatic experience) and an hour or so later she/he may be ordered to face a violent criminal, jeopardizing his/her life (anticipatory stage of trauma). Thus, we can hardly separate prevention in primary, secondary, and/or tertiary as is stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk et al. (1996)</xref> with the actual intervention after the traumatic exposure because of the complex nature of PCST. However, based on the concept of the PCST, a discussion for a further development of preventive intervention policy is necessary and it needs to be applied on a regular basis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534765612466151">
<title>Recommendations for PCST Applications in the Police Field</title>
<p>Recognizing and understanding of officers’ PCST form would have multiple applications in helping officers who are challenged on the line of duty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612466151">Haugen, Evces, and Weiss (2012)</xref> argue that the evidence-based recommendations for first responders are not sufficient considering the risk factors, psychiatric comorbid disorders, and challenges that this population encounters. Therefore, the PCST concept transforms officers’ silent plea for help to a symbolic representation of such a need. The complexity and the presentation of the multitude form of PCST highlights the need for a development of inclusive policy programs that employ preventive interventions not only for the high-risk police personnel but also for the police officers that are more resilient. Even though some officers may be more resilient than others, the difficulties and the requirements of the police work may lead them to exhaustion and eventually they may experience trauma. Therefore, the police organization should have the appropriate preventive intervention programs in order to prevent or even to alleviate the experience of trauma of the police personnel. Also, preventive interventions should encompass all the dimensions of prevention (primary, secondary, and tertiary) considering the singular nature of the PCST and the intertwined complication between prevention and the interventions in the aftermath of trauma exposure. Thus, the either direct or secondary exposure to a traumatic event is not the only factor that may lead to a later experience of trauma.</p>
<p>Specifically, one more contributing factor for the onset of trauma symptoms is the organization’s response, which makes officers often feel “. . . isolated, unsupported, disempowered, and ultimately, traumatized.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534765612466151">Plaxton–Hennings, 2004</xref>, p. 54) Therefore, the police organization itself should develop the necessary interventions in order to provide police officers with the appropriate tools and coping mechanisms in order to help them cope with the traumatic events effectively. Thereby, police organizations would become a type of protective milieu that apply such programs and train their personnel so that police officers would be more resilient in dealing with the exposure to different threatening situations. Although police officers are highly trained and some of them are experienced in helping traumatized people, they lack “specific training in trauma/disaster stress.”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612466151">Karlsson &amp; Christianson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534765612466151">Plaxton-Hennings, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534765612466151">Van der Kolk et al., 1996</xref>, p. 445) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612466151">Karlsson and Christianson (2003)</xref> state that many interrogators who have worked on cases of child abuse decided to transfer to other positions or even to leave the police force because of vicarious trauma.</p>
<p>Moreover, police officers with psychological or personal issues are usually not willing to ask for help from mental health professionals of the department services because of the fear of stigmatization, the negative job consequences (e.g., loss of weapon, personal weakness, etc.), and the modified work duties that may come after such a request for help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612466151">Dowling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1534765612466151">Wester, Arndt, Sedivy, &amp; Arndt, 2010</xref>) and such a realization leads some police departments to require periodic counseling for all officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612466151">Carlan &amp; Nored, 2008</xref>). Many studies show that peer-counseling in police field is effective and police officers seem to respond to these ways of getting support because this type of first-line peer-counseling is provided from trained police officers who are willing to play this role. In addition, officers providing support are given guidelines by mental health professionals from the department about how to give that support. Police officers support each other on the street without having to deal with any kind of negative consequences that may come after seeking mental health assistance following the department’s internal procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612466151">Dowling et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612466151">2006</xref>). However, this is not only an urban police officers’ tendency but even police officers in rural areas seek peer counseling support in order to reduce their stress and deal with their various mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534765612466151">Page &amp; Jacobs, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This, in other words, means that understanding PCST might become an additional way that police officers and mental health professionals provide support. Having the PCST representation in mind as a reminder about the complexity and cumulative form of police trauma has the potential to help those who help police officers. Furthermore, the PCST form might inspire new conversations among mental health professionals for the development of a practice-based multifaceted treatment that would enable mental health professionals s to respond to police officers’ and their families’ needs more effectively considering the multitude forms of police trauma and its consequences in the police organizations. Thus, clinicians will be able to view police trauma as a cumulative form of various critical incidents and multiple factors rather than a single trauma event that by itself triggered trauma symptoms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612466151">Becker et al. (2009)</xref> research findings about treatment offered to traumatized police officers, underscore the importance of developing evidence-based treatment for police officers because police organizations would better consider offering such treatments. Thereby, social scientists, police managers, and police policy makers may consider the PCST conceptualization in their research about police trauma and the development of effective preventive intervention programs for this population. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534765612466151">Violanti (2006)</xref> states, studying officers who survive adversities might offer important knowledge in helping those who suffer.</p>
<p>PCST is a culturally inclusive concept that it takes into account police officers cultural background as well. Thereby, this perspective of PCST might help mental health professionals, police managers, and other police experts be culturally competent and aware of the role of officers’ cultural background in the conceptualization and preventive intervention of police trauma. For instance, PCST symbolic representation of police trauma might enable police managers and police officers from the mainstream group of the police culture to realize that negative stereotypes of the police culture about female officers (female officers are “fragile” or less competent than their male counterparts) worsen their trauma symptoms.</p>
<p>Training police trainees about trauma is significant because through the training process, police trainers are able to make their trainees aware of the challenges of police work and, hence, to help them employ practical ways in helping themselves without needing supervision from a mental health professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612466151">Manzella &amp; Papazoglou, 2011</xref>). Thereby, potential trauma symptoms of police trainees who were exposed to a critical incident while on duty are recognized while also recognizing ways to teach about safety methods and tactics in policing that includes ways to handle the effects from exposure to a threatening situation.</p>
<p>Thus, police educators and training experts might include PCST conceptualization in police training curricula. That way, police teachers and mental health professionals would be able to teach the cumulative and complex form of police trauma using the symbolic representation of PCST that would help police trainees to comprehend in a tangible way, the uniqueness of police trauma. PCST inclusion in police training curricula would hence become an alternative form of the application of PCST in the preventive intervention policy programs. Teaching PCST in a form of a lecture with a combination of some tangible examples and case studies from the police practice would give to the trainees a better understanding of the challenges of police work. For instance, teaching PCST as a module in a crisis management course, police tactics and self-protection course, or/and police psychology course would allow trainees to associate the value of PCST conceptualization with the other objectives of the course and, hence, they would be able to learn that PCST is a symbolic representation of the long-term exposure to stress and critical situations of police officers and the multiple reaction to such events is normal for human beings.</p>
<p>Such a change in training curricula will help the transformation of certain stereotypes in police culture and help make the new generation of police officers and the rest of the police personnel aware of the complex reality of police work, including the fact that having a wide range of reactions to potentially traumatic incidents are normal for human beings (police officers included). There is a need for them to be culturally competent and find ways to encourage seek help from either counseling-trained peers or mental health professionals, which is a necessary element for first responders to get support and understanding. Finally, a class discussion about PCST in a training environment would facilitate an open dialogue about such complex issues that police officers many times encounter and these open conversations will give to the new generation of police officers the “message” that it is acceptable for them to discuss this topic within the police culture, hence, transforming certain negative stereotypes that police culture has preserved over the years.</p>
<p>The contribution of the application of PCST in the development of preventive intervention policy programs in police field would enhance resiliency of police officers—especially the high-risk ones—through a multifaceted approach that may include police managers’ and police mental health professionals’ awareness about the unique form of police trauma, the development and evaluation of police education and training curricula, and the implication of practice-based counseling programs into police field. Furthermore, the aforementioned applications of PCST would encourage and possibly inspire a discourse about the need of evidence-based and practice-based treatments that correspond to the complexity and cumulative form of police trauma as symbolically described by the PCST concept.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The conceptualization of the PCST paves the way for further scientific qualitative and quantitative research in the measurement, assessment, and application of effective interventions of preventing and treating the effects of the PCST to police officers. This theoretical and symbolic conceptualization helps us better understand the distinct nature of police trauma and, hence, to develop relevant interventions and policy programs so as to support traumatized police officers to promote their mental health and wellness. It seems that the spiral metaphor of the complex and cumulative form of police trauma challenges the traditional theories of psychotherapy and points out the need for the development of innovative culturally relevant multifaceted interventions tailored to the unique nature of police work and the needs of police officers. Understanding PCST would probably be a challenge for mental health professionals and researchers because its multidimensional and inclusive form would open a conversation for evidenced-based and practiced-based interventions that would correspond to the idea of the PCST symbol and, hence, support police officers encounter the multiple mode of the challenges of police work. Furthermore, the spiral metaphor of the complex, intense, and cumulative form of the police trauma could be included in the curricula of police academies. Thereby, police officers will be aware, with tangible ways, of the symbolic representation of the PCST and, hence, they will acquire a more detailed knowledge and a sense of self-exploration about the multifaceted nature of police trauma and its effects when they encounter critical incidents over their career. Such an awareness will shape a new way of thinking in the new generations of police officers and police executives about the implications of police trauma in the different facets of their lives and it will probably open a dialogue for a transformation of certain tenets of the police culture related to mental health issues and cultural competency of police officers. That way, police officers will be further able to seek help whenever they need it, to get support, and to help their colleagues.</p>
