<p>This article provides the rationale for effective music assessment that tracks individual progress across time and offers examples to illustrate assessment of a range of music-learning goals. Gauging progress across time helps students become more mastery-oriented, while showing more effort and positive attitudes. As instruction and assessment become more focused on individual students, practices such as private lessons within the group setting and individual performance assessment emerge. Examples based on current strategies used by practicing teachers illustrate these practices.</p>

<p>Two university faculty members explore assessment practices that help educators document individual progress in music learning in the classroom and rehearsal hall.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What essential skills do preservice teachers need to be able to assess their ensemble students effectively and fairly? Although our expertise is in different fields—one of us is a music educator and the other is an educational psychologist—we both have experience working with future music educators. In this article, we provide a rationale for effective music assessment that tracks individual progress across time and offer examples that illustrate assessment of a range of musical goals using best practices.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432111435276">
<title>Importance of Assessing Progress</title>
<p>One of the most powerful motivators we have seen in classrooms—for teachers as well as students—is concrete evidence of student progress. Our observations dovetail with thirty-five years of research demonstrating that articulating goals energizes learners and provides them with direction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432111435276">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, concrete feedback on progress toward those goals enhances motivation and learning by providing opportunities for needed adjustments in efforts to reach the goals.</p>
<p>Gauging progress toward goals is also important to help students focus on their own learning more than simply on their grade or on comparing themselves to others. Research has shown that even in our competitive society (and classrooms), teachers can help their students become more mastery-oriented and less centered on comparisons to and judgments of others. Such practices produce students with more positive attitudes about learning who are willing to attempt challenging tasks and exert more effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432111435276">2</xref></sup> Classroom assessment strategies stressing individual improvement across time and emphasizing the importance of student effort are a key facet in eliciting this kind of motivation from students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432111435276">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our teacher education program and many others capitalize on this research about the value of progress monitoring by requiring teacher candidates to complete an “internship work sample” (IWS). During student teaching, the teacher candidates design goals for a music unit that generally lasts one to two weeks. The candidates measure student understanding and skills before the unit, they teach the unit, and then they measure gains in student understanding and skills after the unit. A typical music unit could address a particular musical element (e.g., form, style, texture) or a music composition to be performed by an ensemble, including all of the musical skills necessary to give a high-quality performance of the selected composition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0027432111435276">
<title>Teacher-Centered Instruction</title>
<p>We have found that our music education students have difficulty devising practical and useful assessments that track individual progress across time. They and their mentor teachers, especially beyond the elementary level, focus primarily on the musical performance of the larger group. Typical large-ensemble rehearsals tend to become teacher-based and reactive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432111435276">4</xref></sup> The director detects an error, stops the group, announces the error, and begins again with the whole ensemble either from the beginning of the current musical selection or at the nearest rehearsal number. The teacher addresses the individual or small section responsible for the error. Out of frustration, teachers often assign playing tests to resolve individual performance errors. We have found that this type of performance assessment produces fear and anxiety rather than an opportunity for students to become better musicians.</p>
<p>Many teachers see insurmountable barriers to implementing more effective assessment of individual progress. These barriers include performance pressures, large numbers of students in music classrooms, poor teacher-student ratios, and time limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432111435276">5</xref></sup> Beyond the typical error correction in rehearsals just described, instruction and assessment tend to focus on the whole group, with the teacher directing and making decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432111435276">6</xref></sup> Common ensemble and class assessments include unison tizzling (sizzling, hissing, buzzing), counting aloud, clapping, and chanting rhythms and syllables. Such assessments may help improve the group performance, but they cannot provide a systematic measure of individual student progress. As instruction and assessment become more focused on individual students rather than the group, other approaches are needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0027432111435276">
<title>Student-Centered Instruction</title>
<p>Because the IWS requires individual data, instruction must become more student-centered. When we began this process, the music faculty decided that recording the entire ensemble and listening as an adjudicator to solve large-ensemble problems would address the assessment requirement. But the need to document individual progress compelled us to look at student-centered assessment and instruction. The teacher can no longer listen from a distance and hide errors to make the large ensemble sound better. We must focus on individuals and their improvement over time. As an added benefit, improved performance of individual students should also result in better overall ensemble performance and higher motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432111435276">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moving from teacher-centered classrooms and assessments toward student-centered classrooms and assessments has become the goal. As instruction and assessment become more focused on individual students rather than the group, practices such as (1) private lessons within the group setting and (2) individual performance assessment emerge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0027432111435276">
<title>Private Lessons, Group Setting</title>
<p>Ideal music instruction, whether in a general music classroom or a secondary large ensemble, can be viewed as a private lesson within the group setting. Individuals should be contributing artists in the process of a musical creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432111435276">8</xref></sup> The responsibility of teaching individuals should far outweigh any large-group assessment. The private lesson within the group setting exemplifies a more student-centered mindset. In addition to being proactive rather than reactive, it offers students the opportunity to (1) make musical judgments, (2) think critically, (3) become more invested in the ensemble’s musical product, and (4) become more interactive in the daily process of music making. Students assist with error detection and offer solutions to problem areas within the music. Instead of framing playing tests as punishment for lack of preparation, they can be viewed as part of the process of preparing for a performance or learning about music. Students identify and discriminate errors in style, balance, attacks, releases, and note and rhythm errors through recorded examples of the ensemble or during daily rehearsals.</p>
<p>The teacher guides the students to success. Students in the class are taught that each will be given individual focus, but that in the music classroom, it takes place in front of the ensemble or class. All students in the group are expected to respond to the teacher just as they would in a private lesson (verbally and with eye contact). All students should come to class with the understanding that they are part of a musical creation and that it is an ongoing process that will result in a performance, which may or may not be better than what they produce in the rehearsal hall.</p>
<p>If an error is made by an individual, the teacher should use that moment as a teachable moment for the entire group. Students can be taught that errors are not bad. Instead, errors benefit everyone in the ensemble by allowing the teacher the opportunity to teach. Students respond well to the thought that musical performances are never perfect, and that because performers are not computers, they should expect errors. Musicians strive for perfect technique, but every great performance is marred by error even though the error may be too small for most listeners to detect.</p>
<p>Students can be encouraged to use critical listening as they participate in the assessment of problem excerpts in the music being rehearsed. Directors should begin this process by identifying problem areas in the group’s performance and questioning students. The following scenarios demonstrate informal assessment strategies.</p>
<p>In measure 51 of Frank Ticheli’s <italic>Sanctuary</italic>, the melodic line is to be played by Alto Saxophone I and Horn I and II. The part is marked to be performed <italic>nobly</italic> starting at <italic>mezzo forte</italic>. This beautiful melody sings forward through several dynamic levels, including three crescendo/decrescendo phrase markings. Using the private lesson within the group setting model, the teacher would ask the saxophone and horn sections to perform the passage with the expectation that all players in the ensemble would be listening critically. After the excerpt is played, the teacher would question the listeners with such questions as “What is the written dynamic of this excerpt?” “How many crescendos did you hear?” “Did the horns move with the alto saxophone?” “Did you hear any intonation problems?” and “How would you perform this excerpt more musically?” This type of interactive rehearsal allows all students in a large ensemble to be actively engaged throughout the rehearsal and trains their ears to discriminate</p>
<p>When performing the first four measures of Ralph Vaughan William’s <italic>English Folksong Suite</italic>, third movement, “March,” the woodwinds may have difficulty matching articulations. To solve this problem while teaching each individual, it is necessary to identify the section or players performing the passage with the desired style, and then ask all students to identify which section(s) meet that desired standard. If the problem persists, the excerpt can be further isolated so that the students can hear the problem and resolve it.</p>
<p>Systematic assessment of individual progress can be woven into this process using simple rubrics, checklists, or rating scales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432111435276">9</xref></sup> For example, using the rating scales in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432111435276">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0027432111435276">2</xref>, both teacher and students could rate aspects of a performance of an excerpt at several points across rehearsals to document progress and see gains over time. Similarly, a director can anticipate a specific place in a piece that may be problematic for each section (e.g., making sure all sixteenth notes are even in a sixteenth-note run for the clarinets) and then design a brief rating scale to use at two different points across the period of preparation for a piece. Comparison of ratings by both instructor and individuals within each section can yield important data for discussion, evaluation, and further instruction. The instructor may need to take a few minutes of class time or find an alternate sectional time to slowly practice the problem area with the clarinets. The difficulty may be a result of errors in fingerings, tempo, pulse, or rhythm, and the student may be practicing the error instead of solving the problem. Many times, directors will identify the error but leave out the critical step of teaching how to resolve the error.</p>

<title>Individual Performance Assessment</title>
<p>Noting an ensemble’s progress as students prepare a piece for a performance is one important element of examining musical progress that benefits student and teacher. In addition, the need to observe and track individual students’ increasing skill and musical understanding as they progress through a music program across time is the second key element.</p>
<p>A key element of individual progress over time is skills development for solo and group performance. Assessment tools for individual progress may include recorded excerpts and using SmartMusic or a combination tailored to instructional needs.</p>
<p>An example of the use of recorded excerpts comes from Beverly Laney at South Pointe High School in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Laney determines the music excerpt to be assessed in a choral class on a given day. She informs the students that they will be recording this excerpt so that they can prepare outside of class. She distributes eight handheld recorders and labeled blank cassette tapes. The ensemble sings the material to be assessed, and eight students record their performance while participating within the group. The recorders are then passed to other members of the ensemble, and this continues until all students have had the opportunity to record the excerpt. Using the recorders allows students to sing freely and eliminates performance anxiety that may be caused by singing alone in front of their peers. The students hand in their cassette tapes after all students have recorded, and Laney listens to the excerpts and assesses them using a performance rubric. This type of individual assessment allows for each student’s musical growth in the areas of voice quality, diction, technical development, and intonation. Laney makes comments at the end of each tape, offering encouragement, praise, and instruction. Students are responsible for listening to themselves sing and to Laney’s comments. This encourages self-assessment and allows students to hear their improvement over time. Laney mentions that these recordings offer her students “virtual voice lessons” within a group setting. The choral classes at South Pointe record once or twice during each nine-week grading period. Laney finds that assessing sight-reading with the same process works well. She does note that it is necessary to change to a different sight-reading excerpt or line each time the recorder is passed. In response to the concern that she must listen and assess student cassettes outside of class, Laney says that she would rather listen to music than grade papers like teachers in other disciplines.</p>
<p>To take this idea one step farther, music teachers can design a standard yet simple rating form to be kept in a folder that could be kept across time, documenting individual student progress across semesters and even years on the basis of recordings such as Laney’s. Such documentation can be energizing for students and teachers to see progress beyond a single piece or short-term effort. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0027432111435276">Figure 3</xref> for an example.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0027432111435276" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Beverly Laney also offers an individual assessment for general music classes or lessons that can be assessed by answering true or false, or by making a choice between two options. Examples of these units include learning about one’s performance instrument (instrumental or voice) or music theory and history. Promethean Interactive Whiteboards allow music teachers to use voting clickers within the ensemble or class. Each clicker can be assigned a student name or set up for anonymity. Laney uses the clickers to guide her instruction, so she chooses for students to remain anonymous. The class views the results on the whiteboard in a pie-chart format.</p>
<p>Mike Doll, former band director at Rawlinson Road Middle School in Rock Hill, South Carolina, uses SmartMusic technology. This relatively inexpensive software allows students to record an excerpt given specific directions. It also makes a digital recording of the music for the student to review before submitting his or her score. Doll can look at the assessment score and offer additional feedback on other musical elements, such as dynamics, intonation, and style, from the recording that is submitted. He can also make written comments, which can be viewed by the student or the parent by logging in to the SmartMusic Gradebook. In addition, SmartMusic provides a record of the time spent practicing the example and the tempo that was achieved. Doll reports that SmartMusic technology has been “the biggest change in the way I teach in fourteen years, and it permeates everything I do.” Doll uses SmartMusic assessment tools for scales, all-state band preparation, method book assignments, and preparation of large-ensemble music. The program has improved to the point that it can serve instrumental music students at all levels. Numerous concert band compositions, solo accompaniments, and skill-building exercises, as well as more than twenty band and string method books, are included, all with accompaniment and all with assessment. In addition, SmartMusic has the capability to allow any composition that is written using Finale software to be converted into a file that can be used for assessment in SmartMusic. This feature is useful for high school marching band arrangements, all-state band preparation, and concert band compositions that are not currently in the SmartMusic library. If the composition is not in SmartMusic, but you have a recording of it, you can simply import the recording to be used for practice and recording purposes with your students.</p>
<p>Doll chose Richard Saucedo’s “Flight of the Thunderbird” for performance with the eighth-grade band. SmartMusic has two “Flight of the Thunderbird” performance assignments specific to each instrument. Doll has set up the Gradebook portion of SmartMusic, and the students enroll in the appropriate class as users. Doll sends the assignment to each student in the band, and the student pulls up the assignment that is an excerpt with instructions for “Flight of the Thunderbird.” The student records the excerpt at the tempo established by Doll either at home or during band time in one of two practice rooms. Students can practice and record the excerpt until they are happy with it, then submit their work to Doll. He is able to listen to the recorded excerpts within a recording of a complete ensemble.</p>
<p>In terms of tracking individual student progress across longer periods than a single piece, SmartMusic provides opportunities for analysis and archiving individual student progress in a relatively efficient manner that is useful for student and teachers. There is a portfolio within SmartMusic to archive examples of student performance over time. Students can be tracked from their entrance into the music program in sixth grade until the time they exit the program in twelfth grade with recorded examples of their performances.</p>
<p>Of course, a program such as SmartMusic is only one component of an effective music program. Teachers must offer students not only written feedback or scores through technology but opportunities for students to work with the teacher for brief periods of interaction to guide them toward their performance goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0027432111435276">
<title>Engaging Students</title>
<p>As we have explored ways to look at individual progress, we have been able to encourage our student teachers to do so as well. One intern recently designed an IWS around Robert Sheldon’s “Eagle Mountain Overture,” in which he focused students on improving articulation. His assessments included peer critiques of specific articulations within instrument groupings and instructor’s evaluations before the unit and after the unit on each student’s performance of articulations required in the composition.</p>
<p>Teaching at all levels for most music instructors has always included engaged student involvement and interaction. The responsibility of teaching preservice teachers, and specifically, the IWS, has clarified our thoughts and subsequently our instruction concerning assessment with our students, both in the ensemble setting and in the classroom. It has enriched our thinking about quality assessment that enhances individual musical skills related to performance as well as to music appreciation and discernment. Helping our teacher candidates focus on these issues makes them better music educators. They also learn to foster progress and greater love for music among their students.</p>
