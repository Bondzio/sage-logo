<p>In recent years, many textbooks on the history of European integration have been published. All these textbooks pursue slightly different approaches and draft their respective narratives of European integration. However, most of them, with only a few exceptions, fail to discuss competing interpretations comprehensively, and thereby fail to provide orientation for their readers in a further expanding and diversifying field of research.</p>
<p>This is the starting point for Wolfram Kaiser and Antonio Varsori in their edited volume on themes and debates in European Union history. Unlike most of those textbooks dealing with the history of European integration, their book focuses on the course of European integration historiography; intending ‘to provide a sophisticated and comprehensive introduction to research trends and themes and debates in the historiography; or, in other words, to sketch the partly competing answers historians have given to questions of why and how European integration developed, on the basis of a chronology of facts that readers can access elsewhere’ (3). Overall, this book fulfils its promise, and offers inspiring prospects for future research in this field.</p>
<p>The book has 10 thematic chapters arranged into three overall sections. One section, on the general context of European integration historiography, considers research networks and collaborative research projects, publication trends and their integration into Modern European history and European studies. Another, on conceptual approaches, deals with federalist perspectives, research on national governmental policy-making and supranational approaches focusing on the Community political system, while the third, on thematic dimensions of European integration history, discusses the economic and business dimension, social and cultural dimensions, the American role in European integration and the external dimension of foreign policy beyond the nation-state. This sample of themes is reasonable, even though other themes, such as domestic and judicial affairs, could also have been given their own chapters. Not much research has been done by historians in this respect, but the same applies to the European Community’s external relations on which Giuliano Garavini has contributed one of the most inspiring chapters of the book.</p>
<p>Most chapters advocate closer links between European integration historiography, and contemporary European history in general, as well as considering the wider international context. As Antonio Varsori points out, the history of European integration cannot be reduced to the history of the European Community/European Union. Furthermore, most chapters demand a stronger ‘cross-disciplinarity’ (Wolfram Kaiser) of European integration historiography, and an increased awareness of theoretical, conceptual and methodological issues. As most chapters underline, historians do not need to start from scratch, and, according to Katja Seidel, European integration historiography has already experienced ‘a phase of refinement’ characterized by more sophisticated conceptual, multilateral and transnational perspectives, instead of conceptually underdeveloped and more traditional state-centred approaches. This even holds true for federalist perspectives and research on national governmental policy-making, as Daniele Pasquinucci and Michael Gehler highlight. In this respect, only the chapter by Mark Gilbert suggests a continuing emphasis on questions of diplomatic history when considering the American role in European integration – at least in the literature considered by Gilbert. Given the complexity of the Community system, as N. Piers Ludlow asserts, it is unavoidable to combine various perspectives anyway. For Morten Rasmussen economic approaches to European integration history also need ‘to be combined with a history of ideas, institutions and politics’ (138). This cross-disciplinary approach, according to Lorenzo Mechi, has already made considerable advances in the historiography of the social aspects of European integration, adopting concepts and methodological tools from the social sciences, economics and law. Giuliano Garavini, also pleading for analysing the European Community’s external policies in the broader context of the political, socio-economic and cultural history of contemporary Europe, finally points to ‘the normative danger of falling into the trap of considering European integration as a positive outcome in itself, and thus to view everything it has produced or encouraged, as civilized, peaceful and positive for the rest of the world’ (207). Consequently, research on the external dimension of European integration has to consider extra-European perspectives, too.</p>
<p>The editors have aimed the book at a very broad readership: researchers in the field of European integration, historians of modern and contemporary Europe, social scientists, even European policy-makers, and not least postgraduate and advanced undergraduate students. Despite some shortcomings as a teaching tool, this book is indeed suitable for a very wide audience.</p>
<p>All chapters have a comprehensive bibliography, even though, unfortunately, they omit most of the textbooks the editors suggest for accessing the ‘chronology of facts’ (3). There is also an equally comprehensive and utterly reliable, well-structured index.</p>
