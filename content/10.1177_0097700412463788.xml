<abstract>
<p>This article examines female property rights in a Chinese lineage village in rural Hong Kong in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It demonstrates the conditions under which female villagers have been entitled to family property and/or cash dividends of an ancestral estate, even though the male-only inheritance rule is a deeply rooted lineage custom. Notably, female inheritance, while allowed, has applied only to land and cash, not to village houses themselves because those are still essential for the maintenance of a lineage community and its associated sense of identity. As for cash and land, particularly after the 1970s, they are not bound up with that social or symbolic meaning, and thus are considered transferable to female villagers. This article shows that in a lineage system women’s property rights are permitted, but this is neither absolute nor based on the principles of gender equality, meaning that women’s rights are situational and subject to negotiation.</p>

<p>This article examines the property rights of female villagers in a Chinese lineage village in rural Hong Kong in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, arguing that family property and ancestral property are not an exclusively male domain. The findings shed new light on women’s relationship to property in Chinese society. The literature on property rights in the New Territories of Hong Kong has two focuses. One is the legal or political dimensions of the inheritance rule, with special reference to gender equality or human rights, and critically examines the legitimacy or illegitimacy of male inheritance rights under British colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">E. Chan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700412463788">Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0097700412463788">Merry and Stern, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0097700412463788">Tong, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0097700412463788">1</xref></sup> The second focus of the literature is on the rules and practices of the customary male-only inheritance in the lineage context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700412463788">Baker, 1968</xref>: 50; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">S.

Watson, 1982</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0097700412463788">2</xref></sup> Both focuses have revealed that women in the New Territories have been socially and legally excluded from inheritance rights because they are subject to Chinese customary law. This article, however, demonstrates that this is not a complete picture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0097700412463788">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the findings of this study challenge Selina Chan’s pioneering study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0097700412463788">1997</xref>) on women’s property rights in the Chinese lineage system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0097700412463788">4</xref></sup> In her study, Chan meticulously discussed an inheritance case in which a married-out daughter competed with her closest relative (a married-in woman) in laying claim to the property (both land and house) of her heirless father. Chan found that neither of them inherited the property and that the married-out daughter was only entitled to the rental income from her father’s property under her trusteeship. She concluded that “land and housing [are] strictly forbidden as a form of inheritance on the part of the daughters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">S. Chan, 1997</xref>: 152). Also, she demonstrated that all unmarried daughters and married-in women in the lineage were entitled to receive cash dividends from ancestral estates (159–60). Women were entitled to receive income derived from the family property and cash dividends of lineage property because villagers agreed that daughters are closely related to the father (in terms of sentimental affiliation and blood relationship) and should be entitled to some inheritance. This article goes beyond Selina Chan’s work by presenting substantial cases indicating that in the Peng lineage some widows did inherit land from their heirless husbands and that some women also took the initiative to set aside their deceased husband’s/sons’ property in the form of trusts and made themselves (and also their daughters, if any) the exclusive beneficiaries. I go on to examine how villagers, both male and female, negotiated the traditional male-only inheritance rule to make these special arrangements possible.</p>
<p>The cases I studied show that female inheritance presents a complex picture. While allowed, it only applied to land, not to village houses, so as to maintain the integrity of lineage territory and its associated identity. Also, I offer another explanation for village women’s entitlement to estate proceeds, illuminating how the villagers of the Peng lineage of Fanling in rural Hong Kong devised their own definitions of estate membership and estate beneficiary to justify this practice, which is anomalous in New Territories lineage villages.</p>
<p>The Peng case reveals that women’s property rights have been permitted in the patriarchal lineage system on the grounds of moral obligation, responsibility, or need, and that they are filled with contestation and negotiation. In other words, women’s property rights in the Chinese lineage system are neither absolute nor based on the principles of individual or gender equality. This explains why, in 1994, when the government amended the inheritance law to give women the right to inherit family property on the grounds of gender equality and human rights, many Pengs, like other lineage villagers in the New Territories, vehemently protested. More importantly, though the new amendment has been in place for nearly eighteen years, my informants reported no cases filed by Peng women that made use of it to lay claim to their father’s village house.</p>
<p>This article draws on information collected from interviews with villagers of the Peng lineage and archival research in the Land Registry (a government department) between the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The following cases and figures are largely derived from two types of Land Registry records. One type contains such information as the size, location, and ownership (past and present) of the land, and it is open to the public, providing a picture of the Peng lineage’s land ownership patterns over time. The second type of record contains confidential information about the Pengs’ corporate estates, such as the history of the estate, the name and number of beneficiaries, the details of assets, and even documents relating to the interests of estate members. The information available to the public from the second type of record, even when official approval is granted, is limited.</p>

<title>Chinese Customs in a British Colony</title>
<p>Hong Kong was under British colonial rule from 1842 to 1997. During this period, the government promised to maintain the “good customs” and practices of the Chinese. This noninterference policy helped to minimize administrative costs and, importantly, gain and foster the support of the powerful male Chinese elites whose interests continued to be maintained in the colony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0097700412463788">5</xref></sup> Consequently, precolonial forms of patriarchal power were perpetuated and even reinforced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700412463788">Jones, 1995</xref>). Even in 1898, during the acquisition of Hong Kong’s New Territories under a 99-year lease, the British enacted a New Territories Ordinance to maintain the local tradition of male-only inheritance and other customary rights. Section 13 of the ordinance stipulated that “in any proceedings in the High Court of the District Court in relation to land in the New Territories, the court will have power to recognize and enforce any Chinese custom or customary right affecting such land.” This legal enactment aimed at garnering native cooperation, particularly that of the local Chinese elites who later associated themselves with the Heung Yee Kuk 鄉議局 (Council on County Affairs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0097700412463788">6</xref></sup> To recapitulate, this noninterventionist policy, which was implemented to preserve Chinese traditional customs and laws, institutionalized the exclusive right of males to inherit family property. The Heung Yee Kuk also argued that this policy played a vital role in maintaining the stability and well-being of the New Territories’ way of life. Consequently, the intersection of the British noninterference policy and the interests of the colonized male elites contributed to the continued denial of female inheritance rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0097700412463788">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Peng Lineage: History and Customs</title>
<p>The Peng lineage is situated in Fanling in the northern New Territories and has a population of about 3,500, including those living overseas. As the Peng genealogy notes, its settlement history dates back to the thirteenth century (during the Song dynasty). In 1220, a walled settlement composed of three hamlets was built by the Pengs. In 1573, they built a lineage hall for conducting collective ancestral worship and settling disputes. Also, a security force was established in the lineage to protect the life and property of its members, and political leaders were elected to speak and fight for collective interests. Notably, these indigenous security and political organizations were, and still are, highly gendered, meaning that men dominated these sites of power in the lineage while women were excluded.</p>
<p>The lineage settlement was mainly surrounded by paddy fields, on which the members mostly relied for survival. But following urbanization, which began to take off in the late 1970s, Fanling became surrounded by sprawling skyscrapers. The urban development was in striking contrast to the long-established architecture in this kinship community, with its hundreds of multistoried village houses of different shapes and sizes erected inside and outside of a centuries-old walled compound.</p>
<p>The Pengs no longer make their living in agriculture; they are employed in a wide range of occupations, such as administrators, teachers, clerks, service workers, sales workers, and professionals. Today, though living in a so-called traditional village, the Pengs also share modern ways of life with the majority of Hong Kong people, such as living with air-conditioning, enjoying the latest electronic household appliances, and practicing conspicuous consumption of food, fashion, and luxury goods. Despite the changes, the Pengs still uphold their lineage traditions and actively participate in communal ceremonial activities financed by income derived from corporate estates (<italic>zu</italic> or <italic>tang</italic>).</p>
<p>A <italic>zu</italic> is an estate formed by pooling a portion of inherited or private land to hold in trust in the name of an ancestor. Rental income from the trust land is mainly used to finance collective ancestor worship in perpetuity. A <italic>tang</italic>, however, usually transcends the boundaries of a particular kin group and is not dedicated to one particular ancestor. For example, Baohe tang, Nanqing tang, and Daqing tang are formed by Pengs living in different hamlets in Fanling; estate membership is defined by the hamlet they live in, regardless of which lineage segment they come from.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0097700412463788">8</xref></sup> Before World War II, these three corporate estates annually financed a lineage-based religious ceremony to placate deities in exchange for their spiritual protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0097700412463788">9</xref></sup> In addition to zu and tang, there is also a <italic>hui</italic>, referring to an estate—land mainly—that villagers set aside in the name of deities, which yields rental income that supports worship in perpetuity. In addition to fulfilling their religious functions, zu, tang, and hui also offer financial aid to their members in need. This function has been vital to villagers, especially before the 1960s when bank services were not available in the rural New Territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1979</xref>: 225).</p>
<p>According to the 1905 land records, the Pengs in Fanling owned 445.15 acres of land in total,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0097700412463788">10</xref></sup> out of which 177.14 acres (39.8 percent) were registered as zu, tang, or hui, and 268.01 acres (60.2 percent) were individually owned. Of the ancestral estates, 118 were zu, 8 were tang, and 8 were hui, in total amounting to almost 40 percent of the Pengs’ land (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0097700412463788">Table 1</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In the Peng lineage, each ancestral estate is administrated by a manager and a treasurer. The manager is elected by estate members and the length of appointment is not fixed, while the treasurer’s position is rotated yearly through all lineage segments under the estate founder. Since estate membership is only passed through the line of male descent, female villagers are excluded from these corporate estates.</p>
<p>When land is set aside in a trust, it becomes inalienable, meaning that the land will be kept undivided in order to perpetuate the aforementioned socioeconomic and religious functions. This is in great contrast to individually owned land, which will be divided in each generation or every few generations, in accordance with the principles of patrilineal descent. During the time when rice was still cultivated on Peng land, this customary inheritance rule provided a centripetal force to keep the lineage’s male members in their natal community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1958</xref>: 127). If a Peng villager has no son to inherit his property, carry on the family line, or practice ancestral worship, he can adopt an heir from within or outside the lineage. This customary practice deprives Peng women of inheriting their natal families’ properties, but it is justified by the argument that they will receive support from their husbands and sons.</p>
<p>As for family houses, there are two types, each bearing different social meanings and transfer practices. The first type is called <italic>zuwu</italic> (ancestors’ house), referring to those built within the walled settlement. In the past, these houses were one-story high, built of clay bricks, and had tiled roofs. Wooden ancestral tablets were placed in the center of the house for veneration. Nowadays, there are approximately two hundred zuwu standing in rows in the village. They have been built and rebuilt since the 1980s into three-and-a-half-story cement houses, each with a covered area ranging from 250 to 800 square feet and with paper ancestral tablets placed on the ground floor for worship. Since zuwu symbolically imply the continuity of the original bloodline and since the Pengs commonly share a belief that the land on which a zuwu stands has positive geomancy (<italic>fengshui</italic>), the houses are customarily transferred in the male descent line so that their auspicious lineage territory and associated collective identity can be maintained. The second type of village house is called <italic>dingwu</italic> (male’s house), referring to those built on the outskirts of the walled settlement under the Small House Policy. The policy, introduced in 1972 by the Hong Kong government, allows each male villager to build a house with a floor area of 700 square feet and a height of 25 feet. Peng villagers commonly pointed out that since the land for building dingwu is not owned by their ancestors and the houses are located outside the lineage settlement, the transfer practices of dingwu should not follow that of zuwu. Therefore, the sale of dingwu by no means violates the lineage tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0097700412463788">K. Chan, 1998</xref>: 63–80). In this article, all village houses discussed in the following cases are zuwu and, importantly, these cases demonstrate that females in the lineage are not allowed to inherit this particular type of property.</p>

<title>Land Inherited by Widows: Customary Rights and Legal Practices</title>
<p>In the 1905 land records, a number of land parcels were found to be registered in the name of female villagers. My elderly Peng informants pointed out that they were usually widows and that this was an expedient measure commonly taken by heirless male villagers for securing the livelihoods of their wives and/or unmarried daughters, particularly in the context of a lack of financial aid provided by the lineage and the government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0097700412463788">11</xref></sup> The 1905 land records show that nine widows had land registered to them as private owners, and that they owned a total of 4.51 acres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0097700412463788">12</xref></sup> These figures revealed two significant points. First, the traditional practice of male inheritance was neither immutable nor frozen; rather, it was subject to negotiation by male villagers so that female inheritance rights were made legitimate in extraordinary circumstances. In other words, female property rights were not completely denied in the Peng lineage even in the early twentieth century. Second, there was a shift in women’s relationship to property during the twentieth century. It changed from one of privilege based on moral obligation (granting a widow the right to use her deceased husband’s property to make a living without changing its legal ownership) to a form of ownership conceived increasingly in terms of property held by the individual (highlighting the legal right of a widow in property inheritance).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0097700412463788">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of those nine widows, two (Peng Zhang shi and Peng Liao shi)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0097700412463788">14</xref></sup> are worthy of special attention. They married two brothers and neither of them produced any children. Therefore, their heirless husbands made special arrangements. As the land records show, during the husbands’ lifetimes, they bequeathed to their wives several plots of land, allowing them to make use of the rental income to support themselves when they became widows. Peng Zhang shi inherited nine pieces of land (1.67 acres) and Peng Liao shi eleven (0.64 acres). As a rough estimate, at that time 1.5 acres of land could support around six family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0097700412463788">K. Chan, 1996</xref>: 18–20). This shows that the amount of land the two women owned was sufficient to secure their livelihoods. The financial provision and protection offered by their land was crucially important to them in a society where public welfare was nearly nonexistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0097700412463788">Jones, 1990</xref>), as it eliminated the economic pressure on them to remarry for survival. Moreover, in imperial China, widows who did not remarry and remained chaste were commemorated, and prestige accrued not only to the women but also to their entire family and lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0097700412463788">Waltner, 1981</xref>). Therefore, it is not hard to imagine why the Peng lineage agreed to this practice. In fact, examples of such financial provision and protection for widows have a long history in Chinese society, dating back to the twelfth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0097700412463788">Bernhardt, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0097700412463788">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700412463788">Birge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700412463788">Dennerline, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, in those cases where the Peng lands were inherited by widows, they had an absolute right of disposal of the lands. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that this legality did not necessarily coincide with the customary practice in dealing with widow’s property rights in the lineage context. According to my elderly informants, there is a lineage custom that encouraged widowed landowners to adopt an heir to continue their husbands’ family line and to inherit the property. In so doing, the land would ultimately be transferred after their death to their husbands’ closest agnates, thereby keeping the village precinct entirely in the hands of the Pengs. These practices aimed at normalizing the ostensibly unusual land ownership by women in the lineage so as to sustain and reinforce the hegemony of the male interest–orientated traditions of property inheritance. Remarkably, the land records indicated that the widow Peng Zhang shi had followed the hegemonic practice suggested by the lineage. She adopted an heir and bequeathed to him not only her property but also the property of the childless widow Peng Liao shi (the wife of Peng Zhang shi’s husband’s brother). But it should be noted that Peng Zhang shi’s adopted son did not actually receive all the land that his adoptive mother inherited from her husband. This was because in 1913 she sold the two largest plots of first-class land to an outsider.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0097700412463788">15</xref></sup> (Also, in the next year, one more widowed Peng transferred a piece of land to the same outsider.) At that time, in the Peng lineage, and also in other lineages in South China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700412463788">Hong Kong Government Gazette, 1900</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1958</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0097700412463788">Woon, 1984</xref>: 28, 84), land was not freely sold. There was a general rule regulating property sales; that is, if a villager wished to sell his land, it had to be sold within the lineage in the first instance. Only when this option was unfeasible could the land be transferred to outsiders. This customary rule also applied to female landowners in the Peng lineage. Therefore, the sale of land by those two Peng widows was known to their deceased husbands’ lineage members and, more importantly, it must have been approved for sale to an outsider. These cases reveal two significant points: first, the lineage recognized the married-in women’s rights to dispose of their inherited property; second, the District Land Officer also endorsed and legalized this transaction, meaning that the role he played was to execute the decision made by the lineage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0097700412463788">
<title>Women as Sole Beneficiaries in Special Estates</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in the Peng lineage corporate estates (zu) were formed for the purpose of supporting collective worship in perpetuity and/or securing the welfare of the estate members. But, notably, there are two types of zu. One is founded by a segment or a branch of a lineage, as a collective; these groups involve large numbers of families and members. The second type is founded by an individual or a family for some specific purpose and its membership is very small. The former is dominant and popular whereas the latter is unusual and few in number. In this section, I focus on the latter form of zu, especially those established with widows and daughters as beneficiaries, revealing how female Pengs (married-in women and unmarried daughters) gained rights to inherit.</p>
<p>In the Peng lineage, there are eight estates that were formed particularly for securing the livelihoods and interests of female villagers whose husbands or fathers were heirless. In these special estates, the female Pengs are the sole beneficiaries. The major reason heirless Pengs adopted this practice was to block greedy lineage members from embezzling their properties after their death. Therefore, they set aside the landed property in trust and assigned their female family members as managers with absolute control over it upon inheritance. In the following paragraphs, I discuss a number of cases in which women are not passive agents but are able to make their property rights possible and legitimate. Each took the initiative in converting the property of their deceased husband or son into an estate and then assigned themselves as the estate manager. The Peng Jinhua zu and the Peng Shuoqiu zu are examples. Peng Jinhua died in 1958 at the age of 60. In 1979, his wife converted his property (two plots of land and two village houses) into an ancestral estate and made herself the sole estate manager. As for the Peng Shuoqiu zu, it was formed by a widow, Chao Limei, in the 1970s. Originally, Chao had a son, but he died a bachelor in 1971 when he was 37 years old. Since her son had no brothers, Chao Limei got the District Land Officer’s approval to set aside her son’s property in a trust of which she was the only beneficiary.</p>
<p>In some cases, the Peng widows were beneficiaries of several estates because they were the only survivors in their husbands’ lineage segments. For instance, Peng Guangwen died in 1942 in his late forties, survived by his wife, Zhang Wenfeng, and their daughter. In 1980 Zhang Wenfeng placed her husband’s properties in the Guangwen zu with herself as its sole beneficiary. Peng Guangwen had two brothers, one married without issue and the other single. Both of them died in 1942. The village elders considered Peng Guangwen’s wife as the closest family member to the two deceased men, and the only rightful successor to their properties. As a result, she inherited four village houses and one plot of land.</p>
<p>The Peng Shanghui zu is another example (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0097700412463788">Figure 1</xref>). When Peng Shanghui died childless in 1967, his wife Peng Li shi immediately put his property into a trust titled Peng Shanghui zu and became the only beneficiary of the estate. Her husband’s brother, Peng Shanghua, had died unmarried in 1936, and Peng Li shi was also named the rightful successor of the estate created in his name; in this she had the support of two village elders who claimed that she was the only survivor in that segment. Ultimately, she thus inherited the property of both her husband Peng Shanghui and his brother Peng Shanghua, including a village house, full ownership of a piece of land (0.09 acres), and two-thirds ownership of two plots of land (0.42 acres in total).</p>

<p>A trust had also been created for Peng Shanghui and Peng Shanghua’s agnatic first cousin, Peng Yongfa, who passed away in 1943, leaving a wife and a daughter. That trust was first managed by the wife and then, after the wife’s death in 1978, passed to the married-out daughter, Peng Lianqing, the sole beneficiary of the estate. She inherited not only the remaining one-third of shares in those two plots of land but also seven pieces of land (0.29 acres in total) and two village houses.</p>
<p>These cases clearly reveal how female Pengs successfully inherited their husbands’/fathers’ properties in whose name a trust was created. Their succession to, and control over, their marital/natal families’ properties was not only accepted by the lineage but also made legal by the 1905 New Territories Ordinance, which stipulated that the estate manager has full power to dispose of the property. Therefore, these Peng cases forcefully rectify the conventional assumption about the marginality of widows’ and daughters’ property rights in the lineage system.</p>

<sec id="section5-0097700412463788">
<title>Dispute and Settlement</title>
<p>In the above female inheritance cases, women have not been completely free from the challenge of some male lineage members when succeeding to their heirless husbands’/fathers’ properties. The male members argued that this unusual inheritance practice would inevitably impinge upon the collective interests of the lineage as a corporate male descent group. Peng Lianqing, mentioned earlier, is an illustrative case. She succeeded to the position of estate manager of the Peng Yongfa zu in 1978 after her mother died. At that time, she was not free to handle her succession as she was working abroad. She therefore authorized her nephew, who resided in the village, to handle her application. In the authorization letter that was sent to the District Land Officer, she stated she would give the nephew her father’s two village houses as a gift if the succession were approved. Significantly, this arrangement revealed how she, as a married-out daughter, fully apprehended and tactically acquiesced to the hegemonic patriarchal ideology that female inheritance, while allowed, only applied to land but not to village houses in order to maintain the integrity of lineage territory and its associated identity. This explains why she appointed her nephew, a male lineage member, to deal with her succession and promised him attractive remuneration. But when the widowed Peng Li shi, who was the estate manager of the Peng Shanghui zu and the Peng Shanghua zu, learned about this case, she complained to the village representatives. In the meantime, she informed the District Land Officer that she was the only rightful successor to Peng Yongfa’s property. She worried that if Peng Lianqing was allowed to manage the Peng Yongfa zu, her right to dispose of the estate would encroach on the interests of both Peng Li shi and the Peng lineage.</p>
<p>Several years later, with the help of the village representatives, the two women came up with an agreement that the land concerned was to be inherited by Peng Lianqing and the two village houses were to be inherited by Peng Li shi. The village representatives argued that, by custom, it was the closest descendant within the deceased’s segment who was to inherit village houses; therefore, Peng Shanghua and Peng Shanghui should be the rightful successors. But since both died sonless and their properties were already managed by Peng Li shi, Peng Li shi was thus entitled to inherit Peng Yongfa’s two village houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0097700412463788">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is noteworthy in this case that the transfer of the land and the transfer of the village houses were no longer governed by the same principle, meaning that a male-only inheritance rule was only applied to the transfer of the houses. Some may suggest that this has to do with the marital status of Peng Lianqing. As a matter of fact, it did affect her claim to her natal family’s property, but it affected only her claim to the village houses, not the land. Another explanation some might propose relies on Sung Lungsheng’s (1981) argument. In studying family property division and inheritance in Taiwan, Sung proposed that there were two forms of property—“inherited property” and “acquired property” (364–67). The former refers to property that is inherited from ancestors, whereas the latter is property acquired through the efforts of family members. The “inherited property,” argued Sung, allows male descendants to fulfill their duty of perpetuating their family line, that is, only those family members who are in the descent line are entitled to claim the property. On the contrary, all family members (including women) share rights to the “acquired property.” Thus, as Sung aptly put it,
<disp-quote>
<p>because the dead retain rights in inherited property, a man cannot give land to his daughter without risking their displeasure. . . . But the dead have no interest in acquired property. A man is thus free to give his daughter a share of any land that he has acquired through his own efforts. (367)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If we apply Sung’s argument to the Peng Lianqing case, we come to the conclusion that the land inherited by Peng Lianqing was acquired property, whereas the houses were inherited property. This would explain why villagers allowed Peng Lianqing to inherit the land but not the houses. However, this conclusion has two major flaws. First, technically, it is hard or even unfeasible to draw a clear-cut boundary between “inherited property” and “acquired property.” In the Peng Lianqing case, we do not know whether the money used by Peng Yongfa to buy the land or the house (or both) was earned by means of a joint effort or was inherited from his ancestors. Second, according to my informants, in the past both land and houses were passed down through partible inheritance along the male line for the purpose of continuing the family line and ancestral worship in perpetuity.</p>
<p>I argue that inheritance arrangements can be seen as a product of the changing socioeconomic value of land and houses in Hong Kong after World War II. During the era of rice cultivation (mainly before the 1960s), land was a valuable resource to be customarily transferred to descendants in the male line, not only for securing their living but also for reproducing the paternal family. Prior to the 1950s, over 80 percent of the land in the New Territories was reportedly under rice cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0097700412463788">Wong, 1971</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0097700412463788">Tregear, 1958</xref>: 12). The elderly Pengs reminisced that at that time their life was hard because the harvest of rice was uncertain (depending on the weather) and also because many families had insufficient land to cultivate. Despite this, there was no alternative for securing or improving their livelihood. Under these circumstances, it is justifiable to transfer land to sons, who usually stayed in the village after marriage and carried on the family line and worship (both domestic and collective), but not to daughters, who would marry out and then rely on their husbands’ family. Consequently, exclusive land ownership in the hands of male Pengs was a significant element in constituting and maintaining the lineage territory.</p>
<p>But after the 1950s, in the New Territories the land devoted to cultivating rice dropped rapidly while the vegetable-growing areas increased significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0097700412463788">17</xref></sup> At that time, in Fanling, for example, many plots of land with good water supplies were rented to immigrants for vegetable cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0097700412463788">Wong, 1971</xref>: 17). These immigrants largely came from Nanhai, Panyu, Shunde, and Dongguan in Guangdong province, where there was a long tradition of growing vegetables for cities. They fled to Hong Kong because they feared the Chinese Communist Party, which came to power in 1949.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0097700412463788">18</xref></sup> Most settled in the rural New Territories and earned a living by growing vegetables on land rented from indigenous villagers. Within a relatively short time, this dramatically changed the New Territories’ land utilization pattern. Notably, the indigenous villagers, including the Pengs, by and large did not switch to vegetable cultivation. This was for two major reasons. First, by letting land to tenants for growing vegetables they made more money from their holdings than they could by cultivating rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0097700412463788">K. Chan, 2005</xref>). Second, many villagers went to work in urban Hong Kong or overseas in countries such as Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where greater income could be earned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0097700412463788">K. Chan, 2007</xref>: 146–51; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0097700412463788">J. Watson, 1975</xref>). As time went by, as more and more Peng villagers made their living by salaried jobs with regular and considerable income instead of meager rental income derived from agricultural land, the economic significance of land for the survival and livelihood of the Peng villagers declined.</p>
<p>Moreover, changing ownership of the Peng land from the 1970s onward has brought a significant change in the size of the lineage territory. It dwindled gradually because of government land reclamation for the purpose of development on one hand<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0097700412463788">19</xref></sup> and the sale of land for profit by the Pengs themselves on the other. The Pengs were willing or eager to sell their land since this would not jeopardize their living, which was no longer based on agriculture. On the contrary, a windfall gain from the sale of land allowed them to afford a high standard of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0097700412463788">K. Chan, 2007</xref>: 101–10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0097700412463788">S. Chan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0097700412463788">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Such an approach to economic gain, nonetheless, does not apply to zuwu (ancestors’ houses) built inside the walled settlement. There are two main reasons. First, the Pengs still believe that this type of house continues to serve significant symbolic and social functions—the continuity of the original bloodline through male inheritance and the perpetuation of domestic ancestor worship as each house contains ancestral tablets. At the domestic level, since each zuwu contains an altar and ancestral tablets, it is a ritual center through which family members can trace their ties to one another, even though they do not share a common residence, usually after family division. At the lineage level, all zuwu as a whole symbolically constitute a collective ritual entity, a sacred site of the Peng lineage. Therefore, keeping this type of housing property intact solely in the Peng male line is strategically important for the maintenance of the walled settlement as a native place to claim their lineage identity. Nowadays, though many outsiders have rented/occupied these houses, they cannot acquire the right of settlement, which is the most important criterion for defining membership in the lineage community.</p>
<p>Second, all zuwu are situated in a geomancically blessed/efficacious settlement that the Pengs believe can bring them and their descendants good fortune. The lineage therefore observes the stringent rule of male inheritance of zuwu in order to preclude outsiders from having a share of, or encroaching on, this good fengshui settlement. According to the elderly Pengs and the Peng genealogy, in the Song dynasty the lineage founder Peng Gui took care of a geomancer who was treated badly by another single-surname lineage. Later, in order to repay Peng Gui’s kindness, the geomancer suggested to him a propitious location to build a new settlement and two choices for his grave in Fanling. As a result, the lineage founder and his descendants followed the geomancer’s instructions and built thatched huts to launch the settlement. Over the generations, the settlement became more populous and villagers built more brick and stone houses to replace the thatched huts. At present, the settlement is not merely a nucleated cluster of houses; it also significantly represents and perpetuates the history and fortune of the Peng lineage.</p>
<p>Though zuwu are not allowed to be transferred to outsiders, many villagers rented out their available zuwu for profit when the demand for rural housing increased substantially from the 1980s onward. Retrospectively, after World War II and the unstable political period in China in 1949, a huge influx of immigrants from China to Hong Kong, together with the subsequently increased birth rate, exacerbated the housing shortage in urban Hong Kong. In order to relieve the overcrowded living conditions, the government has not only provided lost-cost public housing but also commenced the development of new towns in the New Territories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0097700412463788">20</xref></sup> Housing is nevertheless still in substantial demand because of its inadequate supply. In the 1980s, the private housing market began to boom. As a result, more urban people were willing to rent New Territories’ village houses because of the lower rent compared with housing in the urban areas. Village houses for rent in the settlement of the Peng lineage are in great demand because the settlement is situated near the railway station and modern highways linking Fanling to urban Hong Kong and, also, a large shopping mall, swimming pool, sports fields, hospital, and park are available nearby. As a result, many Pengs have rented their houses for profit, arguing that this does not change their legal ownership or infringe on the values contributing to the maintenance of their lineage community.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can understand why the Pengs allowed a married-out daughter (Peng Lianqing) to inherit her father’s land, whereas they insisted that the two zuwu must be under the trusteeship of a married-in woman/widow (Peng Li shi). By custom, after Peng Li shi dies, the houses will be transferred to her adopted son, if available, or to her husband’s closest agnate, thereby maintaining the agnatic community of the Peng lineage. Consequently, Peng Li shi, a village woman well acquainted with this inheritance rule, adopted a son in 1983. Through this practice, she legitimized her right to keep the property and had an heir to carry on her deceased husband’s family line and sacrifices.</p>
<p>Since the Peng lineage accepted Peng Lianqing’s claim to her father’s land, this means that she could exercise the right to sell and dispose of it thereafter. This is evident in her successful sale to outsiders in 1986. When she proposed to sell five pieces (0.25 acres) of land, she observed the common practice of posting her application (which was already submitted to the District Land Officer) on the village notice board to notify villagers and call for their objections, if any, within a month. Eventually, she received no objections to her planned land sales, clearly indicating that it is not impossible for a married-out daughter to possess the absolute right over her inherited land in a patriarchal lineage system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0097700412463788">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, this transfer practice is totally unacceptable when village women attempt to sell village houses. The case of Zhang Wenfeng (Pang Guangwen’s wife) is an illustrative example. Zhang was the sole beneficiary and estate manager of the Peng Guangwen zu mentioned earlier. In 1985, she applied to sell a village house. Not long after she posted her application in the village, the village representatives sent a request to the District Land Officer to suspend her application because of the unknown identity of the buyer. They argued that, by custom, the transfer of the village house to outsiders would not be acceptable, on the grounds of maintaining the integrity of the Peng lineage community. Several months later, the village representatives withdrew the objection after learning that the buyer was a lineage member. Zhang Wenfeng therefore successfully sold the house and used the money to renovate her husband’s grave and to support herself.</p>

<title>Entitlement to Estate Proceeds</title>
<p>Undeniably, in the Peng lineage village, women who are able to become both the estate manager and the sole beneficiary of their heirless husbands’/fathers’ properties (in whose name a trust has been formed) are a minority. Most other unmarried daughters and married-in women in their village are neither members of their husbands’ or fathers’ corporate estates nor do they have any rights to manage those estates. Remarkably, in spite of this exclusion, they share an equal status with their brothers or husbands when it comes to receiving cash dividends from corporate estates. This is a most unusual dividend practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0097700412463788">22</xref></sup> Indeed, lineage studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700412463788">Baker, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0097700412463788">R. Watson, 1985</xref>: 135) have suggested that in a patriarchal system female villagers are considered temporary or transient members of the lineage, and thus are excluded from laying claim to family and lineage property. Apparently this argument or supposition is not applicable to the Peng lineage. How did the Pengs justify this practice, which seems to be anomalous in the New Territories lineage villages, especially when the number of female villagers is nearly the same as or sometimes more than that of the males (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0097700412463788">Table 2</xref>)?</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In this section, I delve into the Pengs’ definition of estate membership and estate beneficiary and examine how this justifies and legitimizes their village women’s entitlement to estate proceeds.</p>
<p>The history of equally dividing estate proceeds among men and women in the Peng lineage can be traced back to the early 1940s. The account book of the Tongxie tang, for instance, shows that in 1942 a total of 878 Hong Kong dollars was granted to 424 men and women belonging to the Peng estate. In the 1980s and 1990s, members of this estate had received additional cash from selling their land to private developers or from surrendering their land to the government for development. The profits derived from land sales or cash compensation in many cases totaled millions of dollars. Take the Lunxian zu, for example. In 1983 the estate received five million Hong Kong dollars cash compensation from the government. The Pengs invested a portion of the proceeds in real estate to support ancestral worship and to subsidize the welfare of estate members. A significant portion of the remaining money was then divided among the estate members themselves and their female family members, namely unmarried daughters and married-in women.</p>
<p>The Pengs adopted two major methods of dividing estate proceeds: per capita and per stirpes. Per capita refers to money divided on the basis of the number of persons while per stirpes refers to division based on the number of lineage branches or households.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0097700412463788">23</xref></sup> Both practices are common in the New Territories lineage villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700412463788">Potter, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0097700412463788">R. Watson, 1985</xref>), but the Pengs have their own unique practices and interpretations. First, when money is divided per stirpes, the youngest son in the family is disentitled from receiving any. Second, unmarried daughters and married-in women share equal status with their brothers or husbands when it comes to receiving cash dividends. Here I focus only on this latter practice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">Selina Chan (1997</xref>: 157–60) has suggested that the Pengs manipulated the contested concept of <italic>qin</italic> to justify their gender-free dividend practice. Qin is interpreted as a close relationship defined in terms of blood ties and sentimental filiation derived from bilateral relations. Therefore, unmarried daughters and married-in women are closely related to the father and the husband respectively, and this entitles them to a cash share of the family property. I agree with Selina Chan’s argument, but I also offer an additional explanation for this gender-free dividend practice with special reference to the villagers’ concepts of estate membership and estate beneficiary.</p>
<p>In the Peng lineage, estate membership is given from father to son and is legitimized by the rite of <italic>diandeng</italic> (literally, “lighting a lantern”). In every first lunar month, a temporary mat-shed (marquee) containing an altar is constructed outside the village walls for this ritual and the subsequent religious ceremony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0097700412463788">24</xref></sup> A pair of lanterns is lit in the mat-shed, and local deities are worshiped. Families that have given birth to sons in the preceding year can offer food to the deities in exchange for a blessing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0097700412463788">25</xref></sup> Moreover, this ritual is a form of social recognition of the lineage membership and estate membership of new-born male descendants. Daughters are excluded from this rite and are deprived of managing the estates, attending meetings, or serving in the hereditary posts in the collective religious activities supported by the corporate estates. But that the Pengs decided to grant cash equally to their female villagers suggests that they have differentiated the concepts of estate membership and estate beneficiary, meaning that all estate members are beneficiaries of their corporate estates, but not vice versa. In other words, the Pengs’ definition of beneficiary is not limited to estate members but, in fact, extends, through the estate members’ descent line, to their wives and unmarried daughters. Therefore, unmarried daughters and married-in women are also entitled to religious benefits by virtue of their relationships to their fathers and husbands. But daughters forfeit their economic and religious entitlements after marriage. This is because, as the Peng villagers have argued, once a married-out daughter becomes incorporated into her husband’s family, she is no longer entitled to enjoy any rights in her natal family and lineage.</p>
<p>But I should note that when female villagers are entitled to enjoy estate proceeds, they are also bound by the responsibility to make financial contributions to the <italic>jiao</italic> religious ceremony, a lineage-based festival held at ten-year intervals for the purpose of purifying the lineage settlement. The Tongxie tang’s account book, for instance, recorded that in 1920, 1930, and 1940 the estate had paid its male and female members to cover their contributions to this festival. Also, as my informants have pointed out, even nowadays, for this religious ceremony the names of all male and female villagers (including unmarried daughters and married-in women) are written on a lengthy piece of paper that a Daoist priest burns and sends to the deities to pray for protection. It is only when female villagers have been married out that their monetary contributions are no longer compulsory and their names will not be mentioned under their fathers’ households in this ritual. This exclusion from the list reveals that married-out daughters are no longer considered members of the family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0097700412463788">
<title>Reactions to the Amendment of the Inheritance Law</title>
<p>As noted above, the 1905 New Territories Ordinance played a vital role in maintaining and reinforcing the traditional male inheritance rights in lineage villages. But in 1994 the government amended the ordinance, allowing daughters to inherit an equal share of family property on grounds of gender equality and human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0097700412463788">26</xref></sup> Before the amendment passed, the Peng villagers actively took part in a series of meetings and demonstrations organized by the Heung Yee Kuk (Council on County Affairs) that argued that this amendment would destroy traditional customs in the New Territories and violate lineage unity. For instance, in early May 1994, about thirty Pengs attended a meeting organized by the Fanling Rural Committee to discuss future strategies (<italic>North District Star</italic>, May 1, 1994). Several days later, more than a hundred Pengs took part in a major demonstration that consisted of more than 7,000 villagers from 27 villages in the New Territories and on the outlying islands. They marched to the government offices in the Central District to express their opposition to the proposed amendment.</p>
<p>In June 1994, despite the indigenous villagers’ strong objection, the amendment was passed. Shortly thereafter, the Kuk made a public statement rejecting it and began preparing to sue the government for destroying the customary rights of the New Territories’ indigenous villagers (<italic>North District Star</italic>, July 1, 1994).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0097700412463788">27</xref></sup> The Pengs lent economic support to the Kuk’s pursuit of legal redress. They contributed approximately 60,000 Hong Kong dollars, donated by four major lineage or communal trusts.</p>
<p>The Pengs I interviewed mostly expressed a common argument: since daughters might inherit their fathers’ property through dowry (such as jewelry) at marriage, they are not disinherited. This is what Jacky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412463788">Goody (1990</xref>: 2) calls the “diverging devolution of property.” As numerous studies have suggested, even after marriage, women do not cut all ties with their natal families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">E. Chan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412463788">Goody, 1990</xref>: 55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700412463788">Judd, 1989</xref>). One of my elderly informants mentioned how his married daughter had always kept in touch with him and his wife and had asked for their financial assistance in times of need. Therefore, many villagers agreed that it was fair to allow only sons to inherit village houses. Also, some of them pointed out that it had always been the custom that when a male villager died, his wife and unmarried daughters were allowed to continue living in his house and to rent out a floor of it to support themselves in times of need, even though they were not the legal owners. By custom, only after the widow died and the daughter married out would the house be claimed by the deceased man’s closest agnate. This compromising strategy allows the widow and unmarried daughters to be protected and supported by their husbands’ or fathers’ properties, while simultaneously ensuring the integrity of the Peng lineage settlement.</p>
<p>This reasoning was overwhelmingly shared among male villagers, regardless of age and education level. Before my fieldwork, I had assumed that more highly educated villagers would hold a more “liberal” view, or even agree about female inheritance rights. But after the interviews, the findings clearly suggested that was not the case. The male villagers usually believed that the lineage tradition of male inheritance of housing property was essential for the maintenance of the Peng community and that everyone should follow it. This hegemonic view on property inheritance grew unconsciously out of daily life and was shaped by community membership. That is, in the process of growing up and being socialized in the lineage community where the patriarchal ideology was emphasized and embedded in everyday life, villagers internalized the meaning and practice of male inheritance of housing property as a tradition to be upheld. This belief was reinforced by the sexist New Territories Ordinance and the Kuk’s role as guardian of Chinese tradition, representing and defending the land interests of indigenous villagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0097700412463788">S. Chan, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0097700412463788">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700412463788">Chun, 1991</xref>). As a result, this cultural hegemony constitutes, consciously or unconsciously, a unifying and authoritative idea, discourse, and practice that has remained entrenched from generation to generation. What is more, the married-in women I interviewed also shared this view with their husbands. They agreed that male-only inheritance of village houses in the lineage settlement was a vital means to maintain lineage unity. Their stance on inheritance matters harmonizes with the male villagers’ reinforcement of the dominant discourse of patriarchal interests in the lineage community.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, only a minority in the village expressed support for female inheritance rights. As a matter of fact, only a few Peng women were found to have different views on this issue. A younger unmarried female villager, for instance, stated that she supported the amendment, not only because of the notion of gender equality, but also because her parents had no male descendant to inherit the house. Under these circumstances, she declared, it was unreasonable for her father’s house to be inherited by a so-called closest agnate who was actually a stranger to her. However, it is noteworthy that no matter how supportive this female Peng informant felt about female inheritance rights, she had never participated in any political activities to fight for them. She explained that she did not want to draw lineage members’ attention to her family’s case during that controversial time. Another unmarried female villager also subscribed to the competing discourse of gender equality to support female inheritance rights in the lineage. Despite this, in order not to confront her traditional-minded father and brothers, she never tried to demand a fair share of the family property. In other words, she was willing to relinquish her property rights in exchange for harmonious family relations with the patriarch and traditional inheritors. Consequently, her self-sacrificing disposition indirectly legitimated and reproduced the hegemony of the customary practice of male-only property inheritance.</p>
<p>It has been eighteen years since the New Territories Ordinance was amended. Nevertheless, during this time, no case has been filed by the Peng women making use of the new inheritance law to lay claim to their fathers’ village houses. This clearly demonstrates that most Pengs, male and female, still unanimously support the importance of the “official order” of male descent and inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700412463788">Judd, 1989</xref>) for the maintenance of lineage unity.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article clearly demonstrates that in the Peng lineage women are not disinherited from the family property and denied the enjoyment of estate proceeds, even though the patrilineal rule of inheritance is a deeply entrenched lineage tradition. Women participate in inheritance in three major ways. First, some heirless families were allowed to form an estate in which only widows and their daughters are the beneficiaries so that their livelihoods can be secured after the death of their husbands or fathers. Second, the villagers devised their own definitions of estate membership and estate beneficiary, thereby allowing female villagers to share an equal status with their husbands or brothers in receiving cash estate proceeds. Third, they manipulated and negotiated lineage community or territory boundaries and the customary inheritance rules regarding the transfer of family property from husband to wife or father to daughter and in the sale of land and houses to outsiders. Consequently, in the Peng lineage, the village zuwu is still commonly reckoned to be essential for the maintenance of the lineage community and its associated sense of identity, which means it must be transferred in the male descent line. As for other types of property, such as land and cash income from corporate estates, since they are not bound up with those social or symbolic meanings, they are considered transferable to female villagers at the owners’ discretion.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Peng lineage is one of the longest-established single-surname lineages in rural Hong Kong. But it is not a unique kinship organization in this region where many such large-scale localized lineages have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1958</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700412463788">1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0097700412463788">Baker, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700412463788">1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700412463788">Potter, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0097700412463788">J. Watson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0097700412463788">R. Watson, 1985</xref>). The Pengs share with other lineages many familiar structural characteristics, cultural traditions, and customs, including sons instead of daughters holding descent status and the patrilineal rule of property inheritance. Also, lineage members share a common residence in a walled or territorially well-defined settlement, and own corporate holdings (at the family and the lineage level) that serve to protect the welfare and interests of its members and to maintain collective worship and its associated identity. The findings of this study of the Peng lineage reasonably suggest that there are also likely to be cases of women’s claim to the property of their natal or husbands’ families in other lineages. Also, I surmise that, in these cases too, villagers would come up with ideas and strategies very similar to those employed by the Pengs that would make women’s property rights socially acceptable and legally legitimate on the condition that they will not infringe upon the collective interests of the lineage. Therefore, in conclusion, it is clear that female property rights are permitted in lineage systems, but they are situational and subject to negotiation in different or changing circumstances.</p>

<p>The centuries-old systems of bondservant (<italic>meizai</italic>) and concubinage, which persisted into the twentieth century, are two examples of a traditional practice perpetuated by the British noninterventionist policy.

But contrary to this view, Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0097700412463788">Chun (1990</xref>: 402) argued that the government had introduced, albeit unintentionally, “subtle changes into the system and petrified the existing order (as artificially constructed) in a way that eventually came to be confused with native tradition.” In other words, the existing local customs were the reinvention of the colonial state itself, which was then re-imposed on the villagers.</p>

<p>Actually, the Pengs’ classification of zu and tang is neither clear-cut nor exhaustive. The Bifeng zu and the Dade tang are examples. The Bifeng zu is not dedicated to one particular ancestor; it is composed of three ancestral trusts, namely the Baohe tang, the Nanqing tang, and the Daqing tang. As for the Dade tang, though registered as a tang, it is an estate dedicated to the lineage founder with an expression of ritual unity with the Pengs of Fanling. For general discussions of zu and tang in the New Territories lineage villages, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700412463788">Freedman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700412463788">Baker, 1968</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0097700412463788">Strauch, 1983</xref>.</p>

<p>In 1905, several years after taking over the lease, the British government conducted land registration and compiled a Block Crown Lease. It recorded the size and location of the area, the owner, the crown rent, and the classes of land. And land in different districts was assigned with a particular District Demarcation Number. The Pengs’ land was mainly in numbers 51 and 91.</p>

<p>In the British colonial system, agricultural land was divided into three classes. First-class lands were those situated near villages in fertile valleys with fertile soil and a good water supply that could produce two crops of rice annually. Second-class lands were less fertile and were generally situated higher up the slopes of hills. With a poorer water supply than first-class lands, second-class lands could only produce one crop of rice annually. Third-class lands were located on still higher slopes that were far away from any good water supply. They were commonly used to cultivate peanuts, sweet potatoes, millet, and other hardy crops that do not require much moisture.</p>

<p>This case has also been discussed by Selina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">Chan (1997)</xref>, but she was misled by her informants, who stated that the land and housing property of Peng Yongfa were both inherited by Peng Lianqing. Based on this misinformation, Selina Chan argued that a married-out daughter’s claim to her father’s property is not related to her marital status. She concluded that “this finding was in contrast to past research indicating that marriage ends a daughter’s claim to the property of her natal family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412463788">S. Chan 1997</xref>: 154–57). But, as I have shown above, this is not the case. The fact is that a married-out daughter was entitled to a share of her father’s land but not village houses. The solution I described should be reliable because the information source is a confidential document kept in the Hong Kong Government office.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, the government started to develop Fanling and Sheung Shui as a new town to re-house some of the growing urban population. This new town covers an area of approximately 780 hectares. In 1982, the government also reclaimed thirteen acres of the Pengs’ land to build a park to provide recreational space for the residents of Fanling and Sheung Shui. Additionally, an industrial site in Fanling, about ten minutes’ walk from the Peng lineage settlement, was developed. Thus from the 1970s to the early 1990s, more than 500 hectares of land had been taken over by the government for this new town project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412463788">Hong Kong Government 1984</xref>: 132; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700412463788">1985</xref>: 183; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0097700412463788">1994</xref>: 208).</p>

<p>The Pengs also did not bar the widows of several estates from selling their Land Exchange Certificate (Letter B) to make a profit. In the 1960s, the Hong Kong government began to offer landowners whose agricultural lands were reclaimed for development a choice of either cash compensation or an exchange for land elsewhere, at a ratio of five square feet of agricultural land in exchange for two square feet of building land. When landowners opted for land exchange, they would receive a letter issued by the government called Letter B.</p>
