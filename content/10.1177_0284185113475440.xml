               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To determine the feasibility of adenosine-stress low-dose single-scan CT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using a 128-slice dual-source CT scanner for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis as defined by fractional flow reserve (FFR).</p>

               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>This study was proved by the Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the patients before enrollment in the study. Ninety-seven patients with chest pain and low-to-intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. Adenosine-stress CCTA using ECG-correlated maximum tube current modulation (Mindose<sup>®</sup>) with 128-slice dual-source CT was performed in all 97 patients. In 37 patients (38.1%; 28 men, nine women; mean age, 61.7 ± 20.5 years; mean heart rate, 74.6 ± 2.8 bpm) with significant stenosis at CCTA (lumen diameter reduction &gt;50%), FFR was performed after CCTA, as a reference standard for the evaluation of myocardial perfusion. FFR value ≤0.75 was considered as positive. CTMPI and CCTA were read by two experienced radiologists with consensus, respectively.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>The effective radiation dose of adenosine-stress single-scan CTMPI was 4.63 ± 2.57 mSv. Compared with FFR, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for identifying significant coronary stenoses were 93.1%, 82.7%, 75.0%, and 95.6%, respectively, on CCTA and 93.1%, 90.3%, 84.4%, and 95.9%, respectively, on CTMPI. On combined CCTA and CTMPI, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 93.1%, 94.2%, 90.0%, and 96.0%, respectively.</p>

               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>Adenosine-stress low-dose single scan CTMPI using a 128-slice dual-source CT can provide complementary information on the hemodynamical significance of coronary artery stenosis as well as anatomical information of coronary arteries.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>With the advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) technology, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has been used with increasing frequency as a non-invasive modality for assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C3">3</xref>). Although CCTA has excellent diagnostic accuracy in the detection and exclusion of significant coronary artery stenosis, a major limitation of CCTA is that physiologic significance of stenotic lesions can be unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C4">4</xref>). Recently, several studies have shown the clinical feasibility of adenosine-stress CT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and that CTMPI could help overcome the limitation of CCTA alone in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C8">8</xref>). Generally, a CTMPI protocol consists of a stress-phase acquisition and a rest-phase acquisition, similar to nuclear MPI and magnetic resonance (MR) MPI. These data acquisitions are aimed for the evaluation of myocardial perfusion information as well as coronary artery anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C9">9</xref>). The most recently developed 128-slice dual-source CT (DSCT) has a high temporal resolution and tube current modulation technique to minimize radiation dose. By using this new scanner, information on coronary artery anatomy and MPI can be obtained simultaneously even in patients with high heart rate (HR) induced by adenosine stress. Intracoronary pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) has been known as a well-established invasive method to assess the functional significance of coronary stenosis with a high index of accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C10">10</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to determine the feasibility of adenosine-stress low-dose single-scan CTMPI using a 128-slice DSCT for diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis as defined by FFR.</p>

            <p>This prospective study protocol was approved by our institutional review board and all patients gave written informed consent. Patients were recruited between January and April 2010. Inclusion criteria were age &gt;40 years, and symptomatic presentation with low-to-intermediate probability of CAD. Exclusion criteria were unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome, previous history of percutaneous coronary stent implantation or coronary bypass graft surgery, atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmia, hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media, impaired renal function (serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 mg/dL), pregnancy or lactation, and inability to hold the breath for 20 s. Of 180 patients who met the inclusion criteria, seven patients had previous coronary artery stent implantation, nine patients had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery, two patients had myocardial infarction, four patients had atrial fibrillation, three patients had more than second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and 58 patients refused to participate. The 97 remaining patients underwent adenosine-stress CCTA and two patients with poor image quality of CCTA with motion artifacts were excluded. Finally, 37 patients who had single or multi-vessel significant stenosis with diagnostic image quality, defined as coronary artery stenosis &gt;50% diameter stenosis in at least one major epicardial coronary artery on CCTA underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with FFR. Subsequently, we compared CCTA with FFR and CTMPI and FFR on a per-vessel basis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475440F1">1</xref>).

            <p>Prior to CCTA, the blood pressure and heart rate (HR) of each patient were measured. No medication other than adenosine was administered. Vital signs including blood pressure, HR, oxygen saturation of arterial blood, and ECG were monitored in the scanning room.</p>

            <title>128-slice dual-source CT scanning protocol</title>
            <p>Patients were advised not to consume any caffeine for at least 24 h before the CT scan. On arrival, two intravenous lines were inserted via two different antecubital veins (an 18-gauge needle for contrast delivery, 20-gauge needle for adenosine infusion). Adenosine was infused at 140 μg/kg/min for &gt;3 min. Contrast material was injected 3 min after the initiation of adenosine infusion, and CT scan was started using a bolus tracking technique. The CT scan and adenosine infusion were stopped simultaneously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475440F2">2</xref>). CT examinations were performed on a 128-slice DSCT (Definition Flash, Siemens Medical Solution, Forchheim, Germany) with a rotation time of 280 msec, slice collimation of 2 × 64 × 0.6 mm using continuous helical scan with electrocardiography (ECG)-dependent maximum tube current modulation technique. The CT scan was triggered automatically by the arrival of the main contrast bolus. A region of interest was placed at the ascending aorta, and image acquisition began 5 s after the signal density level reached the predefined threshold of 100 Hounsfield units (HU). For all CT examinations, a dual-head power injector (Stellant D; Medrad, Indianola, PA, USA) was used to administer a dual-phase bolus at a rate of 5 mL/s: first, 70 mL of iopromide (Ultravist 370, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) was administered. Thereafter, 20 mL of a 20:80 mix of contrast material and saline was administered. ECG-dependent maximum tube current modulation was performed with the following parameters: helical scanning; pitch, 0.16–0.22; tube current, 200 mA during 300–400 msec from prior R peak; minimal tube current, 8 mA during the remainder of the R-R interval. Tube voltage (kVp) was chosen based on patient's body habitus: 100 kVp when body mass index (BMI) was &lt; 25, 120 kVp when BMI was ≥25.

            <title>CT angiography using a 128-slice dual-source CT angiography: image reconstruction and analysis</title>
            <p>Images were reconstructed at 300–400 msec from prior R peak in 10 msec increments to obtain optimal coronary artery images. For reconstruction of transverse images obtained by CT scan, we used a slice thickness of 0.7 mm and a slice width of 0.4 mm with a small- or medium-sized cardiac field of view. Medium-hard algorithm (Siemens B26) was used for reconstruction. All CT data-sets were transferred to a dedicated workstation (Leonardo, Siemens Medical Solutions). Image sets available on the workstation included axial source images, curved maximum intensity projection (MIP) images rotated through 360° along the course of each coronary artery and major side branches, thin-slap (3 mm) MIP images and volume-rendered images. Image quality was described for each vessel as follows: 1, non-diagnostic (severe artifacts impairing accurate evaluation); 2, adequate (moderate artifacts, acceptable and diagnostic); 3, good (minor artifacts, good diagnostic quality); 4, excellent (no artifacts). Two experienced readers (with 10 and 8 years of experience in cardiovascular imaging) without knowledge of the patient's clinical information and results of CTMPI and FFR reviewed all CCTA images on a per-vessel basis in consensus. Vessel diameters were measured on reconstructions orthogonally oriented to the vessel central line. A coronary stenosis was classified as significant stenosis if the average lumen diameter reduction was &gt;50% as compared with proximal reference vessel diameter.</p>

            <p>After evaluation of CCTA for coronary artery stenosis, the same data-set allowed evaluation of CTMPI using an extra smooth filter (Siemens B10). For each data-set, a double-oblique technique was used to create true short-axis, 10 mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction images to decrease image noise and improve contrast resolution for visualization of normal and ischemic myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C7">7</xref>). The standard American Heart Association 17-segment model was used for standardized assessment of CT myocardial perfusion imaging and for a user-defined narrow window width and window level setting to better evaluate subtle myocardial attenuation differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C2">2</xref>). In addition, for each data-set image quality was identified by a three-point scale: 1, poor (non-diagnostic, major artifact); 2, moderate (acceptable, minor artifact); 3, good (no artifact). Two independent experienced readers (with 10 and 8 years of experience in cardiovascular imaging) without knowledge of patient's clinical information read all CTMPI images on a per-vessel basis using visual assessment for the identification of perfusion defects. For any disagreement between two readers in data analysis, consensus reading was performed.</p>

            <p>ICA was performed by standard techniques within 1 week after CCTA. The angiograms were analyzed by three experienced interventional cardiologists with consensus blind to CCTA, CT MPI results using quantitative coronary angiography software (QantCor, QCA, Pie Medical Imaging, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Quantitative analysis was based on the angiographic projection showing the most severe luminal narrowing. More than 50% luminal diameter reduction was considered to be positive.</p>

            <title>Performance and analysis of fractional flow reserve</title>
            <p>FFR was assessed with a coronary pressure wire (Radi Medical Systems, Uppsala, Sweden) in all 37 patients involving 81 territories with a luminal narrowing between 50% and 85% (maximum of two per subject). Maximal myocardial hyperemia was induced with a continuous intravenous infusion of adenosine in a femoral vein at an infusion rate of 140 μg/kg/min for a minimum of 2 min, following positioning of the pressure sensor distal to the stenosis. During maximal hyperemia, FFR was computed as the ratio of the mean distal pressure, measured by the pressure wire, divided by the mean proximal pressure measured by the guiding catheter. FFR value ≤0.75 was considered functionally significant and regarded as positive. If more than one coronary artery stenosis was present within the same perfusion territory, the most severe stenosis was considered for analysis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C11">11</xref>). All ICA's with FFR was performed within 1 week after completing adenosine-stress CCTA</p>

            <p>The dose-length product (DLP, measured in milligray-centimeters) defined as the volume CT dose index multiplied by scan length is an indicator of the integrated radiation dose of the entire CT examination. DLP was displayed on the dose report on the CT scanner and recorded. A reasonable approximation of the effective radiation dose (E) of CCTA was calculated by multiplying DLP by a conversion coefficient for the chest (κ = 0.014 mSv/[mG × cm]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C12">12</xref>).</p>

            <p>All statistical analyses were performed with statistical software (MedCalc, Version 9.4.2.0.; Mariakierke, Belgium). Continuous data are presented as the mean ± SD and categorical variable data are reported as percentage. The diagnostic accuracy of CCTA for identification of significant stenosis in coronary artery and CTMPI for the detection of significant perfusion defect was expressed as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) on a per-vessel basis with ICA or FFR as reference standard; 95% confidence intervals were provided for each estimated stenosis.</p>

         <p>All 37 patients (men, 28; mean age, 61.7 ± 20.5 years; mean heart rate, 74.6 ± 2.8 bpm) successfully completed adenosine-stress CCTA, ICA, and FFR without serious adverse side-effects including persisting angina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475440F3">3</xref>). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475440TB1">1</xref> lists the clinical characteristics of the patients. FFR was also performed in 81 vessels. All CCTA and CTMPI images were diagnostic and acceptable in quality for interpretation of coronary artery stenosis on CCTA (average image score = 3.2 ± 0.3) and perfusion defect on CTMPI (average image score, 2.2 ± 0.2), and the mean radiation dose was 4.63 ± 2.57 mSv. As compared FFR, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CCTA were 93.1%, 82.7%, 75.0%, and 95.6%, respectively. On CTMPI, the diagnostic parameters as compared with FFR were as follows: sensitivity, 93.1%; specificity, 90.3%; PPV, 84.4%; NPV, 95.9%. On combined CCTA and CTMPI, the diagnostic parameters as compared with FFR were as follows: sensitivity, 93.1%; specificity, 94.2%; PPV, 90.0%; NPV, 96.0%. In addition, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of ICA were 100%, 94.2%, 90.6%, and 100%, respectively, by using FFR as reference standard (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475440TB2">2</xref>).

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The use of CCTA to assess myocardial perfusion information with regard to physiological significance of coronary stenosis was limited because coronary flow is maintained up to stenosis of 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C16">16</xref>). MDCT imaging of the heart allows assessment of coronary arteries as well as myocardium. Thus, study of myocardial perfusion imaging using MDCT has been performed for decades. Early data suggest that MDCT is able to detect hypo-attenuating myocardial segments related to perfusion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C18">18</xref>).</p>
         <p>With the development of first generation DSCT (64-slice dual-source CT), there have been several studies on CTMPI using DSCT. Blankstein <italic>et al.</italic> suggested the feasibility of a cardiac CT protocol that combines stress and rest CTMPI together with CCTA in a single examination. In addition, they showed that not only stress CTMPI had comparable diagnostic accuracy to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in detecting hemodynamically significant stenosis but also that total radiation dose used in these CT protocols was equivalent to that of SPECT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C7">7</xref>). DSCT with dual-energy CT (DECT) mode creates an iodine map for the assessment of myocardial perfusion status and DECT even without adenosine-stress has the potential to allow detection of coronary artery stenosis and to reveal the hemodynamic significance of the detected stenotic lesion on myocardial perfusion from a single examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C22">22</xref>). Ko <italic>et al</italic>. showed that DECT with adenosine- stress has the potential to detect myocardial perfusion defects with greater sensitivity and accuracy than adenosine-stress single-energy CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C23">23</xref>). Newly developed dynamic CT-based stress MPI shows promise in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C11">11</xref>).</p>
         <p>It has been reported that FFR is a highly accurate index of myocardial ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C24">24</xref>). Most recently, comparison of CTMPI using 320 detectors with FFR was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C25">25</xref>) and FFR was also used in our study as the gold standard. In our study, we used second generation DSCT (128-slice DSCT) with fastest temporal resolution and simple protocol, not including rest CTMPI, and this protocol could decrease radiation dose significantly. Stress perfusion images using MR imaging (MRI) had a comparable diagnostic accuracy with combined stress and rest perfusion images in CAD diagnosis in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C26">26</xref>). Furthermore, ECG-based tube current modulation, such as in the Mindose<sup>®</sup> technique employed in our study allows to save even more radiation dose. According to Feuchtner <italic>et al.</italic>, two-step (rest and stress) CTMPI using high-pitch and step-and-shoot modes could also allow for the detection of reversible myocardial ischemia and significant coronary stenosis simultaneously with a very low radiation exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C27">27</xref>). Diagnostically acceptable image quality was acquired in all patients thanks to the high temporal resolution of 128-slice DSCT, while the tube current was set at a maximum only during late systolic phase and was reduced substantially outside this phase (4% of maximum tube current). The diagnostic accuracy of CTMPI in our study was comparable to those of previous studies in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in spite of significantly lower radiation exposure. In our study, HR was elevated &gt; 70 bpm in all patients when adenosine was infused. Therefore, we obtained CT data during late systolic phases for coronary artery and myocardial perfusion evaluation, because using a systolic window pulsing could present high image quality in patients with &gt; 75 bpm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475440C28">28</xref>).</p>
         <p>Our study has several limitations: first, a relatively small number of patients in our single-center study might have resulted in no difference between CCTA and CTMPI in the diagnostic accuracy. Thus, a multicenter study in a large population needs to be performed. Second, false-positive perfusion defects caused by beam-hardening artifacts still posed a dilemma for the use of CTMPI in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. False-negative perfusion defects were seen in our study due to motion artifacts and inadequate viewing window widths and levels. Finally, we did not perform other perfusion imaging modalities such as SPECT or MRI for comparison of diagnostic accuracy. Thus, future studies are needed to compare diagnostic accuracy of CTMPI and those of MRMPI or SPECT.</p>
         <p>Despite these limitations, our initial single-scan stress low-dose CTMPI demonstrated its feasibility and acceptable diagnostic accuracy as compared to FFR in detecting functionally relevant coronary stenosis causing stress-induced myocardial perfusion defects.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, adenosine-stress low-dose single-scan CTMPI and CCTA using a 128-slice DSCT provides information on myocardial perfusion with low radiation dose and may provide complementary information on hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis as well as on coronary artery anatomy.</p>
