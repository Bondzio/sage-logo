<abstract>
<p>This study investigates instrumental music teaching strategies in higher education settings, in order to identify those employed and their frequency and context of use. An instrument- and gender-balanced sample of 24 lessons from five institutions was analysed using a researcher-designed observational instrument. The results reveal the predominance of teacher demonstration, general directives and praise as most frequent teaching strategies employed in lessons. Gender differences emerged in the teaching approaches: the male teachers gave more general directives and explanations and the female teachers offered more answers and practice discussions; the male students received the most specific teacher criticism despite uniform use of praise. The findings provide new evidence of teaching practices in advanced instrumental studios and raise questions regarding gender issues in music teaching.</p>

<p>One-to-one instrumental music teaching is a specialized teaching situation and as such employs teaching strategies that are unique to that setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411431392">Uszler, 1992</xref>). Existing research has investigated certain aspects of studio teaching such as modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411431392">Hewitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431392">Siebenaler, 1997</xref>), teacher talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411431392">Young, Burwell, &amp; Pickup, 2003</xref>), reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411431392">Duke &amp; Henninger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby, 1997</xref>), questioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411431392">Burwell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411431392">Rosenshine, Froehlich, &amp; Fakhouri, 2002</xref>) and practising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411431392">Connolly &amp; Williamon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411431392">Jorgensen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the frequency and context of use of various teaching strategies in applied music lessons? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0255761411431392">Speer (1994)</xref> reported that student playing occupied the greatest part of piano lessons, followed by verbal teacher comments and modelling. In string lessons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit (2000)</xref> identified 41% of lesson time as being devoted to student performance, 45% to teacher talk and 20% to teacher modelling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411431392">Sogin and Vallentine (1992)</xref> reported that student playing occupied 40% in university-applied music lessons, and teacher talk 37%. These studies suggest that, after student playing, teacher talk and modelling constitute the bulk of instrumental lessons.</p>
<sec id="section1-0255761411431392">
<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0255761411431392">
<title>Teacher talk</title>
<p>If teachers spend such a large proportion of their lessons talking, what is the nature and purpose of that talk? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411431392">Pallister (1995)</xref> investigated the piano studio teaching context and observed that teacher talk consisted of task statements (directives), feedback and questioning in nearly equal proportions (27–29% each) and minimal teacher explanations (only 2%). However, these results are probably unique to the setting of the study, which involved young beginner students and experienced but non-tertiary educated teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit (2000)</xref> classified verbalizations of Suzuki string teachers’ (in order of frequency) as directives, information statements, approvals, questions, disapprovals and off-task statements. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411431392">Young, Burwell, and Pickup (2003)</xref> found that teacher directives (‘command-style’ teaching strategies) were a predominant teaching strategy in instrumental music lessons at university level. These studies highlight the need for further clarification in the classification of teacher statements and their comparative importance in lessons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0255761411431392">
<title>Feedback</title>
<p>Evaluating student playing is a vital part of instrumental music lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411431392">Lehmann, Sloboda, &amp; Woody, 2007</xref>) and is associated with effective teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411431392">Hendel, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Teacher praise and criticism can have a significant impact on students’ motivation. Research has shown that positive teacher statements had a greater motivating effect on student playing than negative statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411431392">Bartholomew, 1993</xref>), in particular with younger students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411431392">Duke, 1999</xref>). An important question is how to balance approval and disapproval in teaching. In a classroom setting, an 80% approval rate was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431392">Single (1991)</xref>. In an instrumental music studio, teacher approval rate may be related to the student’s age, with teachers, in general, being more positive with younger students and more critical with older students. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411431392">Duke and Henninger (2002)</xref> reported higher tolerance of teacher criticism by higher education music students who seemed to rate teacher directives and negative feedback equally.</p>
<p>The balance between specific and generic statements also plays an important role in teacher feedback. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411431392">Bartholomew (1993)</xref> suggests that excessive general negative remarks will undermine students’ confidence and insincere praise leaves students confused about their achievements. The research evidence on the use of specific and general feedback is mixed, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411431392">Carpenter (1988)</xref> reporting greater use of general positive feedback by school band conductors and two more recent studies showing more specific positive feedback and less general positive comments given by expert teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431392">Siebenaler, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The reviewed studies raise questions about the appropriate balance between praise and criticism and the role of specific and general feedback in higher education instrumental teaching.</p>

<sec id="section4-0255761411431392">
<title>Questioning</title>
<p>While teacher modelling, feedback and directives comprise a large part of an instrumental lesson, little is known about what role teacher questions and answers play in learning. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411431392">Carpenter (1988)</xref> reports that questions constitute only 3% of teacher verbal instruction and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0255761411431392">Yarbrough and Price (1989)</xref> found less than 2% of questions in teacher verbalizations. However, research shows that effective use of questioning can have a positive impact on student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431392">Single, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411431392">Burwell (2005)</xref> suggests that subtle teacher questioning can provide the impetus for more active and reflective student learning. Teachers need to monitor their talk to avoid disguising directives as questions and using rhetorical questions as such use can lead to passive attitudes in students.</p>
<p>The type of questions being asked by teachers is an important factor in student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431392">Single, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411431392">Rosenshine, Froehlich, and Fakhouri (2002)</xref> identified two types of questions usually asked by teachers: those requiring factual answers and those calling for an explanation of how the answer was found. Although the idea of the benefits of using higher order questions has been generally accepted in education, there is little evidence of the actual use of different types of questions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby (1997)</xref> found that while expert teachers asked fewer questions than the student or novice teachers overall, there were eight times as many specific questions as non-specific questions.</p>
<p>Research so far indicates that questioning is an under-used strategy in instrumental teaching. Further evidence of the frequency and the type of questions being employed in higher education studios is needed.</p>

<title>Organizational skills</title>
<p>Lesson planning is of crucial importance in classroom music teaching, but is it necessary in one-to-one instrumental tuition? In higher education, it is commonplace for applied music teachers to allow students to set the agenda for a particular lesson. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411431392">Kennell (2002)</xref> points out: ‘the pre-lesson production of elaborate teaching plans is not typically a part of the studio lesson tradition’ (p. 251). Yet, there is still the need for instructional systematization such as explicit directions regarding practice, choice of repertoire, use of structural analysis of music, organizational skills and outline of future directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411431392">Abeles, Goffi, &amp; Levasseur, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411431392">Persson (1996)</xref> confirmed that a lack of progression from one lesson to the next and of clearly identified objectives was discouraging to university students. While research has highlighted good organizational skills as a vital part of effective music teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411431392">King, 1998</xref>), unfortunately typical instrumental lessons often lack clear goals, specific tasks and systematic teaching patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411431392">Karlsson &amp; Juslin, 2008</xref>). These studies highlight the need for a greater focus on the organizational skills of instrumental teachers.</p>

<sec id="section6-0255761411431392">
<title>Practising</title>
<p>Research has investigated many aspects of instrumental practising (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411431392">Zhukov, 2009a</xref>, for an in-depth review of the literature). The role of instrumental teachers is to demonstrate different practice strategies to students, set achievable goals and evaluate the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411431392">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411431392">Rosenshine, Froehlich, and Fakhouri (2002)</xref> suggested that clear teacher instructions on how to practise can facilitate student progress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411431392">Hallam (1997)</xref> describes practice as a metacognitive activity. She suggests that in addition to developing technique, interpretation, memory and performance skills, students need to think about how they habitually practise.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411431392">Barry (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411431392">Pace (1992)</xref> have identified several effective practice strategies, for example practising slowly, with the metronome, mental rehearsal, clapping rhythm and structural analysis. The most common practice strategy is repetition. However, advanced musicians tend to increase the length of mastered passages into progressively longer sections of the piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411431392">Jorgensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411431392">Miklaszewski, 1989</xref>). Another practice strategy is practising away from the instrument without moving a muscle. Research has shown that mental rehearsal is effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411431392">Pace, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411431392">Rosenthal, Wilson, Evans, &amp; Greenwalt, 1988</xref>) and can improve memory and heighten sensory awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411431392">Connolly &amp; Williamon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0255761411431392">Tannhauser, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Higher education applied music teachers are working with advanced adult students, and therefore assume certain knowledge about practising methods. And yet, research has shown that at this level teachers are more specific in their directives and offer a wide range of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411431392">Barry &amp; McArthur, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411431392">McPherson and Zimmerman (2002)</xref> suggest that by allowing students to decide which practice methods to use, teachers encourage their independence, thinking skills and motivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0255761411431392">
<title>Teacher modelling</title>
<p>Teacher demonstration is an important component of an instrumental music lesson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411431392">Lehmann, Sloboda, &amp; Woody, 2007</xref>). While verbal directions and explanations are equally necessary, a practical demonstration can synthesize all the diverse elements together into a complete performance, which can be absorbed by all the senses (visual, aural and tactile). Musicians acknowledge modelling as vital to improving performance skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411431392">Barry &amp; Hallam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411431392">Radocy &amp; Boyle, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411431392">Dickey (1992)</xref> found significant research evidence that teacher modelling promotes student achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431392">Siebenaler (1997)</xref> confirmed that in piano lessons teacher modelling was an important part of the most effective lessons, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411431392">Barry and Hallam (2002)</xref> also emphasized the need for teacher demonstrations to act as appropriate models for student learning. Conversely, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411431392">Rostvall and West (2003)</xref> reported that lack of teacher demonstration had a negative effect on student learning.</p>
<p>In earlier research, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411431392">Rosenthal (1984)</xref> compared the effects of four different teaching strategies on the accuracy of advanced instrumentalists’ practice (guided model, model only, guide only and practice only), and found that subjects in the model-only group consistently attained the highest scores. This suggests that direct teacher modelling, without verbal comments, may be the most effective teaching strategy to improve the accuracy of student playing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411431392">Rosenthal, Wilson, Evans, and Greenwalt (1988)</xref> reached similar conclusions, when they examined the relationship of five practice conditions (modelling, singing, silent analysis, free practice and controlled practice) to the performance accuracy of advanced wind players. In more recent studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411431392">Linklater (1997)</xref> found that students improved more in home practice after watching the model videotape than after listening to the audio model or the accompaniment part only, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411431392">Hewitt (2001)</xref> showed that listening to a model improved student playing in the areas of tone, rhythm and interpretation, but not intonation or accuracy.</p>
<p>Research on modelling has established that demonstration plays a vital role in instrumental learning. Its importance in higher education settings has to be assessed.</p>
<p>The overview of literature found limited evidence on instrumental teaching strategies in higher education, such as high incidence of teacher talk with predominant usage of directives, more specific practice approaches and greater criticism of student playing. Research from other music settings suggests that teacher modelling, specific praise and questioning could play an important role in effective instrumental instruction. In addition, numerous approaches to efficient practising have been established. The significance of these factors in actual instrumental music lessons in higher education needs to be evaluated.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to identify those teaching strategies in use in contemporary Australian higher education instrumental music lessons and rank them in order of frequency. Gender differences between the teachers and the students were to be examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0255761411431392" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The large study adopted the approach of systematic observation that employs highly structured protocols to analyse videotaped data of instrumental music teaching. Many aspects of teaching were investigated, including lesson structure, content, teaching methodology and teacher/student relationship. This article reports the findings on teaching strategies.</p>
<p>Twelve prominent teachers from five Australian higher education institutions and their 24 students participated in the project. The teachers were employed full-time by the institutions and had established a reputation as successful teachers and performers nationally. The impact of institutional culture was diminished by involving instrumental staff from five higher education institutions to arrive at a sample representative of typical teaching in this setting. The sample was instrument- and gender-balanced, with four teachers of piano, wind and strings and equal numbers of male and female teachers and students in each instrument group. An examination of three groups of instruments provided the opportunity to focus on universal aspects of instrumental teaching, rather than on a narrow range of instrument-specific problems. Recruitment of equal numbers of participants of each gender allowed for a gender analysis of results largely missing from research to date. Each teacher was videotaped teaching two lessons: one with a male student and one with a female student. The camera was left unmanned on ‘auto’ to minimize disruption to lessons. Teacher behaviours during the lessons were categorized and their frequencies counted.</p>
<p>Based on the literature review and previous observational research of instrumental teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431392">Gipson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411431392">Hepler, 1986</xref>), an observational instrument was developed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431392">Gipson (1978)</xref> measured 37 discrete behaviours in wind lessons, counting verbal and musical behaviours. Hepler (1986) used more generalized categories, such as student playing and teacher talking and focused on teacher field-dependence. Teacher questioning was measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431392">Gipson (1978)</xref>, feedback by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411431392">Hepler (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431392">Gipson (1978)</xref>, modelling and practising have been highlighted by research, and explanations and directives were included in more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411431392">Young et al., 2003</xref>). The categories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411431392">Table 1</xref>) were refined in pilot studies, criterion- and content-validated and tested for inter- and intra-judge reliability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0255761411431392">Zhukov, 2009b</xref>, for details). Criterion validity was established by incorporating categories used in earlier research into the observational instrument. Modifications and new categories were based on pilot studies of analysing random 10-minute samples of lessons. Content validity was established by comparing the definitions of each category with three instrumental experts’ descriptions of video examples in that category to arrive at a final definition. Reliability of the observational instrument was determined by high correlations (0.83–0.91) between the scoring by the researcher and the three postgraduate music education students who received training in the use of the observational instrument. Correlation of 0.99 between the researcher’s original marking and a subsequent marking six months later, verified the intra-judge reliability.</p>

<p>The researcher viewed the videotaped lessons in minute portions, pausing every few seconds to score teacher behaviours in each category. The raw data totals in each category were divided by duration of actual lesson to arrive at a score per minute from which a score per hour was calculated to achieve parity between lessons of different length. Statistical analyses included means and correlations across teacher and student gender.</p>

<p>Gender differences emerged in a number of categories and are discussed under each heading.</p>
<sec id="section11-0255761411431392">
<title>Teacher modelling</title>
<p>The results show that modelling was used widely in this sample of advanced instrumental music lessons. This teacher behaviour was the most frequent overall, generally with a uniform approach across the sample. Both gender groups demonstrated similarly, given the means of 27.1 for the female teachers and 25.5 for the male teachers. The teachers treated the female and male students in the same way, as indicated by the corresponding means of 27.1 and 25.4. The findings support earlier research on the importance of teacher modelling in instrumental teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411431392">Barry &amp; Hallam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411431392">Lehmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411431392">Radocy &amp; Boyle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431392">Siebenaler, 1997</xref>) and highlight its prevalence in higher education studios.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0255761411431392">
<title>General directions</title>
<p>General Directions were the second most frequent teacher behaviour in this study, but they were only half as frequent as Modelling. The male teachers scored higher in this category than the female teachers, given the means of 16.2 and 11.5 respectively. The results suggest that the male teachers attempted to exert more control over their lessons than the female teachers. The scores in the lessons of female students were similar to the lessons of male students: with means of 14.4 and 13.3.</p>
<p>The findings contradict three studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411431392">Young, Burwell, and Pickup (2003)</xref> that reported teacher directives to be the most frequent teacher behaviour. This discrepancy could be explained by the different educational settings that these three studies had examined, along with lack of breakdown of data with regard to gender. In the present study, it was the male teachers who scored higher in the categories of General Directions and Explanation, which together suggests a rather authoritarian approach to teaching by men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0255761411431392">
<title>Feedback</title>
<p>After modelling, teacher evaluation of students’ playing was another frequent teaching strategy in this sample. The four categories of evaluation considered in this study (Positive General, Positive Specific, Negative General and Negative Specific) constituted a total of 22.8% of all teacher behaviours, making Feedback the second most frequent teaching device after Modelling. Both the male and female teachers used about 20% of positive statements to 3% of negative statements in their lessons. The results on reinforcement support earlier research on the high use of praise in instrumental music teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411431392">Bartholomew, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431392">Single, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>On the use of Specific rather than General Feedback, the results between Positive General and Positive Specific are similar across the sample, while the results for Negative Specific are higher than for Negative General across the sample, in particular for the male students (with means of 2.7 and 1.0 respectively). This adds to our understanding of this issue: teachers were more specific when criticizing students, but not when praising them. Yet, the teachers directed more of their specific praise and specific criticism towards the male students (<italic>M</italic> = 10.9 and <italic>M</italic> = 2.7) than towards the female students (<italic>M</italic> = 9.9 and <italic>M</italic> = 1.2). The findings support earlier research that indicated high specific feedback by expert teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431392">Siebenaler, 1997</xref>) and provides further clarification of the issue with regard to gender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0255761411431392">
<title>Questioning</title>
<p>The three categories of teacher questioning (General Questions, Specific Questions and Answers) formed a total of 19.2% of all teacher behaviours, making it a substantial tool in instrumental teaching. The high use of questions by the teachers in this sample can be attributed to the higher education setting in contrast to earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411431392">Carpenter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0255761411431392">Yarbrough &amp; Price, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers used two and a half times more General Questions than Specific Questions with a uniform approach across the sample. While previous research recommended greater use of specific questions, instead of general questions to improve teacher efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431392">Single, 1991</xref>), educational theory and instructional reality may not be one and the same. Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby, 1997</xref>) reported actual usage of specific questions by expert teachers. With little research evidence available in this area, it is difficult to hypothesize the reasons for this result.</p>
<p>Female teachers gave more answers to students than the male teachers (with means of 10.3 and 7.3 respectively). More of the teachers’ answers were directed at the male students than the female students (<italic>M</italic> = 9.6 and <italic>M</italic> = 8.0). These results provide evidence of a more facilitating attitude by the female teachers and towards the male students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0255761411431392">
<title>Explanations</title>
<p>Explanations were the seventh most frequent teacher behaviour in this sample. The male teachers gave more Explanations than the female teachers, given the means of 9.7 and 6.0 respectively. This tendency by the male teachers to provide more explanations suggests that their approach to teaching is more authoritarian than the female teachers. The similarity of results in the lessons of male and female students indicates a uniform treatment of the students by both teacher genders.</p>
<p>While the results do not support earlier findings on the degree of prevalence of explanations in instrumental music teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431392">Colprit, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431392">Goolsby, 1997</xref>), the body of literature that includes teacher explanations in its analysis of music teaching is still small and not gender-specific. The findings nonetheless firmly establish the presence of explanations in advanced music lessons and provide new evidence on gender differences amongst teachers regarding their use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0255761411431392">
<title>Organization</title>
<p>The literature has indicated the need for teachers to possess good organizational skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411431392">Abeles et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411431392">King, 1998</xref>), but no gender attributions have been made in research on effective teaching. In this study, teacher organizational skills were measured using the categories of Attendance, Future Planning and Practice.</p>
<p>Discussions of Future Planning and Attendance were infrequent among the advanced instrumental teaching strategies, with means of only 1.9 and 1.0 in these categories respectively. Most of teacher organization took the form of Practice discussions (the overall mean of 4.4), which is treated separately below. The female teachers were better organized than the male teachers, an assertion that can be justified by significant correlations between the categories of Practice, Future Planning and Attendance for the female teachers (with a correlation of .78 between Practice and Future Planning, .68 between Future Planning and Attendance, and .59 between Practice and Attendance). The negative correlations between all three categories for the male teachers suggest a lack of consistency (–.46 for Practice and Future Planning; –.02 for Future Planning and Attendance; and –.36 for Practice and Attendance). While numerical results were similar for both student groups, the correlations between the three categories show that teacher organization was stronger in the lessons of female students (with correlations of .86 between Practice and Future Planning; .72 between Future Planning and Attendance; and .65 between Practice and Attendance) than in the lessons of male students (with only one significant correlation between Practice and Future planning of .60).</p>
<p>The results suggest that the female teachers were more organized than the male teachers, and that the teachers appeared to be more organized in the lessons of female students. Since previous research has made no gender attributions in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411431392">Abeles et al., 1992</xref>), the findings provide new insights that need to be confirmed by future studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0255761411431392">
<title>Practising</title>
<p>In this study, the participants were advanced adult instrumentalists. These students have already mastered the basics of playing on their instruments and had some knowledge of practising techniques. In general, the observed teachers simply exhorted students to do more practice, with little practical assistance on how to practise, aside from suggestions to play slowly. While the research in this area has identified many innovative ways to practise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411431392">Zhukov, 2009a</xref>), such as mental practice and analysis, there was little evidence of this knowledge being applied in reality.</p>
<p>The results show that discussions of Practice formed a considerable part of organization. The notion of a strong relationship between Practice and Future Planning was borne out by a significant correlation of .71 between these variables across the sample. However, gender differences among the teachers were noticeable. The female teachers devoted more time to discussions of Practice than the male teachers, given the means of 6.0 and 2.8 respectively. While the female teachers talked more about practising, they did not necessarily offer students more advice on how to practise. No gender differences were observed in the treatment of students.</p>

<sec id="section18-0255761411431392">
<title>Summary of gender differences in teacher behaviour</title>
<p>A number of subtle differences between the results of the two teacher groups and the similarities in the male and female teachers’ treatment of the two student groups have been discussed under each category. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0255761411431392">Table 3</xref> highlights these distinctions with reference to the overall mean in each category. Since a large number of variables with relatively small differences were considered, a deviation of 1% from the mean was deemed to be of importance. This produced at least a 2% differential between the two groups being compared.</p>

<p>The male teachers used more explanations and general directions than the female teachers, but gave fewer answers and practice suggestions to the students. The female teachers provided more answers to students’ questions and devoted more time to practice discussions than the male teachers, but offered fewer explanations and directives. The findings suggest a more authoritarian role by the male teachers and a more cooperative role by the female teachers in this sample.</p>
<p>The male students received more specific teacher criticism than the female students. The reasons for this are not clear and might lie in teacher/student social interactions in this particular sample.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings indicate the importance of teacher modelling as the predominant teaching strategy in advanced instrumental music lessons, with teacher directives being half as frequent as teacher modelling in this sample.</p>
<p>The results show that these instrumental teachers were generous overall with their praise, with over 80% of their feedback being positive. While research suggests that specific praise and criticism are more effective than general evaluations, the results of this study suggest that instrumental music teachers tend to be more specific when criticizing, but not when praising their students. That is, teacher criticism is often associated with negative statements directed at a specific student error, in contrast to praising, which is more likely to involve more global positive appraisal. In this study, negative teacher evaluations were largely directed at male students, which raises questions on gender difference in the use of approval and disapproval.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that the teachers were employing general questions much more frequently than specific questions. The tasks in advanced instrumental lessons are very specific, in that the students are involved in mastering a particular technical skill. This perhaps required the teachers to adjust their questioning strategies to a level appropriate to the student skill level. It is also possible that, even in higher education, teachers may not be aware of the type of questions they ask of students, because their knowledge of teaching is largely tacit rather than explicit.</p>
<p>The results in the category of teacher explanations suggest that advanced instrumental teachers did not use this strategy frequently, coming well behind demonstrations, feedback and questioning. The findings show gender differences in the use of explanations, with the male teachers scoring higher in this area.</p>
<p>In the area of organization, the findings indicate that the female teachers were better organized than the male teachers, and that teachers were more organized in the lessons of female students. While it is difficult to establish the reasons for this, the results highlight the need for gender analysis to be included in future research.</p>
<p>The findings in the area of practice were disappointing. While the results indicate that female teachers were more interested in discussing practice than male teachers, these advanced instrumental music teachers did little to develop the range of their students’ practising strategies, aside from exhorting them to practise more and to practise slowly. Instrumental teachers and their students would benefit from testing research findings on innovative practice in their studios.</p>
<p>This study has focused on broad aspects of advanced instrumental music teaching that were not limited to one instrument or by institutional culture. While the results reported here describe a small sample of expert teachers whose teaching might have been influenced by their training, teaching experience and location of their institutions and, therefore, need to be replicated in larger samples of teaching advanced instrumentalists, they provide studio teachers with new evidence of the relative priority of teaching practices and raise questions regarding gender differences in teaching.</p>

<title>Les strategies d’enseignement et genre dans l’enseignement superieur aux studios instrumentales</title>
<p>Cette étude examine les stratégies instrumentales d’enseignments de la musique dans l’enseignement supérieur pour identifier les stratégies employés et leur fréquence et leur context d’utilisation. Un échantillon équilibré en termes d’instrument et de genre constitué de vingt-quatre leçons de cinq institutions ont été analysés à l’aide d’un instrument d’observation conçu par le chercheur. Les résultats révèlent la prédominance de la démonstration du professeur, les directives générales et les éloges comme les stratégies d’enseignement plus fréquemment utilisées dans les leçons. Différences entre les genres ont émergé dans les approches d’enseignement : les enseignants masculins ont donné des directives plus générales et des explications et des enseignants de sexe féminin ont offert plus de réponses et des discussions pratique ; les étudiants masculins ont reçu le plus de critiques spécifique, malgré l’utilisation uniforme de la louange. Les résultats fournissent de nouvelles preuves de pratiques d’enseignement en studios instrumentales avancés et soulèvent des questions au sujet de genre dans l’enseignement de la musique.</p>

<title>Erziehungsstrategien und Geschlecht in Instrumentalstudios in der höheren Erziehung</title>
<p>Diese Studie untersucht Strategien für instrumentale Musikerziehung im Rahmen der höheren Erziehung, um zu identifizieren, welche Strategien angewandt werden sowie mit welcher Häufigkeit und in welchem Kontext. Eine im Bezug auf Instrumente und Geschlecht ausgewogene Mustergruppe von vierundzwanzig Unterrichtsstunden von fünf Institutionen, wurde unter Anwendung eines von Forschern entwickelten Beobachtungsinstruments analysiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, daß Lehrervorführungen, allgemeine Richtlinien und Lob die am häufigsten angewandten Erziehungsstrategien im Unterricht sind. Es wurden Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern festgestellt: die männlichen Erzieher gaben mehr generelle Anweisungen und Erläuterungen, während die weiblichen Erzieher mehr Antworten und Diskussionen zu den Übungen anboten; männliche Schüler bekamen am meisten spezifische Lehrerkritiken, obwohl Lob auf uniformer Weise erteilt wurde. Die Ergebnisse zeigen neue Befunde in Bezug auf Lehrmethoden in Instrumentalstudios in der höheren Erziehung und stellen Fragen über geschlechtsspezifische Aspekte in der Musikerziehung.</p>

<title>Estrategias de Enseñanza y Género en Estudios Instrumentales en Enseñanzas Universitarias</title>
<p>Esta investigación trata sobre las estrategias de enseñanza musical en la universidad a fin de identificar aquéllas que más se emplean y en qué contexto. Se analizó una muestra tomada de cinco instituciones diferentes distribuida homogéneamente por instrumentos y sexo, empleándose un instrumento observacional diseñado por esta investigadora. Los resultados revelan que en clase predominan las estrategias en las que el profesorado muestra cómo tocar, da indicaciones generales y también muestras de ánimo. Se encontraron diferencias de género: los profesores daban más indicaciones generales y más explicaciones, mientras que las profesoras daban más respuestas y hacían más demonstraciones prácticas; los alumnos recibieron más críticas específicas, a pesar del uso uniforme de las alabanzas. Nuestros hallazgos proporcionaron nuevas evidencias de prácticas de enseñanza en el estudio instrumental avanzado y plantearon preguntas sobre el papel del género en la enseñanza musical.</p>
