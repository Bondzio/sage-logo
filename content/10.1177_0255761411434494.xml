<abstract>
<p>The experiences of 72 adolescent musicians who had been members of an advanced youth symphony orchestra or concert band were investigated. An online survey explored previous participation and the importance of past experiences when making future decisions about participation. Previous experience was very positive. Enjoyment of public performances, a sense of musical satisfaction from participating, and opportunities to meet new people and spend time with other musicians were highly rated. First-time decisions to participate were primarily influenced by positive feedback from friends and peers while ongoing participation tended to be based on the positive experience of the musical and social aspects of participation rather than contextual aspects such as location or the input of significant others such as instrumental teachers or parents.</p>

<p>This investigation, carried out in Scotland, explored adolescent musicians’ experience of participation in two advanced youth music ensembles outside school. A framework for data collection was developed to evaluate key dimensions of experience of advanced music ensembles and assess whether those same dimensions were important for future participation. Our intention was to draw together aspects identified in related literature as being important in determining participation, in particular that relating to instrumental learning and extracurricular involvement.</p>
<p>Instrumental learning is a complex process; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411434494">Welch (2007)</xref> argues, musical development does not occur in a vacuum but is a product of interaction over time between biology, developmental and environmental aspects. For example, while personal desire has been identified as an important reason for starting to learn an instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434494">MacKenzie, 1991</xref>), context-oriented feelings of satisfaction are important for continued motivation and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411434494">Rife, Shnek, Lauby, &amp; Lapidus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411434494">Schmidt, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411434494">Chandler, Chiarella and Auria (1988)</xref> identified a similar relationship in the context of instrumental practice. From a more general psychological perspective, positive experience of an activity is a pre-requisite for future re-engagement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411434494">Hagger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411434494">Kukla, 1978</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434494">Hallam (2010)</xref> made this point about young people’s musical engagement in general, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411434494">Neill (1998)</xref> in the context of an adult choir.</p>
<p>Playing in advanced ensembles is an integral part of the development of talented adolescent musicians in the Western classical tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0255761411434494">Subotnik, 2000</xref>), providing a particular type of situated and social learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434494">Moore, Burland, &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>) involving, at various levels, parents, teachers/schools, and peers/friends. Positive experiences of shared social context are critical for sustaining motivation. However, the individual perspective remains important; adolescents keenly monitor their own ability to undertake tasks, relying as much on their own evaluation as that of significant adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411434494">Sichivitsa, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411434494">Eccles (1983)</xref> discussed a personal ‘concept of ability’ that determines whether participation takes place or not. This sense of control contributes to a general sense of motivation, which is greatly enhanced in a musical context when the activity is valued and the outcomes considered worthy of time and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411434494">Sichivitsa, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant environmental aspect for many adolescent musicians is parental influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411434494">Sloboda, 1991</xref>), though parental intrusion can have a negative effect as children get older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411434494">Sloboda &amp; Davidson, 1996</xref>). Adolescents may benefit from, but certainly do not need, parental interest or influence to develop an interest in music if the activity itself is sufficiently attractive and impactful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411434494">Sichivitsa, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The study reported in this paper focused on a particular form of advanced performance-oriented music ensemble operating outside the formal music curriculum in Scotland. Other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411434494">Pitts, 2007</xref>) have also examined performance activities that, while they take place in schools, are not part of the curriculum (often referred to as ‘extracurricular activities’, and including school choirs, orchestras, bands and so on). Some studies have investigated young people’s participation in out-of-school performance activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434494">Lamont, Hargreaves, Marshall, &amp; Tarrant, 2003</xref>), investigating those music activities that adolescents choose to initiate for themselves (sometimes referred to as ‘informal’ music activities). Both forms of activity can play a vital role in musical development and the construction of musical identity, providing a focus for the synthesis of individual, interpersonal, institutional and cultural influences in diverse musical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434494">Hargreaves, Marshall, &amp; North, 2003</xref>). Importantly, research suggests that such activities form the main shared social context in which ‘talented’ adolescent musicians embody and express their musical identities, rather than in formal music classes within school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411434494">Lamont, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411434494">Saunders, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of parents in both decisions to participate in, and ongoing experience of, these kinds of non-formal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0255761411434494">1</xref></sup> activities has received considerable attention. Parents have been shown to play a significant role as motivators, facilitators and coaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411434494">Hoyle &amp; Leff, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411434494">Anderson, Funk, Elliot and Smith (2003)</xref> demonstrated that perceived parental support (and indeed pressure) was a strong predictor of extracurricular involvement. In terms of extracurricular music participation, however, neither parental enthusiasm nor educational level is a strong predictor of engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411434494">Denny, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The positive outcomes of an activity for the individual are often cited as important motivational reasons for participation. There is no shortage of literature that argues a positive association between participation in extracurricular activities and various outcomes, including improved academic achievement at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434494">Cooper, Valentine, Nye, &amp; Lindsay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0255761411434494">Southgate &amp; Roscigno, 2009</xref>), positive attitudes to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411434494">Mahoney, Cairns, &amp; Farmer, 2003</xref>) and improved self-esteem and self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411434494">House, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0255761411434494">Zhang, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Adolescents’ participation in such activities has also been explored from a social perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434494">Guest &amp; Schneider, 2003</xref>). Participation leads to improved social networks and improved social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411434494">Eccles, Barber, Stone, &amp; Hunt, 2003</xref>) and builds confidence and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434494">Holland &amp; Andre, 1987</xref>). One might also suggest that, for the advanced adolescent musician in the Western classical tradition, significant benefits of participating in these advanced activities include the development of technical and artistic skills, the opportunity to broaden repertoire and technique, and the chance to work with (and perhaps compete with) other musicians of similar or greater technical skill.</p>
<p>More general theoretical models of musical and non-musical motivation were also explored, for example that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411434494">Kokotsaki and Hallam (2007)</xref> where music students describe participative music-making under three ‘dimensions’; it is: (1) a musical act; (2) a social act; and (3) an influence on personal skill development, identity, confidence and motivation. The role of other people, such as conductors, who are significant in a musical context, was recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411434494">Matthews &amp; Kitsantas, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Ajzen’s theory of planned behaviour also offered a useful contribution to the research framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411434494">Ajzen, 1991</xref>), suggesting that engagement in a specific behaviour is influenced by three dimensions: attitudes, pressures, and the individual’s sense of control (or ability to perform the behaviour). As the individual considers these beliefs they calculate a subjective probability that the desired outcome is likely to come about if they engage. Though applied more frequently in the context of physical exercise, there is utility in the theory for understanding musical engagement. Participation in musical ensembles can reasonably be considered to involve attitudes (beliefs about the activity, for example that ‘it will be fun’ or ‘it will bring about a desired outcome, like playing a certain kind of repertoire’), pressures (internal and external, for example the need to develop greater technical skill, or respond to an instrumental teacher’s suggestion that we participate) and sense of control (for example ‘am I good enough to get in?’, ‘will I be able to attend rehearsals?’). Developing these dimensions further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434494">Allender, Cowburn, and Foster (2006)</xref> outlined a series of ‘motivations’ behind decisions to participate which include forming new social networks, family/peer support, a sense of achievement, skill development, and enjoyment. In a musical context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411434494">Hallam (2002)</xref> described motivation as ‘interplay’ between individual and environmental aspects.</p>
<p>A range of themes was therefore identified from the literature and the personal experience of the researchers as being of interest including parents, self-concept, evaluations of and feelings towards activities, the social and peer aspects of engagement, and the role of environmental aspects. These stimulated thinking on the dimensions that might be meaningfully captured to understand adolescents’ participation in advanced music ensembles. First, the individual should reflect on their subjective experience of prior involvement, given that these attitudes are important for future participation. They would be asked to evaluate the importance of each aspect of prior experience in determining future participation. Second, we would elicit their experience of contextual aspects of the ensemble, given that environmental aspects have also been shown to be important for future participation. Again, respondents would evaluate the importance of contextual aspects in determining their future participation. Third, we would explore the outcomes of participation, hypothesizing that these too would be important motivational aspects. The importance of such outcomes in determining future participation would then be investigated.</p>
<p>To make the emerging framework meaningful, experience of the activity was sub-divided into perceptions of rehearsals and performances, more general musical experience such as musical and creative satisfaction derived from participation, and social aspects of participation. Experience of the ensemble context was sub-divided into organization (convenience), the role of significant others (parents, instrumental teacher, school music teacher) in the initial decision to participate, and feedback on participation received from various significant others. Experience of the outcomes of participation was sub-divided into impact on musical development, personal capacities, and future-oriented outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411434494">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study involved young musicians from two advanced-level performance ensembles: the West of Scotland Schools Symphony Orchestra (WSSSO, subsequently referred to as SO) and the West of Scotland Schools Concert Band (subsequently referred to as CB). Participation is open to all pupils of secondary age and is by application and competitive audition. In general, the more advanced applicants on each instrument are placed in the SO. However, even if the mandatory standard for orchestra membership is achieved, applicants determine which ensemble they join.</p>
<sec id="section2-0255761411434494">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Participants were drawn from the population of school-age musicians who had taken part in SO or CB in 2009. Membership involves application, competitive audition, and attendance (if selected) at a week-long residential rehearsal course in April and participation in a subsequent concert series. Seventy-two musicians who met this criterion were recruited, representing 49% of the total population who participated in 2009 (<italic>n</italic> = 147). The sample consisted of 38 females, 32 males and two ‘other’. The sample was more balanced in terms of gender than might have been expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411434494">Bucknavage &amp; Worrell, 2005</xref>). Ages were between 14 and 18 years. Forty-one individuals had been members of SO and 31 members of CB during 2009. The parents of each musician received a letter inviting their son/daughter to take part in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0255761411434494">
<title>Measure</title>
<p>Respondents completed an online survey. This was open for completion for a period of two months. IP addresses were logged to prevent multiple attempts at completion.</p>
<p>Variables derived from the framework (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761411434494">Appendix 1</xref>) were measured in terms of (1) respondents’ evaluation of past participation experiences and (2) their perceived importance in future decisions to participate. In most cases variables were contained within a statement and respondents were invited to indicate their agreement with (relating to past experience) or the importance of (relating to future decisions to participate) the aspect reflected in the statement.</p>
<p>Respondents were invited to provide open-ended text comments to explain their responses. They also completed three open-ended questions in which they were asked: ‘why did you decide to take part in the symphony orchestra/concert band?’; ‘why do you continue to take part in the symphony orchestra/concert band?’; and ‘what would stop you taking part in the symphony orchestra/concert band?’. These questions provided a validation function for the dimensions, sub-dimensions and aspects underpinning the rating scale questions and are discussed further in the results section of this paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0255761411434494">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Responses to the ‘agreement’ and ‘importance’ rating questions were treated as ordinal data on the basis that it is unwise to assume a meaningful and constant difference between each point on a five-point Likert-type scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411434494">Agresti, 2010</xref>). The use of parametric testing was therefore avoided; analysis focused on the distribution of responses across the five available agreement or importance points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434494">Clason &amp; Dormody, 1994</xref>). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were carried out to test for between-group differences in SO and CB responses, comparing the observed distribution of rating scores with the expected rank sums under the null hypothesis that there was no difference in distribution.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of qualitative data was generated from the comments boxes. This was analyzed thematically where possible, though for some questions there were insufficient data to reasonably proceed in this way. The report of this data is intended to enhance the understanding of the quantitative data.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0255761411434494" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Results are presented in five sections. The first describes respondents’ personal and musical experiences of participation in SO or CB and evaluates the importance of those experiences in future decisions to participate. The second describes two contextual aspects: organization and the role of significant others. Again, the importance of these aspects for future participation is evaluated. A third section describes respondents’ views of the outcomes of their participation and the importance of such outcomes for future participation. Finally, responses to three general questions regarding participation are summarized.</p>
<sec id="section6-0255761411434494">
<title>Personal and musical experiences</title>
<p>Enjoyment of rehearsals and public performances was high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411434494">Table 2</xref>) and both were believed to impact positively on mood and how participants felt about themselves. CB members agreed with this more strongly than SO members (<italic>z</italic> = 1.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Respondents described the positive challenge that rehearsals afforded: ‘the rehearsals were physically and mentally tiring . . . but the results were fantastic’.</p>

<p>Enjoyment of repertoire performed was generally high while the sense of musical satisfaction derived from participation was very high. Strong agreement relating to enjoyment of the music and sense of creative satisfaction was expressed. There was also strong agreement with statements reflecting positive social experience of participation. Most respondents expressed strong approval of the conductors and other staff, and reported that participation was both a good opportunity to meet with existing friends and to meet new people.</p>
<p>Respondents commented in detail on the personality and skill of both SO and CB conductors;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0255761411434494">2</xref></sup> the critical importance of the conductor’s manner and enthusiasm in creating an enjoyable and positive (though challenging) experience was evident. ‘Exhilaration’ (the visceral effect of performing), ‘nerves’ (which did not detract from enjoyment and, if anything, added to the excitement) and ‘pride’ (a sense of belonging to something excellent) were associated with public performances as was a sense of ‘achievement’ (performing to a high standard) and general feelings of happiness and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Enjoyment of previous rehearsal experiences and performances was an important reason why participants continued to take part, though the impact of these activities on mood and on how respondents felt about themselves was less important. Musical satisfaction was the most important musical outcome for continuing participation, though enjoyment of the music rehearsed and performed were also important.</p>
<p>A shared social experience of participation was also important in decisions to participate, though SO members rated the importance of meeting new people more highly than CB (<italic>z</italic> = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.) Explanatory comments emphasized that social benefits of participation, rather than the musical or personal, were most important for these young musicians.</p>

<title>Contextual aspects of the activities: Organization and significant others</title>
<p>This theme looked at both organization aspects of the activities and the influence of significant others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0255761411434494">Table 3</xref>). While previous rehearsals and performances were reported convenient in terms of location, some scheduling challenges were identified in the open-ended text responses, principally the need to be present at school activities (such as exams). Some respondents considered missing schoolwork a major issue, though attendance at rehearsals could also be a positive ‘stress remover’. Location convenience and facilities for both rehearsals and performances were discussed positively though some cited issues around transport as being problematic. The importance of these issues (including rehearsal location, time and organization) for future participation was quite high. The importance of how the conductor organized the rehearsals was rated more important for future decisions to participate.</p>

<p>Turning to significant others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0255761411434494">Table 4</xref>), respondents were asked to evaluate the importance of instrumental teachers, parents and school music teachers when making first-time decisions to participate. A significant spread of influence was observed, with a notable difference in the role of the instrumental teacher. Parental influence was more balanced in terms of importance, although a notable proportion strongly disagreed that their parents were influential in their decision to take part. There was strong disagreement that school music teachers were influential in their initial decisions to apply for SO or CB membership.</p>

<p>For some respondents, their parents, school music teachers and instrumental teachers had encouraged first-time participation. However, the absence of such encouragement was also a common experience (‘they didn’t care’; ‘they were unaware’; ‘do not take an interest at all’). Instrumental teachers appeared to have played a valuable role for some in informing them of the ensemble, though responses suggested that friends and siblings had played a bigger part in this initial stage. While parents clearly had a facilitating role in terms of paying for the activity and organizing transport, their involvement in initial decisions to participate was surprisingly limited.</p>
<p>Feedback from parents was of mixed importance in ongoing decisions to participate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0255761411434494">Table 4</xref>.) Sibling feedback was rated as less important while the distribution of responses relating to feedback from school music teachers was balanced, suggesting that the importance of this varied across the respondent group. One commented that ‘I would only value the opinion of those who actually know what they’re talking about; i.e., musicians. School music teachers take very little interest’.</p>
<p>While some respondents observed that feedback received from others was a positive stimulant to ongoing participation (‘confidence is built up through the reassurance of these people‘) others reflected more a limited influence (‘I’m doing something I’m passionate about, who cares what other people think’).</p>
<p>Feedback from schoolteachers was more important for SO than CB members. One commented: ‘I couldn’t give a toss what the teachers at school think’. Feedback from non-musician friends was more important for CB than SO members. Respondents considered the feedback they received from musician friends important, as was that from instrumental teachers.</p>
<p>Respondents also evaluated the importance of three groups of significant others (instrumental tutor, parents and music teachers) on their continued participation. Results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0255761411434494">Table 3</xref>) suggested that the influence of the instrumental tutor was very varied. CB members tended to report higher levels of importance more frequently than SO members (<italic>z</italic> = 2.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The importance of parental influence and school music teachers on continued participation was distributed quite evenly, though relatively few attributed the highest level of importance to these groups.</p>

<p>Impact on technical development came about through the challenges of performing advanced repertoire whose execution demanded increased mastery of technique or advances in sight-reading technique. Participation was described as helping participants develop the skills necessary to play as part of an ensemble and as having a positive effect on their musical understanding, particularly in relation to expression and aesthetic awareness. Participation was also believed to have an impact on personal capacities, though responses were distributed between the higher three points on the scale, suggesting that this may not be a consistent experience for all participants.</p>
<p>Finally, respondents evaluated the benefits of participation for schoolwork, for their future career and for university entrance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0255761411434494">Table 5</xref>.) A substantial number felt that participation had little or no effect on their schoolwork, though CB members appeared slightly more positive than SO (<italic>z</italic> = 2.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Comments on career impact tended to focus on the relationship between present experience and a desire to pursue a career in music – for example by discussing the relationship between the ‘skills’ involved in the activities and those that would be required in the future. Other responses considered the ‘aspirational’ aspects of participation, using present experience to decide whether they wished to follow a career in music (which was assumed to have much in common with present experience).</p>
<p>There was fairly strong agreement that social outcomes were important when deciding whether to participate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0255761411434494">Table 5</xref>). Comments referred to the ‘value’ of developing social skills for future employment or engagement in music, or characterized these as generally important skills. This could be taken to mean that these positive outcomes, desirable as they may be, are not significant reasons why these participants choose to attend; for example, ‘you don’t go for friendship, that just comes with it’ and ‘the confidence boost is always welcome’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0255761411434494">Table 5</xref> provides a summary of the importance attached to the impact of participation on musical development, skewed towards higher levels of agreement. CB members rated the impact of participation as being of greater significance in future decisions to participate than SO members (musical ability, <italic>z</italic> = 2.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; instrumental ability, <italic>z</italic> = 2.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; musical understanding, <italic>z</italic> = 2.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Many comments referenced the importance of ‘experience playing in a professional band’, or ‘it improves my playing’. Some identified more specific aspects of musical development; for example, in relation to skills – participation being seen to promote the development of particular aspects of musicianship or technique – or to repertoire – participation being associated with developing knowledge and understanding of new repertoire and composers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0255761411434494">
<title>Analysis of validation questions</title>
<p>Respondents were also asked three general questions about participation: ‘why did you first decide to participate?’; ‘why do you continue to participate?’; and ‘why might you stop participating?’. These were completed before the rating-scale questions to avoid responses being influenced by specific items derived from the framework.</p>
<sec id="section10-0255761411434494">
<title>Initial decisions to participate</title>
<p>Thematic analysis identified several motivations behind initial participation. One was the young musicians’ desire for ‘musical development’; to ‘step up’ as one respondent put it. The social advantages of participation, while known to potential applicants, were not cited as important reasons for initial participation. The desire for musical development occurred in the context of ‘activity awareness’: many comments relating to initial decision to participate mentioned an awareness of the ensembles’ reputations. There was high consonance between a personal ‘desire for musical development’ and the reputation of the SO/CB in providing that experience, described in terms of both the standard of repertoire performed and the quality of the other young musicians involved.</p>
<p>Reputational awareness was usually communicated verbally, via friends (‘my friends told me it was a great course’), music teachers, instrumental tutors and siblings. Decisions to apply and participate were based on information from these local sources rather than, for example, publicity material sent to schools. Direct invitations to take part, where the instrumental teacher (usually a member of the tutorial staff in SO or CB) asked the respondent to apply, were also cited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0255761411434494">
<title>Ongoing decisions to participate: ‘Why do you continue to participate?’</title>
<p>Thematic analysis suggested eight specific aspects to future decisions to participate (i.e., the decision to continue participating year-on-year):</p>
<list id="list1-0255761411434494" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A ‘social’ aspect was the most frequently mentioned, which included the opportunity to make new friends, meet existing friends, and spend time with people of similar age and interests. Respondents cited the positive, friendly qualities of other participants as a reason why they chose to participate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A second aspect influencing future participation was ‘ensemble quality’, which included the musicianship within the ensemble, the quality of the other musicians, and the contrast in quality between within-school activities and the SO/CB experience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Participation was ‘fun’. Comments of this type (and there were many) included ‘find it most enjoyable’, ‘it’s a really fun, relaxed course’, ‘the course is always good fun’ and ‘it’s a highly enjoyable course’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fourth aspect was defined as ‘staff’ and was broken down into two specific aspects:
<list id="list2-0255761411434494" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>a. Approval of the conductor: the quality of the conductor appeared to be an important reason for participation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>b. Approval of the staff: section tutors and house staff were cited as a reason for continued participation. Comments of this type included ‘the tutors and house staff are very friendly and are always great fun to chat to. You are treated as equals by the staff and they are welcome to talk’ and ‘staff are always very friendly and enthusiastic’.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fifth aspect was ‘repertoire’, reflecting comments on the enjoyment of music rehearsed and performed as a reason for continued participation. Comments that came within this aspect were concerned with an aesthetic and artistic appreciation of the repertoire, rather than its technical demands and challenges.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The sixth aspect was ‘benefits’, capturing comments that reflected perceived benefits of participation. This included:
<list id="list3-0255761411434494" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>a. Musical benefit, where participation was associated with developments in playing and understanding music;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>b. Social benefit, where participation was associated with developments in social skills.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The seventh aspect was defined as ‘belonging’ and captured comments that reflected a sense of pride in being part of the ensemble. Comments of this type included ‘I feel proud, being able to be part of it’ and ‘WSSSO made me feel a part of something’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The eighth aspect was defined as ‘environment’, and captured comments that cited the rehearsal location and organization as a reason for participation.</p></list-item>

<title>Barriers in decisions to participate</title>
<p>The major reason for discontinuation was age, as the ensembles included in this study are open only to school-age pupils. A second reason concerned the dates of rehearsal courses. Some respondents suggested that, should these prove inconvenient (for example by clashing with important events at school), they would decide not to continue. Comments included ‘I would prefer to miss as little schoolwork as possible’ and ‘I may not attend this year due to exam dates clashing with the course dates’. A third reason for discontinuation was finance, where respondents suggested that course fees might prove a barrier. For example, ‘funding is most likely the reason why I would not take part’ and ‘I wouldn’t (stop) but if I had to it would be because of the cost’.</p>
<p>In general, however, most responses to this question were along the lines of ‘I wouldn’t’, for example ‘nothing I can think of’ or ‘I have no reason to stop, it’s great’. After their initial experience of participation, it was clear that these young musicians were determined to maintain engagement until age made them ineligible.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Previous research has highlighted the music, social and personal dimensions of musical participation across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434494">Lamont, 2011</xref>.) Our research suggests that these dimensions can be usefully applied in developing an understanding of why young people choose to engage in advanced youth music ensembles. They value the opportunity to experience advanced repertoire, to work with other advanced musicians, and to experience the enjoyment and reward of rehearsal and performance. Social aspects are also important, with participation being linked strongly to making friends, socializing with existing friends, and developing strong relationships with adults such as the conductor. Positive personal outcomes are realized through increased confidence and a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Participation decisions appear highly individualistic. While significant others might influence first-time participation, their role in ongoing participation was effective only if the ensemble was found to match existing desires and an emerging sense of control as a musician. The role of parents, which has received attention in both the extracurricular and the instrumental learning literature, appeared minimal for the young musicians in this study. Equally, environmental aspects such as rehearsal location were relatively unimportant.</p>
<p>The research framework explored participants’ subjective experience of participation. Respondents agreed that the experience, context and outcomes of participation were positive. Highest agreement was elicited for statements reflecting enjoyment of performances, a sense of musical satisfaction from participation, the opportunity to meet new people, spending time with other musicians, and approval of the conductor. Lowest agreement was generated by statements reflecting contextual aspects of participation such as the importance of initial decisions to participate, of parents and school music teachers, and the extent of feedback received from schoolteachers.</p>
<p>Some interesting differences emerged between the two ensembles. CB members’ responses were generally stronger in terms of agreement than SO members. There were significant differences between the groups in the perceived impact of rehearsals on ‘how you feel about yourself?’, the importance of school music teachers in the initial decision to participate, ongoing feedback received from school teachers, non-musician friends, musician friends and the instrumental teacher, the impact of taking part on all aspects of musical ability, and the impact of participation on schoolwork. Further research is required to identify the reasons for these between-ensemble differences, which were not predicted.</p>
<p>Respondents were also asked to estimate the importance of previous experience, context and outcomes of taking part on future decisions to participate. Responses were more ambiguous than was the case with reflection on experience, context and outcomes. Strongest importance was attached to the musical satisfaction that was derived from participation, though aspects such as enjoyment of rehearsals and performances, spending time with other musicians, liking the conductor and other staff, and impact of participation on all aspects of musicianship were also important. Lowest importance was attached to extrinsic aspects such as feedback from schoolteachers and non-musician friends, and to encouragement to participate from instrumental tutors, parents and school music teachers.</p>
<p>Significant differences between SO and CB were found with regard to the impact of public performance on how participants felt about themselves, feedback received from non-musician friends, the influence of the instrumental teacher and the impact of participation on all aspects of musical ability, all of which were more important for CB than SO members. Differences were also found in relation to meeting new people and input from school music teachers, which were more important for SO than CB members. Again, more research is required to understand these differences.</p>
<p>For ensemble managers interested in generating first-time participation, positive word-of-mouth circulated by previous participants appears a highly-effective way of attracting new applicants. This of course depends on there being a pool of potential applicants whose developmental needs (in both musical and social contexts) can be addressed by the ensemble. Repeat attendance seems to depend very much on the positive experiences gained, which this research suggested had strong musical <italic>and</italic> social dimensions.</p>
<p>It is clear that these ensembles are highly significant, and important, for the young musicians who take part. This research was a first attempt to better understand adolescents’ experience of participation in advanced-level performance ensembles, and those experiential aspects that are important when making decisions to participate. There is clearly much still to be done in the interrogation of experience and in accounting for the between-ensemble differences noted earlier. Existing models of motivation and engagement, both general and music-specific, identify important internal and external aspects that encourage participation. Aspects of these models were found to be important in this research, though the social context and value of advanced music ensembles, and their contribution to adolescents’ emerging musical identity was perhaps of greater significance than might have been expected; this could be usefully explored further.</p>

<title>Ensembles de jeunes musicien avances : les expériences de et les raison d’y participer</title>
<p>L’expérience de jeunes musiciens avancés qui font partie des orchestres ou bandes en dehors du cadre de l’école n’a pas reçu beaucoup d’attention des chercheurs. Pour cette étude, 72 musiciens adolescents qui avaient été membres d’un orchestre symphonique de niveau avancé ou de Concert Band ont rempli un questionnaire en ligne qui explorait (a) l’expérience antérieure de participation et (b) l’importance de cette expérience pour prendre des décisions futures concernant la participation. Les résultats suggèrent que l’expérience précédente a été très positive. Jouissance des représentations publiques, sentiment de satisfaction musicale de participer, les possibilités de rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et passer du temps avec d’autres musiciens étaient des caractéristiques particulières de la participation. Les commentaires positifs de ses amis et les pairs ont été d’une grande importance à la phase initiale, bien que les décisions en cours tendent à être basées sur l’expérience positive des éléments musicaux et sociaux de la participation plutôt que sur les aspects contextuels tels que l’emplacement, ou l’input d’autres personnes importantes telles que professeurs d’instrument ou de ses parents.</p>

<title>Conjuntos musicales avanzados de jóvenes: experiencias y razones para participar</title>
<p>La experiencia de jóvenes músicos de nivel avanzado que participan en orquestas fuera de los centros escolares o bandas no ha sido muy estudiada por los investigadores. Para este estudio, 72 músicos adolescentes que habían sido miembros de una orquesta sinfónica de nivel avanzado o banda rellenaron una encuesta en línea que investigaba: a) experiencia previa; b) la importancia de esa experiencia previa al hacer decisiones para participaciones futuras. Los resultados sugirieron que la experiencia previa era muy positiva. En particular, el disfrute de las actuaciones ante el público, la sensación de satisfacción musical al participar, las oportunidades para conocer gente nueva y estar con otros músicos. La apoyo de amigos y colegas resultó de suma importancia en los primeros años, aunque las decisiones en curso tendían a estar basadas en la experimentación positiva de los aspectos musicales y sociales de la participación más que en aspectos contextuales como la localización o la aportación de otros actores significativos, como los docentes del instrumento o los padres.</p>
