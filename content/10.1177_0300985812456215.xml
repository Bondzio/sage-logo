            <abstract>
                <p>The wild and captive koala population of the Mt Lofty Ranges in South Australia
                    has a high level of renal dysfunction in which crystals consistent with calcium
                    oxalate have been observed in the kidneys. This study aimed to describe the
                    pathological features of the renal disease in this population, confirm the
                    composition of renal crystals as calcium oxalate, and determine whether any age
                    or sex predispositions exist for this disease. A total of 51 koalas (28
                    wild rescues, 23 captive) were examined at necropsy, of which 28
                    (55%) were found to have gross and/or histological evidence
                    of oxalate nephrosis. Histopathological features included intratubular and
                    interstitial inflammation, tubule dilation, glomerular atrophy, tubule loss, and
                    cortical fibrosis. Calcium oxalate crystals were demonstrated using a
                    combination of polarization microscopy, alizarin red S staining, infrared
                    spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis with scanning electron
                    microscopy. Uric acid and phosphate deposits were also shown to be present but
                    were associated with minimal histopathological changes. No significant
                    differences were found between the numbers of affected captive and wild rescued
                    koalas; also, there were no sex or age predispositions identified, but it was
                    found that oxalate nephrosis may affect koalas &lt;2 years of age. The
                    findings of this study suggest that oxalate nephrosis is a leading disease in
                    this koala population. Possible causes of this disease are currently under
                    investigation.</p>

    <body>
        <p>Renal disease does not appear to be a common cause of morbidity and mortality in
            populations of koalas (<italic>Phascolarctos cinereus</italic>) in the
            eastern states of Australia. Two previous studies performed in New South Wales reported
            less than 4% of koalas were found to have renal disease as the only necropsy
                    finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812456215">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812456215">4</xref></sup> In addition, the
            majority of renal disease in these eastern populations has been considered to be
            secondary to lower urinary tract infection due to chlamydophilosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812456215">15</xref></sup> with one study
            showing that 34% of cystitis cases had renal involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812456215">6</xref></sup> Hence, the
            prevalence of primary renal disease in koalas appears to be low and only a minor
            contributor to poor health in these populations.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Mt Lofty Ranges koala population in South Australia (SA)
            has been found to have a high occurrence of renal dysfunction, with an estimated
            11% of the koala population affected in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812456215">14</xref></sup> In this previous study, the koalas
            exhibited clinical signs typical of renal insufficiency such as weight loss, polydipsia,
            and polyuria that were unassociated with signs of infections, including
                    chlamydophilosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812456215">14</xref></sup> One koala in this previous study was found to have renal
            crystals that reacted positively to Pizzolato’s stain for calcium oxalate. This
            finding, taken in conjunction with accounts from wildlife staff and unpublished
            veterinary reports, was suggestive that oxalate nephrosis occurs in this population of
            koalas.</p>
        <p>Oxalate nephrosis, characterized by renal deposition of calcium oxalate, has been
            identified in a small number of koalas in several eastern states surveys.<sup>2</sup> In
            New South Wales, 1 necropsy survey of 110 koalas reported less than 3% prevalence
            of oxalate nephrosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812456215">9</xref></sup> and similarly, 2 other studies each reported a prevalence of less
            than 2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812456215">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812456215">4</xref></sup> Isolated cases of
            oxalate nephrosis in koalas have also been reported in other regions of
                    Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812456215">18</xref></sup></p>
        <p>A previous report of oxalate nephrosis in 1 koala described renal pathological changes,
            including grossly reddened cortical areas with pale corticomedullary streaks and,
            histologically, intratubular crystals with necrosis of renal tubule epithelial
                    cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812456215">5</xref></sup>
            Since the pathological features and pathogenesis of oxalate nephrosis in koalas have not
            been fully characterized, the aim of the current study was to further investigate the
            features of this disease, including gross renal pathological and histopathological
            changes, crystal composition, and age or sex predispositions in the captive and rescued
            wild koala populations of the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia.</p>

                <p>A total of 51 koalas, euthanized on welfare grounds, were examined between March
                    2008 and October 2010. These included 23 captive koalas originating from Cleland
                    Wildlife Park, SA, and 28 rescued wild koalas from the surrounding Mount Lofty
                    Ranges area. Of the 51 koalas, 21 were female and 30 were male, including 1
                    castrated male. Koalas were aged by classification of tooth wear based on
                    studies by Martin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300985812456215">20</xref></sup> and Martin and Handasyde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812456215">19</xref></sup> or from captive animal
                    management records. Of 44 koalas for which age was determined, 25
                    (57%) were of tooth wear class I (&lt;2 years
                    old approximately), 6 (14%) of class II
                    (&lt;3 years old approximately), 5 (11%)
                    of class III (&lt;4 years old approximately), 7
                    (16%) of class IV (&lt;6 years old
                    approximately), and 1 (2%) of class V
                    (&lt;12 years old approximately).</p>
                <p>The right and left kidneys were cut in half in the transverse and longitudinal
                    planes, respectively. They were scored for the amount of grossly visible crystal
                    deposition on a scale from 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate, severe).
                    Where large renal crystal deposits were present, these were harvested and dried
                    at 37°C in preparation for infrared spectroscopy analysis (see
                    below). For histopathology, both kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral
                    buffered formalin and processed by routine histological techniques. Kidney
                    halves were then embedded in large paraffin wax blocks and 7-μm sections
                    of the entire surface of each kidney cut on a rotary microtome (Leica,
                    Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Kidney tissue
                    sections were assessed blind for pathological changes and for crystal
                    birefringence using partial or full polarization microscopy with an Olympus BX51
                    microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, Pennsylvania).</p>

                <p>Alizarin red S was used to demonstrate crystals composed of calcium oxalate and
                    differentiate them from those of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate

                    tissue sections, which showed large crystal aggregates (n = 12, 1
                    wild, 11 captive) at both pH 7.0 and pH 4.2. Additional tissue sections
                    were treated with acetic acid and hydrochloric acid to assess differential
                    solubilities of crystals to further confirm crystal composition as calcium

                <p>Infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the presence of calcium oxalate in
                    renal deposits from 11 koalas (7 wild, 4 captive). For this, the
                    deposits were dried, ground, and incorporated into potassium bromide disks for
                    qualitative analysis using infrared spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300985812456215">13</xref></sup> on a Varian 800 Scimitar

                    Resolutions software. Transmittance spectra were obtained over 4000 to 600
                        cm<sup>–1</sup> and compared with reference spectra for calcium
                    oxalate and other urinary stones.</p>
                <p>For scanning electron microscopy, additional unstained kidney tissue sections
                    containing large crystal aggregates (n = 9, 1 wild, 8

                    graded series of alcohols to 100% absolute ethanol. These sections were
                    then air dried, carbon coated, and examined on a Philips XL30 field emission
                    scanning electron microscope (SEM; Philips, Amsterdam, the

                <p>Pale yellow crystal precipitation was seen at gross examination of the kidneys in

                    deposition, characterized by a very small amount of crystals just visible most
                    commonly at the papilla, was present in 9 of 24 (38%)
                    koalas and moderate crystal deposition, shown by clearly visible deposition in
                    the papillary and medullary regions, in 11 of 24 (46%).
                    Severe cases, showing streaks of heavy crystal precipitation in the papilla and
                    medulla, speckling in the cortex, and gritty yellow precipitate in the renal
                    pelvis, were seen in 4 of 24 (17%).</p>

                <p>The majority of the kidneys from these 24 koalas appeared otherwise
                    macroscopically normal, but several were pale and firm, whereas some others
                    showed a segmental pattern of pale areas extending from the corticomedullary
                    boundary to the outer cortex. One koala (case No. 10) had an
                    abnormally small left kidney with severe crystal deposition, whereas the right
                    kidney showed a moderate amount of crystals.</p>
                <p>Histological examination showed evidence of renal crystals in 28 of the 51 koalas
                    (55%), identifying 4 additional affected koalas
                    (case Nos. 9, 16, 18, and 26) and indicating that only 86%
                    of the 28 affected koalas showed grossly visible crystal deposition at necropsy.
                    Histological examination showed that in all 28 koalas, the crystals were
                    transparent yellow and usually arranged in rosettes or fan shapes with radiating
                    bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812456215">Fig.
                    2</xref>). They were birefringent under polarized light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812456215">Fig. 3</xref>), suggestive
                    of calcium oxalate. Variations in crystal morphology included wheat-sheaf or
                    bow-tie formations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812456215">Fig.
                        4</xref>) or rectangular shards. Histological evidence of
                    oxalate-like crystals included direct visualization of crystals as well as
                    observation of crystal “ghosts,” which were characterized by pale
                    eosinophilic outlines in the shape of crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812456215">Fig. 4</xref>), some of which contained
                    crystal remnants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812456215">Fig.
                        5</xref>). Crystal ghosts were observed in 93% of the 28 cases
                    altogether, with 13 cases (46%) showing crystal ghosts
                    only.</p>
                <p>Crystals were distributed throughout the renal cortical, medullary, and papillary
                    regions with particularly large aggregates of crystals and crystal ghosts within
                    collecting ducts in the papilla observed in several cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812456215">Fig. 6</xref>). Widespread
                    dilation of collecting ducts and cortical tubules was observed in 82% of
                    the 28 cases, suggestive of an obstructive process. Occasionally, large
                    aggregates of crystals were seen in the medullary interstitium where they had
                    presumably ruptured from tubules. These were associated with a granulomatous
                    inflammatory reaction consisting of lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and
                    occasional multinucleated giant cells.</p>
                <p>Crystals located within tubules were associated with a mixed inflammatory
                    reaction in 89% of the 28 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985812456215">Fig. 7</xref>), with epithelial necrosis
                    adjacent to intratubular crystals seen in 86% of cases. Interstitial
                    fibrosis and tubule loss, as well as multifocal areas of mononuclear
                    inflammation in the cortex, were common features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985812456215">Fig. 7</xref>) and present in 86%
                    and 82% of cases, respectively. In 57% of cases, radiating and
                    segmental cortical interstitial fibrosis interspersed with less affected renal
                    parenchyma was observed. Fibrosis was also prominent in the subcapsular region
                    in 18% of cases, usually associated with widespread cortical fibrosis.
                    Glomerular changes included fibrous thickening of Bowman’s capsule
                    (29%) and dilation of Bowman’s space
                    (39%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985812456215">Fig. 8</xref>), whereas 46% of
                    cases showed glomerular atrophy or loss. Histopathological examination of the
                    small abnormal kidney from koala No. 10 indicated renal dysplasia.</p>

                <p>In 16 of the 28 (57%) cases with oxalate-like crystals,
                    small basophilic deposits were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985812456215">Fig. 9</xref>). These deposits were
                    intratubular; not associated with tubule dilation, fibrosis, or inflammation;
                    and not birefringent when examined with polarization microscopy, suggestive of
                    calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate. Occasionally, basophilic deposits were
                    co-located with the oxalate-like crystals. In 3 koalas (case Nos. 6, 11,
                    and 15), particularly heavy deposition of the basophilic deposits were
                    observed in collecting ducts in the papilla, causing tubule dilation and
                    epithelial necrosis, and were probably indicative of dystrophic
                    calcification.</p>
                <p>In addition, a third deposit type was found to be co-located with clear

                    Nos. 4 and 10). This deposit was yellow-orange, amorphous, and water
                    soluble and hence was not seen in histological examination of stained tissue
                    sections. No evidence of inflammation or other pathological changes were

                    oxalate was further supported by treatment of additional kidney tissue sections
                    containing large crystal aggregates with hydrochloric acid, which resulted in
                    significant crystal dissolution, and also with acetic acid, which minimally
                    affected crystals. In 4 cases in which basophilic deposits were also present,
                    these stained positively with alizarin red S at both pH 7.0 and pH 4.2,
                    consistent with either calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate. Further testing

            <p>This study found 28 of 51 (55%) captive and rescued wild koalas
                from the Mt Lofty Ranges population in South Australia with gross and/or
                histological evidence of renal oxalate crystal deposition. Renal histopathological
                findings were similar among affected koalas and included tubular loss, cortical
                fibrosis, tubule dilation, glomerular atrophy, and crystal-associated inflammation.
                These are the hallmark renal lesions associated with oxalate nephrosis in
                        humans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812456215">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985812456215">27</xref></sup> and the findings in the current study build on those of a
                previous case study of 1 koala with oxalate nephrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812456215">5</xref></sup> An additional observation in the
                current study was a segmental cortical pattern of fibrosis similar to that described
                in humans with advanced nephrocalcinosis, thought to be the result of obstruction of
                tubules with crystals, leading to areas of cortical atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985812456215">27</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The crystals in the kidneys of affected koalas showed typical calcium oxalate
                morphology and were birefringent with polarization microscopy, a characteristic of
                calcium oxalate crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812456215">7</xref></sup> Renal crystals were analyzed using a combined approach of
                differential staining with alizarin red S, infrared spectroscopy, and EDX analysis
                with scanning electron microscopy, and all results supported a composition of
                calcium oxalate. Crystal ghosts were also a prominent histological feature and have
                been reported in other mammalian species with oxalate nephrosis, representing
                organic residues that retain the shape of the crystals lost during histological
                        processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812456215">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300985812456215">23</xref></sup> Hence, evidence obtained in this study clearly demonstrated
                that oxalate nephrosis exists in this South Australian koala population.</p>
            <p>In addition to calcium oxalate, composition analyses of the crystals also suggested
                the presence of phosphate and uric acid. The basophilic deposits observed in koala
                kidney tissue sections were morphologically consistent with calcium carbonate or
                        phosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812456215">1</xref></sup> and were shown to be calcium phosphate using alizarin red S
                staining and EDX analysis. In humans, calcium phosphate is often found in
                conjunction with calcium oxalate in the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812456215">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985812456215">22</xref></sup> and may be due to the elevated
                blood and urine phosphate levels that occur in renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300985812456215">12</xref></sup> However, in
                the current study, these crystals were also found in the kidneys of healthy koalas,
                where they were not associated with inflammation and hence may not be directly
                associated with oxalate nephrosis. In humans, basophilic calcium concretions are not
                an uncommon finding in otherwise normal kidneys and are regarded as functionally
                unimportant in most cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985812456215">27</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The uric acid results of the infrared spectroscopy analyses were more difficult to
                confirm using other methods due to its solubility in water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812456215">1</xref></sup> Although
                nitrogen was not detected by EDX in renal deposit samples, the solubility of the
                orange deposit examined on the unstained slide was consistent with uric acid. In
                addition, the absence of this material in the stained tissue sections, which undergo
                hydration during preparation, is also supportive. A previous study on urinary tract
                disease in koalas in New South Wales identified both calcium oxalate and uric acid
                in a bladder stone of a koala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812456215">4</xref></sup> Uric acid deposits may occur
                similarly as in humans, whereby decreased renal function can lead to hyperuricemia
                and hyperuricosuria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300985812456215">24</xref></sup> and dehydration may cause precipitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985812456215">27</xref></sup></p>
            <p>EDX analyses showed other elements in some samples, such as sodium, magnesium, and
                silicon, but these were invariably detected in control locations also and are thus
                likely to be components of the glass slide. This is also likely to be the case for
                aluminum, which was detected only in the readings from the small phosphate deposits
                and controls but has been implicated in koala renal disease in SA in a previous
                        study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812456215">14</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The kidneys of most koalas showed gross evidence of crystal deposition and
                demonstrated similar renal histopathological changes, and infrared spectroscopy
                showed an identical composition of all kidney precipitate samples, suggesting a
                common disease process. Although sex does not appear to be a factor and similar
                numbers of captive and rescued wild koalas were found to have the disease, it was
                evident that oxalate nephrosis occurred in many young koalas, showing that this
                disease is not limited to older animals.</p>
            <p>This study found that 55% of the total number of koalas examined had renal
                histopathological changes consistent with oxalate nephrosis, which is a similar
                prevalence to that of renal dysfunction in rescued koalas at Cleland Wildlife Park
                per annum (62%). These figures are markedly increased from the
                previous estimate of 11% for koalas affected by renal dysfunction in this
                population in 2000,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812456215">14</xref></sup> which is consistent with reports from wildlife staff that
                renal disease is being seen more frequently in this population. To confirm the
                presence of renal dysfunction in koalas with oxalate nephrosis, blood and urine
                biochemistry investigations will be undertaken.</p>
            <p>The potential causes of oxalate nephrosis in koalas may be similar to those in other
                mammalian species. Dietary intake of plants containing high levels of oxalate is a
                cause in other herbivores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985812456215">21</xref></sup> and has been previously suspected in koala cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812456215">5</xref></sup> However, the
                captive koalas in the current study had no access to known oxalate-containing
                plants, and little is known of the oxalate content of eucalypts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812456215">18</xref></sup> Calcium
                oxalate crystals may also be found within scarred renal tubules as a secondary
                        process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985812456215">21</xref></sup> but the high proportion of cases found in this population would
                suggest a common inciting cause of primary renal disease.</p>
            <p>Although studies in New South Wales koalas have shown that urogenital
                chlamydophilosis infection may cause inflammation and fibrosis of the
                        kidney,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812456215">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812456215">15</xref></sup> these previous studies reported either an absence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812456215">6</xref></sup> or a low
                        proportion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812456215">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812456215">4</xref></sup>
                of koalas with renal calcium oxalate crystals. This indicates that the prevalence of
                oxalate nephrosis remains low in areas with endemic chlamydophilosis. Another study
                using immunohistochemical techniques to demonstrate the presence of
                    <italic>Chlamydiaceae</italic> in koala kidneys could not identify chlamydial
                antigen in the single koala with intraluminal crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812456215">15</xref></sup> In addition, clinical
                urogenital chlamydophilosis in the Mt Lofty population has not been reported by
                wildlife veterinarians, and lesions consistent with chlamydophilosis were not
                observed in the current study. Despite this, positive results from serological and
                polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of SA koalas were found in a
                previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985812456215">16</xref></sup> and there is a need for further research to determine the

            <p>Another cause of oxalate nephrosis well recognized in humans is primary
                hyperoxaluria, an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of the hepatic enzymatic
                pathways involved in glyoxylate metabolism, in which excessive endogenous oxalate
                production occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985812456215">8</xref></sup> Forms of this disease have been reported in both purebred
                        dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985812456215">11</xref></sup>
                and cats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812456215">10</xref></sup> and
                should be considered in koalas due to the low genetic diversity in this
                        population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985812456215">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985812456215">26</xref></sup> On the basis of these causes of oxalate nephrosis in other
                species and previous investigations of disease in koalas, further studies to
                determine a potential cause of oxalate nephrosis in the koala population of the
                Mount Lofty Ranges, SA, are in progress.</p>
