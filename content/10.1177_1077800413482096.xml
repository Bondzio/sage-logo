<abstract>
<p>This article is based on a study of user participation and insight among 30 patients in community health centres in northern Norway. The living conditions of the patients have changed because of mental illness. Through a case study, we analyze the meaning of contexts in a meeting with Sverre, an older man, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia many years ago. One of the core features of schizophrenia is the patient’s lack of insight. Case studies have a valuable place in illness narratives, giving voice to suffering in a way different than the biomedical voice. Sverre’s narrative performance represents a different insight, which challenges the perception of everyday life in the clinic and our work with this patient group. By using a performative narrative perspective, the concept of insight emerges as a relational term and something that is developed in the dialogue, rather than through the static characteristics of the patient.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article emerges from interviews with 30 users at three different community mental health centres in northern Norway. The patients have experienced considerable changes in their lives as a result of a severe mental illness. Most of them had been acutely admitted to a psychiatric hospital several times. The interviews had three main areas: the patient’s insight into his or her own health and treatment, user participation, and the significance of the treatment location. The main aim of the study was to explore the process of insight through analyzing the personal narratives of this patient group. Insight is the core concept of user participation; in other words a crucial concept for every patient who comes into mental health care. It determines your treatment, medication, and whether you are exposed to coercion. Sverre, a man in his late 50s, was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 25 years old. A characteristic of his suffering has been a lack of insight into his condition from a clinical perspective. Normally, the interview with the patient “aims at gathering information to reach a diagnosis and establish a course of action for proper treatment. An agenda should be followed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800413482096">Ribeiro &amp; Bastos, 2005</xref>, p. 60), and it is essential to determine whether the patient has insight into her own illness.</p>
<p>Each research- interview in our study represented an interactional context for storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800413482096">De Fina, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800413482096">Mishler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800413482096">Riessman, 2008</xref>). It became obvious quite early in the interviewing process. Each new research interview represented new stories, a new storytelling. They all reflected and were shaped by, the relationship between the interlocutors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800413482096">De Fina, 2009</xref>). Though; Sverre distinguished from the others. He was the only patient who wanted to discuss what his diagnosis meant in treatment and everyday life. He gave an insight into his own health that was extremely descriptive, and brought out a deeper understanding of insight as a relational and dynamic process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800413482096">Langellier (2001</xref>, p. 176) claims that the “performance approach to narrative asserts that every performance is unique, and therefore every narrative identity is multiple, fragmentary, and unfinished.” This was prominent in the meeting with Sverre. His storytelling was discontinuous, he changed topics often, and he primarily wanted to talk about his delusions and voice-hearing. To keep the dialogue going, I had to bring myself in to the conversation, and become a part of Sverre’s investigation of his symptoms.</p>
<p>The agenda of the doctor or the clinician, in contrast to the research interview, often follows an institutional topic agenda, such as “hearing voices” and establishes a clear asymmetrical relation between the participants in the conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800413482096">Ribeiro &amp; Bastos, 2005</xref>, p. 60). Insight has many dimensions and consequences in the meeting between health professionals and patients. It serves as a barometer, a proxy through which patients measure the distance from their own identity claims and worldviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077800413482096">Razon &amp; Ross, 2012</xref>). It is also the barometer from where clinicians determine which treatment the patient will receive. How can we challenge the concept of insight from a different angle? Is it possible to address it in such a way that insight can become a relational dynamic process between patient and clinician? Can the meeting with Sverre give us a new understanding of how insight can be prepared in cooperation with patients?</p>
<p>In this article, we highlight some key points within the concept of “insight” in schizophrenia that are connected with the research interview as an interactional and local context. We explore context in relation to Sverre’s performative narrative, and expand the term <italic>context</italic> by following Sverre’s delusions and voice-hearing. We connect it to a larger social sphere and a cultural metanarrative sphere. By using these terms within context, we hope to transfer the symptoms of the illness to become a relational concept, which occurs in the interaction and dialogue. In clinical everyday life and work, health professionals have long held a more nuanced view of insight among schizophrenia patients, focusing on the patient’s coping and less on lack of insight as a cognitive shortcoming or a static characteristic of the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800413482096">Lorem, 2009</xref>). By moving the focus away from the patient’s coping and toward insight as a relational term, we encourage health professionals to open a dialogue with the contextual embedding of illness narratives. A narrative performance approach requires that the clinicians make themselves visible as partners in the narrative contract with the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800413482096">Langellier, 2001</xref>). This way of approaching the material “opens up analytic possibilities that are missed with static conceptions of identity and by essentializing theories that assume the unity of an inner self.”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800413482096">Riessman, 2003</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>A case study might give practical knowledge back to the field;
<disp-quote>
<p>“In evidence- based medicine, the case of an individual has been downgraded to the status of an “anecdote,” but in teaching the case study thrives, for it is the best way to communicate practical knowledge to trainees. It is through detailed examples that clinicians come to understand what is involved in illness and treatment.”</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800413482096">Riessman, 2003</xref>, p. 6).</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>First, the story of Sverre is defined as a personal performative narrative, where performance is a key point for understanding his storytelling. Before presenting the contextual frame, we focus on the dominant narrative of insight. Next, we analyze Sverre’s storytelling in three different contextual spheres. Then, we relate these spheres to the concept of insight as a relational term. Finally, we conclude with proposals for improved clinical practice, focusing on a more democratic psychiatry, and relational dialogues with a stigmatized patient group.</p>

<sec id="section2-1077800413482096">
<title>The Personal Performative Narrative</title>
<p>“The impulse toward narrative is a fundamentally human one” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800413482096">Miller &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>, p. 169). Life stories are socially situated actions and are identity-giving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800413482096">Karlsson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800413482096">Mishler, 1999</xref>). They are created and received in a context. In fact, performing personal narrative is radically contextualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800413482096">Langellier &amp; Peterson, 2006</xref>, p. 152);
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . embodied in participants who tell personal stories of experience, situated in the interactional and material constraints of the performance event, and embedded within discursive forces that shape experience, narrative and, selves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Personal narrative is performed everywhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800413482096">Langellier &amp; Peterson, 2006</xref>), and “. . . people’s storytelling and stories about their experiences and expectations can contribute to knowledge about people, culture, and society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800413482096">Karlsson, 2006</xref>, p. 57). “Performing personal narrative reclaims and proclaims both body and voice: the personal gives body to narrative, and narrative give voice to experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800413482096">Langellier, 1998</xref>, p. 207). We focus on the narrative as a personal performative event, and the interview with Sverre serves as a contextual frame. This approach refers to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800413482096">Georgakopoulou (2006</xref>, p. 123) calls “the second wave of narrative analysis” that has “moved from the study of narrative as text (first wave) to the study of narrative-in-context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800413482096">Phoenix, 2008</xref>, p. 64).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p> . . . the focus shift even more to narrative in the context of its telling, to the fact that stories are collective or collaborative productions that not only take place under particular social conditions, but are social actions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800413482096">Brockmeier &amp; Carbaugh, 2001</xref>, p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When we enter the personal performance narrative we “interpret its symbolic universe to discover the complexity of its extraordinary meanings and practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800413482096">Madison &amp; Hamera, 2006</xref>, p. 7). Sverre’s experience of illness has a knowledge value related to the topic of insight. In general, insight is difficult to ask people about. <italic>If I went to my doctor tomorrow, and she asked me whether I had insight in my own health, I would not know what to answer.</italic> Studying the aspect of insight demands an approach other than direct questions about insight. “The participants in any conversation, including interviews, have to establish their right to speak on the topics being discussed.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800413482096">Phoenix, 2008</xref>, p. 70). We had to agree as to what we were talking about and establish the dialogue. The interview is a complex, dialogical process where the interlocutors have to negotiate the topics on which the conversation should focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800413482096">Mishler, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800413482096">1999</xref>). I started all of the interviews with the open question “Can you tell me what brought you to psychiatric services?” The open question was designed to elicit a narrative account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077800413482096">Thornhill, Clare, &amp; May, 2004</xref>). Sverre told me that his girlfriend died when he was 25 years old. He had been mentally ill since then. This focused attention on how Sverre built his narrative and the performative work from which he wanted the dialogue to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800413482096">Phoenix, 2008</xref>). The story of Sverre is created with the help of the interview, and it is therefore regarded as a social structure characterized by the special relationship that involves just that: an interview situation. At the same time, it is characterized by the story of his experience and his understanding of experiences, actions, situation-bound elements, and cultural thought forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800413482096">Perez Prieto, 2006</xref>). The conversational dialogue stresses the performative nature of interviews. The narrative is seen as “practice within a social interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800413482096">De Fina &amp; Georgakopoulou, 2008</xref>, p. 275). The performance, in turn, “situates narrative as both a making and a doing.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077800413482096">Peterson &amp; Langellier, 2006</xref>, p. 179). Sverre’s wondering about schizophrenia and what this disorder really is emerges as the conversation progresses. Through the description of the visual pictures he has in his mind and the voices he hears, we can discuss insight from his perspective. It is an ongoing process: “. . . [Stories] are performative, destabilized, and deferred, rather than an inherent, unified property of the individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077800413482096">Smith &amp; Sparkes, 2008</xref>, p. 24). To approach the narrative as a performance requires a theory that takes the context as seriously as the text itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800413482096">Langellier, 1999</xref>). By doing so, we can see Sverre’s performance also as political; it does something:</p>
<p>“. . . in doing something in and with discourse that is neither uniform nor stable, performing may reinscribe or resist the bodily practices and material conditions in which they are embedded. Performing personal narrative can work to both legitimate and critique relations of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800413482096">Langellier &amp; Peterson, 2006</xref>, p. 164).</p>
<p>In the interview with Sverre, the personal performative narrative elaborates a focus of concern: the clinical approach to lack of insight as a core feature of schizophrenia seems obvious. Within a community mental health context, Sverre’s delusions are often viewed as “delusional ideas that are attributable to the illness, serving simply as one of its more characteristic symptoms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>, p. 88). However, his storytelling and stories are multilayered and filled with mental leaps and associations. Sverre’s narrative performance is complex and opens a richness of approaches, theoretical understandings, and unexpected findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800413482096">Andrews, Squire, &amp; Tamboukou, 2008</xref>). Though; by discussing his diagnosis, Sverre brings a question mark on today’s psychiatric practice around schizophrenia patients and insight.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077800413482096">
<title>The Dominant Narrative of Insight</title>
<p>“Schizophrenia is the medical term used in the field of psychiatry that most closely captures phenomena that otherwise would be described by the lay public as insanity or madness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>, p. 89). The dominant story of insight among schizophrenic patients has recently developed. The most common definition of insight involves three aspects: you are consciously aware of your own suffering, you are able to redefine the symptoms to be part of the disorder, and you recognize the need for treatment. These three aspects may vary and will be present in varying degrees. Once treated as a one-dimensional, categorical concept, insight is now considered “a complex and multidimensional phenomenon.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800413482096">Amador &amp; Strauss, 1993</xref>, p. 306). “Lack of insight is understood both as explanatory and descriptive of psychosis. The former perspective causally connects psychosis to the patient’s lack of contact with objective reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800413482096">Lorem, 2009</xref>). The latter perspective perceives lack of insight as a result of an underlying condition or disturbance, such as a neurological or psychological dysfunction, and cannot be seen as anything but a symptom of an underlying disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800413482096">Kringlen, 1982</xref>). “Regardless of how the concept is defined, the impact of insight into illness and life situations is widely discussed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800413482096">Lorem, 2009</xref>). The lack of understanding as an inherent aspect of psychotic disorders is commonly known, and it is the core feature of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>). If we accept these assumptions,
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . people are doomed to confirm their diagnosis regardless of how they react to the information they are given. If they accept the diagnosis, for instance, this constitutes their agreement, despite the fact that if they really do have the illness they are not supposed to be capable of having such awareness. Agreement also renders all of their other beliefs, ideas and decisions suspect at best, as we still view schizophrenia as impairing their cognitive abilities and judgement. If, on the other hand, they deny the diagnosis, or refuse to accept it, this act can be used as evidence that the person lacks insight and therefore must have a mental illness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>, p. 91, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Kravetz, 2003</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Biomedical interventions are considered essential to create knowledge, which is necessary to maintain consent for treatment, willingness to enable the individual to reestablish control over the symptoms, and improve quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077800413482096">MacNaughton, 2008</xref>). Insight into one’s own health and treatment is therefore connected with dealing with the illness and healing. In modern psychiatry based on outpatient care, “insight is necessary for compliance with treatment and prevention of relapse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800413482096">Flyckt, Taube, Edman, Jedenius, &amp; Bjerkenstedt, 1999</xref>, p. 377). As a result, the person with schizophrenia “is viewed as lacking the essential prerequisites for being a narrator of her own experience: awareness and insight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>, p. 86).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . insight is often judged in relation to the beliefs of clinical experts, and less attention has been paid to how people with schizophrenia make sense of their own experience of the illness in terms of the insight formation. The main criticism of this approach has been that it fails to account for patients’ perception of the illness, which is implicitly embedded within a personal narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800413482096">Ko, Yeh, Hsu, Chung, &amp; Yen, 2006</xref>, p. 124).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If Sverre is offering us an alternative narrative to the biomedical one, the common response would be to look at it as denial, lack of insight, transference, or evidence in direct contradiction to the narrator’s claim of validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800413482096">Estroff, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800413482096">Roe and Davidson (2006)</xref>, this perspective results in an overly narrow view of awareness because the position reflects the fact that objective/descriptive psychiatry has tended to equate insight with the person’s ability to articulate the perspective of the clinician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800413482096">Greenfeld, Strauss, Bowers, &amp; Mandelkern, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>“In a dialectical relationship with narrative are incoherence and silence. If we run into problems with our personal or professional narratives, if they stop making sense to us or to others, we find that a taken-for-granted coherence has been lost” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077800413482096">Thornhill et al., 2004</xref>, p. 182).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800413482096">Geekie (2004</xref>, p. 148) underlines the almost total absence of the voices of those who have the most direct experience of schizophrenia—the person diagnosed as “schizophrenic”—in literature and research. These voices, both in professional literature and in clinical settings, have been marginalized, according to Geekie, and “this has been to the detriment of clients’ interests and clinical practice as well as research efforts directed at investigating the nature of the experience.” One consequence of this marginalization has been “the paucity of terms available to us to refer to the multitude of ways in which people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia relate to their experience.” Insight is often the first term that comes to mind in this regard, and “it usually refers to whether the client agrees with the clinician’s position” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800413482096">Geekie, 2004</xref>, p. 149).</p>
<p>Sverre was young the first time he was hospitalized. Insight was defined differently then. Maybe Sverre had an understanding the doctor did not catch up? As a result of this we can ask; is the theme insight discussed with Sverre for each new admission? If insight is a dynamic process that requires that clinicians continuously listen to Sverre in his everyday life, it should be discussed and highlighted on a regular basis. For Sverre as a patient, insight is a concept of great importance. It is crucial for his treatment, therapy, and medication.</p>

<title>A Contextual Frame</title>
<p>Between the individual, the narrator, and the context are the places of identity construction, the narrative context, and the storytelling context. In the text, <italic>Historien om räven och andra berättelser</italic> [The story about the fox and other stories], Perez Prieto uses the anthropologist Bruner’s distinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800413482096">Bruner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800413482096">Perez Prieto, 2006</xref>). These can be fruitful in the interview situation; distinctions between the lived life (what happened to Sverre when the suffering became part of him), the perceived life (how Sverre is experiencing the disorder), and life as it is told (how Sverre talks about suffering). This serves as the basis of the narrative, so to speak. The context enters the story in a complex choreography and moves on several levels. The context is placed in the space between narrator and listener, between telling and setting, between reader and text, and between history and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800413482096">Riessman, 2008</xref>). When we look at the conversation with Sverre from a performative perspective, it is emphasized that the story is created in the moment and that it occurs in a vital and vibrant setting. The narrative activities that occur within the interview situation also articulate aspects of the wider social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800413482096">De Fina, 2008</xref>). Reading for context is not a simple task, as there seems to be no limit to relevant contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber, Tuval-Mashiach, &amp; Lieblich, 2008</xref>). The zoom model has been developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800413482096">Pamphilion (1999)</xref> to analyze the multiple levels of meaning found in a story. The metaphor derives from the field of photography and allows us to focus on particular levels of interest and to “freeze frame” that level for indepth analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800413482096">Pamphilion, 1999</xref>). The micro-zoom focuses on the oral dimension of the life story, and the meso-zoom turns the focus to the individual’s process of storytelling. At this level, we would search for themes that have been constructed by Sverre to create coherence in his life story. We would also look for what the narrative is missing. “The macro-zoom level focuses on the sociocultural collective dimensions of the story” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800413482096">Pamphilion, 1999</xref>, p. 395). The fourth level is called the interactional-zoom, and it is the place where the researcher zooms onto herself and the research as a whole. The zoom model can be seen as a precursor to another context theory within performance narrative studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber et al. (2008)</xref> introduces three spheres of context that are relevant: intersubjective relations, the social field, and cultural metanarratives. In the following analysis, we will use these different spheres when we enter the interview situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077800413482096">
<title>Intersubjective Relations</title>
<p>The immediate relationship and interaction that occurs in the interview represents a context-sphere in which the identity is linked to the story at the moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber et al., 2008</xref>). In conversations with Sverre, he entered into an agreement in advance that dealt with the content of the interview. He had been presented by a contact person at the community mental health centre and would like to speak to “this researcher from Tromsø.” We met early on a Tuesday morning for the interview, and for Sverre, the day had started many hours prior to our meeting. He had woken up at 5 o’clock in the morning, ready to be interviewed and eager and anxious to see if he would answer “right.” He took a chair and sat close to me. Several times during the interview, he leaned forward and looked at the tape recorder on the table and wondered if what he said was in that box. There was a contact person, Turid, present during the interview, and she sat on a sofa opposite us. Sverre approached her once during the interview; otherwise, he looked at the floor and continued talking. When I asked him whether he has planned admissions, he tells me about the lady in the coffin:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>Is it like. . . do you have regular admissions, or. . . ?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>Yes. I have been given that. Yes.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>Can you tell me about it?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>No, it has, you know. . . I was. It was the schizophrenia and then it was like it was getting worse, it got worse and worse. The nurses think it dissolves, but it does not do that. It is like this; the voices want me to dissolve. . . so that I miss the psychologist. . . so they started to make a headache, because there was a direct contact between me and the dead person. So they wanted a headache, and then I made it. . . so I can’t sit at home, all the time with a headache, maybe the voice will be nice, when it sees that I am getting treatment. Like “this and that,” like thinking. . . then there was a lady who came in the air once, in a coffin, behind me and Turid (laughing).</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>. . . and she went into my stomach. A dead cadaver. A dead lady. Her daughter was beside the coffin, when I asked why she was coming along, “no,” she was about to fix her daughter a boyfriend. Why she came into my body, that riddle I don’t understand, I mean; it’s the worst schizophrenia I have experienced, at least.</p>
</speech>
<p>On the intersubjective level, or the micro-zoom level, I noticed that Sverre knew that he was going to be interviewed as part of a study. He was not sure what we were going to talk about before we started, and I told him that we could talk about his life experiences. Before I had turned on the tape recorder, he started telling me why he got sick. This can be seen as a lead for interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber et al., 2008</xref>). From the passage above, we can see how Sverre interprets the narrative; the lady in the coffin can be understood as his dead girlfriend and the expression of his loss. Knowing the context of the interview, Sverre wanted to talk about his delusions and voice-hearing connected to dead people. His voice was low, and he continued to say, as a comment on his own narrative “yes,” “yes yes yes” as if he wanted to ensure himself and the interlocutors that he had said what he just had said. During the interview, he mentions the lady several times and, in one case, he tells me how all these dead people are following him, in mirrors and inside his body, hunting him. Several times, he stopped in his narrative, and asked me questions such as where my parents came from and how old I was. I answered his questions, and then he continued with his narrative. At the meso-level, Sverre’s narrative is intense, and it demands the interlocutors to follow his associations. His storytelling is indeed visual, and also painful. It is difficult to grasp the coherence at some points, but it may not be relevant in the “here and now.” Sverre is filling his storytelling with an alternative coherence. If we should focus on what is missing in the story, some would argue the only things missing are coherence and insight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077800413482096">
<title>The Social Field</title>
<p>The social field is related to the sociohistorical context in which life is lived. When narrating their lives, people situate their stories within certain social structures and historical events. “Their choice of a relevant social field is meaningful and may be interpreted to indicate what they see as relevant or important for their identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber et al., 2008</xref>, p. 1053). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800413482096">Pamphilion (1999)</xref>, the macro-zoom might include both the social field and the cultural metanarratives. Let us first focus on the social field. Sverre’s narrative is characterized by many associations and is not linear in shape. When Sverre talks about his suffering in a larger context, he mentions the mental health system and the clinicians around him at the place where he is receiving treatment or he talks about the Norwegian Princess Märtha Louise.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>But it must be nice to have someone to talk with?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, I have to say it like that, it’s no good to sit alone at home all the time with the schizophrenia, then you start talking with yourself. One is constantly awakened, and it’s like. . . like that, so like that. What is schizophrenia, anyway? Is it a hole in the head? Or is it me that, or is it the thoughts that. . . for instance, if Märtha Louise is on the television, then it’s just like she knows me, and I get these voices from her too, from the television as well, and I can talk with the pictures, and. . . they answer too.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>Hm. But I think that. . .</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>So strange that schizophrenia. You see these dead pictures in the hallway, then they start talking to me. Old people that are dead. But it isn’t. . . thus, from my side they are talking. Just like they are starting to talk like I want them to, you know. Talking like that, nothing from their side. Just half agree, talking like that.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>But I think you said something very wise just a minute ago, you said that schizophrenia is probably different for everyone?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>And I think you’re right. The fact that we all experience it very differently. So I do not think it’s so easy to say “that’s it” and “it is not so.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>No, of course, I have gone my schools, you know, and all that, so I really don’t know what’s wrong with these voices, it’s a sort of ascendancy in my young men voices, ascendancy over me.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>Hm.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I don’t know, that’s the big question, yes.</p>
</speech>
<p>When Sverre pulls the Princess in to the conversation, it might represent someone with whom he can identify. The Norwegian Princess has been much discussed in the media in recent years for her alternative beliefs and the exercise of her role as a royal. She claims to be able to talk with animals and angels, and this is probably something that Sverre has experienced himself. It is not to say that Princess Martha Louise has a mental illness, but she speaks a language that Sverre can identify with and understand. “The social field context relates to the personal depiction of the public time and space in which the identity unfolded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber et al., 2008</xref>, p. 1063). Sverre wishes here to discuss what his condition actually is: “is it a hole in the head?” He is clearly aware that the voices come from within him, but he would like to know why that is the case and what the researcher thinks about it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077800413482096">
<title>Cultural Metanarratives</title>
<p>Dominant narratives “reflect cultural themes and beliefs that provide a local story with coherence and legitimacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077800413482096">Zilber et al., 2008</xref>, p. 1054). In the dominant story of schizophrenia, we see that there are a number of medical signs of suffering in its expression. Unfortunately, there are areas of the psychiatric field where a pessimistic view of prognosis in schizophrenia once existed. There are indications that bad treatment outcomes are caused by an incomplete understanding of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800413482096">Granhus, 2010</xref>). Sverre has probably, during his many years in treatment, been subjected to several surveys of the disorder. When I ask him how it was when he first came in contact with psychiatric services, whether he was relieved or desperate, he replies:</p>
<p><italic>Sverre</italic>: It was not like that. Lost my friends (coughs), the psychiatry, I approved it, afterwards MUST, I thought like “it’s my mother who has decided this,” I thought. I had asked them several times whether it was my mother, but they. . . .no, I believe it was my mother, she knew it straight away. So I did. Yes, I thought when I am such a quiet and calm guy, maybe I’m just thinking too much, you know (laughs). I had a lot of responsibility when I was working as well. A lot.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>Hm. Yes.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>But it is probably just to use the mind, what to do the day after and things like that. No. . . and then there are meetings and all that. Meetings when you come in, and then nothing more, then you have a supporter and then there was a trip to town, from the psychiatric hospital, to take a look at clothes and stuff. . . but it’s like. . . I don’t really know what the psychiatry is, I don’t know that.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rita:</speaker>
<p>No.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sverre:</speaker>
<p>That’s why I say it like that (laughs).</p></speech>
<p>Sverre lives within a meaning system that characterizes his suffering in a way that confirms his lack of insight. The dominant culture in psychiatry does not recognize his alternative language when he discusses his own health, and Sverre answers to this by denying knowledge of the system. He does not know the identity of this system; he says. Psychiatry. Sverre does not know how “to read” the system or how it can help him.</p>
<p>“The shift from holding up a dominant worldview to which we expect all perspectives to correspond, to acknowledging the coexistence of multiple, diverse views may be necessary precondition for encouraging people with schizophrenia to compose and share their narratives, and for these narratives to be respected, not only as valid and useful tools for research, but as a foundation for recovery as well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>, p. 91).</p>
<p>Within the clinical context that Sverre is in, his stories primarily characterize an expression of the symptoms of his disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>). In a study of the explanatory models of people who experience psychosis, two main findings were reported. The first finding was that the opportunity to talk in depth about what illness experiences mean to people was important. The second finding was that there are many ways in which clients understand their psychotic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800413482096">Geekie, 2004</xref>, p. 151). By taking part in Sverre’s personal performative narrative attempts to find his own experience, one can see the concept of insight in a more relational sense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077800413482096">
<title>Insight as a Relational Term</title>
<p>In the meeting with Sverre, we argue that insight is a relational concept, which he with his own language, his delusions and voice-hearing, share with us and we perform together. From a narrative perspective, the delusions and voice-hearing represent Sverre’s active attempt to make sense of his experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>). He wishes to discuss the condition and treatment. Through the dialogue, the interlocutors create a space where insight can be understood through the user’s own language. Insight is considered a verb, not a noun. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800413482096">Denzin (2003</xref>, p. 16) “the performative turn looks toward an interactionist epistemology, one where context replaces text, verbs replace nouns, structure become processes.” When we attend to the telling of the narrative, it allows both “a focus on episodes or event stories. . . and aspects of narrative identities that are diachronic in that they present different time frames. . . by attending to what is presented in the interview situation and what is being claimed on the basis of experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800413482096">Battersby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800413482096">Järvinen, 2004</xref>). Diagnostic concepts of the disorder were not an issue in this conversation, and Sverre could, through his own experiences, provide a common understanding of his health.</p>
<p>According to Pamphilion’s interactional-zoom, “a life history is the result of the relationship between a particular person and a particular researcher” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800413482096">Pamphilion, 1999</xref>, p. 396). Applying this concept to the coherence of Sverre’s story, it is required that I, as a researcher, accept his experience of suffering. “. . . the researcher’s interpretative role is an active one at every point as she or he chooses what to elicit, highlight, and make visible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800413482096">Pamphilion, 1999</xref>, p. 396). Within the clinical context, this means that the clinician chooses which subjects to work on in the dialogue with the patient based on what is necessary for mutual understanding. The view of context not as a static surrounding frame but as a set of multiple and intersecting processes that are mutually feeding each other with dialogue is now a consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800413482096">De Fina &amp; Georgakopoulou, 2008</xref>). We can look at insight in the same way, as a multiple and intersecting process that is created between the clinician and the patient. Sverre must have become a participant in, and not a spectator of, his own treatment. By taking hold of the users’ own language related to expressions of suffering and experience, one can approach the understanding in relational terms. Insight will be something that occurs in the conversation and is then considered as something to be practiced together. Patients should increase the chance to formulate their problems with their own concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077800413482096">Terkelsen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking at the three sections from Sverre’s story, we observe the following. In the story about the lady in the coffin, he shows that he is clearly aware of his own suffering. He is familiar with the diagnosis and expresses it through delusions about the woman in the coffin. In the second section, Sverre is able to redefine his symptoms to be part of the disorder: “But it isn’t . . . thus, from my side they are talking. Just like they are starting to talk like I want them to, you know. Talking like that, nothing from their side. Just half agree, talking like that.” Sverre knows that his voice comes from within and does not represent an external reality. He knows that he is hallucinating and that it is part of his illness. In the last section, about how he experienced the first contact with psychiatric services, Sverre said that he accepted the psychiatric services at once. He says: “So I did. Yes, I thought when I am such a quiet and calm guy, maybe I’m just thinking too much, you know (laughs).” He has agreed to treatment. These three sections show us that Sverre meets the dominant narrative definition of the criteria that must be present to say that schizophrenia patients have insight. However, Sverre displays these criteria in a relational context in which he knows that he will not have to respond to clinical tests or questionnaires. Insight is not considered a static unit of knowledge or a story related to the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800413482096">Lysaker, Clements, Plascak-Hallberg, Knipscheer, &amp; Wright, 2002</xref>); rather, it is rooted in relationships and dialogue with other people. Through the conversation progress, Sverre uses his own language and his own terms to describe the experience of suffering. Psychotherapy has long sought to increase the narrative context in work with schizophrenics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800413482096">Haugsgjerd, 1994</xref>), but if you extend this to include treatment on a larger scale, it could change the life of this user group. Treatment for this group of people is today largely dominated by biological and psychosocial models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800413482096">Granhus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>) and has less focus on the stories of the individual in treatment. If a user presents an alternative narrative to the biomedical, it is usually interpreted as having a lack of insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800413482096">Roe &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>). Research shows that a dialogue-based approach to people who are in a psychotic state can lead to improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077800413482096">Terkelsen, 2010</xref>). “It is only in the uniqueness of the history of each individual, and in the meanings that each person assigns to that history and to their “symptoms” that any true cause can be discovered” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077800413482096">Silver, Koehler, &amp; Karon, 2004</xref>, p. 209). According to Leader, the treatment of psychosis should be situated outside the traditional parameters of “mental health,” which relies on the idea that the clinician knows in advance what is best for the subject. “An openness to real dialogue is crucial here, and the therapist must avoid any attempt to show the subject that they are thinking “incorrectly” or failing to conform to a right way of perceiving the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800413482096">Leader, 2011</xref>, p. 298).</p>
<p>More therapy traditions that have a place for storytelling should be considered. A democratic psychiatry requires patients and practitioners “willing to act in situations where outcome cannot be predicted an advance. In such situations a politics of new possibilities can be imagined and made to happen” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800413482096">Denzin, 2006</xref>, p. 335). Sverre’s story shows that it is possible to gain insight from a perspective different from everyday clinical work. The three spheres of context show that the interview is a dialogue where insight could be acted out.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The first contribution of this article to the field is to provide a forum for the narrative performance of a man diagnosed with schizophrenia and his experiences from within the community health services in northern Norway. Narrative, according to Lorem, has two assumptions. One is that we can put ourselves in the story’s location, whereas the second implies that the meaning is established in human interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800413482096">Lorem, 2006</xref>, p. 172). To be able to interact and communicate, says Lorem, we rely on a common language that already exists in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800413482096">Lorem, 2006</xref>). However, being positioned to interpret a story does not mean that we understand it:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . a personal narrative is not an exact record of what happened, and nor does it mirror the wider world. It is always tentative and cannot provide certainties because of its multilayered meanings. . . .Each person brings to the narrative a different interpretation. The narrative re- presents experience rather than providing the reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800413482096">Bold, 2012</xref>, p. 30).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By acknowledging Sverre as the expert on his own experiences, we hope to bring some important implications for research and clinical practice to the field. Acknowledging mentally ill patients as experts need not be viewed as undermining the expertise that clinicians and researchers bring to the subject. Rather, “recognizing that there are multiple perspectives. . . on schizophrenia may enhance the quality and usefulness of the debate, illuminate the nature of their experiences and lead to improved clinical services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800413482096">Geekie, 2004</xref>, p. 159).</p>
<p>The second aspect of the article was the reading of the narrative in a contextual frame, where the relational term of insight could be given a place. Narration requires relationships and being engaged in the other’s expression. By presenting sections from Sverre’s story, we mean to emphasize the need for a more relational understanding of the term “insight,” where the dialogue becomes central to the understanding of the user’s perception of themselves and his or her life situation. Through delusions and voice-hearing, Sverre described how he experienced the disease. Narrative is “a unique form-finding and meaning-making activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800413482096">De Fina &amp; Georgakopoulou, 2012</xref>, p. 21). The lady in the coffin represents a picture of how Sverre experiences his daily life and tells us that the lady is dwelling in him. He needs to grasp the experience. He needs to tell. Narrative performance is not a disembodied invention waiting to be found by any knowledgeable observer and analyzed within a neutral or stable context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800413482096">Langellier &amp; Peterson, 2004</xref>, p. 30). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800413482096">De Fina and Georgakopoulou (2012</xref>, p. 61), you can state the performance act in storytelling as critically important, here in the discussion about clinical practice and insight as a term:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the notion of performance becomes more closely associated with the idea of contextualization as a process that allows for a more dynamic view of the relations between narrators, events, speech communities, and cultural contexts. In this respect, context is not a list of situational and cultural elements that determines the structure and shape of narrative, but an orchestration of those elements that come alive in specific communicative situations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sverre’s performative narrative calls for a praxis-based ethics within community health centres. A commitment to a more democratic psychiatry can be an empowering, dialogical experience for both patients and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800413482096">Denzin, 2006</xref>).</p>
