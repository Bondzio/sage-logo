<p>This essay examines the socio-political and spiritual importance of the Book of Lamentations and lament expressions in Hebraic and early Christian liturgies and public settings, especially with regard to women’s lyrical expressions and to Syrian traditions until late antiquity. Further, this study addresses the current crisis in Syria, locating Syrian women’s and men’s laments today, including those from Muslim background. These laments show both continuity with ancient lament traditions and creative lyrical innovations that speak to the Syrian people’s urgent, devastating situation and their united need for help and justice.</p>

<p>We fled in the rain.</p>
<p>We got stopped and searched constantly;</p>
<p>they would ask us, “Who are you and where are you going?”</p>
<p>We’d say, “We are fleeing from oppression and injustice.</p>

<p>The ancient biblical lamentation above expresses one person’s lyric of the anguish of a devastated people, victims both of their own failed leaders and of misplaced trust in other nations and political alliances that brought suffering. While the Book of Lamentations includes critique of its own people, it also includes dissident voices, one a woman’s, protesting the wrongs that have brought wholesale suffering to innocent people, especially children.</p>
<p>The second quotation above is from a woman in Homs, Syria today; hers is a voice of the people, and could easily be from any religious group, as all are suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020964312473249">3</xref></sup> Farther down the road in the capital, Rima Dali was raising her own lament. Just one of thousands of Syrian women peacefully protesting along with men over the last 18 months, she stood in an intersection in front of the Syrian parliament in Damascus and held up a banner that said: “Stop the killing; we want to build a Syria for all people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020964312473249">4</xref></sup> She was arrested. More than a year before this, thousands of women and children successfully marched, demanding the release of 100 political prisoners (husbands and fathers).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020964312473249">5</xref></sup> A month prior, on March 25, 2011, children and youth in Daraa raised a rallying cry of lament, in what has become a national moment of truth, protesting abuses of the regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0020964312473249">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Less often quoted are the laments of people around the world critiquing the hypocrisy of nations and their leaders and their business people (including the United States and the West) that have been in business alliance with dictators or oppressive regimes for years, as if uprisings now should come as any surprise to them. The laments of children, women, and men have been silenced in every corner of the earth under such regimes who face abuse, maiming, torture, and lasting trauma. And yet a report on the crisis in Syria in July of 2012 announced 1,400 children killed since the uprising began<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0020964312473249">7</xref></sup> and the toll is higher now. By November, 2012, about 40,000 civilians had been killed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0020964312473249">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This essay will draw together several threads of traditions of lament and Lamentations from the Bible, from early Jewish liturgy, from early Christian liturgical practices in Syria, as well as Muslims’ and others’ laments from the current crisis in Syria, to illuminate two key points. First, in spite of ambiguous rejection and reception of women’s lament voices within androcentric religious and cultural traditions, the documented <italic>importance of women’s laments</italic> remains. Second, lament is not only the expression of grieving over death or processing loss and trauma (both for individuals and communities, such as cities), as important as these are; it also often serves a <italic>socio-political purpose</italic> and engages either in a polemic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0020964312473249">9</xref></sup> against abusive power that promotes hate, exclusion, revenge, and violence against the “Other” or in a polemic for compassion, justice, limiting violence, and the common good of all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0020964312473249">10</xref></sup> The reflections here will illuminate examples of women’s lament voices, and the irrepressible “living” lamenting, which like a rushing stream finds its way to the sea of peoples struggling in socio-political upheavals.</p>

<title>Preliminary Thoughts: Lament, Theology, and Politics</title>
<p>Is not the greatest lament, in light of yet another human disaster, that “the world” has proven itself time and again mostly incapable of preventing or stopping such evil? People are often presented with political systems led either by secular regimes that abuse power with patronage, coercion, or violence, or by religious regimes that abuse power with patronage, coercion, or violence—each claiming to defend “their” people against the dangerous alternative. In the hope of transcending such irresponsibility, H. Richard Niebuhr called for a shared <italic>theological vision</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0020964312473249">11</xref></sup> <italic>that issues from the One who is beyond all our lesser, though valued, human loyalties of politics, religion, culture, and nation.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0020964312473249">12</xref></sup> Yet, so many people live in the middle between these two extremes. They live and love side by side with neighbors who hold ethical values shaped by different religious traditions. They have little means to hold off the violence and to rescue the desperate suffering ones, and they lack solutions. All too often, this potentially “prophetic middle” stands helpless. Reinhold Niebuhr did not give in to futility in such circumstances. He insisted instead that the only truly effective action against such injustice is a loving counter, nonviolent, <italic>force</italic>, which strives to re-balance the powers to effect more justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0020964312473249">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is no accident that historic people’s movements, and nonviolent ones, have been fueled by lyrical refrains, unsanctioned voices (women’s and men’s), unsilenceable laments speaking truth to power, thus finding empowerment, and re-taking power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0020964312473249">14</xref></sup> The human song truly and mysteriously moves freely—rising from, yet transcending every culture and religion and gender—as does God, as does the human aspiration for dignity, justice, and peace.</p>
<p>Yet, a counter-force of justice to <italic>prevent</italic> abuse of power is so often lacking because we compromise and accept injustice, especially when we (as individuals, as a community, a religion, or as a nation) benefit from the status quo, or fear the risks of change. We wring our hands about our reputations, or whether to employ sanctions or divestiture against a regime, and yet the people suffering in different nations often say that the associated pain caused to them is little compared to the devastation they are already experiencing, and these sanctions do help over time in pressuring unjust regimes to change.</p>
<p>Consider that . . .</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If the prophets of the God of Abraham and Sarah . . .</p>
<p> if Jesus Christ . . .</p>
<p>  if Muhammed . . .</p>
<p>all spoke out for justice and took action,</p>
<p>with compassion, on behalf of those oppressed</p>
<p>and suffering in their situations,</p>
<p>if they all critiqued the idolatry of political alliances,</p>
<p>all preferred peace to violence,</p>
<p>and were then persecuted to the point of death</p>
<p><italic>because</italic> of the sins of those in cultures then,</p>
<p> who in truth defied God, abused power,</p>
<p>and mistreated human beings—</p>
<p>then <italic>who are</italic> each of us Jews now?</p>
<p>    Christians now?</p>
<p>     Muslims now?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0020964312473249">15</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Syrian woman activist recently said, and it appears many Syrians agree, the people do not want outside nations’ military intervention; they simply want concerned individuals’ support of their cause. Such solidarity means raising laments, laments that ask questions of international business leaders (call them neo-liberal or neo-conservative), and of ourselves. <italic>How</italic> many more utensils and goods and “good will” will one purchase from a nation that (again) keeps blocking the “united nations” of the world from trying to act ethically in concert against an oppressive regime? <italic>How long</italic> will our nations and companies continue honoring military and oil deals with the Syrian regime because they made them (“in good faith”) before the massacres of innocents started happening? <italic>How long</italic> will bloody money and power politics be more important than human blood? <italic>What</italic> is the proud cost to bear for doing what is right, in everyone’s sight, even in an election year? <italic>How long</italic> will the bad blood of history and politics stand like a wall in the way of dying “foreign” refugee children who need to cross particular borders to find a safe haven?</p>
<p>And yet, people do not become counter-forces for justice and good until moved in compassion and love for the people who need help. Perhaps some more knowledge about Syria will move the reader.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Today’s Syria, with a history of famous civilizations and cities such as Ebla, Aram, Mari, Ugarit, Damascus, Homs, Edessa, Antioch, and Aleppo, is a land of diverse peoples and cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0020964312473249">16</xref></sup> Greater Syria was under the rule of larger empires from the late Bronze Age until initial independence in 1936 and the departure of French control ten years later; the present states of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel were created out of Greater Syria in the last century by Western nations, during which time Syria has occasionally been embroiled in wars with neighboring nations. Syria has been a safe haven for fleeing Armenians, Lebanese, Palestinians, and Iraqi refugees of different faith traditions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0020964312473249">17</xref></sup> yet also a place for destructive extremists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0020964312473249">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Muslims make up 92% of the Syrian population (mostly Sunni), and the president is affiliated with a minority Alawite tradition;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0020964312473249">19</xref></sup> Christians are 5–10%, and Jews 1%. Among Christians, those associated with Eastern forms of Christianity (about 1.5 million) make up a majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0020964312473249">20</xref></sup> While most Syrians find the Assad regime’s violence against the people reprehensible, there is some ambivalence about what kind of dangerous alternative could replace it, since the regime has protected the freedoms of minority religions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0020964312473249">21</xref></sup> Yet, the regime’s atrocities challenge any continued support of it, or neutral by-standing.</p>
<p>Syria is the land where the New Testament suggests Jesus’ disciples were first called “Christians,” of Paul’s Damascus Road experience, and where the story of Thecla provided memories of female Christian leaders. It is where the Syriac language, a dialect of Aramaic, originally was spoken in the region of the city of Edessa in Syria in the 1st century <sc>c.e.</sc> and spread out in the region with the growth of churches;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0020964312473249">22</xref></sup> Greek had been adopted for liturgy in other Syrian churches. Syria is a country where dialects of Aramaic are still spoken in some villages, where Arabic is spoken in others, and where Christians might refer to God as Allah.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0020964312473249">23</xref></sup> Syria is the land of the Peshitta (Syriac-Aramaic) translation of the Bible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0020964312473249">24</xref></sup> Scholars suggest that nearly all Syrians share a common ancient Near Eastern musical heritage that permeates both their folk and sacred music. Syria is a land with a legacy of great poets and singers.</p>
<p>“Lament” is found across cultures worldwide and through human history, particularly in dirges for the dead, laments for communal disaster, and lament as prayer. Women have played a central role both in composing dirge lyrics and in performance across many cultures, including Syria,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0020964312473249">25</xref></sup> and in biblical times,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0020964312473249">26</xref></sup> though men were not excluded from such expression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0020964312473249">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elements of the dirge song across cultures may include: reference to or description of death or loss; metaphors/similes for the individual lost; a contrast motif (comparing life “then and now”); questions about why or how it could happen; complaint, especially over the shortness of life if death is premature; weeping and melancholy; impact of the death or devastation on survivors; a call and response (dialog) performance style; singer addressing the dead (“you”), or the dead speaking; praise for the deceased (eulogy); prayer/reference to deity (and hope, or eternal life); personification (of inanimate things, death, war, nature, a city/nation); summons to others, or even nature, to pay attention, to mourn; incomprehensibility of the event; reconciling motifs (a “making peace” for the survivors; nobility of an individual’s life, death, or memory); protest or accusation if there was a perpetrator of death; a call for justice; a call for revenge, a curse; or a call for forgiveness.</p>

<sec id="section4-0020964312473249">
<title>Hebraic Tradition in the Middle East: The Book of Lamentations</title>
<p>While women’s composing and singing of laments for the dead is recognized in traditional cultures worldwide, including ancient Israel,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0020964312473249">28</xref></sup> it is a curious fact that none of their songs are included in the Bible. The only clear instance of the lyrics of a dirge is David’s dirge for Saul and Jonathan. While the Bible refers to the collection of laments by Jeremiah and singing men and women,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0020964312473249">29</xref></sup> whatever happened to this collection is a mystery. Why were these compositions not included? One explanation is that these were “secular” compositions and so not included; this would not be the case, as most dirges participate in the spiritual worldview of the composer and community for which it is offered, as David’s dirge shows, and are often associated with times of ritual burial. Either such laments were not used because the collection was lost, or because they did not fit in with the biblical editors’ theological perspectives or ideological purposes. Lament psalms <italic>may</italic> include women’s compositions, though the “I” or “we” voice in Hebrew leaves open the question of the speaker’s gender. Men and women through the ages have found that the Psalms speak to their experiences.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations gives the only sustained lament lyric of a female gendered voice in the Bible (apart from the woman lover in the Song of Songs). Many believe Lamentations is a representation to some extent of the perspectives and voices of the people about the 6th-century devastation of Jerusalem and exile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0020964312473249">30</xref></sup> While the book includes no dirges for the individual dead, it does express “communal dirges” for the whole people, and lament prayers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0020964312473249">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies of the Book of Lamentations highlight multiple voices representing different perspectives about the devastation. These voices try to make sense of the disaster that has befallen them. A number of scholars observe that the first two voices of the book (in Lamentations 1–2) engage in a dialogue. The first serves initially as a kind of detached narrator of the destruction using typical prophetic-type rhetoric, and the second voice as the female city of Jerusalem<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0020964312473249">32</xref></sup> or as a grieving mother.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0020964312473249">33</xref></sup> The latter representation of the female voice raises the question of how the biblical text (poet) either constructs a female persona of the city, or a poet/scribe/editor possibly co-opts a real woman’s lamenting voice in the context by turning her into such a persona.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0020964312473249">34</xref></sup> On the other hand, are there traces of a “real” woman’s voice and perspective in the book?</p>
<p>These voices in Lamentations initially accept the regnant explanation that God allowed the devastation by the Babylonian enemy and the exile as punishment for the injustices and idolatries of the Judean people. However, mutually encouraging one another’s laments leads the first two voices to articulate anger toward God for allowing the suffering and deaths of innocent children, wholesale destruction, and for excessive divine anger rather than mercy. The woman’s voice speaks as a grieving mother, not only for the loss of her children, but also for the loss of all the people (“children” of the city that she represents). While some of the first two speakers’ lines lament about the enemies’ actions and admit Jerusalem’s own wrongs, most lines blame God for abandoning the people and children. These elements of self-criticism and blame are of great significance as we look at later developments with religious/ethnic communities as they interpret situations via the genre of lament. Lamentations ends with a communal lament in which the people pray to God for help from a state of near hopelessness, but God does not answer.</p>
<p>A curious feature of the Book of Lamentations is not so much its acrostics (found elsewhere in the Bible), but its reversal of two letters in the alphabet in Lamentations 2, 3, and 4. I have suggested<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0020964312473249">35</xref></sup> that these letter reversals (associated with “eyes”—weeping—and “mouth”—speech) were intentional. They draw attention to the lamenters’ severe complaint and challenge the extremity of the “order” of God’s angry words.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0020964312473249">36</xref></sup> In nearly all biblical acrostic psalms, the alphabet follows the expected order, and these lyrics strongly justify and defend God (e.g., Psalms 25; 33; 34; 37; 38; 94; 111; 112; 119; 145). However, the use of acrostic and <italic>letter reversals</italic> appears in the lament of Psalms 9–10, with Lamentations, and in the Jewish <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> service (below).</p>

<title>The Performance of the Book of Lamentations in Early Jewish History and Liturgy</title>
<p>Lamentations was likely performed after 587 <sc>b.c.e</sc>., in the post-exilic years, and was required, according to the Talmud, to be chanted or performed in the early centuries of the Common Era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0020964312473249">37</xref></sup> Abraham Z. Idelsohn describes early Jewish music as characteristically “Semitic-Oriental,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0020964312473249">38</xref></sup> not written but oral, modal in form, using a tetrachordal system (four scales). Ancient Near Eastern neighbors used the same system. Within this music, Lamentations, along with the Prophets and the lament psalms, all shared the same musical scale,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0020964312473249">39</xref></sup> and this scale was the standard in Jewish music—both in folk music and in the ancient synagogue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0020964312473249">40</xref></sup> Lamentations also had a tune for performance, which might vary somewhat in locales due to different tonalities, but its music would be identifiable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0020964312473249">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been a consensus that early church music was influenced by Jewish modes of music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0020964312473249">42</xref></sup> Idelsohn also points out that the Gregorian song, “by establishing for ‘Plain Chant’ the rule of equal time-value for all notes of the chant” changed Semitic music from “its distinctive features: the unrhythmical, free character of improvisation, and the embellishment, which is the very color of Oriental life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0020964312473249">43</xref></sup> Thus, Lamentations recited in this Gregorian style would not likely fully capture the indigenous style of the Semitic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0020964312473249">44</xref></sup> performance modes. François Velde notes that some Roman Catholic performances of Lamentations offer<disp-quote>
<p>extended melismas, that is, long groups of notes on the same vowel (something rather unusual in Gregorian chant, though by no means rare: many alleluias have melismas). That tradition is probably as old as Gregorian itself, and may have roots in Hebrew liturgy. Most Renaissance and Baroque composers followed the tradition of melismas in their musical settings of the Lamentations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0020964312473249">45</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Idelsohn describes the Semitic musical scale of the Prophets, Lamentations, and lament psalms as expressive of “the outpouring of the soul . . . for those emotional texts the contents of which are pleading or fervent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0020964312473249">46</xref></sup></p>

<title>Remembering the Destruction: Compositions Inspired by Lamentations</title>
<p>Through the centuries in Jewish tradition, all five chapters of Lamentations have been chanted or sung liturgically on the Ninth of Av (<italic>Tishah B’Av</italic>), a fast day on the anniversary of the 6th-century <sc>b.c.e</sc>. destruction of Jerusalem, though not all synagogues today still hold the service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0020964312473249">47</xref></sup> It is usually held around August, and also commemorates the destruction of the Second Temple (70 <sc>c.e</sc>.), as well as later historic catastrophes, such as the expulsion of Jews from Spain and the 20th-century Holocaust (Shoah or Churban). Traditionally, mourning customs begin three weeks prior to this date,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0020964312473249">48</xref></sup> and often include other biblical and post-biblical lament psalms (<italic>kinoth</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0020964312473249">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>A highly influential poet/composer whose laments are included in this service is Eleazar ben Jacob Kallir. Though biographical information about him is uncertain, he may have lived in Palestine, Syria, or elsewhere, perhaps in the 6th,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0020964312473249">50</xref></sup> 7th,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0020964312473249">51</xref></sup> or 8th century <sc>c.e</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0020964312473249">52</xref></sup> His lament poems are often acrostics, a style that Idelsohn notes was popular among the people of Israel before the 6th century <sc>b.c.e</sc>. destruction, and which continued for centuries.

<p>In another lament based on Lamentations 2, Kallir uses the same peculiar reversal of two letters of the alphabet as in Lam 2:16 and 17; in both poems, this serves to emphasize the horrible speech of the enemies upon the Judean people being attacked, and also complains about what God has done in allowing it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0020964312473249">57</xref></sup> Of interest is the inclusion of a traditional “Lament for Josiah”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0020964312473249">58</xref></sup> in the <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> service, only mentioned in the Bible but not found there. Of note in this song is the same reversal of letters as above. It could be that this rhetorical feature comes from skilled dirge singers (including, if not largely women) in Judean tradition, and if so suggestive of women’s rhetorical influence on the book of Lamentations.</p>

<title>Western Christianity and Lamentations</title>
<p>Roman Catholic churches have included readings from the Book of Lamentations at least from the Middle Ages until the present. Western Christian composers arranged musical settings during the Renaissance and Early Modern period (1700s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0020964312473249">59</xref></sup> By 1570, the official Roman Mass after the Council of Trent established that the liturgy for the Tenebrae service (the dramatic extinguishing of lights/candles)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0020964312473249">60</xref></sup> during Holy Week would include nine readings of Lamentations in the vigils of Maundy Thursday (Lam 1:1–5, 1:6–9, 1:10–14), Good Friday (2:8–11, 2:12–15, 3:1–9), and Holy Saturday (3:22–30, 4:1–6, 5:1–11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0020964312473249">61</xref></sup> Some Protestant churches today now hold a Tenebrae service.</p>
<p>The theological themes of sin and repentance in these selections of Lamentations coincided with Holy Week’s emphases on the passion and death of Jesus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0020964312473249">62</xref></sup> Tragically, the Christian Holy Week was also at times through history the occasion for attacks on Jews, aided by anti-Jewish rhetoric embedded in Holy Week liturgies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0020964312473249">63</xref></sup> With Vatican II and the document <italic>Nostra Aetate</italic> (<italic>In Our Time</italic>) came the concern to right the wrongs of anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0020964312473249">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>A look at these selected verses of Lamentations for Holy Week reveals that they deleted the expressions of dissent in Lamentations (female Jerusalem or a female voice as mother, along with the first voice’s prophetic-type dissent). Nor does the selection include the defiant complaints about the deaths of innocent children. The selection only includes the female voice’s admission of sin, and deletes hers and the first voice’s dissent against God punishing this way. The selection skips over the first voice’s appeal to the female voice as “wall of Daughter Zion” to cry out in protest to the Lord and for help for the lives of her children; it deletes her subsequent direct address to God in lament prayer (Lam 2:20–22; 3:42–45). The selection also deletes the critique of false priests, prophets, and elders—leaders who brought the disaster upon the people (Lam 4:13–16). While the Book of Lamentations as a whole casts blame on the leaders, the people, and even God, this liturgical selection blames essentially the female city of Jerusalem, while at the same time seriously diminishes the woman’s voice. What we begin to see at work here is the occasional use of Lamentations, by those in control of liturgy, to link women’s portrayed lament with blame.</p>

<title>Examples of the Use of Lamentations Today: Roman Catholic and Protestant</title>
<p>An example of a Roman Catholic Tenebrae service today shows that the liturgy still includes lament psalms but reduces the readings from Lamentations to 3:1–11.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0020964312473249">65</xref></sup> The reading is followed by a responsory in which Jesus asks “O my chosen vineyard, it is I who have planted you; how have you become so bitter that you should crucify me?” This is clearly an anti-Jewish polemic, as the “vineyard” is an Old Testament metaphor for the people of Israel.</p>
<p>The <italic>Revised Common Lectionary</italic> for several Protestant churches includes Lamentations as an option for Holy Week,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0020964312473249">66</xref></sup> but the selected text (Lam 3:1–9, 19–24) completely edit out the female voice along with the narrator’s voice and all of their dissident laments and struggle; they are not heard in services. The readings do include selections from five lament psalms (Pss 36:5–11; 71: 1–14; 70:1–5; 116:1–2, 12–19, 22; and 31:1–4, 15–16), which total only 16 verses plus Psalm 22 (31 verses). However, the exclusion of the mother’s voice in Lamentations, lamenting the loss of her children and her outcry at the injustice, impoverishes the Protestant liturgy, which also lacks the stress on the suffering of Mary, Jesus’ mother that Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, and other church traditions include. The traditions that do not shy away from lament generally are the Eastern church traditions, including those in Syria.</p>

<sec id="section10-0020964312473249">
<title>The Syriac Orthodox Church</title>
<p>In the Syriac Orthodox Church, the ritual service for the Friday of crucifixion includes symbolic actions of carrying the cross, bearing the coffin, congregants drinking a bitter mixture, and singing of dramatic hymns, including the following lament hymn of Mary (<italic>Kadh Nopheq</italic>):<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0020964312473249">71</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>As He was coming out of the city, carrying His Cross on His shoulders,</p>
<p>The Hebrew women gathered to weep over Him bitterly.</p>
<p>His mother was standing afar, accompanied with her acquaintances,</p>
<p>As a dove she began to moan with grief and sorrow:</p>
<p>“Wither my Son, wither my beloved One are you going?</p>
<p>“Where are they taking You? Why did You give Yourself</p>
<p>“In the hands of the ungrateful ones?</p>
<p>“Woe is me, my beloved One. What happened to You this day?”</p>

<p>And blessed is Your humiliation which was on our account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0020964312473249">72</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Besides the role of Mary, the role of women’s voices in singing liturgical laments comes to the fore in several ways in Syria of late antiquity. While all the Eastern Church traditions emphasize the portrayal of Mary’s laments, the Syriac churches are progressive by the 4th century in affirming women to sing in liturgical choirs, including singing lament psalms. Susan Ashbrook Harvey notes that these “Daughters of the Covenant” in Syriac Orthodox tradition were empowered by their opportunity to contribute to the “public ministry,” but also that their participation was limited by the orthodoxy of the official church. The lyrics they sang, composed by St. Ephrem, the greatest poet and theologian of this tradition, were often intentionally designed to combat what he regarded as heresies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0020964312473249">73</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Daughters of the Covenant were charged with the task of singing psalms and various kinds of hymns in certain liturgical celebrations of the civic churches. This practice contrasted sharply, for example, with the normal pattern of Greek and Latin civic churches to the west. These areas permitted women’s singing in convent choirs, to be sure. But with the possible exception of Ambrose’s cathedral in Milan, women’s voices were excluded from choral participation in civic liturgical celebration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0020964312473249">74</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of the widespread oral traditional practice of women in the Mediterranean world and the Near East both composing and singing dirges (and other folk poetry) in settings outside of religious sanctuaries, and their recognized skill in expressing sorrow and grief, a question about women singers of Syriac liturgy (influenced as it was by oral poetic music of the folk) is to what extent these women contributed to the composition of songs of piety. Or, were they limited simply to performing the official repertoire? Ephrem<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0020964312473249">75</xref></sup> alludes to but does not record the full activity of the women singers, though Jacob of Serugh comments favorably that Ephrem composed the hymns for the women to sing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0020964312473249">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>If so, this might suggest that women as singers had more freedom to compose <italic>outside</italic> the liturgical sphere. There, with dirges women would not only render their personal experience of death and of those for whom they sang professionally, but the genre lyrics were also known to be used on occasion for socio-political commentary. By 676, the Daughters of the Covenant were affirmed also in their singing of dirges for the dead in funeral processions and at memorial services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0020964312473249">77</xref></sup> This may have been progressive by the Syrian churches, as the practice of women freely singing dirges was one that male leaders in several cultures earlier had tried to stop completely or limit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0020964312473249">78</xref></sup> Might this particular Syrian dirge composing-singing tradition, if we knew more about it (related to the Hebrew language family and oral poetic background), possibly shed light on the nature of lament singing of biblical women in Hebrew and Aramaic that were not included in the canon?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0020964312473249">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, in the current crisis of Syria, is there traditional singing of dirges for the many killed? And by traditional Muslim women singers as well? If so, are there elements of an ancient tradition being preserved, and innovated, for the current context? Most importantly, what might these songs convey of the cultural identity, suffering, and political and spiritual views of the people? How might such songs not only facilitate grief, but also participate in political action or empowerment? We will examine below some contemporary Syrian poets’ and singers’ laments related to the current situation, which include dirge motifs, with a political tone.</p>
<p>In Syriac churches, there was also an interpretive practice in performed homilies of “imagined speech” of female biblical characters “who in their scriptural texts were silent or barely granted brief comments.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0020964312473249">80</xref></sup> Thus in several ways, the Syrian Orthodox Church at least as early as the 4th century made serious attempts to advance women’s roles, including singing lament psalms. This is commendable, if not extraordinary in the context, as their efforts would have also been counter to the statement attributed to Paul, that “women should be silent in the churches” (1 Cor 14:34; even if a post-Pauline comment).</p>

<title>The Greek Orthodox Church</title>
<p>In the Greek Orthodox tradition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0020964312473249">81</xref></sup> including in Syria, there is a significant emphasis on singing lament psalms during Lent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0020964312473249">82</xref></sup> and on the suffering of Jesus and his (Jewish) followers, including laments attributed to them,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0020964312473249">83</xref></sup> including Mary, Joseph of Arimathea, and women followers who went to anoint Jesus and sing funeral dirges for him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0020964312473249">84</xref></sup> These lamenters are included in spite of the fact that in Luke’s Gospel Jesus is portrayed as saying, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your children” (23:27)—directed to the professional Jewish mourning women who sing laments. It is unclear whether this is Lukan anti-Jewish polemic, or a portrayal of Jesus’ sympathetic pointing to a future suffering coming from Rome against Jerusalem. This emphasis on suffering, it may be said, increases the depths of meaning of the passion, as well as the dramatic impact of resurrection.</p>
<p>The Greek Orthodox emphasis on honoring Mary’s experience of her son’s death involves a large collection of laments called <italic>stavrotheotokia</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0020964312473249">85</xref></sup> including lyrical representations of Mary’s laments for Jesus’ suffering and death, as well as their dialogs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0020964312473249">86</xref></sup> Unfortunately, some of the laments attributed to Jesus or Mary participate in anti-Jewish polemic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0020964312473249">87</xref></sup> The lament-dirge genre by women traditionally may include the singer’s protest over a socio-political injustice causing death, or critique of specific perpetrators, even leaders complicit in someone’s death. However, in these few liturgical cases of Mary’s and Jesus’ portrayed laments that blame the Jews, the rhetoric critiques a whole people; apparently completely missing in these laments is the expected outrage at specific <italic>Roman</italic> authorities for crucifying Jesus; this raises the larger question of the early church’s political use of such laments in the social context of appeasing Rome over against “the Jews.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the forerunner for the Greek Orthodox laments of Mary was the composition “Mary at the Cross” by the 6th-century Syrian hymnographer, Romanos the Melodist, influenced by Syrian traditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0020964312473249">88</xref></sup> The hymn is sung on Great Friday in Greek Orthodox churches, including in Syria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0020964312473249">89</xref></sup> Romanos was from Edessa, but he later served in Constantinople and wrote in Greek. He is said to have used a colloquial idiom in his poetry popular with the people, and shows an extraordinary pathos and sensitivity in this selection where he portrays Jesus and his mother in dialogue:
<disp-quote>
<p>“When the Ewe beheld her beloved lamb</p>
<p>being dragged to slaughter, Mary followed</p>
<p>with the other women. She cried out in torment:</p>
<p>‘Where do you rush, my Son,</p>
<p>why this haste to finish your course . . .</p>
<p>should I come with you Son?</p>
<p>Or better, wait for you somewhere?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0020964312473249">90</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Romanos portrays Mary speaking next of the “lawless ones” and “outlaws” who seized Jesus “with no justification,” and speaks of “your unjust execution.” She also critiques the disciples, including Peter, who all deserted Jesus, leaving him alone. Romanos says, “These were the words Mary cried and sobbed in the depths of her pain, in total agony. Her son turned to her and spoke, ‘Why weep, mother? Why be swept along with the other women?’” He explains to her that his death is necessary to redeem Adam. The editor of Romanos’ work, following other scholars, suggests the next stanza is a “spurious addition,” ironically, as in it Mary objects to being quieted, and affirms the women’s role in lamenting the dead:
<disp-quote>
<p>The all-holy Mother now cried out such a reply to him,</p>
<p>him who had been inconceivably sown in her and born of her.</p>
<p>Tormenting her soul even more, she said:</p>
<p>“Why say, my son, that I am not to be swept along with the others?</p>
<p> As they carried children in their bodies,</p>
<p> so did my womb carry you; I nursed you with my breasts.</p>
<p>How can you not want me to wail for you now, my Son,</p>
<p> as you hurry to undergo an unjust death,</p>
<p> even though you have raised the dead to life,</p>
<p>my Son and my God?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0020964312473249">91</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mary goes on to say that now she wipes the tears from her eyes, “but my mind cannot keep its silence,” asking him further to explain why he must die. Jesus is portrayed as explaining why. When Mary asks if she will see him again, he promises she will be the first to see him from the tomb. Mary continues, “Let me scorn the presumption of those who honor Moses. Do they mean to ratify him, these blind fools out to kill you?” She is portrayed as critiquing the specific lawless ones against him who claim Moses. Jesus instructs her to keep calm “if you see the foundations of earth quaking. Men’s sacrilege will totter all creation. . . The Temple will tear its veil at their ultimate blasphemy. . . .” The poem’s language and the last reference to “men’s sacrilege” refrain from the severe anti-Jewish polemic seen in later laments and earlier Christian writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0020964312473249">92</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-0020964312473249">
<title>Women’s Laments and the Gospels’ Passion Narratives</title>
<p>The emphasis on Mary’s laments in early church tradition leads us back to the New Testament Gospel Passion Narratives, where the virtual lack/silence of hers and women’s voices lamenting the death of Jesus is striking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0020964312473249">93</xref></sup> Did this general exclusion/rejection—or lack of attributing real Jewish women’s voices in the New Testament canon who were close to Jesus—amount to a detour from Jesus’ progressive, intended inclusion of women? On this matter, parts of the living church tradition appear more inclusive of women’s voices than the final written canon of the New Testament.</p>
<p>A clue to what we might term a “costly loss of women’s lament”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0020964312473249">94</xref></sup> in the New Testament Passion Narratives (and in the Old) may be found in a Greek Orthodox text focused on Mary. In the liturgy for “Great Saturday Morning,” the priest highlights Mary’s role and gives thanks for her:<disp-quote>
<p>Especially for our most holy, pure, most-blessed glorious Lady, the Theotokos<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0020964312473249">95</xref></sup> and ever-virgin Mary.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The people respond:<disp-quote>
<p>All creation rejoices in you, O full of grace, the assembly of angels and the human race. You are a sanctified temple and a spiritual paradise, the glory from which God was incarnate and became a child—our God, who exists before all ages. He made your womb a throne, and your body more spacious than the heavens. . . . <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0020964312473249">96</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, an outpouring of faithful expression transforms the mother Mary into a typology or persona so revered that she is regarded as almost goddess-like, like the sacred space of the city of Jerusalem, “Daughter Zion” (the temple) of old, in which God dwells.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0020964312473249">97</xref></sup> She also represents, at the same time, the church. Such “constructs” are lyrics of faith, beautiful expressions extending beyond the context of Mary’s life to express multiple facets of the community’s experience. They help counter the sometimes misogynous portrayals of Eve in the early church and the divisive “uses” of Mary so objectified that her words are turned to polemic made to speak against the other.</p>
<p>Yet the above text, importantly, also gives an analogous clue to what may have happened to the woman’s voice of lament in the Book of Lamentations. Perhaps over time she, too, was transformed, lyricized, yet objectified, into a persona of the female city Jerusalem. She was portrayed by Judean prophetic and post-exilic leaders as sinful and punished, a metaphor for Judah’s idolatry and injustice—yet beautifully redeemed in the lyrics of Second Isaiah. We must ask whether women composing-singers had anything to do with the re-casting, with the positive portrayals of these female personae.</p>
<p>The Greek Orthodox Easter liturgy goes on to confirm the transformation of Mary like the lamenting mother Jerusalem; as the priest says, “Let us honor and magnify the Theotokos, the<disp-quote>
<p>Mother of Light, with hymns. O my soul, magnify him who willingly suffered and was buried and arose from the grave on the third day. Shine, O shine, New Jerusalem, for the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. Rejoice now and be glad, Sion. And you, O pure Theotokos, rejoice in the resurrection of your child. . . .”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0020964312473249">98</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The parallel of sacred mother Mary to the sacred mother city<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0020964312473249">99</xref></sup> becomes explicit as the liturgist next addresses the unnamed women followers of Jesus:<disp-quote>
<p>Come from that scene, O women, heralds of good news, and say to Sion: “Accept the good news of joy from us, the news that Christ is risen. Exalt and celebrate and rejoice, O Jerusalem, seeing Christ the king coming from the tomb like a bridegroom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0020964312473249">100</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Greek liturgy, however, has offered an additional interpretive insight important for women. The call to the women around Jesus to be “heralds” announcing good news parallels the call to the prophet(s) in Second Isaiah, thus depicting these women witnessing the resurrection and receiving the admonition to speak as called prophets. Indeed, in Orthodox tradition, Mary of Magdala is the “apostle to the apostles.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0020964312473249">101</xref></sup> Moreover, because of the analogy drawn, these liturgical interpreters could have seen a possibility that there was a woman prophet herald in Second Isaiah, herald(ess) to Zion (Isa 40:9), where the Hebrew clearly alludes to a woman called to be a herald.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0020964312473249">102</xref></sup> The affirmation of women witnessing Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection in the Greek Orthodox liturgy suggests a “revelation”—the possibility of a woman’s high calling as a prophetic herald. Perhaps it is no irony (rather, suppressed and overlooked) to see a real suffering woman in Lamentations and a real Mary grieving Jesus’ death, both receiving a real female herald’s good news.</p>
<p>Looking past Mary to the other women, Kathleen Corley also has noted the strange absence of women’s voices of lament in the New Testament Passion Narratives. She has examined especially the standard practice of women holding “meals for the dead” throughout the Mediterranean world. She proposes convincingly that this women’s activity likely was the impetus for the very formation of the story of the Passion Narratives in the Gospels, which came not from an unknown written source, but was rooted in the women’s creative recounting as witnesses to their oral tradition. Thus, their lament songs especially, narrating the sad event, shaped the written Gospels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0020964312473249">103</xref></sup> A tragedy, in her view, is that the women have not been given credit for this contribution or for their role in the development of a resurrection faith and theology that ensued, central to the origins of Christianity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0020964312473249">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>So what can we surmise from these threads of tradition of lament? First, women’s voices of lament were/are important and valued in popular culture in ancient Near Eastern and Syrian traditions, especially in singing dirges, though at times curtailed (reception/rejection). Women’s laments likely influenced forms of biblical literature (Lamentations, dirge rhetoric, and perhaps lament psalms), but their actual songs were essentially excluded, while their lyrics inspired powerful poetic metaphors or personae; thus women’s laments appear to be only obliquely included in the canon (reception/rejection). In the most extreme crisis of ancient Israel, with everything collapsing, a woman’s voice of Lamentations yet strained through—with lyrics admitting wrongs, lamenting the people’s and especially innocent children’s suffering, with protest against leaders’ failures, with protest against God, for treating the people so harshly and not intervening with help. Centuries later, women’s dirge-laments and Mary, mother of Jesus, significantly influenced post-biblical liturgy in Roman Catholic and Eastern church traditions and some others, and women singers contributed to performance of dirges and perhaps lament psalms. But again, Mary’s voice and the women singers’ voices appear to be filtered by sympathetic male authorities, and at times unfortunately put to polemical use against the “Other.”</p>

<title>Women’s Laments: Then and Now</title>
<p>Real women over the generations, whose laments had some influence, really lived in their cultures and struggled and suffered during crises. The grief of mothers in recent contexts of violence has generated important laments and protest movements that have helped bring about positive change; theirs is a polemic as well, but for the common good. In the 1950s, when the apartheid government in South Africa imposed hardships on black women, Xhosa women developed a saying that became a fervent national song, “Now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock!” This spurred on the struggle and generated sympathetic solidarity from white women who formed the Black Sash (signifying mourning). In 1956, 20,000 women, many carrying children, marched to the door of the prime minister’s office in Pretoria with 100,000 signatures demanding change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0020964312473249">105</xref></sup> One South African Jewish woman in parliament, the late Helen Suzman, stood up time and again, all alone, to vote against the apartheid government’s abuse of black people, and she inspired a nation. In 1966, the National Organization of Women in the U.S. issued a statement saying, “We . . . believe that the time has come for a new movement . . . toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0020964312473249">106</xref></sup> In 1977, mothers in Argentina united as Madres de la Plaza de Mayo and marched to the president’s palace to protest their missing and killed children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0020964312473249">107</xref></sup> In 1988, “Women in Black” in Jerusalem organized against violence and killing; Jewish and Palestinian women stood together silently in public, wearing black, a sign of mourning. In 1989, in China, mothers and fathers watched their children protest in Tiananmen Square, and now they demand to be allowed to publicly mourn and remember their killed children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0020964312473249">108</xref></sup> In 2003, Liberian social worker Leymah Gbowee led thousands of women (across religions) who had had enough of men’s endless civil war in a successful sit-in at the presidential palace to demand peace, a movement culminating in the first woman head of state of Liberia (Ellen Johnson Sirleaf).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0020964312473249">109</xref></sup> And in 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi, after nearly 15 years under house arrest as a political prisoner protesting the Burmese government, was released and elected to the Burmese Parliament in 2012; “The Lady” is the beloved leader of the people. It is no accident that women with laments, whether recognized or not, are more than just weeping and wailing, for a long history of singing dirges has often involved them in political protest. They have been important figures in movements for social justice, like Rima Dali, and many others, standing up in Damascus.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us now listen to the voices of lament in Syria. We have already seen that women and men are in the streets raising their voices. Recent video footage shows the importance of many poetic singers in the streets leading the people in lyrical chants and protesting the regime,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0020964312473249">110</xref></sup> and not a few have been imprisoned and tortured.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0020964312473249">111</xref></sup> In footage from 2011, a poet chants a lament in Arabic in a public square in the city of Homs, center of the uprising; and as in the rhetoric of so many communal laments from different cultures in the Middle East and the Mediterranean world, he personifies his city, while also appealing to God for help:
<disp-quote>
<p>They’ve starved you!</p>
<p>They’ve besieged you!</p>
<p>They’ve made you kneel down</p>
<p>But Homs</p>
<p>you’re full of dignity and pride</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh Homs!</p>
<p>There is no one like you!</p>
<p>Oh God!</p>
<p>You are all we have got!</p>
<p>Oh God!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0020964312473249">112</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The crowd responds, repeating his lyrics with energized singing.</p>
<p>An undercover Aljazeera reporter who spent several months in Syria recently recounted what is going on all over the country:<disp-quote>
<p>You now have an indigenous uprising based on local grievances, organized by local leaders with very little outside support, confronting the regime for the first time . . . This is a culture that has a great deal of appreciation for poetry and for lives of spoken poetry, going back to pre-Islamic days even. So this very much informs the demonstrations as well. It has created this unique subculture, where every night you go out and sing the same songs; they’re in your head all the time now, all day long; little kids know them as well. . . . <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0020964312473249">113</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He also noted that mosques are one of the few places left for people to organize safely; Christians and other non-Muslims in the community as well enter them to be part of the local movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0020964312473249">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reporter further explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Despite all this violence and attacks [by the regime], every night there are demonstrations. People come out in defiance. It’s become something they have to do, going out and singing. . . It makes them feel like they’re human, like they have dignity, like they have freedom, for just that moment in time . . . There’s a phenomenon, sometimes at 9:00 p.m., sometimes at midnight, of women, children, men—going on their balconies and shouting ‘Allahu akbar’” [God is greatest]. . . .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0020964312473249">115</xref></sup></p>

<p>The well-known dissident Syrian female poet, Hala Mohammad,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0020964312473249">116</xref></sup> in exile from Latakia, was featured in a recent video program. She said,<disp-quote>
<p>The revolution in Syria is now teaching me that poetry really does leave an impression, the slogans of the demonstrations and the peacefulness of it all . . . The way the protesters stand, they’re dying but singing and holding peaceful banners. . . . all the artistic practices the authorities forbid have become major ways to express ideas about the revolution in a peaceful way. In Syria they say, “The Syrian people will not be humiliated.” It’s the most beautiful poem written this year. Syria was known for its politics. Now people are talking about its people. This alone is a big achievement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0020964312473249">117</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mohammed described how, when in Daraa, Syria, the children chanting slogans against the regime were arrested or killed, this shocked her and many in Syria. She says, “Even if this killer has a Ph.D., he is still illiterate, illiterate and blind. This goes back to the idea of entitlement. He thinks the country is his.” <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0020964312473249">118</xref></sup> She reads two of her poems (translated here) in response; they contain some of the same key themes, uniquely expressed, in traditional women’s dirges and laments across cultures, throughout history—compassion for suffering and killed children, and outcry of injustice against the perpetrator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0020964312473249">119</xref></sup></p>

<p>Mohammad explains, “When I speak poetically, I speak with freedom. When I write: ‘The despot fells death grave by grave, so that not a single one remains for him,’ I’m not being just sentimental, I’m actively looking for justice. . . . Until now, weapons are stronger than us. Maybe they are faster. But I think poetry will endure.” <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0020964312473249">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>Can such voices of lament also push back the pressures of sectarian polemic and hate, of group-interest instigated by a dictator who holds the threat of persecution and death over them (in so-called “civil war”)? Can they find in diverse cultural and Abrahamic ancestries (patriarchal and matriarchal) common ground to unite for the good of all? Or will the dictator and group leaders further divide the people by their differences, violently pitting neighbors against each other, as happened in former Yugoslavia?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0020964312473249">122</xref></sup>—and we all have such a history. Or, will a united, diverse Syrian people, <italic>singing in</italic> their own Spring become an even greater counter-force and nation?</p>
<p>Let us end these reflections with a lament poem by a young Syrian-American and recent college graduate about her homeland. In her unique way, she lyricizes as women have always done, about death, children, the perpetrator, faith, and the triumphs of victory.</p>

<p>Before aspirin/Before languages and letters and rituals/Before the major questions and the major religions/Before “help me” and “save me” . . ./Think of the nightmares of those times/And the cries of those people/Think of the suffering of weak, helpless, puzzled, dumb creatures/Think of this and that/Of the pain of this and that,/Not like someone taking part in a banquet of regret or pity/But like some one suffering on behalf of all mankind.</p>
