<abstract>
<p>The total energy balance sheet of Algeria in the year 2009 shows that the final energy consumption is evaluated as 30.98 million TEP (Ton oil equivalent) and emphasizes a prevalence of energy consumption in the household sector as more than 41% compared with 19% from the industry sector and 33% from transport. In this article, an analysis of the use of the various energy vectors in an individual dwelling (conventional and ecological house) in urban environment is presented. The thermal parameters influencing the building are evaluated, illustrating the potential for energy losses, as well as energy gains for both types of buildings. The results are compared to demonstrate the requirement to use more ecological materials for buildings to realize savings in energy and economic terms to reduce heating and cooling and to minimize emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>, for a more carbon-efficient-sustainable built environment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11413478"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a need for Algeria to plan for a foreseeable shortage of fossil energies due to the consequences of carefree consumption. Since the consumption of energy is increasing from one year to another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11413478">Figure 1</xref>), there is a need to develop innovating techniques to bring solutions at least partially for a more efficient use of resources and to minimize pollution. The housing sector carries a considerable share of the responsibilities in this matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11413478">Figure 2</xref>) in comparison to the other sectors.

</p>
<p>In this context, the building sector supports important research programs aiming to reduce the environmental impacts of buildings within the framework of a sustainable development policy. The Algerian law on the control of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11413478">4</xref>] and the new statutory texts set up recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11413478">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11413478"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11413478">7</xref>] have set the national model for energy consumption of buildings and have defined the general framework for the various actions, in order to consider the construction of buildings with positive energy, i.e. on an annual statement of account producing more energy than consumption. Taking as a starting point, the studies that led to this research topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11413478">8</xref>], the work presented in this article provides a comparison of the various assessments (energy, economic and environmental) between a traditional house existing in the town of Tlemcen (Algeria) and a similar house built with ecological materials. The goal of this project was to illustrate the levels of energy consumption within a dwelling and to identify the best intervention to allow the development of more energy-efficient buildings. The dissemination of the findings of this work should be informative for future development of more sustainable buildings and ecological habitats in Algeria, as well as building material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11413478"><title>Description of the Houses</title>
<p>The conventional house studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11413478">Figure 3</xref>) is located in Tlemcen (Western Algeria). The house has a total surface plate of 100 m<sup>2</sup> conceived in downstairs and two (2) stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11413478">Figure 4</xref>). The downstairs comprises a hall, a garage, a living room and a bathroom. On the first level, there is another living room, a kitchen, a small hall and a small bathroom. On the second level, there are three bedrooms, a hall, a bathroom and a balcony. The architectural features and the sitting of the house enable it to receive the solar radiation since the living rooms are southeastern and southwestern facing. The bioclimatic architecture is an important requirement for the ecological design. The external walls comprise a layer of double walls of 30 cm (the thermal coefficient of transmission <italic>U</italic> = 3.5 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). The interior wall is constructed of brick with a thickness of 13 cm. The flagstone wall is made of 20 cm of concrete (<italic>U</italic> = 4 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). The house has simple glazing, with wooden windows and doors (<italic>U</italic> = 2.5 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). The external doors are made of iron (<italic>U</italic> = 5.8 Wm<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>).
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11413478" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>The studied house.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11413478" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>The layout plan of the conventional house.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig4a.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig4b.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The ecological house is constructed mainly of wood due to the various advantageous characteristics; wood has a weak thermal inertia, low cost of construction, low embodied carbon and low coefficient of thermal transmission as compared to other ecological materials. Thus, the external walls would have a wood framework of 30 cm, comprising a layer of 22 cm cellulose wadding (<italic>U</italic> = 0.163 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). The flagstone wall is insulated by 20 cm of cellulose wadding (<italic>U</italic> = 0.118 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). A very powerful double glazing (20 mm <italic>U</italic> = 1.1 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>) is used throughout the house. The insulated external doors is fitted with a high degree of air tightness (<italic>U</italic> = 0.94 W m<sup>−2</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11413478"><title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The current design of the buildings is mainly based on the criterion of energy saving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11413478">9</xref>] associated with the use of insulation; solar contributions and inertia; and by carefully considering the occupants’ tolerance of their thermal environment for comfort which would play two very important roles in the energy efficiency of buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11413478">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11413478">11</xref>].
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First of all, the consumption of energy of any building would depend on the interior temperatures, because the losses of heat by surfaces of the building or ventilation would depend primarily on the difference between interior and external temperatures. The sensitivity of the occupants to the interior climate also has major implications in the way of controlling the environment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For a building to be considered fit for the purpose of living, the interior comfort of the environment is acceptable for the occupants. Thermal comfort is generally regarded by the occupants as one of the most important needs in the building. Moreover, it is proven that the thermal comfort of the occupants is related to their perceptions of the quality of the interior air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11413478">12</xref>] and the productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11413478">13</xref>]. Comfort is also important because the occupants will react to any discomfort by actions of restoration of the thermal environment. These actions can have an energy cost—to open a window when the heat is on, for example, it could be an expensive way of cooling an overheated building.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec4-1420326X11413478"><title>Energy Consumption and Comfort</title>
<p>Many works presented an “index” for estimating the acceptable thermal environment for occupants based on the theory of heat exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11413478">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11413478"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11413478"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11413478">15</xref>]. Nevins and Gagge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11413478">14</xref>] introduced the concept of effective temperature and this was extended to the standard effective temperature, which constituted the basics of the construction standards in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11413478">15</xref>]. Humphreys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11413478">16</xref>], in 1978, established a relationship, see Eq (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11413478">1</xref>), between the comfort temperature and the average temperature.

<p>The concept of day degree “Dd” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11413478">Table 1</xref>) was introduced to allow the determination of the quantity of heat consumed by a building over a given period of heating and to carry out comparisons between buildings located in various climatic zones.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11413478"><title>Energy Balance Sheet of the Two Houses</title>
<p>To determine the exact energy balance sheet of the two houses, the energy requirements of each house during 1 year was calculated to determine the comfort temperature. Thus, the thermal comfort needs for the conventional house was estimated to be 281 kW h m<sup>−2</sup> per year and those of the ecological house would be 18.41 kW h m<sup>−2</sup> per year. These are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11413478">Figure 5</xref>.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11413478" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Comparison between the energy balance sheet of the conventional house and ecological house.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig5.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Although the architecture and provisions of the two houses are the same, there is a great deal of difference in the energy saved in the ecological house (93%) as compared to that of the conventional house due to the insulation. Also to note is the energy demand of the two houses for air conditioning (cooling), during the months of June, July, August and September (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11413478">Figure 6</xref>).
<fig id="fig6-1420326X11413478" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Comparison between the energy requirements for the two types of houses for <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> (comfort temperature).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig6.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The energy assessments of the two houses have illustrated that the energy consumption in the conventional house is mainly due to the walls (35% of the total intake), heating (22.5%) and losses via the ceiling (19%); the power consumption of the ecological house, however, would be mainly due to the doors and glazings (26%), heating (23%) and losses via the walls (21.5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11413478"><title>Economic Balance Sheet of the Two Houses</title>
<p>For the economic balance sheet, a comparative study between the energy bill of the traditional house and that of the ecological house is necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11413478">Figure 7</xref>).
<fig id="fig7-1420326X11413478" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>The total energy consumption comparison between the conventional and ecological house during the summer and heating season.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig7.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The ecological house is distinguished clearly from the conventional house by its annual economic assessment, the energy bill for the conventional house, for achieving a temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> (temperature of comfort) by heating and cooling (energy used for heating and/or cooling the house), largely would exceed 300€ per year. Contrary to this, that of the ecological house would be less than 200€ per year.</p>
<p>The summary table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11413478">Table 2</xref>) shows the differences in designs, materials and costs between the two houses that were indexed. The costs associated with the house over 15 years were reported by adopting the approach that the structure of the building was designed to last at least during all this time, by undergoing the repairs if necessary. The table has highlighted well the important hidden costs of a house:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the conventional construction industries, the maintenance costs over 15 years would amount to paying half of the one second complete construction of the house, whereas, in the ecological versions, this would represent only a quarter of the construction cost.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The report is identical for consumption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the whole, the additional expenses with more effective construction are lessened by the generated economies. The ecological construction would become less expensive than the conventional version. The choice to build ecological would be driven by financial profitability.</p></list-item>

<p>The comfort of life achieved in the better heated house is not equivalent in both houses.</p>
<p>The difference in the economic assessment between the conventional and ecological house is very important, and this would depend on the durability of materials and the technical implementation in the construction of the houses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11413478">Figure 8</xref> shows the investments required in order to upgrade the energy efficiency conditions of the house. However, too expensive construction would not be of interest to the owners to undertake refurbishment upgrade of the house: the heating needs are null, but the return time of investment will be unfavourable.
<fig id="fig8-1420326X11413478" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>Report investment – Return time of investment/heating requirements.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413478-fig8.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>An effort is being considered to limit the energy needs between 200 and 15 kW h m<sup>−2</sup> per year. Construction has been proven to be increasingly expensive. The costs for energy power were lowered, together with the associated costs, but this reduction has not been able to compensate the exponential growth in cost for construction, and the growth in value of the equity of the property (i.e. the house) and would not be realised over a long time to ameliorate the cost invested for refurbishment upgrade.</p>
<p>The energy consumption limit of 15 kW h m<sup>−2</sup> per year for the ecological house is justified by the curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11413478">Figure 8</xref> and this was mainly due to the saving achieved by reducing heating requirements.</p>
<p>The performance of the envelope of the ecological house would allow the reduction in the energy requirement for the ecological house to 15 kW h. However, the construction and materials costs would be so prohibitive that there might not be sufficient interest to achieve the “zero-energy” target.</p>

<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a dwelling are regarded as an indicator of the quality of its design, as well as the architectural thermal quality. The environmental assessment conducted by this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1420326X11413478">Figure 9</xref>), showed clearly the difference between the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the two houses. This difference was due mainly to the choice of material for insulation, which would allow the reduction of energy consumption for heating and air-conditioning.

<sec id="sec8-1420326X11413478"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The environmental and economic assessments conducted by this study have illustrated that the construction of an ecological house could achieve a reduction in the energy consumption and economic cost. The crucial factor would be the optimization of the U factor of the houses by an appropriate choice of building materials. Moreover, during its life cycle, the building would allow a significant reduction of the environmental impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, in particular the global warming potential and exhaustion of the abiotic resources. Thus, the concept of the ecological house should constitute a valid solution for building in Mediterranean climate to improve the energy and environmental performances of dwellings compared with that of the Algerian building regulations.</p>
<p>An ecological house cannot be completely perfect if a maximum comfort is sought. Moreover, in time, these buildings will need less energy to heat, to light, etc., which would represent saving in economies in comparison to the other buildings.</p>
<p>According to this study, an ecological house would be approximately 15% more expensive with the investment than a conventional house. This would represent an investment not an “over cost,” because the performance of the house would allow a profit in 10 years time. Nevertheless, the paramount benefit would lie in the exploitation of renewable energies, the respect of the environment, of ecology, and comfort, while using the latest exploitable materials for insulation, following the example of the other traditional products.</p>
<p>To build ecologically is thus a profitable operation and would fit in with the framework of sustainable development.</p>
