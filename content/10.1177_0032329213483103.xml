<abstract>
<p>Many of our inherited civic institutions are dead or dying. We need an ambitious reform program to revive democratic life. This essay advances a four-pronged “citizenship agenda”: (1) a campaign finance initiative granting each voter fifty “patriot dollars” to fund candidates and political parties of his or her choice; (2) a proposal for a new national holiday, Deliberation Day, held before each national election, enabling citizens to deliberate on the merits of rival candidates; (3) a system of federally financed electronic news-vouchers to permit professional journalism to survive the destruction of its traditional business model; and (4) a new form of citizenship inheritance, which provides $80,000 to all Americans as they start off life as adults. Working with collaborators, I have developed each of these initiatives at book length. This essay suggests how the “citizenship agenda” yields a whole that is larger than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>Progressives have been fighting a rear-guard battle in defense of the achievements of the twentieth century—public education and progressive taxation, social security and Medicare, civil rights and environmental protection, union rights and workplace safety. President Barack Obama’s health care program, while a significant step, fulfills an old progressive initiative laid out by Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and many others over the past century. It does not represent new thinking that confronts the distinctive challenges of contemporary life.</p>
<p>Some old ideas are good ideas. But a politics of nostalgia won’t be good enough to defend our democracy against plutocratic attack. From the American and French Revolutions to the day-before-yesterday, we have expanded our democratic legacy through acts of bold institutional innovation—some more successful than others—but all pushing forward the movement to greater political inclusion, individual freedom, and social justice. If we are to move further down this path, there is an imperative need for large acts of political imagination.</p>
<p>In preparing a new reform agenda, we should proceed in the distinctive spirit of realistic idealism. As realists, we should design institutional initiatives that will <italic>actually work</italic> in the real world, using all the tools of modern policy analysis for a hard-headed exploration of practical options. Good intentions aren’t enough.</p>
<p>We should also be unembarrassed idealists: we should not content ourselves with narrow variations on the status quo, but aim for practical frameworks that would enable ordinary citizens to take charge of their political and economic lives. The meaningful exercise of American citizenship is no pipedream, but a practical project well worth a tough political struggle.</p>
<p>This has been the spirit of a “citizenship agenda” that is the product of fifteen years of collaborative work. In setting out four planks of a new agenda, my friends and I have tried to develop the art of talking about big ideas in ordinary English, staying clear of techno-babble. This is the only way to convince millions of ordinary people that meaningful citizenship is a real-world possibility—if only they took the future into their own hands.</p>
<p>I won’t really mind if you find these proposals wrong-headed or counterproductive. Nobody can please everybody, and you may be provoked to come up with better ideas than we have offered. But I will have utterly failed if you find them obscure or pedantic.</p>
<p>Begin with the problem of big money in politics. The top one percent of Americans give more than ninety percent of the money to political candidates; and with the recent rise of the SuperPACs, we no longer even try to disguise our emerging plutocracy in democratic dress.</p>
<p>To reform the system, we need something new: give every voter a special credit card account containing $50 that he or she can spend only on federal election campaigns. Armed with their cards, voters could go to local ATM machines whenever they liked and send their “patriot dollars” to favored candidates and political organizations. About 130 million Americans went to the polls in 2012. If they also had a chance to go to their ATMs, they would have injected about $6.5 billion of federally funded patriot dollars into the campaign—greatly diluting the power of the private $5.2 billion spent by all federal candidates—and their nominally “independent” campaign supporters—during the last electoral cycle. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032329213483103">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are lots of key details that must be resolved to transform this idea into a workable program: Ian Ayres and I work out these problems at book length in <italic>Voting with Dollars</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032329213483103">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>But for now, consider the way a functioning program would invigorate the politics of ordinary citizenship. When each US voter has $50 in patriot dollars in his or her pocket, candidates will have a powerful incentive to reach out and grab them. Fundraising will become a community affair —a box lunch for 100 can gross $5000! These outreach efforts will provoke hundreds of millions of conversations: Who should get the money? Who is a charlatan, and who is really concerned about the country?</p>
<p>Patriot dollars have many merits, but one great limitation. Once citizens go to their ATMs to beam their patriot money onward, the candidates will continue to spend most of the contributions on sound-bite appeals to hot-button issues. Patriotic finance will redistribute the sound-bites, emphasizing themes with greater resonance for ordinary citizens. But we will still be living in a sound-bite democracy, and this isn’t good enough.</p>
<p>The next challenge is to provide citizens with the tools they need to move beyond the media blitz, and engage in thoughtful political discussion. An exemplary model is the US jury. Twelve men and women begin in total ignorance, but they learn a lot during the course of the trial. After hearing competing arguments, and reasoning together, they regularly—if not invariably—come up with perfectly sensible conclusions.</p>
<p>The task is to design a similar format for politics. Working with my friend, Stanford political scientist Jim Fishkin, we’ve come up with a practical proposal based on a new technique, Deliberative Polling, which has been field-tested in seventy-five settings throughout the world—from Australia to Bulgaria, China to Denmark, Austin to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Each poll invites a few hundred citizens to spend a weekend deliberating on major issues of public policy. Before they arrive, participants respond to a standard questionnaire that explores their knowledge about, and positions on, the issues. They then answer the same questionnaire after completing their deliberations.</p>
<p>Comparing these before-and-after responses, Fishkin and his team of social scientists have rigorously established that participants greatly increase their understanding of the issues and often change their minds on the best course of action. Ten percent swings are common. No less important, participants leave with a more confident sense of their capacities as citizens.</p>
<p>These experiments suggest a new way of thinking about democratic reform. In our book, <italic>Deliberation Day</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032329213483103">3</xref></sup> Fishkin and I urge the creation of a new national holiday, held two weeks before critical national elections. Ordinary business will come to a halt, and citizens will be invited to gather at neighborhood centers to discuss the central issues raised by the leading candidates for the presidency. Nobody will be forced to attend, but as with jury service, participants should be paid a stipend for the day’s work of citizenship.</p>
<p>Deliberation Day (DDay) begins with a nationally televised debate between the candidates, who discuss the leading issues in the traditional way. But citizens then deliberate in small groups of fifteen, and later in larger plenary assemblies. The small groups begin where the televised debate leaves off. Each spends an hour and a half defining questions that the national candidates left unanswered. Everybody then proceeds to a 500-citizen assembly to hear their questions answered by local representatives of the major parties.</p>
<p>After lunch, participants repeat the morning procedure. By the end of the day, citizens will have moved beyond the top-down television debate by the leading candidates. They will achieve a bottom-up understanding of the choices confronting the nation. Discussions begun on DDay will continue during the run-up to election day, drawing tens of millions of other Americans into the escalating national dialogue.</p>
<p>If DDay succeeds, sound-bite democracy will end. Candidates would have powerful incentives to create longer and more substantive “infomercials.” Newscasts would be full of exit polls determining the extent to which DDay discussions had changed voting preferences—framing the intensifying debate that culminates only on election day. While there will always be plenty of room for a politics of personality, the new system would put the focus where it belongs: on the crucial issues determining the future of the United States.</p>
<p>Once again, our book works out the proposal in detail. The task here is to place the proposal into the larger context defined by the patriot dollar initiative. In our present sound-bite democracy, voters are bombarded by hot-button slogans generated by well-financed special interests: the point is to arouse knee-jerk reactions, not informed judgments. So it’s no surprise that most voters go to the polls with only the vaguest understanding of the issues.</p>
<p>But once they are provided with new tools for engagement, voters will be in a position to take their citizenship seriously. From the very beginning of the presidential campaign, candidates will be reaching out to them with great vigor—if only to pick their pockets and get at their patriot dollars. As citizens begin “to vote with their dollars,” Deliberation Day will loom on the horizon. Candidates will no longer spend most of their money on thirty-second sound bites. They will be beaming longer “infomercials” to enable partisans to state their case intelligently on DDay. By the time election day arrives, voters will go to the polls with a far better sense of the stakes before the nation, and the nature of the rival responses proposed by the candidates.</p>
<p>The democratic promise of DDay can be further enhanced by an ongoing effort to shape the internet as a force for citizenship deliberation. Despite the vibrancy of the blogosphere, the hard truth is that the internet is destroying professional journalism. The speed of this transformation is extraordinary. In the United States, the overall number of newspaper reporters and broadcast news analysts has already dropped from 66,000 in 2000 to 52,000 in 2009, with devastating cuts in the Washington press corps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032329213483103">4</xref></sup> This is only the beginning. The very existence of journalism is at stake. We are losing a vibrant corps of serious reporters whose job is to dig for facts and provide both sides of the story in a relatively impartial fashion.</p>
<p>The blogosphere can’t be expected to take up the slack. First-class reporting on national and international affairs isn’t for amateurs. It requires lots of training and lots of contacts and lots of expenses. It also requires reporters with the well-honed capacity to write for a broad audience—something that eludes the overwhelming majority of academic specialists and think-tank policy wonks. And it requires editors who recognize the need to maintain their organization’s long-term credibility when presenting the hot-button news of the day. The modern newspaper created the right incentives, but without a comparable business model for the new technology, blogging will degenerate into a postmodern nightmare—with millions spouting off without any concern for the facts.</p>
<p>Enter the internet news voucher. Under my proposal, internet users click a box whenever they read a news article that contributes to their political understanding. These reader “votes” are then transmitted to a National Endowment for Journalism, which would compensate the news organization originating the article on the basis of a strict mathematical formula: the more clicks, the bigger the check from the Endowment.</p>
<p>Some might find this prospect daunting. Readers may flock to sensationalist sites and click to support their “news reports.” But common sense, as well as fundamental liberal values, counsels against any governmental effort to regulate the quality of news.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some basic restrictions should apply. For starters, the government should not be in the business of subsidizing libel. It should limit grants to news organizations prepared to put up an insurance policy to cover the costs of compensating people whose reputations they destroy through false reporting. This means that a news organization must go into the marketplace and satisfy an insurance company that they have the resources to do serious fact-checking. It’s only if they pass this market test that they can open their voucher account with the National Endowment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0032329213483103">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a safeguard against fraud, each reader will have to convince the Endowment that he or she is a real person, and not merely a computer program designed to inflate the article’s popularity. Before they can click in support, they will have to spend a few seconds typing in some random words or syllables. Though the time typing may seem trivial, it will help discriminate between the cynics and the citizens. After all, the readers won’t receive any private reward for “wasting” their time, day after day, clicking approval of the articles deserving public support. They will participate only if, as good citizens, they are willing to spend a few moments in the broader project of creating a vibrant public dialogue.</p>
<p>The resulting system will bear a family resemblance to Voting with Dollars and Deliberation Day. The National Endowment sets up a voucher system that, like patriot dollars, permits the decentralized show of support by concerned citizens. Like Deliberation Day, it engineers a credible microcontext for the responsible exercise of citizenship—but this time on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>No need to exaggerate. I am not conjuring up some mythic version of Periclean Athens. I am not asking modern Americans to don their togas, but to click their computers, send patriot dollars via ATM machines, and talk to their neighbors at local community centers—while spending most of their time earning a living and leading a fulfilling personal life. I am not longing for some brave new world, but one where ordinary citizens can check the power of big money to control our sound-bite democracy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Real reform in politics comes cheap. The patriot dollars initiative would cost about $2 billion dollars on an annualized basis ($6.5 billion during presidential elections, $2.5 billion during midterm elections). The National Endowment for Journalism would have a huge impact if citizen-clicks could direct $1 to $2 billion dollars a year to journalistic sites.</p>
<p>DDay is also pretty cheap. Running the facilities would cost about $2 billion if 50 to 70 million Americans show up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0032329213483103">6</xref></sup> The big cost comes in creating a new national holiday—which would more-or-less close down the economy, losing a day’s economic output. But we can avoid this large “opportunity cost” by celebrating President’s Day in late October rather than the middle of February. I’m very confident that George Washington and Abe Lincoln would applaud the move—since a Day of Citizen Deliberation would serve as a superior memorial than the current consumerist orgies at the Presidents’ Day Sale!</p>
<p>Once we move from political to economic citizenship, we confront big price tags. Only a large initiative has the chance to stop the spiraling inequalities that endanger the future of democratic life.</p>
<p>There can be no disputing the basic facts: between 1979 and 2006, the top one percent’s share of total income grew from 9 percent to 19 percent. And the problem is getting worse, not better. During the boom between 1993 and 2008, the top one percent took more than half of the total increase in national income, as economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez have established in path-breaking work. They also show that that the top one-tenth of one percent is doing even better. The elite’s share of the national wealth has quadrupled over the past forty years—growing from 1.28 percent in 1979 to 5 percent in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0032329213483103">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wealth is even more concentrated than income. According to data compiled by the Federal Reserve, the top 1 percent owned 35 percent of the disposable wealth, as opposed to 21 percent of the income, in 2006-2007. The United States is becoming a poorly disguised plutocracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0032329213483103">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Below the plutocrats, the country has a three-class system. About 30 percent of US children will graduate from four-year colleges and move into the ranks of the symbol-using class. But the vast middle class, who graduate high school or a two-year college, will fail to share in the prosperity of the symbol users. To be sure, they won’t confront the long-term unemployment that threatens the bottom fifth who drop out of high-school. But that is small consolation.</p>
<p>Over the last half-century, progressives have fashioned some new legal tools to struggle against these forces of economic exclusion: most notably, in civil rights law. They have spent numberless hours seeking to pry open more good jobs for blacks, women, and other subordinated groups. For all the half-steps, the result has been a great triumph of inclusion: many more Americans can realistically demand equal treatment in the workplace. But by itself, civil rights law does little to address the widening gap between the oligarchs, the minority of privileged symbol-users, and the broad middle class in this country.</p>
<p>If progressives don’t confront these gaps, conservatives will continue to exploit middle class anxieties to create a backlash against a welfare state that seeks to help the bottom fifth of Americans sustain a minimal economic livelihood. There is a big hole here in our vision of economic citizenship, and Anne Alstott and I try to fill it in <italic>The Stakeholder Society</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0032329213483103">9</xref></sup> Our idea is simple: as a birthright of citizenship, each American should be guaranteed a stake of $80,000 as he or she confronts the challenges of life as a young adult.</p>
<p>This stake will allow the typical college graduate to start off life without a crippling debt burden. The initiative will yield even greater gains for the seven out of ten Americans who never gain the economic autonomy that a four-year degree provides. An $80,000 nest-egg will provide average Americans with a rough-and-ready sense of economic independence, permitting them to confront the labor market with their heads held high.</p>
<p>Stakeholding creates a new institution—citizenship inheritance—to compete with traditional family inheritance. In contrast to right-wing efforts to eliminate the “death tax” on the rich and super-rich, the citizenship agenda offers a more democratic vision. The nation’s wealth, after all, is the product of generations of work by all Americans—the police officer on the beat, the teacher in the school, no less than the financial wizards on Wall Street. Stakeholding recognizes this basic point by granting all citizens a share of the nation’s wealth as they start out in life, when they need it most.</p>
<p>Before they can claim their $80,000, Americans will have to complete high school. The fifteen percent who drop out will only receive the interest on their stake, not the principal. But for the rest, there will be no strings attached. For the first time in a long time, ordinary Americans will have a real taste of economic freedom.</p>
<p>Some might throw away their $80,000 on frivolities. But the abuse of freedom by a few should not deprive the vast majority of a genuine opportunity to shape their lives while they are young. Today most men and women in their early twenties live lives of quiet desperation. While average American unemployment in 2010 was 9.6 percent, it was 15.5 percent for those ages 20-24 who weren’t in school. Astonishingly, people in their early twenties face an unemployment rate similar to high-school dropouts.</p>
<p>Here is where stakeholding makes its special contribution. Eighty thousand dollars would keep some in college who would otherwise drop out, and send others to college who can’t afford it today. Others will decide that university isn’t for them, and will use their $80,000 to gain technical education, pay off debt, buy a house, or otherwise gain a stable foothold in adult life. Since they must complete high school to gain full control over their citizenship inheritance, young Americans will have a powerful incentive against dropping out. The overwhelming majority of Americans will enter adult life with their heads held high, with the right to a fair starting point in economic life.</p>
<p>All this comes with a new tax, but one that gets to the heart of the problem, hitting only Americans in the 3 percent at the top of the wealth distribution. About three and a half million Americans would qualify for stakeholding each year. Based on data reflecting the impact of the current recession, we estimate that $80,000 stakes can be funded by an annual wealth tax of two percent on households with assets above 1.5 million dollars. This estimate assumes a 28 percent tax evasion rate; if the economic elite prove to be more responsible, their tax rate would be lower.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0032329213483103">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Will the rising generatcs to the table, or will they content themselves with rehashing noble-but-tired variations on twentieth-century themes?</p>
<p>The year is 2030. Citizens have voted with their patriot dollars; they have debated stakeholding at Deliberation Day, and considered it further through the vibrant journalism established under the National Endowment for Journalism, before they provide an electoral mandate to progressive candidates to guarantee every citizen a substantial stake when starting out in life.</p>
<p>Or maybe they will come up with a more attractive and effective citizenship agenda that makes sense of twenty-first century aspirations.</p>

<p>My report on job losses in journalism is derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which changed its reporting categories in 2004. Before then, it aggregated journalists working in newspapers and broadcast news into a single group. More recently it has treated “broadcast news analysts” and “reporters and correspondents” separately. My own figure for 2009 adds the two categories together, to permit comparison with the 2000 report.
