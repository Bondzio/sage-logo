<abstract>
<p>Place is central to many research projects in the social sciences, but it is often taken by researchers as a given. Recently, discourse analysts have devoted more attention to the construction of place in interaction. We focus on one aspect of this construction, the process of drawing inferences from place categories and place names, in transcripts of oral history interviews. We apply membership categorization analysis (MCA) to descriptions of house types and houses, showing how some categories are presented as being shared and recognizable, and how inferences are projected. Then we apply a similar approach to the ways inferences are drawn from place names, focusing especially on proximity. Participants’ categories can be investigated by examining the ways they are used in question–answer pairs, and in the construction of turns using elaborations, contrasting pairs, negatives and qualifications. This analysis shows the work these place references do for the participants, for instance, in categorizing themselves and others and giving accounts for behaviour.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s been an amazing journey coming from a council house in Rhyl to suddenly owning a Jaguar but I hope it continues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445613480589">Rogers, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jade Jones, the Olympic Taekwondo Gold Medallist, describes her success in terms of going from a council house to a Jaguar. What is she doing with these references? We might invoke shared cultural knowledge of council houses, Rhyl or Jaguars, and the people and activities associated with them. But that will not tell us how Jade Jones is using them here, in relation to each other, in a newspaper interview, in a construction in which she has gone from one (council house) to another (Jaguar).</p>
<p>This article is about how we as analysts can interpret the work people might do by describing or naming a place. We are interested in what inferences participants draw in a question and answer sequence, not in a press celebrity interview like this one, but in research interviews. The leap from a category (‘council house’) or place name (‘Rhyl’) to some inference about people is not usually explicated, in everyday conversation, in this institutional genre of social research interviews or in researchers’ analyses of those interviews. We argue that place references are used by participants in the flow of questions and answers in a way that allows for inferences to be made. By focusing on how place references are used, we hope to contribute to an on-going body of work arguing that conversational use of categories is systematic, that these categories do not proliferate into unconstrained lists, and that they can be investigated in a rigorous way without resorting at the start to analysts’ taken-for-granted cultural knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445613480589">Housley and Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445613480589">Stokoe, 2012</xref>). We argue that reflexive social science researchers in any discipline should attend to these categorization and inference-making processes as part of their analysis of interview transcripts.</p>
<p>Why focus on place among all the categories of people, schools, jobs and possessions (such as cars) that people use in conversation? Place is central to much of social science research, in linguistics but also in other disciplines. However, the categories applied are usually those of the researchers. Even in the richer and more reflexive approach of ethnographic case studies, places may be chosen and labelled, comparisons made, wider conclusions drawn, based on the researcher’s own geographical categories; for instance, what they know about the likely attributes of residents of council houses, a kind of publicly owned housing in the United Kingdom, or about Rhyl, a resort on the North Wales coast. That is, researchers do just what readers of the newspaper article about Jade Jones would do, and what Jade Jones herself encourages them to do. We argue that researchers should attend first to the ways places are constructed by different participants in interaction and within the constraints of the research interview genre. We draw out data from a large, publicly available archive of social science interviews so that we can show the approach is useful to social scientists across a range of disciplines (we will discuss some of the issues of transcription in our methods section). Researchers in the social sciences would benefit from attending to the turn constructions and inference-making procedures used by participants, and the categories and names used in these procedures, to understand how interviews produce places, and the role of places in the course of interactions.</p>

<title>Place, discourse and categorization</title>
<p>A great deal of work has been done on the relation between discourse and place. Much of it is concerned with space as the setting for an utterance, and location as a problem in communication. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445613480589">Levinson (2003</xref>: 65–68), in a cross-linguistic comparison of spatial frames, treats the sorts of reference that concerns us in a short section on location without frames of reference, including dexis, toponymy (place names) and topology (coincidence, such as being near or in). But in our data, participants are concerned less with problems of locating a place than with what that place means in terms of the current question. They do use such prepositional phrases as ‘round the corner’ or ‘up the road’, but their concern is not to help their interlocutor find the place, but to say something about their lives there. In a review that comes closer to our concerns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445613480589">Van Dijk (2008</xref>: 45–60) distinguishes personal space (e.g. the conventional distance between interlocutors), social space (such as homes and workplaces) and geographical space (on a scale from home and neighbourhood to county and continent). Van Dijk notes that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Places (and their typical activities) may be categorized as (more or less) private or public, open or closed, and we may add such scalar properties as intimate vs distance, free vs paying, nature vs built, warm vs cold, big vs small, and so on. Indeed, in order to be able to organize our interactions, places need to be visible, known, and accessible (for at least some users). That is, people not only define where they are in the three ways indicated above [personal space, social space, geographical space], but also how they feel about such places. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445613480589">2008</xref>: 53)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants in our data are largely concerned with the representation of social space, the way places are categorized as a cue for inferences about people and their actions. There is a rich body of studies on the use of place names within specific cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613480589">Abell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480589">Basso, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480589">Dixon and Durrheim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445613480589">Modan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445613480589">Nevins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445613480589">Pred, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445613480589">Schiffrin, 2009</xref>); they are reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445613480589">Myers and Lampropoulou (forthcoming)</xref>. The examples discussed here have a much more limited range of functions, for instance showing proximity or distance.</p>
<p>While we draw on research that is concerned with place and space in cultural knowledge, we are particularly concerned with the ways categories and locations are evoked and used. To study these processes, we follow a line of conversation analysis (CA) and membership categorization analysis (MCA) researchers on place.</p>
<p>MCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445613480589">Coulter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445613480589">Hester and Eglin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445613480589">Housley and Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445613480589">Jayussi, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445613480589">Stokoe, 2012</xref>) is primarily concerned with the categorization of persons, but it can give us insights into the ways in which inferences can be drawn in conversation, so we will briefly introduce that approach before going on to work specifically on place. In his <italic>Lectures on Conversation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445613480589">1992</xref>), Sacks explored both the structures of sequential development that have since become conversation analysis, and the ‘membership categories’, the ‘classifications or social types that may be used to describe persons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445613480589">Hester and Eglin, 1997</xref>: 3). Sacks showed how listeners and viewers make and display inferences about possible attributes and actions based on shared sets of categories, as in the story he returns to again and again: ‘The baby cried. The mommy picked it up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445613480589">1992</xref>: 235). Why do hearers assume that it is the baby’s mommy who picked it up, and that the mommy picked the baby up because it was crying? He proposed two rules for the ways that proposed categories would be treated in conversation, the economy rule and the consistency rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445613480589">Hester and Eglin, 1997</xref>: 4). The economy rule, in negative form, is that ‘it is not necessary that some multiple categories from categorization devices be employed for recognition, that a person is being referred to, to be made; a single category will do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445613480589">Sacks, 1992</xref>: 246; original lecture 1966). Typically, participants make a choice about which classificatory set, or membership categorization device (MCD), is relevant to the current conversation – here, that she is a mommy. The consistency rule is that ‘if a category from some device’s collection has been used to categorize a first Member of a population, then that category or other categories from the same collection <italic>may</italic> be used to categorize further Members of the population’ (p. 246). That is the rule that links the baby (first member) to the mommy (further member). Members may have ‘category-bound activities’ actions expected of people because they are in that class (later extended to ‘category-bound predicates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461445613480589">Watson, 1978</xref>), which can cover a wider range of attributes). MCA has been controversial, with some arguing that it provides a way for analysts to smuggle in their own categories instead of finding them in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445613480589">Schegloff, 2007</xref>; for a critical response, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445613480589">Carlin, 2010</xref>), leading to an uncontrolled proliferation of categories rather than an analytical system. Practitioners have responded that MCA can provide a rigorous system for investigating category-bound predicates, what is shared but not made explicit when a category is invoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445613480589">Stokoe, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>One issue in these analyses is the researchers’ use of their own cultural knowledge as the basis for explaining categories used by participants. Benson and Hughes, in an early introduction to ethnomethodology, pointed out the problem with using cultural knowledge as an explanation:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the consequences of the ethnomethodological programme is the requirement to suspend the idea of an overarching culture of shared expectations and mutual understanding as a method of accounting for action. Instead it asks that we demonstrate how mutual understanding and shared expectations are achieved through work done by members. In this respect, the member, too, is an investigator of his or her culture and is, moreover, equipped with the methods for doing so. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613480589">Benson and Hughes, 1983</xref>: 147)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this perspective, it is not enough to say that we know as members of the culture that, for instance, council houses are associated with working-class people; the analyst would have to show how participants are using the reference to ‘council house’ here. In this article, we argue for attention to the ways participants make categories available to other participants, for instance in accounts, in the process making it possible for the analyst to interpret them.</p>
<p>For our research on place references, research in CA and MCA has provided insights into:</p>
<list id="list1-1461445613480589" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>the ways place references are designed for an audience in a specific situation (Harvey Sacks);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the ways participants negotiate the right choices of reference for a given purpose and genre (Emanuel Schegloff);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>tools for tracing the processes of displaying, checking and rejecting inferences from place references from one turn to the next (Paul Drew);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how inferences about categories of places are similar to and different from those concerning categories of people, and how place references are based on ‘commonsense geography’ (Alec McHoul and Rod Watson);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the use of ‘mundane reason’ as a basis for inference-making in interviews (William Housley and Robert James Smith).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The central insight from both approaches is the insistence on the way place references are designed for an audience and a particular situation. Harvey Sacks frequently deals with place references in his <italic>Lectures on Conversation</italic> (1992, lectures delivered 1964–1972), often returning to the opening of a story: ‘Ruth Henderson and I drove down to Ventura yesterday’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445613480589">Sacks, 1992</xref>: 13). His particular concern is the way locating a story works it up, makes it tellable by relating it to the local, and signals to the audience that this story is designed for them, people who share the same sense of the local. In the interviews we studied, place references are also designed for the recipient, but since they are strangers, they sometimes have to work out just what references they have in common.</p>
<p>Emanuel Schegloff, in one of his earlier papers (‘Formulating place’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445613480589">1972</xref>), makes a point that is crucial to our study – that all place references involve choices:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ‘problem’ of locational formulation is this: For any location to which reference is made, there is a set of terms each of which, by a correspondence test, is a correct way to refer to it. On any actual occasion of use, however, not any member of the set is ‘right’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445613480589">1972</xref>: 81)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A ‘correct’ formulation would be any of the many references that pick out the same place. By ‘right’ here, Schegloff means that the formulation works for the participants, in the ongoing interaction, in a way other formulations would not. Schegloff makes a distinction between geographical references, locating a place as if seen objectively on a map (‘east of Lancaster’) and relational references, which depend on members’ knowledge and situation (‘on the one-way system, turn left at the Town Hall’). And he notes that for any place, there is a scale of possible ways of referring to it, for instance in terms of house address, neighbourhood, town or region. He shows in his study how participants work out the ‘right’ form of reference in calls to an emergency helpline. In the case Schegloff studied (as in the related studies of direction-giving by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445613480589">Psathas, 1979</xref>), the issue is location; the responses of the helpline operators show how a formulation does or does not work, and the ‘right’ form is that which gets the fire engine to the door. But the same structure of choice and possible negotiation applies to talk in which the ‘right’ form is that which qualifies as a satisfactory answer to an interview question, or conveys a desired identity, stance or relation to the interviewer.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480589">Paul Drew’s (1978)</xref> analysis of a transcript from the Scarman Tribunal on violence in Northern Ireland provides a model for understanding how participants can display the meanings places have for them in a particular interaction. The data concern the cross-examination of a witness in which the lawyer reads out events from the station log and then formulates them in terms of religious groups:
<disp-quote>
<p>1. C: So there you have ‘Fighting in Percy Street – crowd out of control’, ‘Crowd coming down Conway Street from Shankhill Road’ and ‘Crowd on Donegal Road from Sandy Row’.</p>
<p>2. W: Yes.</p>
<p>3. C: All indicative of an invasion of Catholic areas by Protestants?</p>
<p>4. W: I would say incensed at the shooting that was taking place – scared.</p>
<p>5. C: You say the crowd was coming down there incensed and scared?</p>
<p>6. W: Which crowd are you referring to?</p>
<p>7. C: The Protestant crowd. Is that the crowd you are referring to?</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480589">1978</xref>: 1–2, turns renumbered)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One way to approach these data would be to say that people who know Belfast have a shared cultural knowledge of the ‘religious geography’ of the town that enables them to categorize people based on address, and that if the self-reflexive analyst shares this knowledge, they can make the correct inferences from the transcript. Drew is interested instead in how the participants make inferences from place names and use them in interaction, so the knowledge of religious geography is not out there in the culture, but is recreated here in this interaction, and in any interaction. His approach is through analysis of the sequential turns. Formulations such as that in turn 3 make explicit one interpretation of these place names that he wants to use. And in the longer data extract, it is clear that all these questions and formulations are leading up to an accusation that policing of the ‘Protestant crowd’ was lax. We know about formulations in conversation and about responses to accusations, so we can see how place names function in these sequential structures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480589">Alec McHoul and Rod Watson (1984)</xref> contribute to our analytical toolkit a critical description of how meanings are assembled in one genre, the classroom. They explore possibilities of extending MCA from persons to places. They demonstrate how, in discussions in a geography classroom about urban planning, courthouses, the fire station and the university can be categorized in the MCD of public buildings, with a possible Category Bound Activity of their location in the Central Business District. But they point out a number of reasons, methodological and philosophical, why this extension is problematic. The most important, for our purposes, concerns the kind of predicate that can be attributed; citing Schegloff, they note that ‘there appear to be quite distinct and MCD-independent ways by which place-references are organized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480589">McHoul and Watson, 1984</xref>: 290). Since it is harder to show how geographical categories can be built only with MCDs, they explore a more general axis of ‘commonsense geography’ in which participants draw on various kinds of shared and taken-for-granted knowledge to make place references. They also point out the relevance of topic continuity in making use of this knowledge. Their article then shows how the intervention of the teacher shapes this commonsense geography into the formal geographical knowledge of the classroom.</p>
<p>In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445613480589">William Housley and Robin James Smith (2011)</xref> look at the application of ‘mundane reason’ in interviewees’ uses of different categorization systems in participants’ talk about the redevelopment of the former docklands of Cardiff Bay into retail, entertainment and civic sites. Their work is of particular relevance to our study because their data come from research interviews, as ours do. Interviews are problematic partly because they lack the topic continuity that is a key part of the analyses by Drew and by McHoul and Watson; the interviewer can shift topic at any turn without giving any reason or link. So we often miss the third-turn evidence of how an interviewee’s categorization is related back to the question. Their analysis shows how participants use such MCDs as ‘suitable building’, and references to immediately visible buildings, along with contrast structures, in developing arguments about, for instance, the location of a public building.</p>
<p>We find in the MCA literature a rich resource for describing how a given description or place name is used in a specific interactional context and genre to generate inferences and maintain topic continuity.</p>

<title>Data and methods</title>
<p>We aim to contribute to studies of membership categorization, but we also aim to persuade social scientists to attend to these aspects of interaction when interpreting their own interviews. We believe that it is important to be able to make some points using the kinds of transcripts they produce and recognize, rather than re-transcribed materials that would require them to do many hours of further work. Our data are interview transcripts from the Qualidata Archive, a repository for qualitative data from UK social research projects (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esds.ac.uk/qualidata">http://www.esds.ac.uk/qualidata</ext-link> for more information) that is specifically intended to allow secondary analyses such as this one. We looked at 10 projects, but to avoid having to give too much background, the examples in this article are all from one: Paul Thompson’s ‘One Hundred Families’ (Qualidata Project Number 4938), a classic oral history project of the 1980s (on the original researcher’s own methodology, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461445613480589">Thompson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461445613480589">2000</xref>). The 10 interviews from this project contain 255,762 words. In another article we report overall patterns of place vocabulary in the whole corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445613480589">Myers and Lampropoulou, forthcoming</xref>). Geographical names occur throughout this particular project, from the first questions about where grandparents and parents were born. Sometimes responses are in terms of the names of large cities, counties or regions that might be assumed to be part of the common knowledge of British residents. But often participants refer to local streets or neighbourhoods. The transcription of local names is sometimes problematic; it took us a while to realize that a town transcribed as ‘Nelsey’, spoken of by an interviewee in Bristol, must be Nailsea. In some but not all transcripts place names are deleted, but the fact of a reference to place, and the kind of reference made, remains.</p>
<p>This source has the advantage that we can look at a wide range of interviews, with different interviewing styles and aims, using exactly the same kind of data as sociologists, political scientists and geographers themselves. But it puts two potential constraints on our analysis. One is to do with the limited information: we have to use the transcriptions as they are. Sound files and more detailed transcription would enable us to look, for instance, at whether a reformulated place description followed a non-response on the part of the interviewer, or was a self-interruption. But the transcripts we have are detailed enough for analysis of the descriptions, categories and names and the grammar of turns.</p>
<p>The other constraint has to do with the genre of the research interview itself. The interviews consist of questions and answers, and the interviewee is usually asked to provide information, so there is not the highly charged context of accusation and denial that underpinned the example in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480589">Drew (1978)</xref> or the teacher-driven classroom discussion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480589">McHoul and Watson (1984)</xref>. There are few third-turn responses that would enable us to see what the interviewer does with the place reference in the way that Drew could use the lawyer’s formulations and the witness’s responses to them, or in the way that conversational storytellers in Sacks’s lectures use place references to work up story materials. ‘Tellability’ is not an issue for an interviewee when the interviewer has asked a question. We argue that a question can project certain kinds of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445613480589">Lampropoulou and Myers, 2012</xref>) and that participants interpret place references in terms of these projected topics, and in terms of the packaging of a turn by the interviewer or interviewee.</p>
<p>We used Atlas-ti software to code a wide range of place references in the interview transcripts. The test for what these place references do in context is in the interaction that precedes and follows them. There is no standard procedure for MCA, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445613480589">Elizabeth Stokoe (2012)</xref> has provided a useful outline of the basics, with commentaries by other researchers. We were particularly interested in how some descriptions of houses treat them as specific instances of a more general category (e.g. ‘council house’). Categories are typically part of multiple categorization devices, and participants cue which one is being applied. Place categories have possible predicates, and belong to multiple possible categorization devices. Place names can also be interpreted in relation to different kinds of categorizations and actions; in our examples in this article we focus on inferences from proximity. We access the inferences being made by participants by two methods: 1) sequence, the way the turn responds to the previous turn or projects the next one, and 2) turn packaging, especially elaboration, qualification, contrast and negation, in a way that projects and deals with possible inferences. From these inferences, we moved to the kinds of conversational work being done. In the first instance, this work is asking and answering interview questions appropriately.</p>

<title>Place descriptions and categories</title>
<p>In these oral history interviews, participants were often asked about houses where they or other family members had lived. There is no sign that participants treat this as a strange request. As we saw in the Jade Jones example (‘a council house in Rhyl’), people sometimes talk about the kind of house in which they grew up, perhaps as shorthand for their social categories and the changes over the course of their life, or as a reason for having or not having some experience or performing some action. Surprisingly, there is no fixed typology for everyday house descriptions; the interviews provide an apparent jumble of different terms and categorization principles: in Britain the terms might include bungalow, terraced house, council house, semi-detached. But participants assume that there is a set of house types that anyone in the culture, even this stranger, the interviewer, will recognize; as we will see, these terms are culture-specific, so they might not have different associations even in different parts of Britain.</p>
<p>One way to understand how these categories are used is to look at the way a category is modified before or after it is named, by elaboration, contrast, negation or qualification. In Example 1, several kinds of house are named (‘council house’, ‘Coronation Street type’ and ‘lodgings’). The interviewee presents these categories as already familiar to the interviewer, but then works to correct and refine the image he assumes is in the interviewer’s mind.</p>
<p>Example 1</p>
<p>1. Interviewer: Can you describe the house and neighbourhood that you grew up in?</p>
<p>2. Subject:  a) It was a council house.</p>
<p>   b) I wasn’t born in that,</p>
<p>   c) I was born in a typical,</p>
<p>   d) well not really typical, no, not like the Coronation Street type.</p>
<p>   e) But that type of a house.</p>
<p>   f) But the back was overlooking fields.</p>
<p>   g) I believe I was 13 months old when my mother got that.</p>
<p>   h) She lived then with my Auntie Edith,</p>
<p>   i) she lived in lodgings with her,</p>
<p>   j) and she’d had John and she’d lost those two babies,</p>
<p>   k) it’s on the tape,</p>
<p>   l) and then she had me.</p>
<p>   m) She was still in lodgings</p>
<p>   n) and she got this council house.</p>
<p>   o) And that was on a council estate,</p>
<p>   p) it was just a two bedroomed,</p>
<p>   q) but it had bathroom and separate toilet.</p>
<p>   r) Big living room and a big kitchen.</p>
<p>   s) Gardens back and front.</p>
<p>   t) Quite nice actually, for –</p>
<p>   u) I’m talking now about 1928 onwards –</p>
<p>   v) so actually it was nice.</p>
<p>   w) She was the first tenant in,</p>
<p>   x) it was brand new when she went in it.</p>
<p>3. Interviewer: Did you say it had a bathroom?</p>
<p>4. Subject:  a) Yes, oh yes.</p>
<p>   b) I was never without a bathroom.</p>
<p>   c) Until I got my first house,</p>
<p>   d) then I went to one without a bathroom then.</p>
<p>   e) Never had gaslight,</p>
<p>   f) I never lived in a house with gaslight. (Int. 006)</p>
<p>In conversation, people usually give a description for a reason, for instance, as background to a story or as a basis for and argument. Here, he is giving it because he was asked for a description (a), and he starts by naming a category that is presented as a sufficient answer in itself, ‘a council house’. This is nominally a category of ownership (houses built by local government councils in the 20th century to rent as public housing). The houses described this way vary widely; they can be terraced or semi-detached, brick or pebble-dashed, and can date from the interwar years or 1945–1990, but it is the associative meanings, not the literal reference, that are at issue here.</p>
<p>Readers of this article may not have these associative meanings as part of their cultural knowledge, and may have quite different categories of housing in their own culture. But they can see from the transcript how participants present these meanings to each other, assuming that they share some assumptions about life in council houses, and in lodgings and other classes of house. The interviewee elaborates, correcting himself twice. The first time (b) he offers an alternative answer to the question – where he was born rather than where he grew up. Then he interrupts himself, saying ‘I was born in a typical’ before he gives the noun, a typical what. The second correction orients to the possible inferences that could be drawn from this category, or just from the description as ‘typical’ (d), before going on to say what it is not: ‘the Coronation Street type’. This allusion refers to the houses in a long-running television soap opera, set in a fictional northern town (and filmed on a set in Manchester), where one side of the street is two-storey brick terraced houses, of the kind built in the 19th century by private landlords to house mill workers. But of course he does not need to say all this; he assumes that the interviewer will recognize this type without further description, and that this type will have certain attributes, so he can then go on to the ways in which his house was <italic>not</italic> like this type. And the way in which it was not like this type was that ‘the back was overlooking fields’ (f). He does not correct any other attributes that this type might have (building materials, presence of a garden) or other associations, positive or negative, that the interviewer might have with ‘the Coronation Street type’; he addresses the possible inference that it would not be overlooking fields, it would be on a dense network of urban streets.</p>
<p>In lines (m) and (n), the interviewee develops a contrast pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613480589">Baker, 2004</xref>) between ‘lodgings’ and ‘this council house’. The connection between the births and the mother moving out of shared accommodation is left implicit. Again, he is doing complicated unpicking of the category-bound attributes of this category, ‘council house’. First, he applies a categorization device in which number of bedrooms stands for the size of the accommodation (p). (We have found no descriptions in our data that suggest size in terms of area, as estate agents do.) When he qualifies it as ‘<italic>just</italic> a two bedroomed’, he suggests this is to be taken as small. (We will see in other examples that ‘just’, here in its depreciatory sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445613480589">Lee, 1991</xref>) is a crucial adverb in modifying a description.) Then he categorizes in terms of its plumbing, also a common device in these descriptions (q). He suggests with ‘but’ that the impression given by the number of rooms is in opposition to the impression given by the bathroom and the ‘Big living room and a big kitchen’ (r). This is marked as potentially a favourable description, but apparently it is not obvious it is favourable, because he says ‘quite nice actually, for –’, the ‘actually’ suggesting a contrast between what these categorizations suggest at the time of his speaking (1985) and what they would have suggested then: ‘I’m talking about 1928 onwards’. So we have again a concern to check that the inferences drawn by the interviewer on the basis of the categorizations offered are correct. The coda to the story (w–x) goes back to the contrast between lodgings with others and the new council house with her own family: ‘She was the first tenant in’. So instead of presenting a council house as it might be in other contexts, a sign of a working-class background, or of poverty, or crowding, he presents it in terms of the meanings it had for his mother then.</p>
<p>The interviewer ignores this carefully developed and layered description, and picks up one attribute of this category, the presence of a bathroom (q). A bathroom is not just another room; that is clear from the way the interviewee responds in 4, emphatically (repetition in a) and absolutely (‘never’ in b). The meaning of a bathroom is developed by its parallel relation with light sources: he once had a house without a bathroom (b), but he never had a house with gaslight (e). These are two separate systems of the home, plumbing and lighting, but here they are presented as being the same sort of predicate about a house, since for him both an internal bathroom and electric light are signs of something. The various descriptions of house types used in talk, and in interviews, do not fit together into one logical taxonomy. ‘Council house’ and ‘Coronation Street type’ are both highly evocative descriptions of small working-class dwellings, but they are from different categorization devices, in terms of ownership and in terms of period and appearance, and the interviewee offers other devices, in terms of number of rooms, plumbing and lighting. Here there is no simple mapping of categories of houses onto categories of people – that potential mapping is what the interviewee carefully complicates with his elaborations. The same description can do different work depending on what question it answers, on how it is taken up by the interviewer and on the context of evaluation (here, 1928 versus 1985).</p>
<p>The categorization of a house does not determine which of its attributes are relevant in this interaction, but we can see how the participants shape inferences in, for instance, contrasts. In Example 2, the same interviewee as in Example 1 is talking later in the interview about his mother’s stay in hospital and then in a residential home for the elderly. The interviewer uses the word <italic>home</italic> in contrast to the hospital. Then the interviewee develops a different contrast pair between two possible places that could be called home.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>1. Interviewer: Did she want to go home?</p>
<p>2. Subject:  a) Well, home to her isn’t her bungalow.</p>
<p>   b) It’s the house that’s been pulled down.</p>
<p>   c) And this is what the hospital can’t understand.</p>
<p>   d) It’s difficult to get through.</p>
<p>   e) Her mind’s wandering,</p>
<p>   f) She’s, as far as she’s concerned her home is this terraced house that’s been pulled down.</p>
<p>   g) She didn’t see it come down.</p>
<p>   h) So to her mind it’s still stood there.</p>
<p>   i) That is her home.</p>
<p>   j) Not the bungalow she lived in.</p>
<p>   k) So when she tells ’em at the hospital –</p>
<p>   l) I want to go home,</p>
<p>   m) take me home,</p>
<p>   n) I’m going home.</p>
<p>   o) It isn’t her bungalow,</p>
<p>   p) It’s her terraced house she’s going to – in her mind. (Int. 006)</p>
<p>The ‘Well’ (2a), typically a marker of a dispreferred response, suggests the speaker is presenting a different kind of answer from that projected in the question. The interviewee offers two contrasting categories of home. He does not draw on any of the features of a literal definition of a ‘bungalow’ or a ‘terrace’. For instance, the word <italic>bungalow</italic> can refer to a fairly specific sort of house, probably detached and small with one storey, and large windows. One might say someone moved into a bungalow after an illness, and expect it to be understood that a bungalow does not have internal stairs. Here the relevant contrast is between ‘her bungalow’ (a) and ‘the house that’s been pulled down’ (b). The second time, it is ‘this terraced house’ (f), the demonstrative <italic>this</italic> rather than <italic>the</italic> suggesting affective closeness (compare ‘this council house’ in Example 1). ‘So’ in (k) suggests that what follows is an upshot from the description he has given. Finally he repeats the contrast between ‘her bungalow’ (o) and ‘her terraced house’ (p), closing his story with a coda that this contrast is ‘in her mind’, since one of the houses was pulled down. He makes this contrast three times without giving any further description of these types, or drawing out any of the category-bound predicates that might be relevant in other contexts (such as the crowded community or central location of the terraced houses, or the isolation and relative modernity and comfort of a bungalow). These categories represent for present purposes two periods of her life. The focus in this contrast is not on how it categorizes her in terms of social class (as it might in a different context), but on how it dramatizes her situation as an elderly patient. Meanwhile her own perspective is given with reported speech (l–n) that doesn’t refer to the bungalow versus terrace contrast he has developed, but uses the contrast introduced implicitly by the interviewer, home versus hospital.</p>
<p>In a classic paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445613480589">Linde and Labov (1975)</xref> showed how their interviewees described their New York flats in terms of a tour rather than a plan, and that is consistent with descriptions in our data. But interviewees seem reluctant to give a straightforward description of the house, even when prompted to do so, and indeed, it is hard to think of a conversational situation in which one might be asked for a plan, apart from an interview, or perhaps as a setting for a story.</p>
<p>Example 3</p>
<p>1. Interviewer: Can you describe your home?</p>
<p>2. Subject:  a) It was just a big block of flats,</p>
<p>   b) and everyone had big families,</p>
<p>   c) everyone knew everybody.</p>
<p>   d) The door was never shut.</p>
<p>3. Interviewer: How many rooms were there? Can you describe the layout of it?</p>
<p>4. Subject:  a) Amazingly enough,</p>
<p>   b) we had three bedrooms and a living room and a tiny little kitchen,</p>
<p>   c) and a bathroom and toilet,</p>
<p>   d) and a passageway.</p>
<p>   e) How we all got in there I’ll never know.</p>
<p>5. Interviewer: How did you manage, you shared bedrooms? (Int. 017)</p>
<p>In turn 2, the interviewee responds with ‘just a big block of flats’, another depreciatory ‘just’, here suggesting that no further description is necessary. Instead she stresses what is for her the salient feature of this place, or any block of flats, with three statements of how people lived there, each formulated in extreme terms (‘everyone’, ‘everyone’, ‘never’). In turn 3, the interviewer prompts her for the number of rooms and the ‘layout’. The interviewee still does not describe the flat in these terms; instead she starts with ‘amazingly enough’, orienting to a problem that is implied in the question about how many rooms. She lists (b–d) every bit of the space (including the passageway), with the phrase ‘a tiny little kitchen’, and a rhetorical question focusing on the point she wants to make about living there, that it was very small (e). The interviewer responds to the rhetorical question emphasizing the crowding (b) with a practical question about just how eight people fit in three rooms.</p>
<p>There is frequently a mismatch between the ways interviewers talk about houses and the ways interviewees talk. To use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445613480589">Ingold’s (2000)</xref> terminology, interviewees describe houses as dwellings, not buildings, or in other terms, as they are lived in, not as they appear. And the daily events of living can bring out all sorts of features as salient: plumbing, number of rooms, doors or view. In all these examples, 1–3, categories of houses are offered as already known, shared with the interviewer, and having predicates that can be the basis for inferences about what people did and did not do in these spaces and what the places meant for them.</p>

<sec id="section5-1461445613480589">
<title>Place names and accounts</title>
<p>Place names are not necessarily used as categories, but they can be used in ways that parallel the uses of categories of houses we have been discussing, in that they allow the participants to draw inferences relevant to the immediate exchange of questions and answers. In Example 4, the interviewee names two places and then uses them in an account.</p>
<p>Example 4</p>
<p>1. Interviewer: How often do you see your daughter?</p>
<p>2. Subject:  a) Well, she lived at Nelsey [Nailsea],</p>
<p>   b) which was only about eight miles away, you see, until recently</p>
<p>   c) and then she moved up to Milton Keynes.</p>
<p>   d) So, I don’t see much of her. (Int. 019)</p>
<p>The ‘Well’ suggests a dispreferred response, because he is not immediately saying ‘how often’, but starting by naming a place. That place is then made the basis for an explanation of why he saw her more before. His adding the information in (b) suggests the researchers would not recognize the place, and his ‘only’ cues the interpretation that what is relevant here is proximity. The ‘you see’ suggests that the interviewer will be able to make the correct inference from this distance; the interviewee does not actually spell out the category-bound action that if a father and daughter live eight miles apart, they will see each other. Then he sets up a contrast pair between Nailsea and Milton Keynes (c). He doesn’t say where Milton Keynes is, but assumes the interviewer knows, and knows also that it is far – for these purposes – from Bristol. ‘So’ in (d) marks an inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445613480589">Fraser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445613480589">Schiffrin, 1987</xref>) that can be drawn from the knowledge that she moved to Milton Keynes: ‘I don’t see much of her’. There is an asymmetry in presentation of the two parts of the contrast pair; in the first part, we are given geographical information, but not the inference, and in the second we are given the inference, but not the geographical information. The two together present the issue of contact, or lack of, with his daughter as <italic>only</italic> a matter of geography.</p>
<p>We can see an inference can be drawn from a geographical reference when a speaker cancels it. In Example 5, the interviewee, a university student living at home with his mother, has had a long turn about the possibility of moving out with his brother David, and has given several reasons for moving, without naming any particular place. Let us start before the question in turn 4, to show how the previous turns set up the possible inferences made from the geographical information</p>
<p>Example 5</p>
<p>1. Subject:  a) . . . And I’m starting work in July.</p>
<p>   b) David wouldn’t mind getting a house.</p>
<p>   c) I think its all lots of different reasons.</p>
<p>   d) Let’s go and get a house.</p>
<p>2. Interviewer:  Have you actually got one then? </p>
<p>3. Subject:  a) One lined up,</p>
<p>   b) it’s waiting for the survey.</p>
<p>4. Interviewer:  Whereabouts is that?</p>
<p>5. Subject:  a) [Missing word] Road,</p>
<p>   b) just round the corner,</p>
<p>   c) five minutes away.</p>
<p>6. Interviewer:  So how often do you think you’ll come back then?</p>
<p>7. Subject:  Christmas.</p>
<p>8. Interviewer:  Is that all?</p>
<p>9. Subject:  And birthdays. Yes, I - I would - the only reason I came back before when I went away is that I used to get all my washing done . . . (Int. 015)</p>
<p>In 1, the place they are looking for is just ‘a house’ (1b, 1d) with no specification of locality; the point is that it is ‘a house’ rather than ‘this house’ in which he is speaking. From such a formulation, the plan could be hypothetical; in turn 2 the interviewer checks whether they are ‘actually’ proceeding to get one. In 3, the interviewee demonstrates his seriousness in terms of the stage of the purchase process (in England, the survey is done after a formal offer has been made but before the completion). The question in 4 could have all sorts of responses, for instance naming a neighbourhood or direction, but the interviewee hears it as a question about proximity. He names a road, and then, since the interviewee cannot be expected to know it, locates it; ‘round the corner’ presents it as near, and the ‘just’ emphasizes this nearness. Then he reinforces the proximity by reformulating this as ‘five minutes away’ (5c). The interviewer picks up one possible implication of this proximity (6). They start with ‘So’, a discourse marker that typically introduces inferences about other-sensitive topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445613480589">Bolden, 2006</xref>). The interviewer, by showing they recognize this particular inference as relevant, displays their involvement with the interviewee.</p>
<p>In Example 4, we saw inferences drawn from a parental relationship: if adult children are nearby, they will visit. Here, the interviewee’s one-word response both suggests there was such a possible inference and cancels it, without elaboration. We know that the inference was indeed possible here because the interviewer pursues it in a question in 8 that formulates it as surprising. The interviewee’s response in 9 confirms that that was ‘all’ by adding only the minimal possibility of other visits, and then by elaborating that when he has lived away, his only visits were for a purpose other than seeing his mother. Both participants in this exchange are orienting to the inferences that can be drawn from a geographical reference when the MCD of family has been invoked.</p>
<p>If the interviewee in Example 5 had named a neighbourhood, that could have led to a different set of inferences. Place names can, of course, be used in claims to place identity; that is, the main topic of much research on place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480589">Dixon and Durrheim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445613480589">Modan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445613480589">Myers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445613480589">Proshansky et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445613480589">Rofe and Szili, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445613480589">Schiffrin, 2009</xref>). In the turns immediately preceding Example 6 (in the small talk very near the beginning of the interview that provided example 3), the interviewee has apologized for her accent and said she was a ‘real Cockney’ because ‘I was born within the sound of Bow Bells’. That prompts the interviewer to remark on the relevance of this response to the first question of the interview schedule.</p>
<p>Example 6</p>
<p>1. Interviewer: Since the first question of the interview is: where were you born. Where were you born?</p>
<p>2. Subject:  a) [Missing] Park.</p>
<p>   b) It was Avenue at the time.</p>
<p>   c) I don’t think it exists anymore.</p>
<p>   d) Its just off of [missing] Road.</p>
<p>3. Interviewer: It’s just up the road, isn’t it? Right round the corner from where you were born?</p>
<p>4. Subject: I have never gone out of Islington. (Int. 017)</p>
<p>In turn 2, the interviewee names the street (a), comments on it (b and c) and then locates it in terms of another road (d). This formulation suggests the interviewer is not expected to recognize the first name. But the interviewer displays her knowledge of the place, describing it in relation to the location of the interview as ‘just up the road’. The ‘just’ here echoes that in 2d, but it has a different meaning, the first specificatory (exactly there) where the second is depreciatory (minimizing the distance). The interviewer checks with a tag question and then draws an inference, that the interviewee now lives ‘right round the corner’ from where she was born. So the interviewee is no longer confirming a location (that the place was close), but is confirming that she still lives so close to her birthplace, and thus that there is something remarkable about this fact. The interviewee uses an extreme case formulation, suggesting that she may take this characterization as a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445613480589">Pomerantz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445613480589">Sidnell, 2004</xref>); not only does she now live near where she was born, but she has ‘<italic>never</italic> gone out of Islington’. This elaboration, that she has not only always lived in London, but in the same area of London, relates back to her previous claim to be a ‘Cockney’.</p>
<p>Place names can of course be used in many ways in interviews, for instance, to distinguish between periods of one’s life, contrast two schools or explain why one took one job rather than another. In these three examples, they imply proximity in ways that allow inferences, accounts and identity claims. They are like the uses of house descriptions in that their meanings do not draw on some universal, shared gazetteer; they are indexical, following from the current question and making possible other next turns.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>One might wonder why all this detailed analysis of place references is necessary, since any analyst who shares the culture of the participants already knows what a council house is and who lives in one, and is aware that an adult living near his or her parent is expected to visit. The difference is between knowing <italic>that</italic> a council house is, for instance, associated with working-class tenants, and knowing <italic>how</italic> this category-bound predicate is employed to do work in conversation. We have not revealed some hidden meaning behind what they evidently say, but have found consistent patterns in how they say it. We accept the ethnomethodological argument that there is a danger in analysts drawing on ‘what everyone knows’, in an unreflective way, in that it misses this work that participants do to make ‘what everyone knows’ available in this instance.</p>
<p>We have argued that MCA analyses do not lead to a proliferation of categories based on analysts’ cultural knowledge, but are based on distinctions displayed by and meaningful for the participants in the talk, as interviewees show that their responses follow appropriately from the questions. Some consistent patterns have emerged:</p>
<list id="list2-1461445613480589" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Participants usually choose just one way of categorizing a place as sufficient for present purposes (Sacks’s economy rule), for instance, ‘council house’ in Example 1.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When one participant uses a device for categorizing places, the other uses that device (Sacks’s consistency rule), for instance, number of bedrooms in Example 3.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Categorization can involve presenting a prototypical recognized category, and then revising it by elaboration, qualification, contrasts or negation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>References are presented and interpreted as providing for inferences relevant to the ongoing talk, and in particular, as part of a response to a question; for instance, the inference that a house is crowded, or that proximity allows frequent visits.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These inferences can be cancelled (as in Example 5), in the process making them explicit.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This kind of analysis only covers one aspect of the use of place descriptions in interviews. Our use of researchers’ transcripts, rather than our own, means we cannot do the kind of detailed sequential analysis that would show, for instance, if a place reference were revised after the interviewer failed to take it up. And these findings are specific to the interview genre; they cannot stand for all kinds of talk about place, for instance in telling everyday stories, accounting for actions, complaining, arguing or any of the daily kinds of interaction that may require place references, though interview participants must draw on these everyday practices even in an institutional setting.</p>
<p>One purpose in this study is to provide tools so that social science researchers can attend to aspects of interaction in interviews that are usually unnoticed. By using social researchers’ transcripts, rather than more fine-grained re-transcriptions, we can offer these tools to a range of social researchers and not just to conversation analysts. At a minimum, the findings should make researchers more aware of the degree to which their own questions and follow-ups prompt the kinds of place references used by invoking one or another category. Closer attention to place references would lead researchers to consider, in <italic>planning</italic> interviews:</p>
<list id="list3-1461445613480589" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>what kinds of prompts they are using to evoke place references (categorization devices such as number of bedrooms, adverbs such as <italic>just</italic> or <italic>only</italic>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>what implications these prompts have for the next turns (i.e. thematizing size, modernity, crowding);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how previous questions and previous turns constrain possible responses (i.e. the focus in this particular project on class mobility and family relations).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>So, for instance, a reference to number of bedrooms makes that categorization device available for all further house descriptions, and thus foregrounds issues of space and crowding. Questions about bathrooms, in talking about the early 20th century, foreground issues of modernity and class.</p>
<p>Attention of place references would also assist researchers in analysing interviews. They can find:</p>

<list-item><p>how the use of a category responds to the question, explicitly or implicitly;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>which categories and terminology are meaningful for them, and what are taken as the researchers’ register;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>what interviewees are doing by using a particular category and what predicates are assumed to be bound to it;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how they give accounts, treating categorization (i.e. having a bathroom) as potentially a moral issue.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Interviewees may treat questions of where they live, or lived, as questions about how one should live.</p>
<p>We would hope with this kind of analysis to make researchers more aware of the way place descriptions work in the ongoing development of interview talk. Researchers may come to a project, whether they realize it or not, with their own place categories and maps. But they should not impose those categories and maps without first listening closely to the ways in which interviewees describe and name places, and recognizing the complex conversational uses to which this geography can be put. We would like to make them aware of the interactional challenges, relational issues and moral weight of a question such as ‘Can you describe the house and neighbourhood that you grew up in?’.</p>
