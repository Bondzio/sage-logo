<sec id="sec1-0954406211418158"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Small and large vehicles (automotives, trains, aircrafts, etc.) are equipped with several sensors and other small devices to monitor the proper functioning of all subsystems and components and to provide the instantaneous measurement of the most relevant environmental parameters. On-board sensors, or sensor networks, are usually supplied by wire cablings with the electric power generated by the engine or stored in high-capacitance batteries. However, the proliferation of measurement points may dramatically complicate the cabling architecture and cause reliability and maintenance problems. These limitations are pushing the research to develop self-powered sensing systems for converting the kinetic energy of mechanical vibrations to electric power [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211418158">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211418158">5</xref></bold>]. Rail vehicles are the most promising candidates for the first industrial development of sensor networks supplied by energy harvesters; this is because (a) some typologies of trains (such as trains for goods transportation) are not equipped with electric cabling and (b) a very large amount of vibrations are associated with railway vehicles. The autonomous nodes of the network, properly optimized in dimensions and packaging, will be applied near the critical components of the railway vehicle, where the cabling by wire is not possible. The conditions of the components may be controlled through the measurement of few significant parameters (temperature, acceleration, etc.); at the same time, dedicated algorithms extracted by empirical tests may be used to define proper thresholds of alarm, preventing the failure of the component and improving the safety of the vehicle. The material damage caused by fatigue, for instance, can be predicted by measuring the temperature of the loaded component, or with automatically detected ultrasonic detections; similarly, the wheel profile or the roundness of ball bearings can be controlled by monitoring the vibration spectrum and the acceleration closely to the axle box of the bogie. Analogous approaches for structural monitoring were documented in the literature [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211418158">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211418158">7</xref></bold>], especially for aircrafts and space vehicles.</p>
<p>Open problems and future challenges in this field are the design and fabrication of devices that are able to convert the power with reasonable efficiency and reliability, with low-cost building processes and large-scale applicability. Several solutions were proposed in the literature in both macro- and microscales, but their characteristics in terms of conversion efficiency, reliability, industrial development, and applicability are still not satisfactory [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211418158">8</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211418158">10</xref></bold>]. The most popular transduction principles are piezoelectric, magnetic-inductive, and capacitive. Each strategy is characterized by specific benefits, and even by intrinsic limitations. For instance, piezoelectric harvesters have a limited mechanical reliability due to the repetitive bending; the inductive generators have a poor tunability and a small specific power per unit of volume; the electric preload required by capacitive harvesters strongly reduces their efficiency [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211418158">11</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211418158">13</xref></bold>]. Some important design issues are the optimization of the efficiency and the introduction of tuning strategies.</p>
<p>In this article, the piezoelectric solution was selected for the energy conversion because of the large availability of the components, the easiness of assembling, the propensity of the generator to be tuned on the excitation frequency, and the acceptable values of output current [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211418158">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211418158">15</xref></bold>]. The final goal of this study is to fabricate a compact integrated platform that includes a harvester device, a small accumulation battery, some inertial sensors for the self-powered data acquisition, and a radio frequency (RF) transceiver to connect the node to the rest of the network. The piezoelectric harvester embedded in the network node should be optimized in dimensions and package in the final configuration; a miniaturization process is probably required for this purpose, forinstance by means of the micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211418158">16</xref></bold>]; however, the approach adopted here is to use a macrodimensional prototype for the harvester to estimate the conversion efficiency and to define some semiempirical equations to calculate the power generated. These relations are still valid at microscale and can be easily used to design the MEMS energy harvester for the industrial-optimized network node. A scaled railway bogie mounted on a roller rig was used to replicate the vibrations produced by the train; the experimental analysis was addressed to the dynamic characterization, the electromechanical optimization, and the definition of proper tuning strategies. Finally, some crucial design parameters (acceleration, frequency, proof mass, mechanical stiffness, electric load, etc.) were related to the harvested power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211418158"><title>2 ENERGY HARVESTING STRATEGIES</title>
<p>This section introduces the fundamental strategies used in the literature to convert the energy associated with mechanical vibrations into electrical power.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211418158"><title>2.1 Piezoelectric conversion</title>
<p>In this typology of generators, the output power is provided by one or more structural components made of piezoelectric material, which are bended under the inertia effect of a proof mass in the presence of environmental vibrations. Due to the advantageous ratio between strain and applied force, the cantilever beam is the configuration preferred, but many different cross-section shapes were explored to optimize the power generated per unit volume. Usually, a proof mass situated on the tip of the cantilever amplifies the oscillation and allows tuning of the dynamic response of the generator. An example of piezoelectric generator is present in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211418158">17</xref></bold>], where the authors developed a bimorph piezoelectric transducer cantilever with a steel centre shim; the device (1 cm<sup>3</sup> volume) was characterized at 100 Hz frequency and 2.25 m/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration, generating about 5 V and 70 µW output at the optimum resistive load of 220 kΩ.</p>
<p>Several mathematical models were developed to predict the output power for a given set of electro-mechanical parameters of the material and acceleration; an example of analytic model was presented by Roundy and Wright [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211418158">18</xref></bold>]. The advantages given by piezoelectric generators are the ease of fabrication and assembling, the high electric compatibility, and the relative low cost. The main limitation is represented by the high output impedance affecting piezomaterials, which leads to high generated voltages and low currents; this elongates the battery charge process and suggests using a power transformer at the output to lower the voltage to the level required by the battery. The reliability of the generator is also critical, because the repetitive load stress imposed by the vibrations near the beam constraint induces cracks initiation and fatigue failure; this effect is accentuated by the brittle nature of traditional piezoelectric materials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211418158"><title>2.2 Magnetic inductive conversion</title>
<p>The electric current is produced inside a conductive wire by the relative motion between a coil and a permanent magnet. Usually, the configuration adopted provides a movable magnet supported by mechanical springs that vibrates into a fixed cylindrical coil [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211418158">19</xref></bold>]. The magnetic inductive generator presented by Huang <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211418158">20</xref></bold>] is formed by a vibrating permanent magnet and ten turns of coil; it is able to generate 0.35 μW output power at resonance conditions (100 Hz).</p>
<p>In magnetic inductive generators, the output current is appreciable and the time to charge a battery is sensitively shorter than for piezoelectric generation for a given output power level; the reliability of the generator is also satisfactory, from both electrical and mechanical viewpoints. However, many limitations are present; the ratio between the power generated and the volume of the device is not particularly high. This is because the output directly depends on the number of turns of the coil and on the travel length of the magnet; the magnet velocity and the magnetic material used are also very influent. Another problem is represented by the limited tunability of these generators, because the electric dimensioning limits the possibility to adjust the size of the vibrating proof mass that is simply constituted by the permanent magnet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954406211418158"><title>2.3 Capacitive conversion</title>
<p>Capacitive generators are based on the relative motion between two charged armatures under the effect of environmental vibrations. The variation of their relative distance produces a voltage difference that can be used to charge a battery. Different strategies were developed in the literature, especially for microsystem applications: in-plane gap closing, in-plane overlap, and out-of-plane, depending on the kinematic actuation strategy.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the capacitive conversion strategy is that an electric preload is usually required. This represents a power consumption that limits the efficiency of the generator and indicates to address this strategy to the microscale, where smaller surfaces limit the preload power. It is possible to replace the electric preload using electrets, innovative components still under optimization that are able to store the charge for long time. The small dimension of the device causes high resonance frequencies that do not match traditional vehicles vibration spectra. In the nickel MEMS capacitive harvester fabricated by the authors [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211418158">21</xref></bold>], a very large proof mass and weak elastic springs were introduced to properly modulate the dynamic response of the device, giving a resonance frequency of about 300 Hz.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954406211418158"><title>3 HARVESTER PROTOTYPE AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</title>
<p>The piezoelectric transduction principle was selected among the described conversion strategies because the characteristics of the electric output are the most suitable for the proposed application. The relatively high levels of currents achievable make the charge of a storage battery easier in short time, and the dynamic properties of the harvester can be easily modified to tune the resonance to the excitation frequency provided by the vehicle. The commercial availability of piezotransducers is another advantage when compared with the electromagnetic and capacitive harvesters that require dedicated design, fabrication, and assembling processes.</p>
<p>The P-876.A12 DuraAct piezoelectric cantilever transducer was used for the experiments. The beam consists of a PIC255 piezoceramic layer (200 µm thickness) and an insulating polymeric package; electrical properties and geometrical dimensions of the packaged beam are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211418158">Table 1</xref>. The dynamic response of the cantilever was varied by introducing a variable proof mass on the tip and by increasing its structural stiffness with additional adhesive layers of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), attached to the upper and lower surfaces. In the characterization procedure, the length of the beam was also adjusted by changing the position of the constraint to tune the resonance frequency. The variable proof masses used and the properties of PVC layers are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211418158">Table 1</xref> as well.

<p>An electromechanical shaker was used to apply the alternate force on the constrained side of the piezoelectric cantilever to simulate the environment vibration. The acceleration level imposed by the shaker was controlled in open loop by an accelerometer, while the dynamic response of the excited piezobeam detected by measuring its output voltage. The alternate current generated by the piezomaterial when it bends must be rectified prior to being used to supply the storage battery. For this purpose, a four-diode bridge and two levelling capacitors were used; the rectification circuit was assembled in a perforated plate made for holding electronic components and small circuits. The Panasonic VL3032 lithium–vanadium rechargeable battery was selected to store the power generated and was assembled in the electronic circuit. The characteristics of the battery are: 30 mm diameter, 3.2 mm thickness, 100 mAh capacity, and −20 to 60°C temperature range. The piezoelectric cantilever and the rectification circuit with storage battery are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211418158">Fig. 1</xref>.

<p>The electromechanical properties of the piezoelectric harvester in dynamic conditions are investigated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211418158">Figure 2</xref> reports the dynamic response of the piezoelectric beam in terms of output voltage for three levels of acceleration.

</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954406211418158"><title>4.2 Resonance tuning</title>
<p>Tuning the resonance of vibrating energy harvester to the driving frequency of the external force is a key feature of the design. The development of low-power tuning strategies is determinant to increase the global efficiency of the device for those applications, like vehicles, which have a wide dynamic vibration spectrum. A common solution adopted by the designers is building up a set of harvesting structures with different geometries (e.g. piezoelectric beams with different lengths), each one tuned on a specific resonance frequency; this results in an amplification of the bandwidth of the whole device. Other strategies are based on the softening and/or stiffening process of the elastic components of the harvester; for instance, by applying an axial load to a flexible beam or plate, the resonance frequency of the structure can be easily tuned; thanks to the variation of its effective stiffness. Similarly, an external force can be applied to the tip of a piezoelectric vibrating beam to tune its resonance: by attaching a permanent magnet to the tip of the beam, the magnetic field generated by a conductor can provide the tuning force required. Instead, the strategy adopted in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211418158">21</xref></bold>] was to mechanically couple several identical energy-harvesting proof masses to form a bandpass mechanical filter while overlapping its bandpass with the environment by designing the coupling springs situated between two adjacent masses. The resultant frequency spectrum is characterized by multiple resonance peaks corresponding to several resonance modes of the multi-degrees-of-freedom device.</p>
<p>The resonance frequency of the piezoelectric cantilever was studied by means of an finite element method (FEM) simulation, only considering the structural properties. In addition, the effects of the variable proof masses, structural stiffness, and free lengths of deflection of the beam were studied. The results predicted by the simulations were validated by experiments for the different configurations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211418158">Figure 4</xref> reports the results of FEM simulations, compared with the experimental measurements at two lengths of the beam, respectively, 53 and 57 mm; the stiffness of the beam is indicated as <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>-PVC</sub>, where <italic>i</italic> corresponds to the number of PVC layers attached to the surfaces. The beam stiffness without additional PVC layers is indicated as <italic>k</italic><sub>0-PVC</sub>. The alternate voltage generated by the piezoelectric beam for different configurations of proof mass and stiffness was measured and the root mean square value was calculated. The generated power was calculated using the <italic>P</italic> = <italic>RI</italic><sup>2</sup> equation, where the current <italic>I</italic> was measured at the output. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211418158">Figure 5</xref> reports the measured values of the output power and voltage of the piezoelectric beam with stiffness <italic>k</italic><sub>0-PVC</sub>, where the proof mass was varied. The maximum level of voltage and power can be obtained in the presence of the optimum electric load. The characterization was performed on the shaker with 0.2<italic>g</italic> acceleration at resonance condition; the resonance frequencies for the different configurations are in the range 5.71–11.77 Hz depending on the proof mass considered and are reported near each curve. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211418158">Figure 6</xref> reports the measured output power and voltage of the piezoelectric beam with proof mass <italic>m</italic> = 36.62 g and variable stiffness.

<sec id="sec10-0954406211418158"><title>5 EXPERIMENTS ON A SCALED RAILWAY BOGIE</title>
<p>Rail vehicles, especially those addressed to commercial transportation, are not supplied by on-board sensing systems and electrical wires. This makes the self-powered sensing strategy particularly attractive. The application of sensors on rail vehicles allows the real-time monitoring of functional parameters (velocity, acceleration, vibrations, angular velocity, etc.) and provides information about the working conditions of the most critical components. Sensor networks also facilitate the position tracking of the single coaches through the global positioning system. These information are vital to continuously monitor the reliability of the vehicle and its components, and to track the travel story of each carriage in order to schedule its maintenance.</p>
<p>The distributed sensor network is responsible for the detection of some safety-critical parameters on the train, as the temperature increasing in the stressed components where a damage process is occurring. Many parts of the vehicle are subjected to alternate loads, which may cause a fatigue damaging process initiation; other components such as ball bearings are subjected to wear degradation. All these effects are accompanied by a considerable temperature increasing, which should be detected in order to prevent failures. The detection of acceleration on three axes is also useful to monitor the vibrations caused by the rail–wheels contact and to store the load history. Anomalous peaks of vibrations caused by the presence of debris can be recognized as well as their eventual effects on critical components. The network node also needs a transmission system to send the measurements to the main host, where data are processed and analysed. For this purpose, an RF device with a specific communication protocol can be integrated into the node. The schematic of the network node is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211418158">Fig. 7</xref>; the alternate electric power generated by the harvester is rectified by a simple electric circuit (diode bridge and levelling capacitor) and then stored in a battery. The sensors and the RF transceiver are activated at fixed time intervals, which are compatible with the duty cycle of the system; the self-powered node, after an optimization of dimensions and assembling in relation to the specific application, can be easily applied closely to critical components of the vehicle [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211418158">7</xref></bold>].
<fig id="fig7-0954406211418158" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Schematic of the proposed self-powered sensing node for rail vehicles applications</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211418158-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The piezoelectric harvester was applied to a scaled model of railway bogie to characterize the performances of a sensing node. The system considered is composed of a piezoelectric harvester, a linearization electronic circuit, and a storage battery. Two acceleration sensors and an RF transceiver were supplied with the power generated.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0954406211418158"><title>5.1 Description of scaled bogie and roller rig</title>
<p>The bogie used for the characterization is scaled down to 1:4 ratio of an actual vehicle faithfully reproducing its geometric characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211418158">Fig. 8</xref>). The prototype reproduces a trailing bogie but is designed to accept two motor gears to also simulate the motor bogie. The rollers of the rig were machined to obtain the same transversal rail profile UNI50 canted to 1:20. The wheel profiles are characterized by two interchangeable conical profiles (0.05 and 0.3 rad) and a profile S1002; the curvature profiles are designed to obtain the same shape of the rail–wheel actual contact area. The stiffness of the bogie was designed and tested experimentally to have dynamic characteristics equivalent to those of the actual vehicle. The single rubber element used as primary suspension in the actual vehicle was replaced by four hinges supported by disc springs for longitudinal and vertical directions. The lateral stiffness was obtained using 12 helical compression springs. The system allows adjustment of wheelset preload and position. The secondary suspension is represented by an air spring that gives a ratio between lateral and vertical stiffness equal to that of actual springs. Several similitude methods were used to convert the parameters measured on the scaled model. The similitude law proposed by Jaschinski [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211418158">22</xref></bold>] was used to design the bogie; this method provides the equivalence of wheelset dynamics and keeps the accelerations unscaled on the prototype.

<p>The analytic model introduced in this section is based on empirical coefficients derived from the experimental characterization. The most important parameters affecting the electromechanical properties of the harvester and its output power were analysed at variable accelerations.

where <italic>P</italic> is the output power in microWatts, <italic>R</italic> the electric load in Ohm, <italic>a</italic> the acceleration in g, <italic>C</italic> the piezoelectric beam capacitance in nanoFarad, and <italic>m</italic> the proof mass in grams. The empirical coefficients are

where <italic>n</italic> is the total number of PVC adhesive layers applied to the beam.</p>
<p>The output power predicted by equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954406211418158">1</xref>) was compared to the measured values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211418158">Fig. 10</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954406211418158"><title>7 DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The dynamic characterization at variable proof mass reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211418158">Fig. 5</xref> reveals a proportional relationship between the mass and the output power and voltage; this can be easily explained by considering the oscillation amplitude of the beam at resonance: the higher the mass on the tip, the higher the flexural deflection and the electric output of the piezoelectric material. This is particularly evident for a constant acceleration, which was imposed at 0.2<italic>g</italic> in the characterization.</p>
<p>The diagrams reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211418158">Fig. 6</xref> reveal the existence of an optimum stiffness that corresponds to the maximum power and voltage output. In fact, the electric output at <italic>k</italic><sub>4-PCV</sub> is higher than those obtained at the lower stiffness level <italic>k</italic><sub>2-PVC</sub> and at the higher stiffness level <italic>k</italic><sub>6-PVC</sub>. These results can be motivated considering that the measurements were performed at the resonance condition of the beam; thus, an increasing stiffness determines the increase in resonance frequency, giving a benefit on electric output (more oscillation cycles per unit of time). However, when the stiffness becomes very high, the oscillation amplitude of the beam is reduced for that acceleration level and an opposite effect on the electric generation is produced.</p>
<p>The experimental validation of the sensing platform on the railway bogie reveals that the cycle time of the self-powered device does not allow a continuous acquisition and transmission, but indicates that a recharging time is required after each operation. This limitation is compatible for structural monitoring purposes, as an optimized strategy may be used to detect accelerations as well as different parameters (temperature, angular velocity, etc.) at specific time intervals, or when a given threshold is reached. The capacitance of the piezoelectric material used in the characterization is not particularly high; the global efficiency of the device can be sensitively increased if a high-capacitance piezoelectric material is adopted. For this purpose, the power harvested from the vibrations of the bogie with a piezoelectric generator with an increased 150 nF capacitance was measured and compared to that of 90 nF; the results obtained in the same conditions described before are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211418158">Fig. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211418158">Table 3</xref>. Optimization of the final device configuration is needed to reduce the dimensions of the self-powered system; the electronic circuit used to rectify the harvested voltage also requires additional optimization. Furthermore, a package must be provided to protect the device from mechanical shocks, debris, and dust; however, the package should not introduce interferences affecting the RF transmission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0954406211418158"><title>8 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The energy-harvesting strategy to generate power from mechanical vibrations of railway vehicles was explored. The prototype of a self-powered sensing system is presented, which is addressed to structural monitoring of critical components. After a preliminary characterization of electrical and dynamic properties of the piezoelectric transducer, the harvester was integrated to a scaled railway bogie associated to a roller rig, which has the capability of simulating the accelerations on actual rail vehicles. The final efficiency of the device was measured in terms of time needed to recharge the battery by the harvester after sensing and transmission operations. A compact analytic model based on empirical coefficients was derived to estimate the power generated by the harvester and compared with good agreement to the measured values.</p>
