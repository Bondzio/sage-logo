<p>Tissue-engineered rabbit flexor tendons reseeded with cells are stronger in vitro after culture in a bioreactor. It is not known whether this effect persists in vivo. Tenocytes from New Zealand white rabbits were seeded onto rabbit rear paw flexor tendons that were deprived of cells and exposed to cyclic strain in a bioreactor. Reseeded constructs that were kept unloaded in a medium for 5 days were used as controls. The tendons were implanted to bridge a zone II defect in the rabbit. After explantation 4 weeks later, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elastic modulus (EM) were determined. Tendon constructs that were exposed to cyclic strain had significantly improved UTS and EM. Histology showed that cellularity was increased in the bioreactor tendons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Using autologous grafts in the reconstruction of extensive hand trauma can sometimes be difficult because of the lack of source material and donor site morbidity. Autologous grafts are also usually of extrasynovial origin and do not fully match the original tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411419439">Seiler et al., 1995</xref>). The use of extrasynovial tendons may result in excessive scarring and adhesions, which in turn might require additional procedures to improve gliding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411419439">Amadio et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411419439">LaSalle and Strickland, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193411419439">Wehbé et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411419439">White, 1960</xref>) in contrast to intrasynovial tendons that have better gliding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411419439">Bischoff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411419439">Leversedge and Seiler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411419439">Leversedge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411419439">Seiler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193411419439">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). To overcome these problems there is a need for a tissue-engineered flexor tendon construct that has a gliding surface and biomechanical strength comparable to that of intrasynovial autologous grafts.</p>
<p>Previously, we have successfully removed the cells from rabbit flexor tendon, shown that these scaffolds can be reseeded with tenocytes, and grafted the constructs back into another animal of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411419439">Kryger et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, this procedure of reseeding tendon scaffolds with cells such as tenocytes significantly adds to the mechanical strength of the constructs in vitro and results in a tendon construct with tenocyte-like cells on histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411419439">Saber et al., 2010</xref>). After the application of cyclic strain during culture, the strength of the constructs has also been shown to increase further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411419439">Saber et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is not known whether the effects of cyclic strain persist in vivo. Therefore, in this study we applied cyclic strain to tissue-engineered rabbit flexor tendon constructs preoperatively, transplanted them back to the rear paw of a recipient animal and then examined the biomechanical characteristics of these flexor tendon constructs after 4 weeks in vivo. We hypothesized that tissue-engineered flexor tendon constructs optimized in a bioreactor exposed to cyclic strain before surgery would be stronger in vivo than identical constructs kept in a static culture preoperatively.</p>

<title>Tissue engineering of flexor tendons</title>
<p>To produce flexor tendon constructs, adult male New Zealand white rabbits (3.2–3.6 kg) were used as a source of tenocytes and collagen scaffolds. Flexor tendons were explanted to obtain tenocytes that were expanded in culture. Different animals were used to obtain flexor tendons (4 cm in length) that had all cellular components removed and the expanded tenocytes were reseeded onto the collagen scaffolds. These protocols have been reported by us previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411419439">Angelidis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411419439">Kryger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411419439">Riboh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411419439">Saber et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Bioreactor optimization</title>
<p>A custom bioreactor (Ligagen L30-4C, DynaGen Systems, Tissue Growth Technologies, Minnetonka, MN, USA) applied uniaxial, cyclic strain to the reseeded tendon constructs in the experimental group (B+) while they were mounted in a humidified culture chamber in the bioreactor containing F12 medium at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A motor applied a force of 5 N equal to 1.25 N per construct at a frequency of 1 cycle per minute (0.017 Hz), alternating 1 hour of cyclic strain with 1 hour of rest for 5 days before surgery. This protocol has previously been shown to increase the ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus in tissue engineered rabbit flexor tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411419439">Angelidis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411419439">Saber et al., 2010</xref>). Constructs used for control (B-) were reseeded with tenocytes as in the experimental group and kept unloaded for 5 days in F12 medium in an incubator at 37°C in a humidified tissue culture chamber with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Surgical procedure</title>
<p>New Zealand white rabbits were used as recipients for the B+ and B- tissue engineered flexor tendons. The animals were given 1.0 ml of ketamine (40 mg/ml) (Ketalar; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and 0.5 ml xylazine (4 mg/ml) (AnaSed; Lloyd Laboratories, Shendiah, IA, USA) preoperatively. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with isofluorane via a breathing mask. A tourniquet was applied proximal to the insertion of the Achilles’ tendon. The skin was disinfected with alcohol and betadine, and the animal was draped to ensure sterility.</p>
<p>Under loupe magnification (2.5×), the plantar skin was incised in a L-shaped fashion, and the subcutaneous tissues were dissected to expose the superficial and deep flexor tendons to the second and third digit at the level of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. Care was taken not to injure the neurovascular bundles. A 3–4 mm longitudinal incision was made in the skin overlying the distal insertion of the deep flexor tendon at the distal phalanx. The native deep flexor tendon was excised at 3 mm proximal to its bony insertion distally, and 10 mm proximal to the MTP joint and discarded.</p>
<p>Two tissue-engineered tendon constructs were cut to fit the two defects. Each animal received either two tendon constructs that had been exposed to cyclic strain (B+) or two tendons that had been kept unloaded (B-). The constructs were threaded through the pulley system with a thin guide wire and sutured using the modified Kessler technique with a non-resorbable suture (6-0 Ethilon; Ethicon Inc., Sommerville, NJ, USA). The core suture tendon purchase was equal to or greater than the width of the tendon (at least 3 mm). To reinforce the core suture, a running 6-0 Ethilon epitendinous suture was placed circumferentially to adapt the edges of the tendon construct to the native tendon. Proximal to the construct, in the plantar area of the paw, the deep flexor tendon was sutured with a holding suture to the superficial flexor tendon. The native flexor tendon was then transected 10 mm proximal of the holding suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411419439">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The skin was closed, an antibacterial ointment was put on the wound and a soft gauze was applied as a dressing that the animal removed by itself, usually within the first 48 hours. Animals were allowed to move freely in their cages and they were given standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum. The water was supplemented with trimethoprim-sulfa during the first postoperative week for infection prophylaxis.</p>

<title>Biomechanical testing</title>
<p>The animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks with an injection of pentobarbital sodium (Euthanasol; Schering-Plough Animal Health), and tendon constructs were harvested using an atraumatic technique.</p>
<p>After harvest, the constructs were kept moist in phosphate buffered saline before mechanical testing the same day. The constructs were clamped between the grips in a materials testing system (MTS 858; MTS, Eden Praire, MN, USA). The length of the construct between the clamps was kept at 25 mm. Two orthogonal photographs were made of each construct with a digital camera (Nikon D3; Nikon Corp., Japan) to determine the cross-sectional area on the basis of an ellipse by using an image analysis software (Image J; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). To screen for constructs that were weak due to subclinical infection, each construct was preconditioned with ten cycles of increasing load up to 40 N. All constructs that did not go through the ten preconditioning cycles were discarded. After the ten preconditioning cycles, a final loading was applied so that the construct was stretched to failure. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS, defined as the maximum resistance to tendon failure per square millimetre) and the elastic modulus (EM, defined as the elastic deformation of the tendon construct when a force was applied to it) were calculated from the load–displacement data recorded by the test system (TestawareSX; MTS, Eden Praire, MN, USA).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tenocytes from New Zealand white rabbits can be reseeded onto tendons that had the cells removed and these cells remain in the construct for up to 12 weeks in the rabbit. These grafts are biomechanically stronger in vitro than unseeded tendons and their ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus in vitro improve significantly after application of cyclic strain for 5 days in a bioreactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411419439">Angelidis et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411419439">Saber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411419439">Thorfinn et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we have shown that the bioreactor-optimized flexor tendon constructs are also significantly superior in strength and elastic modulus in vivo. There may be several reasons for this. Cyclic strain causes cells to change orientation relative to the axis of the bioreactor force in contrast to a random pattern when cultured unloaded. It has been established by several authors that different cell types, including fibroblasts, orient their direction when exposed to strain during culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411419439">Angelidis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411419439">Loesberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411419439">Saber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411419439">Sawaguchi et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, it seems that the change in orientation induces fibroblasts to produce collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411419439">Loesberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411419439">Sawaguchi et al., 2010</xref>). Increased collagen production as a result of change in cell orientation may therefore be responsible for the increase in strength seen after cyclic strain in our experiment. Cyclic strain may facilitate the faster migration of cells into the deeper parts of the tendon than in unloaded constructs. In several experiments by other authors it has been established that the migration of cells from the outer to the deeper aspects of the tendon seems to play an important role for the healing process in flexor tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411419439">Abrahamsson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411419439">Manske et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411419439">Mass and Tuel, 1991</xref>). An increasing number of cells populating the deeper parts of the reseeded scaffold may therefore explain our finding that the bioreactor optimized tendons are stronger biomechanically. However, this needs to be further clarified.</p>
<p>The design of this study has some limitations. First of all, it focused on the first 4 weeks of the postoperative period. The importance of early motion training to avoid scarring and adhesions was the rationale for the observation period in this study. It is clinically established that early motion training significantly improves the outcome of flexor tendon repair when compared to keeping the healing tendon immobilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411419439">Gelberman and Manske, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411419439">Khanna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411419439">Schneider and Bush, 1989</xref>). A number of changes in the tendon healing process have been proposed to explain this. Flexor tendons subjected to early protected training have an increased density of peritendinous vessels, migration of epitendinous cells into the repair site is facilitated and scar formation is decreased in comparison with repaired tendons in an immobilized extremity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411419439">Gelberman et al., 1986</xref>). In the future, when tissue engineering of flexor tendons becomes a clinical alternative, early strength will be important. However, further studies should address the effects of bioreactor optimization on the strength of tissue-engineered flexor tendon constructs in later postoperative periods.</p>
<p>The rear paws of the animals were not immobilized postoperatively because the animals do not tolerate full immobilization in the rear paw after surgery and they need to be able to move freely in the cage as soon as anaesthesia is concluded. However, we tried to mimic the clinical situation regarding immobilization in this model. To lessen the range of excursion of the tendon while the rear paws were mobilized, the deep flexor tendon proximal to the tendon construct was transected and attached with no tension to the superficial flexor tendon that was left intact. Even though some sliding of the tendon construct in the sheath cannot be ruled out, it is most likely that the load of the tendon was decreased considerably by this manoeuvre.</p>
<p>The high number of animals that had to be excluded due to infections and wound formation also limits the study. We have previously used the rabbit forepaw as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411419439">Thorfinn et al., 2009</xref>) but the rear paw had to be used to obtain flexor tendons large enough for bioreactor optimization and biomechanical testing. Obtaining long-term sterility to prevent wound formation proved to be difficult since the animals had to roam freely postoperatively using their rear paws. The constructs were prone to fungal infections of low virulence that were not obvious at the time of implantation but resulted in a high rate of subclinical infection after explantation.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively low number of constructs, our results indicate that preoperative bioreactor optimization with cyclic strain seems beneficial in vivo. This is important because in the future, when tissue-engineered flexor tendon constructs become a clinical alternative to autologous grafts, a stronger construct will most likely allow an earlier start of motion training, which in turn may have a positive effect on healing, scarring and adhesion development.</p>
