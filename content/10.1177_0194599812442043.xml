<sec id="section4-0194599812442043">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>One hundred two consecutive parotid operations by 1 surgeon were recorded. A high rate of sialocele formation was addressed by identifying possible contributing factors, sequentially introducing changes, and then analyzing the effect of such changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812442043">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty patients developed a sialocele (19.6%). Demographic variables of those who developed a sialocele were similar to those who did not. Factors examined included partial versus complete superficial parotidectomy, use of Surgicel, vacuum drain pressure, and postoperative duration for surgical drain. The only significant factor on regression analysis for increasing the risk of a sialocele development was the use of Surgicel (<italic>P</italic> = .023). Once the use of Surgicel stopped, the rate of sialocele formation diminished markedly (from 28.6% to 11.3%).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Sialocele can cause significant problems for the patient and surgeon in terms of delayed wound healing and increased clinic resources and frustration. This study suggests that the use of products such as Surgicel increases the risk of postoperative sialocele formation.</p>

<body>
<p>A collection of saliva at the surgical site (sialocele) is a recognized common complication after parotid surgery, being reported in anywhere from 5% to 39% of parotid operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812442043">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812442043"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812442043"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442043">4</xref></sup> There is no clear explanation for this large variance in incidence, but it may be due to factors related to the method of surgery, diligence in sialocele detection, or the definition of a clinically significant collection. In any event, a major issue with sialocele formation is that it seems to be an unpredictable event. Witt considers that the growing popularity of partial superficial parotidectomies—as distinct from complete superficial parotidectomy—has led to an increase in the incidence of sialocele.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442043">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sialoceles are frustrating for surgeons and can provoke anxiety in patients because of the need for added clinic attendance and treatment. Often there is a delay in wound healing and sometimes even fistula formation. Methods for preventing sialoceles include prolonged wound drain usage and application of tissue glue intraoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812442043">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812442043">6</xref></sup> Persistent sialoceles have been treated by repeated aspiration, pressure dressings, exploration of the wound, and botulinum toxin injection. More radical treatments include radiotherapy, tympanic neuronectomy, creation of an oral fistula, and even completion parotidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812442043">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pathogenesis of sialocele relates to disruption of the gland parenchyma as a result of the parotid surgery, with “leakage” of saliva into the tissues, to form a collection with an inflammatory pseudocapsule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812442043">7</xref></sup> Risk of sialocele may be reduced if accumulation of extravasated saliva is prevented by the use of a surgical drain. A high-pressure vacuum drain, however, may stimulate saliva extravasation and thereby possibly promote a tract for subsequent sialocele formation once the drain is removed. Another consideration is that absorbable hemostatic material, such as Surgicel (Ethicon Inc, St Louis, Missouri), if placed within the wound to protect the facial nerve from irritation from the drain tubing, may allow elevation of the surgical skin flap, to create a dead space for saliva collection.</p>
<p>We became conscious of an apparent high rate of sialocele formation in our parotidectomy patients. We decided to review our experience and to try to identify factor(s) associated with a high likelihood of postoperative sialocele following parotid surgery. This article reports the results of that review and of our attempts to change variables to reduce the rate of sialocele formation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812442043" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective review of parotid procedures by a single surgeon between 2002 and 2010 was conducted. Patients having a radical or extended parotidectomy or those with a high-grade malignancy were excluded. Ethics approval was obtained from the Northern X Regional Ethics Committee (responsible for all ethics approvals in our geographical area) for this study.</p>
<p>As a routine, all patients had been monitored closely for signs of sialocele formation in the 2 weeks following surgery. Initially, the surgical procedure generally included the laying of Surgicel over the exposed branches of the facial nerve and the insertion of a high-pressure vacuum drain (Redivac Atrium Medical, Hudson, New Hampshire) prior to wound closure.</p>
<p>The routine surgical practice was subsequently modified by first changing the vacuum drain to a lower pressure system (Blake Drain; Ethicon) and later by avoiding Surgicel before closing the wound.</p>
<p>If a patient developed a sialocele, this was confirmed and treated with aspiration initially. If this was unsuccessful in resolving the sialocele, an 18-gauge angiocath was inserted and taped in place to allow free drainage and was removed after 2 days.</p>
<p>Patient data included demographic details, surgical approach (whether antegrade or retrograde facial nerve dissection), extent of resection, duration of operation, drain type, Surgicel use, and hospital length of stay. Sialocele formation and postoperative facial nerve status were the recorded short-term outcomes of interest.</p>
<p>The data were analyzed for an association between sialocele formation and possible causative factors using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Tests of significance for the dependent variable (sialocele formation) included χ<sup>2</sup> for categorical variables and <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to the 4 variables we wanted to test—type of drain, Surgicel use, volume of drainage at 18 hours, and partial superficial versus greater than partial parotidectomy—for an association with sialocele formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599812442043" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 58 women and 44 men in this study; the mean age of the patients was 49 years (women, 46 years; men, 53 years). The median duration of surgery was 120 minutes.</p>
<p>Seventy-five parotidectomies (73.5%) were performed with a retrograde approach; 15 (14.7%) were antegrade, and the balance comprised a combination of antegrade and retrograde. The extent of the surgery was categorized as either partial superficial parotidectomy or greater than partial (being complete superficial parotidectomy, total parotidectomy, with or without deep lobe dissection). There were 72 of 102 (70.6%) partial parotidectomies. In total, in 49 of 102 cases (48.0%) Surgicel was used, and in 53 of 102 (52.0%) it was not used.</p>
<p>There were 20 patients (19.4%) who developed a sialocele (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812442043"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Patients with Surgicel had a 28.6% sialocele rate compared with 11.3% for those without Surgicel. Different factors were assessed for association (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812442043"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). The only factor on bivariate analysis that was associated significantly with sialocele formation was whether or not Surgicel was placed in the wound (χ<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = .028). In particular, there was no significant difference in sialocele rate associated with the extent of parotid dissection.</p>

<p>Eleven of 53 patients (20.3%) without Surgicel developed some temporary facial nerve weakness. This compared with 19 of 49 (38.8%) patients with Surgicel who developed some temporary facial nerve weakness. This was not statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = .08).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812442043" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite sialocele formation being a relatively common complication following parotid surgery, there is very little information in the literature relating to causation.</p>
<p>In this study, we have found that patient’s age and sex did not affect the incidence of this complication. This is consistent with Witt’s experience,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442043">4</xref></sup> but unlike with his series, we did not find any association between partial superficial parotidectomy and sialocele formation (<italic>P</italic> = .813). This may be because a very high proportion of our cases had partial parotid surgery (70.9%), and we excluded extensive surgical cases in which high-grade malignancy prevailed.</p>
<p>Our results show that the use of Surgicel carried a significant 6-fold risk of sialocele formation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been demonstrated. Although we considered Surgicel likely to be protective of the facial nerve, we did not see an increase in the incidence of facial weakness once we stopped using Surgicel. Indeed, the results indicated a lower rate of facial nerve weakness (20% without Surgicel versus 39% with it), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. An animal study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812442043">8</xref></sup> has shown that topical application of Surgicel temporarily stops conductivity of a rat’s saphenous nerve, and this phenomenon may account to some degree for our observations with the facial nerve.</p>
<p>The association between Surgicel and sialocele formation may be related in part to changes over time, because the use of Surgicel occurred early in our series. The Hawthorne effect—that mere awareness of being under observation can alter the way in which a person behaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812442043">9</xref></sup>—is another possible confounding factor, although recent literature considers this effect as overstated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812442043">10</xref></sup> If time, or the Hawthorne effect, were contributing, the initial changes in practice (reduced drain vacuum pressure, prolonged drain retention) should probably have shown some improvement because of our heightened awareness of the sialocele problem at that stage. Instead, there was no discernable reduction in sialocele formation until we stopped using Surgicel.</p>
<p>To conclude that Surgicel is a significant causative factor for sialocele formation, possible confounding needs to be addressed. The decision for placing Surgicel was temporal rather than based on the state of the wound bed, size of incision, and so forth. Although we did not specifically measure bleeding during surgery, surrogate markers for this would include drain time and volume and duration of procedure—all of which were not significant factors on bivariate analysis, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812442043"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812442043" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on our results, we would recommend that Surgicel not be used to cover the facial nerve or indeed any part of the parotid dissection.</p>
