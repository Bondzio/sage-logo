<p>The historico-political division of the Mariana Islands archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean embodies one of the more complex instances of colonization persisting into the present day. The southernmost island in the chain, Guam, was acquired by the United States in 1898 as part of the spoils of the Spanish-American War. The rest of the chain, including the island of Saipan, was acquired by Germany, which then relinquished them to Japan in 1914, who held them until the end of the Second World War. At that point they became part of the US-administered Pacific and remain so as the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. In <italic>Cultures of Commemoration</italic>, Keith L. Camacho takes as his point of departure the differing experiences of the native Chamorros of Guam and Saipan under US and Japanese rule before and during the Second World War (when Guam was occupied by Japan), as well as the ways in which those experiences shaped the memories of the war and the contemporary social construction of what the war now means. Camacho effectively traces the entanglement of memory, history, and culture in order to tease out the distinct ways that the people of this divided island group remember both the war and its aftermath, notably through a comparison of the ways in which both Guam and Saipan created and maintain their respective Liberation Day celebrations. In Guam, the holiday commemorates the return of the Americans in 1944 and the liberation of the Chamorros from Japan (a ‘liberation’ tempered by Guam’s continuing colonial status within the American empire); in Saipan, the day marks the liberation of the Chamorros in 1946 from the American internment camp established at the end of the war to ostensibly protect the Islanders from the final episodes of combat.</p>
<p>While Camacho is adept at weaving the histories of these divergent commemorations into a single narrative, the book occasionally misses opportunities to explore the various complicated layers of memory and colonization, especially as those remembrances play out in the present day. One example is the tension between Nasion Chamoru, an indigenous independence group that criticized US colonial policy, and the wartime generation of Chamorros that came to the fore during the 1991 Liberation Day activities. Camacho briefly mentions the confrontation, but offers no analysis of its implications, not the least of which is the almost certain way that Islanders’ memories of the war will change as the wartime generation passes on. Additionally, the book would have benefitted from engaging with a certain irony: while the US has administered both Guam and the northern Marianas since the end of the war, there remains a geo-political split between the islands and Islanders due in part to a combination of US territorial policy and inter-island cultural memory. That said, this book is worth the read, and it demonstrates that there is more work to be done on the subject of how Islanders construct memory, reality, and other cultural forms.</p>
