<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A 26-year-old, right-handed housewife attended hospital for routine delivery of her first child. After an unsuccessful attempt at venous cannulation using a 20 gauge needle on the dorsoradial aspect of the right wrist within the anatomical snuffbox, she immediately experienced a sharp ‘electric’ pain radiating from the dorsum of the hand to the back of the right upper arm, with a loss of sensation over the first dorsal web space and radial aspect of the thumb. The procedure was abandoned and no intravenous fluid was injected through the cannula. Ten weeks later she continued to experience numbness over the thumb and index finger and intermittent ‘electric pains’ within the dorsoradial forearm. The symptoms were aggravated by writing for long periods, cold weather and holding her child. She also noticed a sensitive pea-sized firm nodule within the anatomical snuff box.</p>
<p>Surgical exploration 9 months after the injury revealed a small fusiform swelling on the superficial sensory branch of the radial nerve, typical of a neuroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411433524">Figure 1</xref>). The neuroma was 1.5 x the diameter of the nerve and was in continuity with it. Resection of the neuroma and primary repair was done without requiring a graft. Histology showed a well circumscribed lesion consisting of nerve bundles and nuclei with no evidence of mitosis or malignant changes.</p>

<p>Although painful neuromas can develop in any nerve, the predilection for a neuroma to developing in the superficial branch of the radial nerve has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433524">Dellon and Mackinnon, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411433524">1986b</xref>).The nerve exits beneath the dense fascia and the tendons of the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus. It also lies superficially, close to the cephalic vein with little soft tissue cover. As the nerve lies close to the wrist joint, movement of the wrist subjects the superficial radial nerve to substantial traction and repetitive mechanical trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433524">Dellon and Mackinnon, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411433524">1986b</xref>).The combination of both mechanical and anatomical factors promotes neuroma formation and can exacerbate the symptoms.</p>
<p>The dorsoradial aspect of the wrist is a popular site for intravenous cannulation since the large cephalic vein can be easily identified there. The cannula is also less likely to kink than on the dorsum of the hand. These factors allow for both easier cannulation and the use of a larger cannula. The unfortunate downside is that the ‘neuroma susceptible’ superficial branch of the radial nerve lies near the cephalic vein and is therefore prone to injury at this location. In the case we report, attempted intravenous cannulation on the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist probably lacerated the superficial branch, resulting in the immediate classical neuropathic symptom of an ‘electric shock’ type of radiating pain.</p>
<p>Various conservative measures have been tried for the management of the symptoms of a neuroma, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), repeated nerve blocks and pharmacological treatments such as anticonvulsants or tricyclic depressants. However, an entirely effective treatment has yet to be found. Surgical treatment can provide permanent pain relief and can avoid the lifelong use of pharmacological agents or painful outpatient procedures such as repeated nerve blocks or TENS procedures. There are various surgical procedures for a damaged superficial branch of the radial nerve. In this case excision of the neuroma with direct suturing was done, as approximation was possible without tension. Where approximation is not possible it is preferable to perform a simple submuscular implantation of the proximal nerve end into the brachioradialis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411433524">Dellon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433524">Stahl et al., 1996</xref>). An interposition nerve graft can be used; however it often has an unfavourable outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433524">Dellon and Mackinnon, 1986a</xref>).</p>
