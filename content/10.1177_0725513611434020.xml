<p>Bringing together important, well-timed reflections on passion in politics, extremism, totalitarianism, religion, and the question of the contemporary ‘impasses and hopes of a radical politics of emancipation and egalitarianism’ (p. xii), Alberto Toscano’s <italic>Fanaticism</italic> clearly belongs in the same stable as the work of Alain Badiou (Toscano having translated into English a number of his books) and Slavoj Žižek – though Toscano does not shy away from raising some very pertinent and probing questions of his comrades.</p>
<p>‘Fanaticism’, as Toscano notes, is a ‘remarkably resilient and adaptable weapon’, deployed as a way of ‘disqualifying or demonizing adversaries’ (p. 249), and, frequently, used as a ‘foil’ against which to defend ‘the proper path of politics’ (p. xxv). The idea is mobile, and inquiry into its movement demonstrates well that a too-easy consignment of the term to the realm of ideology, as class-motivated mystification, does not work hard enough. Fanaticism, that is, may be portrayed as the outside of reason, or it might be argued as expressive of ultra-rationalism; at times, the fanatic is one mired in the sensuous and particular, while, at other times, he or she is in the thrall of abstraction and ungrounded universality (pp. xviii, 249). So, too, do we often find the opposition to alleged fanaticism issuing in a politics of anti-fanatical fanaticism – this particular problem raising the question of the ambivalence frequently bound into the accusation of ‘fanaticism’ and of the related uneasy relationship between mostly disavowed ‘fanaticism’ and its ‘nobler cousin’ (p. xxi) ‘enthusiasm’.</p>
<p>In many respects an account of the intellectual twists and turns taken by the charge of ‘fanaticism’ across time and space, Toscano’s work is far from a blank history of ideas exercise in the ‘interestingness’ of a concept, and the political aims of the work are firmly planted up-front: a defence of the ‘communist hypothesis’ (and the necessity of abstraction and enthusiasm to such politics [p. xxvi]), and a critical assault on Cold Warrior and new philosophical defences of liberal democracy against radical politics, as well as more recent attempts to bolster a threatened ‘Western civilization’ against Islamic atavism. Each of the figures of fanaticism treated serves these political purposes.</p>
<p>The first stop is a consideration of the classical liberal deployment of ‘fanaticism’ – for instance, in the crusade against the ‘misty abstractions’ (p. 6) and divisive levelling efforts of the abolitionists, this configuration demonstrating not only the ‘pollutedness’ of such liberalism, but also that fanaticism can ‘serve an indispensable emancipatory function’ (p. 11). New figures of fanaticism appear in ‘the age of empire’, with the labelling and pathologization of threatening movements at home – for instance, feminism or anarchism – and abroad – ‘Hindustanee fanatics’, ‘Muhammadan bigots’, ‘dervish fanaticism’ (pp. 12–14). Turning to the post-communist resurgence of liberalism, Toscano sets the recent ‘post-historical politics of de-dramatization’ (p. 40) of Peter Sloterdijk’s ‘dismaying’ (p. 41) <italic>Rage and Time</italic> – which marries Fukuyama and Nietzsche, synthesizes a century of propagandistic anti-communism, and fulminates against de-naturing egalitarianism – negatively against Badiou’s startling championing of the 20th century’s ‘passion for the real’.</p>
<p>Turning, then, in a rather odd sequencing, to the ‘locus classicus’ of debate on fanaticism, Muntzer and the German Peasants’ War, Toscano subtly centres his discussion on a fascinating 1956 seminar at the University of Manchester, which brought together the very different contributions of Eric Hobsbawm, Peter Worsley, and Norman Cohn. Hobsbawm’s interpretation of the ‘pre-political’ character of millenarianism is occasion for entry into the interesting disagreement between Lukacs – pushing a line of the ‘objective impossibility’ of any real restructuring of life at that historical moment – and Bloch, with his attentiveness to the powers of the ‘living yesterday’ (p. 56), his suggestion of the existence of (in Badiou’s words) ‘communist invariants’ (p. 85), and his much more flexible reading (as Jameson puts it) of base-superstructure as a <italic>problem</italic> <italic>rather than a solution</italic> – this latter, Blochian line obviously more appealing to Toscano.</p>
<p>Chapters on the Enlightenment and psychoanalysis provide some nice, sharp elbows in the ribs to reigning orthodoxies. Against the creation of a ‘folk Enlightenment’ (p. 111), understood as all about finitude, limitation, tolerance, caution, anti-totalization, and best grasped as a contemporary set of political tools to defend Western gates from the new barbarians, Enlightenment thinkers were often, in fact, portrayed precisely as fanatics – Kant, for instance, decried by Nietzsche for his defence of ‘the ethico-political rights of abstraction’ (p. 138) and his account of revolutionary enthusiasm. Moving to psychoanalysis, Toscano seeks to get at the political unconscious of the field, charging that many psychoanalytical thinkers owe an unfortunate debt to Hegel, effectively following the latter’s depiction of Islam as a political and expansionist religion that takes universalism too far, repudiating law, limitation, and state independence. Toscano’s targets, here, include thinkers such as Žižek who have, in their enthusiasm for ‘Christian atheism’, been led into an orientalist impasse, erecting a fantasy of ‘our’ culture of autonomy, scepticism, and freedom – an imaginative unity built on the equally fantasmic unification of the culture of the Other. Against this trend, Toscano champions a return to Freud’s ‘generic’ treatment of religion, the latter’s ‘indifference’ to specific religious iterations, and his implicit rejection of the notion that ‘certain illusions have an emancipatory potential that makes them superior to others’ (p. 171).</p>
<p>The final two chapters deal, in like fashion, with religion – a topic most pertinent given what has been described as a recent ‘post-secular turn’ across the human sciences. First, Toscano revisits Marx, reminding us of the latter’s insistence that real abstractions should not be treated as ‘arbitrary product[s] of human reflection’ (quoted p. 184), his attempt to ‘think the conditions for its [religion’s] “real-apparent” autonomization’ (p. 187), his suggestion that Christianity was an integral component of world capitalism, and his interpretation of religion as the ‘<italic>expression</italic> of real suffering and a protest against real suffering’ (quoted p. 192). A return to Cohn and the ‘political religion’ thesis on ideological fanaticism is next, Toscano rejecting the ultra-formalism in play here, and in more recent versions such as John Gray’s <italic>Black Mass</italic>, which pays no attention to actual content or historical specificity (fanaticism treated as a ‘monolithic invariance’ [p. xx]), and simply retreads conservative paths of rootedness, natural hierarchies, human fallibility, and the like.</p>
<p>In the last pages of this chapter, Toscano makes some acute observations about the peculiar embrace of the religious by recent emancipatory thinkers – the likes of Derrida, Agamben, and those closest to him, Žižek and Badiou. This, for Toscano, is a ‘profoundly ambivalent move’ (p. 245), an effort to ‘inoculate’ radical thought against the conservative critique, and a signal of a ‘broader suspicion that has fallen on knowledge within the arena of politics’ (p. 246) – seen, for instance, in the ‘miracle’ (inaccessible to knowledge, radically distanced from anything like a programme) of Badiou’s Event. Toscano’s closing note continues this comradely interrogation, insisting, on the one hand, on the necessity of ‘unconditional conviction and principled egalitarianism’ (p. 250) and on the place of the abstract in politics – against what Žižek has called the ‘prohibition on thinking’ effectively pronounced by anti-totalitarian discourse; but, on the other hand, after Marx and Bloch, this abstraction must be ‘accompanied by an effort to account for the emergence, autonomization and power of real abstractions’ (p. 251), and we must remember that ‘politics is not reducible to the cry, the clash or the axiom’, that ‘urgency and intransigence must be coupled with patience and strategy, if there is ever to be a history without fanaticism’ (p. 253).</p>
<p>A great read – richly researched and argued, well-aimed, both polemical and thoughtful – Toscano’s book will prove both a well-deserved annoyance to his political opponents and a well-needed push to communist friends.</p>
