<p>Presidential Address at the Association for Applied and Clinical Sociology</p>
<p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin, October 6, 2012</p>
<p>In this address, I show how women who create, own, and operate their own businesses in harness horse racing approach and view their work. How do women in harness horse racing do it their way?—In their ways of doing business, and by using their voices, strong self-concept, and solidarity to resist the structural and cultural barriers to their goals of making a living and by treating their racehorses humanely. I draw on the voices of women owners, trainers, and drivers from my 2002 ethnographic study of Pittsburgh harness horse racing to illustrate my points. Heidi, a fourth generation harness horseman, owner-trainer-driver, explains “doing it her way”:
<disp-quote>
<p>I can’t do it. Because they’re an animal to me, you know, and that’s back to the thing where you know you like these animals, you respect them, or you do it because of the money. I mean, yeah, I’d like to make way more money than I’m making, but I’m not gonna chance hurting my animal to do that. So I’ll be happy with what I make <italic>doing it my way</italic> and you know, if you want to, [you] go ahead and damage your animal. You make that animal! You don’t rely on drugs to make that animal for you, you know?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724413492664">Baumgardner and Richards (2010)</xref> note, “Feminists today are more likely to be individuals living quietly . . . living self-determined lives than radicals on the ramparts” (p. 36), and Heidi exemplifies this strategy in her ways of doing business and living her life. Heidi resisted the male structures of harness racing in the ways she conducted business. She did not put her horses on drugs to better their performance. Her respect for the animals led her to deal with her horses in caring ways once they were too old for the racetrack. In this way, she went against the extant philosophy of horses as tools, as things that can be artificially pumped up while they are useful and then dispassionately disposed of when they are used up. Respect for the animal encouraged Heidi to stay away from using drugs on the horse to assist its performance. Instead of viewing and treating these racehorses as things to be controlled and ultimately discarded, Heidi took the responsibility of improving her horses by working respectfully with them and treating them as dignified living beings.</p>
<p>Women business owners in harness racing are caught in something like a vicious circle, a situation in which the apparent solution of one problem in a chain of circumstances creates a new problem and increases the difficulty of solving the old problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1936724413492664">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>It works like this: to win races, a trainer or driver needs to attract the owners of fast, first-rate horses. To attract customers like that, one needs to have a good reputation, since there are no résumés in this business, nothing else by which to judge a person. To develop a good reputation, a person needs to have frequent opportunities to demonstrate his or her skills in front of others. Because the owners of these good, expensive horses generally believe that women are not up to the task of driving them, these jobs usually go to men.</p>
<p>Owners also tend to believe that women are incapable of being good trainers, too. Because they are not entrusted with these fine horses, the women most often have to go out and buy their own racehorses with what money they personally possess, which almost certainly results in women training horses of considerably lower quality than those of the men. Since they are also the owners, the women trainers must assume all the horses’ expenses themselves. And, as people frequently told me, the cheap horses eat just as much as the expensive ones.</p>
<p>The women may drive their own horses once a week, but do not get the opportunities that catch-drivers or drivers-for-hire, do to hone their skills on a nightly basis among a small set of the same, top drivers. In short, to gain respect and keep a good reputation in harness racing, a person needs good horses and frequent opportunities to develop and display his or her skills at training or driving. Women are largely denied these chances. They therefore can neither develop nor exhibit the skills that are central to gaining respect, reputation, visibility, opportunity, and success. I call this phenomenon the <italic>vicious oval</italic>, a play on the term <italic>vicious circle</italic>, using “oval” since this is the shape of most racetracks.</p>
<p>Nicola is an owner-trainer-breeder whose husband, Dylan, drives their horses at the races. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724413492664">Bruni, Gherardi, and Poggio (2004)</xref> found that <italic>not</italic> being identified as an entrepreneur can provide some women with a justification for “not doing what an entrepreneur should do” and also for “doing what an entrepreneur shouldn’t do” (p. 417). Listen to Nicola’s voice as she explains how she cares for a retired racehorse and how she scrutinizes all horse buyers and creates her own rules rather than going by tradition or expected practice:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have a retired horse out there, a horse that made me quite a bit of money and I always promised him . . . that I would take care of him for the rest of his life and I look at him out in the field and uh now that he’s retired and Dylan’ll say something about you know, the horse the horse the horse, I said you know what? . . . I’ll make my own decisions about stuff like that . . . I try to stand my ground as a woman in harness racing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here is how Nicola deals with people who want to buy her horses and use performance-enhancing drugs on them:
<disp-quote>
<p>See that’s why . . . we can sell our horses so easily . . . because they say, well, uh, we like to buy off of you . . . because your horses are clean. Well, so as soon as they say that to me, I tell Dylan, you know what? We ain’t selling them! Because that tells me that they’re looking for a clean horse that they can use drugs on and make him go faster and I won’t, I won’t tolerate that unless I have to. And like I said, I tell Dylan, unless there comes a time in my life when I’m eating crackers and cheese, my horses won’t go that direction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An attitude of toughness, persistence, and independence pervaded the women’s narratives and suggested that their strong sense of self operated as a form of resistance. Look at how Heidi explains how she deals with her deeply gendered work environment:
<disp-quote>
<p>You’re not in the clique, as they say, with the guys. I don’t care I ain’t, that’s where that stubbornness . . . I’m doing my own, you know, I mean that’s just the way I am . . . [The men will say] we don’t want them bimbettes out there. You know, stuff like that you gotta hear . . . It’s kind of goofy, you know they’re gonna do it, so like it doesn’t bother me, ‘cause I feel, you know, I guess secure enough with myself that I don’t really care what they say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a sometimes hostile work environment, women in harness racing quietly carve out space where they can manage autonomously and draw boundaries around the pervasive ideologies. For example, Lila was not particularly vocal on matters of gender, work, and power, but prominently displayed a little wooden sign in the ground outside her barn that said, “The Witch is in and casting spells,” a statement designed to convey toughness. Other than that, she did not seek to differentiate herself from her male colleagues, preferring, as she said, to “stay out of the politics and just do my work, go home.”</p>
<p>Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724413492664">Lewis (2006)</xref> found, even those women who subscribe to an ideology of gender blindness and “seek to highlight their similarity to their male entrepreneurial colleagues and to play down their difference may bring to the fore the ways gender is inherent in enterprise and entrepreneurship” (p. 467). Lila and her husband Justin did not work together in the same barn but operated different stables. Lila trained the horses owned by a pharmacist who lived in the area. By independently running a private stable, with only one external owner, Lila also resisted the potential problems connected to running a public stable and constantly having to seek out new owners for business. She persisted by tweaking the existing system in ways that worked for her as a woman in harness racing. Nicola engaged in comparable self-protection by operating as the sole owner of her horses. Having seen how women lacked respect in the business, she said, “I took it in my own hands just to buy my own [horses to train].”</p>
<p>In my ethnographic fieldwork at the racetrack, I learned of just one instance of group solidarity among the women trainers and drivers: a battle of sexes race that pitted male and female drivers against each other. Heidi recalls,
<disp-quote>
<p>That was a lot of fun. ‘Cause you had [top male driver] and I can’t remember who the heck the [other] top guys were at the time here . . . we set up our strategy before the race, you know, like which one of us had to go out there, try to get to the front, run some of them guys down, get those horses tired so the rest of us girls could sweep them!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This unity and collaboration was fun for Heidi, but was short-lived and had no momentum beyond the actual race. On an everyday basis, this kind of working together among harness racing women was not visible. Nonetheless, Heidi’s sense of the event being fun is important. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724413492664">Baumgardner and Richards (2010)</xref> note about third wave feminists, “this generation is predestined to fight against the . . . stereotype of being too serious, too political, and seemingly asexual” (p. 137).</p>
<p>To summarize, what kinds of things do harness racing women do to resist within the current structures of harness racing? They keep their horses off drugs, and price them so high that buyers who hope to use drugs on these clean horses will be discouraged. Sometimes, they use natural remedies to avoid traditional medicine. They work through their pregnancies, they divorce men who try to put them in the background, they offer their input, they resist sexist jokes, fire disrespectful male employees, and even humorously threaten others with signs that say they are witches and casting spells. And albeit rarely, they come together as a group and have fun plotting how to collectively overcome the men.</p>
<p>For a long time, harness racing has operated according to the values and standards of a very small subgroup of owners, trainers, and drivers. As the horse racing business struggles in the United States, economically bolstered largely by adjacent casinos not particularly sympathetic to its challenges, a wider range and variety of entrepreneurial styles and practices may be vital to its preservation and continuance.</p>
<p>The connotation of <italic>entrepreneur</italic> has been a traditionally masculine one, based on growth, unlimited profit, and belief in the neutrality and meritocracy of the business world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724413492664">Lewis 2006</xref>). Evidence that some women are approaching their own entrepreneurship differently may help us in reconsidering the concept, especially now when social and human capital and service are becoming increasingly important in today’s economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724413492664">Kyro 2009</xref>). Business owners tend to shape the culture of their organizations to be consistent with their personal motivations, perceived challenges, and personal characteristics, and may want to be more attentive to the culture and internal environment that they are creating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724413492664">Adkins et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724413492664">Strier (2010)</xref> found that microenterprise tends to serve as an <italic>individual</italic> shelter for women from labor and gender oppression, and as an opportunity for self-expression and self-determination, but not as a space for <italic>collective</italic> resistance to poverty and gender oppression. Strong structural and systemic barriers remain, and providing start-up capital and affordable credit terms are necessary to women’s success as business owners and operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724413492664">Strier 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724413492664">Kyro (2009)</xref>, in a Finnish context, found that self-employment was important to women: they wanted to be their own bosses and make their dreams come true. They focused on work satisfaction and a holistic life emphasizing family, flexibility, customer satisfaction, and good professional performance, and minimized the role of financial affairs as a necessity rather than as a goal of their businesses.</p>
