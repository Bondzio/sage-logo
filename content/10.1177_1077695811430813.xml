<p>The art of storytelling, across a variety of media platforms, is transforming journalism and media education. Hart’s <italic>Story Craft</italic> succeeds by focusing on “narrative possibilities” for those with a passion for storytelling because of application breadth:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Story makes sense out of a confusing universe by showing us how one action leads to another. It teaches us how to live by discovering how our fellow human beings overcome the challenges in their lives. And it helps us discover the universals that bind us to everything around us. (p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Story, to Hart, is universal because a good story has no print and broadcast division. Thus, the opening chapter reveals the essential principles—a sequence of actions, a sympathetic character, a complication, and a resolution. From this foundation, Hart smoothly moves the readers to structure. Visual representations of a narrative arc explained through useful examples.</p>
<p><italic>Story Craft</italic> then turns to the importance of a point of view. Rather than wrestling with journalistic objectivity, Hart challenges the reader to consider decisions about stance, distance, and the ladder of abstraction, which he sees as “one of the most useful concepts for any writer” (p. 55).</p>
<p>Young writers often struggle to find their voice and style, but Hart drills down by identifying and explaining institutional voice, the first person voice, persona, and position. While some find fun in developing voice, Hart admits to his readers that it is more like pain reduction: “So I try to relax, sliding into an easy rhythm that moves ahead quickly and smoothly” (p. 74). Hart moves on in the book to address, through brief chapters, character, scene, and dialogue. A former managing editor and writing coach at <italic>The Oregonian</italic> and faculty member at six universities, he clearly brings a liberal arts perspective to journalism. He reserves for chapter 10 the topic of reporting and notes, “The newsies who’d been trained my way, with pro forma beat reporting and a checklist of official sources, were skeptical of the narrative approach” (p. 146). It demands immersion, access, observation, reconstructive narrative, interviewing, and an eye for a story. Throughout the book, Hart’s examples return the reader to the narrative arc to demonstrate exactly how and where stories use narrative structure and technique. While the reader may now be ready for Hart’s concluding chapter on ethics, some journalism professors may worry that it again has been relegated to the end of the textbook. Likewise, there is little here to signal to the novice storyteller that his or her work may raise legal concerns.</p>
<p>If great storytelling skills are what is needed to save American newspapers and electronic media from the tsunami of technological change brought by the Internet, Thornburg’s <italic>Producing Online News</italic> takes the point of view that online news is different:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As an online journalist, you’ll still work with the traditional elements and values of news. But you’ll also take advantage of the three attributes of online communication that make reporting, producing and distributing your stories via the Internet fundamentally different from working in any other medium. (p. 8).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thornburg divides the terrain into multimedia (“a variety of choices about how to combine storytelling techniques”), interactive, and on-demand. Thus, reproduced Twitter streams about the 2010 health care vote appear on the second and third pages of the book; and this is followed by a vote map, online stories, an online video screen shot, subsequent comments, and Google Insights for Search data.</p>
<p><italic>Producing Online News</italic> then backs into news values and elements in the second chapter. This will be familiar territory found in traditional reporting textbooks, but Thornburg adds a myriad of online news screen shots to appeal to visual learners. Still, the chapter content could be lost in the visuals, which may encourage the reader to move along too quickly.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on elements of narrative and reporting, this book encourages the journalism student to think about the online news audience, managing online site content, editing and keywords, and search engine optimization (SEO). The message is clear that journalists must understand marketing.</p>
<p>While Thornburg sees news as adhering to traditional rules of journalism, his chapter on Web research signals a different method of source cultivation that includes online links. Here, journalism students read about how to conduct an online search and use a Twitter hashtag. Chapters on linking, multimedia reporting, and data prepare the reader to see the journalism process as fluid. It is as much about blogs and breaking news as it is about audience engagement:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The interactivity of the Web has brought an end to one-way flow. Reporters are now answering questions from the audience. Politicians, businesspeople and celebrities are now speaking directly to the audience, without a reporter as an intermediary. And the audience is now demanding explanations, both from reporters and directly from sources. It is getting harder to tell who is the reporter, who is the source and who is the audience. (pp. 306–7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The conversation of journalism today leads Thornburg to conclude his book with a chapter called “Remixing the News” (p. 333). He describes a type of journalism filled with data distribution, nonlinear narratives, chunks, links, and filters. This ends abruptly by saying that the remix is “one of the most creative aspects of online journalism,” and reuse of information and tools “can help you find and present patterns that might have remained unclear otherwise” (p. 357). As with each of the other eleven chapters, the book offers online learning modules to teach techniques.</p>
<p>In a recent visit to the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, I saw evidence of traditional and online journalism surviving as separate subcultures. Hart and Thornburg accurately reflect the separate yet overlapping worldviews. Journalism and mass communication educators should be careful to make curriculum decisions that respect the narrative and storytelling craft, as well as online journalism skills. Both will be important for the survival of journalism as a relevant area of study and professional path.</p>
