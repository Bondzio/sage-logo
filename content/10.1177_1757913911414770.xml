<abstract>
<p>Health systems strengthening (HSS) is being increasingly recognized as a strategic cross-cutting issue in all World Health Organization (WHO) work. Health systems comprise six building blocks: service delivery; medical products, vaccines and technologies; health workforce; health systems financing; health information system; and leadership and governance. Public–private mix (PPM) approaches or partnerships consist of initiatives aimed at increasing collaboration and improving the relationships between public–public, public–private and private–private health providers. An important component of PPM is the clear distribution of tasks between the different providers involved in the provision of health care. In practice, most PPM initiatives are disease-specific and are often related to the health service delivery block mentioned above. Although there is widespread consensus that PPM initiatives are typically of an HSS nature, efforts to make explicit the links between PPM and health systems building blocks are rather uncommon. The present paper aims to identify – in order to facilitate operationalization – potential aspects linking PPM to health systems building blocks, using a few experiences from tuberculosis control and beyond. The paper targets policymakers, donors and health systems scientists and ends with a call for more aware and innovative leadership, for increased support of PPM initiatives covering various building blocks, and for more operational research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health systems strengthening (HSS) is being increasingly recognized as a strategic cross-cutting issue in all World Health Organization (WHO) work. The WHO framework for action defines health systems as ‘all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911414770">1</xref></sup> According to this framework, health systems are made of six building blocks: service delivery; medical products, vaccines and technologies; health workforce; health systems financing; health information system; and leadership and governance. HSS involves any effort to improve one or several aspects of health systems building blocks and to enhance equity and sustainability in health systems and health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911414770">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The above definition of health systems is broad and includes efforts by organizations and actors from the public and private sectors, including for-profit, not-for-profit and informal care providers. Partnerships between public and private sectors are referred to using various denominations, often as public–private partnerships (PPPs). In the global tuberculosis (TB) community, such partnerships are called public–private mix (PPM) approaches. PPM approaches consist of initiatives aimed at increasing collaboration and improving the relationships between public and private health sectors, and involve a clear distribution of tasks between the different providers in the provision of health services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911414770">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The whole rationale behind PPM approaches is based on the fact that people seek care from different health providers for various ailments, and for different reasons, including financial and cultural or for geographical proximity. There is an indication that a substantial proportion of the population in virtually every society resorts to private sector care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911414770">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911414770">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>The role of non-state providers in health care provision</title>
<list id="list1-1757913911414770" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A review of Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data from 38 countries showed that in the poorest quintile, 34%–96% of children seeking care for diarrhoea received it from the non-public sector, while 37%–99% of children seeking care for acute respiratory tract infection received it in the non-public sector.</p></list-item>

</boxed-text>
<p>The increasing importance of the role of the private sector in health care in most low- and middle-income countries implies that there is unlikely to be any significant improvement in health systems performance unless the private sector is adequately involved. In such settings, where private providers attend to a significant proportion of the population’s health needs, both vertical programmes and general health services should seek to build a sustainable relationship with the private sector.</p>
<p>However, despite the consensus of the importance of the private sector in health, the links between PPM and the whole spectrum of HSS are barely discussed in explicit terms. One reason for this is that, in practice, most PPM initiatives are disease-specific. Therefore, PPM is often referred to from the perspective of delivery of services for the disease concerned. This is true even at a global level: out of 90 international PPPs in health identified by Barr,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911414770">5</xref></sup> only one focused on improving health systems beyond specific diseases. The predominance of PPM in vertical programmes can be said to be a result of increased external funding made available for disease-specific programmes, as compared to resources allocated to general health services. It is only recently that HSS has re-emerged as a priority in the international public health discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911414770">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913911414770">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since health systems are the skeleton on which all public health actions are grounded, disease-specific programmes should also ensure that they strengthen overall health systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911414770">8</xref></sup> just as health systems design should enhance disease-specific programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913911414770">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913911414770">10</xref></sup> This paper is an exercise in defining the potential role of private sector actors (individual or corporate providers, private logistical companies, insurance companies, training institutions, etc.) in HSS. It is an attempt to contribute to what has recently been called ‘the systems thinking for health systems strengthening’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913911414770">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to elucidate the potential contribution of public and private collaborative frameworks to the different aspects of the six building blocks that constitute health systems. The focus of this paper is on operationalizing the contribution of PPM to HSS. The paper is primarily about low-income countries.</p>
<sec id="section2-1757913911414770">
<title>Key documentary sources and approach</title>
<p>The discussion will purposefully focus on health systems issues in a typical low-income context, essentially Africa. I will mostly rely on recent documentary sources that form the current discourse on public and private partnerships in health care. These publications emanate from the main global health institutions, including WHO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911414770">1</xref></sup> the World Bank Group/International Finance Corporation (IFC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research (AHPSR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913911414770">13</xref></sup> and other critical publications from the Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored project on the role of private providers in health systems, implemented by Results for Development Institute in 2008–2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913911414770">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913911414770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913911414770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913911414770">17</xref></sup> The 63rd World Health Assembly Resolution (March 2010) on the issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757913911414770">18</xref></sup> is another indication of the significant shift in the global health discourse towards recognition of the private sector’s role in health systems development.</p>
<p>As far as the approach is concerned, it is essential to emphasize that several PPM initiatives are already happening, although it is not always clear how they contribute to health systems development. This paper is essentially about what aspects of PPM could be useful for HSS (with all its components). I have opted to refer to WHO Stop TB Department’s PPM policy guidance and literature from TB control efforts in African countries, the reason being that PPM in TB control appears relatively well developed compared to the attempt of other global disease-specific programmes to guide the involvement of private providers.</p>

<title>PPM and health services delivery improvement</title>
<sec id="section5-1757913911414770">
<title>An essential component of health systems</title>
<p>The health services delivery component gives the most accurate information as regards to how good a health system is in providing the services and commodities needed to improve population health. Services might be delivered in health facilities, at home, within the community and at the workplace. Delivery of services has primarily to do with access to services of good quality and provided in the safest conditions.</p>
<p>PPM is evidently most associated with this particular component of health system. The role of the private sector in health care provision is significant and growing virtually everywhere. In Africa, for instance, half of health care provision is in the hands of private providers (even excluding informal providers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, according to recent estimates by the IFC, health services delivery will account for half of the private investment opportunities in health care in sub-Saharan Africa for the next decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> PPM approaches might increase the provider base for health services provision and contribute to increased coverage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913911414770">
<title>Mechanisms of involvement</title>
<p>There are a variety of mechanisms to improve coverage of services by using private providers, including social marketing, vouchers, contracting out, franchising, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757913911414770">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757913911414770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757913911414770">21</xref></sup> Contextual specificities should motivate the choice between different strategies of involving private providers, and strategies might differ depending on targeted types of providers or groups of users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, access to health services might be increased for example by relying on training, accreditation and supervision of informal providers (e.g. practitioners of traditional medicine, village pharmacists, etc.) in areas where they are most likely to attend to targeted groups of patients such as rural dwellers. Vouchers might be used to improve access to specific services by poorer social strata, allowing them to access private provider services either free of charge or at subsidized prices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757913911414770">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most strategies involving private providers in service delivery have been developed within the contexts of specific disease control (HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria) and family planning programmes, and few have been scaled up. In Africa, Kenyan and Nigerian PPM experiences have demonstrated that private providers can effectively be involved in TB control according to national guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913911414770">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757913911414770">24</xref></sup> The evidence from Africa and elsewhere has been compelling in terms of gains in increased numbers of suspected TB cases referred for sputum microscopy, significant contribution of non-public providers to the detection of new TB cases, and participation in treatment and its supervision. This has been the basis for the WHO guidelines on PPM approaches that many countries are now implementing in TB control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911414770">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757913911414770">
<title>Integration and continuity of care</title>
<p>The strength of a delivery system depends on the types of connections between the different existing actors in the service delivery chain and between sites. Indeed, efficient service delivery presupposes a well-functioning network of providers and levels of care, as well as integrated continuity of care.</p>
<p>Involving private providers is likely to reduce fragmentation of health services among types of providers and levels of care, and provides ample scope for continuity of care. The majority of patients with all types of ailments would probably benefit from a more coherent, integrated and continuous health care provision than having to ‘shop around’ among discrete and non-connected providers. This underscores the necessity of having efficient referral systems between different types of providers and levels of service delivery (including private and informal providers), resulting in reductions in diagnostic delays (e.g. for TB patients) and in better care for patients affected by multiple diseases (e.g. TB/HIV co-infected patients). In TB care, approaches such as Practical Approach to Lung Health (PAL) suggest a comprehensive health care delivery package addressing the challenge of the large burden of acute and chronic respiratory diseases in primary health care settings, irrespective of the nature of the provider, i.e. be it public or private.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757913911414770">25</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1757913911414770">
<title>Equity and quality of services</title>
<p>National policy vis-à-vis the private sector should consider both high-end hospitals/clinics mostly located in urban areas that serve the generally wealthy strata, and high-volume, low-cost hospitals mainly serving low-income population groups. It is recognized that the latter have greater development impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> and thus make a more substantial contribution to HSS and equity in access to care. However, private high-end comparative advantages in terms of availability of specialty care and advanced technology should also be capitalized upon.</p>
<p>Increased coverage is highly desirable but insufficient unless it is accompanied by an improvement in the quality of provided services, and even harmful if users’ safety is not enhanced. There is concern about the quality of services offered by private providers, although poor quality is also reported in public facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757913911414770">26</xref></sup> Strategies to address quality issues might include actions on the supply side, such as regulation to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics, increased frequency and rigour in supervision, development and enforcement of quality standards, training of providers, provision of material and commodity to private providers, etc. Actions on the demand side might include information to service users about service quality requirements and their empowerment so that they can participate in the assessment of service quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757913911414770">21</xref></sup> From a TB control perspective, some quality and equity dimensions are being promoted by tools such as International Standards of TB Care (ISTC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757913911414770">27</xref></sup> and Patients Charter for TB Care (PCTB),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757913911414770">28</xref></sup> which are increasingly being disseminated among private providers.</p>

<title>PPM and health workforce challenges</title>
<sec id="section10-1757913911414770">
<title>Better use of available human resources</title>
<p>Shortage of human resources for health (HRH) is known to be one of the major bottlenecks in health systems in most developing countries. According to estimates by WHO, sub-Saharan Africa needs about 1.3 million more health professionals – of whom 750,000 are health delivery workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757913911414770">29</xref></sup> Of the available health care personnel, 70% of the physicians and 50% of other health workers in Africa are reportedly employed by the public sector. The same report calls for caution in interpreting these figures, given that most health workers actually have dual employment in the public and private sectors. For instance, it was found in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa that 60% of physicians in the public sector were formally employed in the private sector too.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757913911414770">29</xref></sup> Therefore, the size of the actual human resources involved in private health care provision might be more significant than perceived.</p>
<p>The contribution of the private sector in improving the availability of human resources in health care can be considered from two perspectives: better use of the current stock of human resources, and production of new resources. As regards existing health care personnel, the involvement of private providers might allow better inventory, oversight and task allocation between health care providers considering geographical distribution and capacity. Indeed, it is a fact that most governments do not fully know how many people are working in the private health sector and where they are located. Spatial mapping exercises of private health workers in Ujjain, India demonstrated that there were significantly more private providers than those registered with public authorities and that qualified ones were over-concentrated in urban settings whereas non-qualified and informal providers were predominantly in rural areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757913911414770">30</xref></sup> A similar assessment in Kenya found that out of 6,674 service facilities identified, 50% were private providers, of which only 39% were registered on government databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757913911414770">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Private providers (both formal and informal) represent a significant proportion of human resources for health care. Of course, there are issues related to diversity and qualification among the available workers. However, even the less-qualified providers in the private and informal sector represent resources and capacity that might be used. A systematic task-shifting approach would allow for complementation and required skills development. In TB control, PPM attempts to involve informal providers in increasing TB case detection and supervision of treatment are examples of practical task shifting that free clinical personnel from many unqualified tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757913911414770">32</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1757913911414770">
<title>Production of additional health personnel</title>
<p>According to estimates, 90,000 physicians, 500,000 nurses and 300,000 community health workers are needed in sub-Saharan Africa in addition to what local training institutions are capable of producing. This is an important potential market for private actors to contribute to health workforce production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> requiring enormous capital and organizational capacity as well as a conducive policy environment. Encouraging the development of privately owned training institutions and ensuring they follow adequate curricula that reflect the national objectives of health workforce development would be essential and would expand the overall capacity of the health care system, thus addressing some of the critical reasons for human resource shortages. Models of private health-related training institutions that exist in sub-Saharan Africa include large multidisciplinary universities, schools for nurses, midwives and lab technicians, and distance learning for nurses. Also, teaching hospitals associated with such private universities and colleges should be linked into the general health systems provision network.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-1757913911414770">
<title>PPM for comprehensiveness of health information systems</title>
<p>The production, analysis, dissemination and use of reliable information for decision-making, both on a regular basis and in emergencies, are key features of functioning health information systems. The health information infrastructure is part of the overall leadership and governance role of a country’s health ministry. Indeed, as part of their basic function, authorities should be able to maintain a system that provides basic general data related to population health status, health determinants, an inventory of available health care providers, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, public health sector information systems in most developing countries are far from comprehensive. For instance, as mentioned above, studies on spatial mapping of health care providers in an Indian province<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757913911414770">30</xref></sup> and in Kenya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757913911414770">31</xref></sup> indicated that official databases fail to contain as many as half of the available health care providers. Among the consequences of inadequate health information systems might be the lack of referral mechanisms between different levels of care, resulting in patients frequently bypassing certain levels of the health care system.</p>
<p>If the responsibility for the setting up and management of information systems lies with the national authorities, their improvement is a function of the inputs from all those who are active in any aspect of health (service provision, insurance, training, health research, etc.), including private providers, international donors and technical agencies such as WHO. The standardization of health data collection instruments and awareness of reporting mechanisms among all health care providers are fundamental and private organizations need to be well acquainted with data management procedures. The recent WHO guidelines on TB routine data now include information on whether the service provider is a public or a private one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757913911414770">33</xref></sup> In this way, the contribution of private actors to TB control is highlighted, and the information produced can therefore be used to affect policy on private TB control providers.</p>

<title>Medical products and technologies and PPM</title>
<sec id="section14-1757913911414770">
<title>Production of medical products</title>
<p>There is tremendous potential here for private providers to play a role in the procurement, distribution and production of new products. Generally, medical product manufacturers in the poorest countries produce at a cost disadvantage compared to large-scale manufacturers found for instance in Asian countries. As regards <italic>production of new products</italic>, both for-profit and not-for-profit private actors might be considered. The regulatory framework, addressing taxes and import barriers, needs to be adequately set up to support local initiatives. Several private actors (e.g. commercial and research institutions) are involved in partnerships with donors to develop new drugs, vaccines or diagnostic equipment needed to fight major diseases such as HIV, TB and malaria. These schemes are to be encouraged, and their role in strengthening overall systems in needy countries must be assessed and made explicit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1757913911414770">
<title>Procurement processes</title>
<p>Reliable private organizations (pharmacy chains, multi-sector distributors, etc.) with adequate logistics and human resource capacity can be commissioned to take on <italic>procurement</italic> tasks in countries. Funding to support private providers’ involvement in these aspects might originate from global donor initiatives such as the Global Fund. Procurement is reported to be one of the components where for-profit private actors have mostly been involved in donor-funded initiatives in health care systems in Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> However, private providers’ involvement in the distribution and retail of medical products and drugs is a sensitive issue in health care, considering the challenge posed by counterfeit and substandard drugs, together with risks of leakages of drugs from national procurement channels. The indications are that <italic>pooling procurement</italic> minimizes the risk of leakage and ensures efficiency of the procurement chain.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be learned from experiences gained from national disease (TB, HIV) and immunization programmes to see what methods and procedures can be adopted by private actors. It should be recognized that too-fragmented a supply chain is often one of the main factors leading to counterfeit products. Provided an appropriate regulatory framework is put in place to discourage excessive profit making, private providers can play a critical role in improving supply chain effectiveness and thus enhancing health systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913911414770">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regards to informal providers, mainly drugs peddlers, one strategy might be to support the distributors who supply them. The objective should be to improve the quality of the service the peddlers provide to end consumers and ensure that the drugs sold are of an acceptable quality. Information on drug use and training of peddlers might be organized by or with the assistance of private drug distributors to ensure that the information is relevant to their working environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757913911414770">32</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section16-1757913911414770">
<title>Dissemination of health technology</title>
<p>Availability of health technology products relates to production and procurement processes, whereas equity has to do with equal access to such products by those in need. Lack of a coordinated policy and supervision of the dissemination of health technology by public authorities might lead to inequity and inefficiencies in health systems, as in one reported Indian case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757913911414770">34</xref></sup></p>

<title>Catalyzing domestic and foreign investment</title>
<p>Raising adequate funding to acquire the medical supplies, drugs, infrastructure and personnel needed is a key function of health systems. Most systems involve a mix of public and private financing, and it would be irrational to suggest a single template for action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911414770">1</xref></sup> The private sector can contribute to improving health financing in different ways. One way is through increasing domestic and foreign direct investment in health care. According to estimates by the IFC, there are huge opportunities in this area of business in Africa, with the need for new investments ranging between $25bn and $30bn for the current decade (including new hospitals, clinics, drugs manufacturing, distribution warehouses, etc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Social protection and risk pooling</title>
<p>On the patients’ side, affordability and social protection against the risk of financial ruin are the main issues whenever they are to pay for health care out of their own pockets. Risk pooling includes mechanisms that allow patients to share risks through pre-payment schemes. Since public social insurance systems are generally very weak in most poor countries, the private sector might play an important role by setting up corporate insurance schemes. These schemes are unfortunately often limited to covering the wealthy and those employed in the formal sector. Community-based health insurance has been widely tested in many parts of Africa, but the results indicate that sustainability is not always certain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757913911414770">35</xref></sup> Micro-health insurance, whereby people buy health insurance together with another product such as a micro-loan, is another option. The latter options might be particularly effective in catering for poorer social groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757913911414770">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the private providers’ role with regards to insurance might be considered from the perspective of <italic>vertical integration</italic>, i.e. integrating risk pooling with in-house health service provision. This formula seems attractive as the private agents act as both provider of care and financier, managing the social protection schemes for their patients. This is thought to minimize the risk of fraud and is more likely to be financially viable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911414770">12</xref></sup> Also, the provider is more accountable to the patients and the quality of service is easier to monitor.</p>
<p>From a public health perspective, one important aspect in health care financing is minimizing out-of-pocket expenses, as they tend to decrease utilization of health services among the poorest and unhealthiest and hence hamper early detection and treatment of diseases. PPM approaches should allow poorer people to benefit from high-quality care from private providers at subsidized costs or free of charge under particular conditions (HIV, TB, antenatal care, etc). Experiences from the TB field have demonstrated that PPM initiatives are more cost-effective than TB services provided only by the public sector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1757913911414770">37</xref></sup></p>

<title>Strategic guidance and strengthened leadership capacity</title>
<p>Leadership and governance are evidently the most important building blocks of a health system, without which none of the other blocks would stand. Setting the rules of private sector involvement and designing the overall policy direction are key roles devoted to governments. This involves allocating priorities, i.e. making choices between different options, providing policy guidance and supervision, and building collaboration and alliances with domestic and foreign partners. These tasks require both political and technical capacity that is not always available. Institutional capacity is therefore fundamental in order to have well-functioning health care partnerships with the private sector.</p>
<p>Involvement of the private sector might strengthen health systems if it is seen as a process through which efforts are proactively made to identify and address weaknesses with regards to a government’s capacity to manage its partnership with private providers. For instance, involving the private sector against a background of massive corruption, or lack of technically competent personnel, etc. would be extremely counterproductive. One PPM initiative in Brazil providing a franchise for health care delivery to a group of physicians collapsed because of political and technical inconsistencies and financial irregularities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1757913911414770">38</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1757913911414770">
<title>User participation in health care</title>
<p>The social accountability of PPM approaches needs to be assessed and ensured by the governing authorities. The communities, the users of the services or the civil society need to be part of the collaborative work, under the leadership and encouragement of the governing authority. This is even more crucial whenever the PPM initiative takes place at lower levels of health care (delivery of primary health care). It is up to the regulating authority to guarantee full participation of the relevant stakeholders in any such partnership.</p>
<p>Five main imperatives have been suggested by the IFC for policymakers to strengthen the private sector’s involvement in health systems. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757913911414770">Table 1</xref> expands on these conditions and provides a few examples of what might be considered viable policy options.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a consensus and subsequently increased international focus on the role of the private sector in health in low-income countries. This paper calls for an extended approach to the role of private sector in health, arguing that private actors are relevant with respect to all health system building blocks, beyond the sole health services delivery component and vertical disease control programmes. Policymakers’ awareness of this potential and their innovative and leadership capabilities are key to shaping and managing such initiatives. Moreover, donors are needed to promote non-disease-specific PPM initiatives. Operational research to assess the relevance and effectiveness of PPM initiatives with regard to different health system building blocks will be highly useful to inform health policy.</p>
