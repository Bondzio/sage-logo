<abstract>
<p>Extant scholarship on Jwarasur [the Fever-Demon] sees him as a colonial-era invention tied to the exigencies of colonial rule. Jwarasur is held to belong exclusively to the domain of Bengali ‘folk medicine’ rather than ‘classical Ayurveda’. We challenge both these contentions and draw four inter-related inferences. First, we posit that Jwarasur was not alien to classical Ayurvedic medicine. Second, we claim that Jwarasur was significant to the way Ayurvedic physicians negotiated fever. Third, we trace the invention of the folk/classical divide under colonial modernity. Finally, we posit that the divide inspired new reading strategies through which modernising Ayurvedists sought to expunge the transmateriality of Jwarasur. Jwarasur, we find, was constantly re-embedded into multiple heterogeneous traditions of medical and religio-moral practice. These diverse embeddings actively militate against the existence of any corpuscular ‘systems’ called ‘folk’ or ‘classical’ medicine. Rather Jwarasur is a common figure that networks a number of heterogeneous, amorphous domains. The extant disciplinary protocols of History, Anthropology, etc., however, are blind to this networked past and hence keep alive the colonial distinctions of ‘folk’ and ‘classical’. Our critical history contrapuntally, seeks to restore the promiscuity of these corpuscular fields and historicise the divisions that distinguish them.</p>

<body>
<p>Bengal’s infamy as a febrile land long predates British colonialism. Mighty Mughal commanders are thought to have disliked postings to the fever-infested Subah Bangla and the Akbarnama made repeated references to the pathogenic climate of the region that bred rebellion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0019464613494619">1</xref></sup> The terrible scourge, it was said, had its origins in the enraged breath that was emitted by the mighty Siva when he first heard of the suicide of his beloved wife, Durga, upon her father Daksha’s having insulted Siva. In another version of the story, fever emerged after Siva in his grief tore one of his matted locks and threw it into the fire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0019464613494619">2</xref></sup> The smoke from that fire emerged as the terrifying, all-slaying demon known as Jwar [Fever], Jwarasur [Fever-Demon] or, in some cases, Birbhadra: a vengeful creature raised from the ashes of an young love doomed by social disapproval, it hates life and delivers death.</p>
<p>Gods, be they benevolent or malevolent, have usually struggled to find a firm footing in historical writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0019464613494619">3</xref></sup> Thus, while medical histories have proliferated in recent decades, little account has been taken of Jwarasur. In the few cases where he has been mentioned, he has either been said to form a part of a peculiarly ‘Bengali system of belief’, or a form of Bengali ‘practical religion’, or indeed, less generously, as a ‘folk-deity’ exclusively of ‘ignorant lower-class people’ usually belonging to the ‘lower castes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0019464613494619">4</xref></sup> In either case, the domain to which Jwarasur belongs is seen to be quite distinct from the grand, classical tradition of Ayurvedic medicine. Some go further and argue that Jwarasur is a recently evolved god dating in all likelihood from the eighteenth century when fever epidemics ravaged southern Bengal. Yet, when we actually look at the writings of elite Bengali Kavirajes [Ayurvedic physicians] of the nineteenth century, we find that Jwarasur’s lore was central to their education and, for many of them, informed their understanding of fever in important ways. This forces us to wonder whether the alleged divides between Ayurvedic and ‘folk medicine’ are in fact an artefact of the methodological and critical frameworks of academic scholarship.</p>
<p>Jwarasur’s exile from the historical record, however, did not happen in a vacuum. It was both a part of and informed a larger project of refiguring ‘Ayurveda’ along ‘rational’ and ‘scientific’ lines. Many reformers, politicians and educationists from the late nineteenth century onwards shared the view of a fundamental divide between a classical, textual and ‘rational’ Ayurveda and a ‘folk medicine’ comprised of gods, rituals and ‘superstition’. The revival and revitalisation of the former was an urgent national duty, while the latter was at best to be catalogued as a feature of quaint bucolic culture, before being stamped out in favour of more ‘rational’ alternatives.</p>
<p>Realising this bifurcated vision meant radically refiguring the extant field of Kaviraji medical practice and education. It would not do to merely elide Jwarasur’s name from Kaviraji practice. It needed a more thoroughgoing refiguration of the ways in which the nosology of fever was medically understood. Its transmaterial dimensions, i.e., those aspects where the bodily materiality of a febrile affliction transcended its sheer materiality and became the bodily manifestation of divine being (Jwarasur), had to be carefully recalibrated. For fever to cease being the manifestation of Jwarasur had not only therapeutic, but also ontological consequences: the very category called ‘fever’ needed to be reconstituted through the extrusion of the transmaterial elements that previously constituted it.</p>
<sec id="section1-0019464613494619">
<title>Revisiting the Folk/Classical Divide</title>
<p>Jwarasur’s neglect by historians and his extrusion from modernised Ayurveda are not unique. Ola Bibi, Jhola Bibi, Ghentu, Pencho Thakur (Panchananda), Sahibosum, Dharma Pinnu and Ganga (here a Chakma spirit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0019464613494619">5</xref></sup> rather than the Hindu goddess) are only a few of the numerous pathogenic divinities known in or around Bengal. Nearly all of them suffer from the same neglect in histories of medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0019464613494619">6</xref></sup> At the heart of these elisions resides a binarism between ‘folk’ and ‘classical’ medicines. Ralph Nicholas, whose study of Jwarasur is the most extensive extant account of this divinity, articulates this binarism when he writes that, ‘Ayurvedic medicine explains disease with reference to imbalances among the three basic bodily humours. However, the Bengali belief system concerning Sitala [which includes the cult of Jwarasur] explains disease within a different framework of meaning … by reference to who controls it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0019464613494619">7</xref></sup> Poonam Bala, in her early study of the history of Ayurveda similarly identified ‘folk medicine’ with midwives, bone-setters, ‘supernatural curers of various types’, etc. The ‘concepts and practices’ of this ‘folk medicine’, she stated, was a combination of humoral theory, cosmological speculation and magical practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0019464613494619">8</xref></sup> By contrast, Ayurvedic medicine—at least in its post-Atharva Vedic form—had, she suggested, been organised wholly along a ‘scientific’ humoral theory. In recent iterations of this divide, it has been recast as one between ‘<italic>sanskrita</italic>’ (which is equated with the ‘classical’) and ‘<italic>prakrita</italic>’ (equated with the ‘folk’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0019464613494619">9</xref></sup> The former is said to be trans-regional and ‘codified’, whilst the latter is understood as ‘un-codified’ and ‘grounded in ethnicity and ecosystem’. Many, though definitely not all, of these binarisms—most notably those of Nicholas and more recently, William Sax—were informed by a necessary and laudable agenda. They sought to draw attention both to the existence of a species of medical knowledge amongst the non-elite and marginal groups that was distinctive from the elite, classical traditions as well as describe the rationality and viability of this knowledge. The agenda emerged in response to a hallowed tradition of blindness and dismissal of non-elite knowledges in favour of classical knowledges. Recent policy trends of the Indian state and media that has combined vigorous support of elite medical traditions (in what David Hardiman calls their ‘syndicated’ forms) along with a barrage of propaganda and legislation aimed at stamping out ‘irrational’ therapies, have added a political urgency to the rearticulation of the binarism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0019464613494619">10</xref></sup> These recent contextual resonances apart, the longevity of this binarism has much to do with the near-total absence of any serious historical appraisal of the constitution of this divide.</p>
<p>Historical appraisal alone, however, does not suffice to undo the binarism. The precise mode, in which the historicisation is undertaken, remains critical. Thus, the handful of scholars who have actually noticed the similarities between the Ayurvedic textual corpus and the disease-divinities, have either then proceeded to resuscitate the binarism as a distinction between different forms of explanation or interpretation, or alternatively to deny all heterogeneity and club the entire ‘indigenous’ medical landscape together as the expression of a single underlying ‘traditional Indian medical system’. For Zimmerman thus the binarism was expressed as the distinction between the ‘expectant’ and the ‘operative’ modes of explanation; whereas for Nicholas (in his work on Sitala) it was the distinction between an interpretation based on ‘biology of humors and diet’ and another based on the conception of ‘disease as a affliction’ by a divine agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0019464613494619">11</xref></sup> By contrast, Frederique Marglin, writing again on Sitala, plotted the goddess into an undifferentiated ‘traditional Indian medical system’ where the textual tradition of Ayurveda and the cult of the goddess were expressions of a single ‘unified field’ of thought and experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0019464613494619">12</xref></sup> While the former approach to historicisation risks naturalising the historically constituted sociology of medical knowledge, the latter approach fails to be adequately sensitive to the very significant asymmetries of power between ‘high Brahmanic’ and ‘low folksy’ knowledges. In the medical domain, such asymmetries have become even more conspicuous in recent decades through the post-liberalisation Indian state’s enthusiastic support for the elite medical knowledges now known collectively as AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy—and lately, Sowa Rigpa) <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> its continued antagonism, or at best apathy, towards ‘folk’ medical knowledge (with the exception of an almost purely extractive and exploitative interest in ‘folk’ pharmacopoeias).</p>
<p>Historians, as already pointed out, have almost wholly eschewed engaging with pathogenic divinities while trying to understand medical histories. The pioneering works of K.N. Panikkar and Brahmananda Gupta, or the more recent work of Poonam Bala and Kavita Sivaramakrishnan largely eschew any engagement with divinities such as Jwarasur. The three exceptions to this general rule are David Arnold’s works on Cholera and Small Pox, David Hardiman’s work on the Devi and Biswamoy Pati’s work on Dharma Pinnu. Each of these important interventions shares two basic features. First, all of them emphasise the marginality of the pathogenic divinity from the mainstream of Ayurvedic medicine. Arnold, in discussing Sitala, for instance, stated that ‘like other diseases in the Ayurvedic corpus’, Small Pox was understood within Ayurveda in humoral terms. By the nineteenth century, however, the recognition of the futility of a humorally based Ayurvedic treatment was so extensive that ‘even…physicians themselves, [recognised it] to be beyond their powers to prevent or to relieve. Thus, the only appropriate course was to seek the intercession of Sitala, a deity who had crept into Ayurvedic texts only in relatively recent times’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0019464613494619">13</xref></sup> For Hardiman and Pati, this distance, though not explicitly stated, is even more obvious.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0019464613494619">14</xref></sup> The pathogenic divinities they have examined are both worshipped conspicuously by ‘tribal’ groups who have an anxious and ambivalent relationship to Brahminic Hinduism with whose cultural repertoire the Ayurvedic canon is usually associated. Willingly or not this framework resuscitates or, at the very least, does nothing to challenge the ‘folk’/‘classical’ binarism. Though, once again, it is worth reminding ourselves that it was the politically praiseworthy goal of empowering marginal groups and their rationalities which informed each of these authors.</p>
<p>Second, all three studies focus on fairly recent inventions (in Ola Bibi’s or Dharma Pinnu’s case) or re-inventions (in the case of the Devi) of pathogenic divinities. This recentness of focus leaves us almost wholly in the dark about the longer history of such divinities. Were they purely modern inventions, or were there older genealogies to these modern forms? More importantly, what was the nature of the ‘folk’/‘classical’ binary before the advent of modernity? Was the binary of longer vintage as suggested by Anthropologists who use the model of ‘great’ and ‘little traditions’ or by literary scholars who speak of ‘cosmopolitans’ and ‘vernaculars’ (which, in our context finds resonances in terms such as ‘<italic>sanskrita</italic>’ and ‘<italic>prakrita</italic>’)?</p>
<p>These are precisely the sort of questions that we believe a thorough exploration of Jwarasur’s history will help elucidate. It will help us re-map and contextualise the broader question of the relationship between the ‘Brahminic’, ‘great’ or ‘classical’ Ayurvedic tradition and the ‘non-Brahminic’, ‘little’, ‘local’ or ‘folk’ traditions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0019464613494619">
<title>Disputing Jwarasur’s Modernity</title>
<p>Nicholas’s history of Jwarasur posits a broad correspondence between the rise of his cult and the preponderance of malarial fevers in lower Bengal from the eighteenth century. While there is enough evidence to affirm that the worship of Jwarasur peaked during febrile outbreaks, to suggest that Jwarasur’s cult itself arose in the eighteenth century is problematic. There are two major objections to this suggestion. First, there seems to be little grounds for accessing Jwarasur solely through a handful of texts written by devotees of Sitala, the pox-goddess. Jwarasur’s descriptions and narratives were long available in a number of other texts, including in such canonical texts as the Mahabharata. Moreover, we have a number of accounts from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that suggest that Jwarasur was not always worshipped alongside Sitala. Haraprasad Shastri from the late nineteenth century, Dipankar Das from the early twentieth century and Gopendrakrishna Basu from slightly later in the twentieth century have left us accounts of how Jwarasur is also worshipped either independently or alongside a range of other ‘disease-deities’ such as Dharma Thakur, Panchananda, Ola Bibi, etc., in composite shrines. While it is true that most contemporary worship of Jwarasur seems to be bound up with Sitala’s cult, this was by no means a universal phenomenon. Nicholas’s evidence at best suggests a more prominent affiliation of Jwarasur within the Sitala cult. It cannot in anyway tell us anything about whether Jwarasur’s worship was new in the eighteenth century or not.</p>
<p>A second and more important problem in Nicholas’s formulation is that he does not take account of the politics of the archive. The pre-colonial and the colonial archives are not identical: they record different things and do so in different ways; and, most crucially, the pre-colonial archive lacks anything like the colonial ethnographic record. Most of the evidence of Jwarasur’s cult in the colonial period emerges initially in ethnographic texts such as District Gazetteers and Settlement Reports. Later administrator–ethnographers like William Crooke contributed further to the building of this archive. Finally, nationalistically-minded folklorists collected further evidence of the Jwarasur cult. There is nothing like this in the pre-colonial period. With the occasional and rather serendipitous exception of travellers’ accounts (where Jwarasur is absent), no pre-colonial government—to the best of our knowledge—sought to produce descriptive accounts of ‘popular’ religiosity. There is thus nothing to compare Jwarasur’s colonial career with. It is very possible that Jwarasur’s cult existed before colonialism, but did not produce a significant textual trace. Non-textual archives, such as statuary, do seem to hint at closely related, if not identical, fever-gods being worshipped well-before the colonial water-shed. It would thus be misleading to conflate colonialism’s more capacious recording practices with the actual production of new cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p>There is indeed enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that Jwarasur existed long before the fever epidemics of early modernity. While we do not have any descriptive accounts of his cult, he is well established within both the epic and the medical–textual corpus. Moreover, some observers have even suggested that iconographic, rather than purely textual, analysis might suggest an even deeper past of Jwarasur that connects it to deities of the Vajrayana Buddhist pantheon that had thrived in eastern South Asia. Kenneth Zysk has pointed out that the Atharva Veda speaks of fever as a demon called Takman. The text had also posited an implicit connection between Takman and Rudra—a deity who would later come to be identified with Siva.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0019464613494619">15</xref></sup> This connection was re-organised and re-stated in the <italic>Charaka Samhita</italic>—arguably the most important Ayurvedic classic<italic>.</italic> Gavin Flood points out that Rudra was originally a peripheral god in the Vedic pantheon. It was by the fourth or fifth BCE that Rudra became identified with Siva and the composite deity was raised to the position of ‘the supreme absolute, the efficient and material cause of the cosmos’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0019464613494619">16</xref></sup> It is this identity of Rudra-Siva that was articulated in the <italic>Charaka.</italic> According to the <italic>Charaka</italic>, having been slighted at a sacrifice performed by the mythic king, Daksha, Rudra broke his vow of calmness and in his wrath opened his third-eye. The fire-spitting third-eye first burnt the demons that, taking advantage of Siva’s vow, had become recalcitrant. Subsequently, the third-eye produced ‘enemy-vanquishing arrows heated by the fire of the Lord’s wrath’. The arrows destroyed Daksha’s sacrifice, made the gods wince in pain and the living beings suffered in immense heat. Rudra was finally pacified by the gods after much effort and he resumed his beatific form as Siva. It was then that the Lord’s wrath-fire (<italic>krodhagni</italic>) approached the Lord with folded arms and asked: ‘Oh Lord! What should I do now’? Hearing this, Rudra/Siva ordered the embodied wrath-fire to ‘live in the bodies of mortals during birth, death and in-between these two events in the form of fever’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0019464613494619">17</xref></sup> In narrating the story, <italic>Charaka</italic> significantly also uses the names Mahadev and Maheswar to designate Rudra.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0019464613494619">18</xref></sup> This account subsequently became the standard account for the origin of fever and was nearly universally reproduced in Ayurvedic/Kaviraji texts. The <italic>Susruta Samhita</italic>, for instance, briefly mentioned that fever arose from the fire of Rudra’s anger (<italic>kopagni</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0019464613494619">19</xref></sup> The <italic>Nidana</italic> opens its discussion of fever by stating that, ‘the source of … [fever] is the exhalation of Rudra, whose violent wrath had been aroused by the disrespect of Daksha….’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0019464613494619">20</xref></sup> Vijayrakshit’s commentary on the passage recounted the full story of its origin by drawing upon the <italic>Charaka.</italic> At first glance the commentary seems to downplay this magical dimension to some extent by stating that Rudra’s anger was only the ‘distant cause’ and that it was ‘inapplicable with regard to therapy’. On closer reading however, we find that Vijayrakshit was careful not to wholly rule out this dimension in the treatment of fever. He stated that ‘[o]thers, however, say: (fever) has been shown to deserve worship…’. He also pointed out that, Videha had said that ‘fever becomes appeased at once by acts of worship’. Finally, Vijayrakshit drew upon the <italic>Harivamsa</italic>—a later accretion to the Mahabharata—to include an extended physical description of the fever-demon’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0019464613494619">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is even more striking than the references to the fever-demon in Ayurvedic texts is how closely these descriptions match the iconography of Jwarasur. Vijayrakshit’s description, which drew upon the <italic>Harivamsa</italic> for example, had described the demon thus: ‘fever has three feet, three heads, six arms and nine eyes; it has ashes for a weapon, is fierce (like Rudra) and resembles all-destroying time in the form of Yama’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0019464613494619">22</xref></sup> The Khulna district gazetteer provides us with an excellent comparable description of the actual form in which idols of fever were worshipped in that district at the end of the nineteenth century. According to the gazetteer, ‘his image [was] of sky blue colour, with three heads, three feet, six arms and nine eyes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0019464613494619">23</xref></sup> Gopendrakrishna Basu’s mid-twentieth century description is more fulsome. He wrote that,
<disp-quote>
<p>[Jwarasur’s] complexion is deep blue, occasionally almost black like kohl. [He has] three-heads, nine-eyes, six-arms and three-legs. The eyes and the hair are light-coloured (<italic>kata-rang</italic>, usually brown or yellow). The three heads wear three crowns and his arms and legs are adorned by various ornaments. He wears a yellow cloak (<italic>odana</italic>), dhoti and a vest-like small shirt … in 24 Parganas he is … terrifying (<italic>bibhatsa</italic>) and his body is truncated with the head being placed on a (enlarged) belly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0019464613494619">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Krishnakali Mandal, writing at the end of the twentieth century on local cults of South 24 Parganas, also mentioned the icons of fever being ‘three-headed (<italic>trimunda</italic>), three-legged (<italic>tripada</italic>), six-armed (<italic>sadabhuj</italic>) and terrifying (<italic>bhayaldarshan</italic>) and blue-complexioned (<italic>nilabarna</italic>)…’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0019464613494619">25</xref></sup> Clearly there is a fair degree of overlap between the Jwarasur of Nicholas’s ‘practical religiosity’ and the fever-demon of the Ayurvedic authors.</p>
<p>The image, however, was not merely an ossified leftover in the Ayurvedic scriptural tradition from some antique episteme that could not distinguish between material and transmaterial elements. For in many post-classical Ayurvedic texts we find a distinct elaboration of fever’s transmateriality. The <italic>Haritsamhita</italic>, believed to have been written around the eighth century, for instance, saw fever as an ‘anthropomorphic figure’ which could manifest itself in four different forms, each belonging to a different varna. Thus, we find a Raudra-Jwar who is a Brahmin, a Maharaudra or Mahendra-Jwar who is a Kshatriya, a Vaishya named Jwareswara and Sudra, Kal-Jwar. Their treatment comprised mainly of religious ceremonies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0019464613494619">26</xref></sup> Chamunda’s <italic>Jwaratimirabhaskara</italic>, written at the very end of the fifteenth century, further developed this theme by introducing a fifth Chandal fever. In Chamunda’s work, the Brahmin fever was the easiest to cure and the Kshatriya and Vaishya ones each successively more difficult to cure, while the Sudra and the Chandal were incurable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0019464613494619">27</xref></sup> The sixteenth-century work of Hamsaraj, on the other hand, expanded the description of fever’s anthropomorphic form by adding to the description available in the <italic>Madhavanidana</italic> on which it was based. Going beyond Madhavakara’s description based upon the <italic>Harivamsa</italic>, Hamsaraj added that fever was terrifying (<italic>bibhatsa</italic>), brown-coloured (<italic>kapila</italic>), yellowish-brown-eyed (<italic>pingalaksha</italic>), large-bellied (<italic>mahodara</italic>) and ash-throwing (<italic>bhasmavikshepak</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0019464613494619">28</xref></sup> These new epithets introduced by Hamsaraj are strikingly resonant with Basu’s descriptions of extant idols of Jwarasur. An even greater correspondence between this Ayurvedic description and the realm of ‘practical religion’ can be observed in a couple of <italic>dhyan-mantra</italic>s or formulas for ritual invocation of Jwarasur collected from a priest by Chintaharan Chakrabarty towards the middle of the twentieth century. These <italic>dhyan-mantras</italic> gave a vivid description of the form of Jwarasur. In line with the descriptions of Hamsaraj, they described Jwarasur as a terrifying, ash-throwing, yellowish-brown-eyed demon with yellowish-brown body hair upon a black complexion, born out of Rudra’s angered breath and possessed of three heads, three legs, six arms and nine eyes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0019464613494619">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond these textual antecedents of Jwarasur, are still other antecedents suggested by the iconographic archive. Commenting on the iconography of Jwarasur, Gopendrakrishna Basu, mentioned that,
<disp-quote>
<p>we notice a similarity of form (<italic>akritigata</italic>) between Jwarasur and some of the Buddhist deities. These deities too were healing deities. From this, we feel that the devotees of Jwarasur must have, at a time had links with the Mahayanists…[the Buddhist deities with whom Jwarasur bears a resemblance are] 1) Parnasavari—the presiding deity of Plague, Fever and other diseases [who had] three heads and six hands, [and] 2) Yamantak or Yamari, who pacified all killers [and had] a blue body and three heads.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0019464613494619">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dipankar Das, commenting on the cult of Jwarasur in Medinipur, also comments that ‘the shadow of Parnasavari might have fallen on Jwarasur…though the mode of his worship bears no resemblance to Buddhism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0019464613494619">31</xref></sup> Sitala, with whom Jwarasur frequently appears, has also been connected to Parnasavari. In fact, one stone statue found from north-eastern India and thought to belong to the tenth or eleventh century, depicted Parnasavari with Sitala, another Buddhist deity and the horse-headed Hayagriva—also a fever-deity—together. Miranda Eberle Shaw recently has identified Hayagriva with Jwarasur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0019464613494619">32</xref></sup> The connection between Hayagriva and Jwarasur, is based upon the <italic>Kalika Purana</italic> where the former is depicted as triumphing in an epic battle over Jwarasur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0019464613494619">33</xref></sup> The <italic>Kalika Purana</italic> is believed to have been written around the cusp of the tenth and eleventh centuries somewhere near the border regions between Bengal and Assam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0019464613494619">34</xref></sup> Besides Parnasavari, Hayagriva and Yamari, another Buddhist deity, though not directly connected to diseases, was Vajrahumkara—a three-headed, six-armed, blue-complexioned deity. This deity, interestingly, was depicted together with a form of Siva, whom he trampled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0019464613494619">35</xref></sup> The composite statues and the pauranic tales tell of accommodations and crossovers between late Pala Buddhism and Pauranic Hinduism. Shaw suggests that the composite statuary, rather than depicting sectarian strife between Buddhism and Hinduism, is evidence of deities working together for similar ends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0019464613494619">36</xref></sup> But the nature of the crossovers and that of the archive pre-empts any strictly chronological history of borrowings between these two.</p>
<p>The foregoing account clearly shows that Jwarasur cannot be considered an utterly novel invention of the eighteenth century. Neither does he belong exclusively to ‘ignorant lower-class people’. His place in the Harivamsa and his inclusion in such canonical Ayurvedic works as Madhavakara’s <italic>Nidana,</italic> not to mention the steady evolution of a broader set of identities and ideas about the transmateriality of fevers in the works of Chamunda and Hamsaraj, all serve to demonstrate that Jwarasur was neither exclusively part of a uniquely Bengali ‘folk’ milieu nor external to the world of Sanskrit, text-based Ayurveda.</p>

<title>Nineteenth-Century Kaviraji Practice</title>
<p>Thomas Alexander Wise, a Scottish doctor in Bengal who wrote extensively and sympathetically on Ayurvedic medicine in the nineteenth century, was one of the first to report on the Kaviraji lore about Jwarasur. Though Wise described an account of the birth of the fever-demon from Siva’s anger at Durga’s suicide, he did not call the creature Jwarasur. Instead, he used the name Birbhadra and said that the account had appeared in some of the ‘more recent medical works’ of the Hindus. He also described the account as ‘mythological’, thereby introducing a modern, ‘historical’ sensibility into Kaviraji medical lore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0019464613494619">37</xref></sup> Despite such circumscriptions as occasioned by his invocation of the recentness of the lore as well as its explicit marking as ‘mythological’, the fact that he still included the narrative is a testament to Wise’s method which, unlike most other early Orientalists, combined textual study with enquiries from practitioners.</p>
<p>The most explicit proof of the centrality of Jwarasur to Kaviraji practice, however, comes to us from a brief account published in 1323 B.E. (1916) by an eminent Kaviraj, Brajaballabh Ray. Ray remembered how his father, himself an eminent Kaviraj, used to begin teaching his students about fever by the sloka: ‘<italic>Jvarastripadastrishirah shadbhujo navalocanah bhashmapraharano raudrah kalantakayamopamah</italic>’ [Jvara, born of Rudra, has three feet and three heads and nine eyes. Showering ashes, he resembles Time (as god of death, i.e., Yama)]. Ray also stated that his father took this verse very seriously and had defended its description against allegations of absurdity levelled by a close <italic>daktar</italic> friend of his.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0019464613494619">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Besides this clear statement of the centrality of Jwarasur to Ray senior’s conceptualisation and pedagogy of fever, the account also provides some further clues as to the functional dynamics of the lore. Ray mentioned that his father used to expand upon the physical descriptions of Jwarasur by telling his students a Pauranic story about fever. According to the story Ray told, King Ban’s daughter had had a raving pre-marital relationship with Krishna’s grandson, Aniruddha. The king’s guards having found the young Aniruddha in the princess’ bedchamber apprehended and imprisoned him. Krishna was left with little choice but invade King Ban’s kingdom to set his grandson free. Siva came to his devotee, King Ban’s aid and joined battle, but the immense army of Krishna soon bested the defending forces. It was then that Siva, enraged by the result of the battle, created fever to vanquish Krishna’s forces on the brink of victory. This fever-demon was called Rudra-jwar. Krishna himself was soon afflicted and struggled to keep fighting. At last, on the verge of succumbing to it, Krishna created a rival fever from his own person. This was Vishnu-jwar. A battle between the two fevers followed, until at long last Rudra-jwar was routed. Having been defeated, Rudra-jwar now surrendered to Krishna. The ever-forgiving Krishna forgave Rudra-jwar and asked him what boon he desired. Rudra-jwar pleaded that he may be allowed to roam the earth as the only fever. Krishna granted his boon. Vishnu-jwar merged back into Krishna’s person and Rudra-jwar was given a free reign. Ray’s narrative went further and even gave details of all the precise instructions that Krishna had given Rudra-jwar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0019464613494619">39</xref></sup> This lengthy narrative, though not original, demonstrates how the transmaterial aspect had a dual function of medical exegesis and religio-moral embedding.</p>
<p>The medical exegetic function is elaborated on the one hand through the iteration of Krishna’s instructions to Rudra-jwar, which functioned like a potted nosological description. On the other hand, it highlighted the transmaterial, extra-sensory dimensions of medicine. Thus, the senior Ray explained, through these tales the ancient sages had rendered all that was fundamentally beyond the senses (<italic>mule jaha atindriya</italic>) within the grasp of man’s limited sensory universe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0019464613494619">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to understand this essentially extra-sensory, gnostic knowledge, however, the senior Ray had explained that one had to have the ‘nobility of Hindu-ness inscribed on one’s heart’ (<italic>mane hindutver abhimana</italic>). It was only within the religio-moral worldview of this, essentially Pauranic Hindu-ness (which was needless to say wholly distinct from the contemporary ideological doctrine of Hindutva), that one could make sense of the Ayurvedic descriptions of Jwarasur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0019464613494619">41</xref></sup> The way this Pauranic framework informed medical thinking of the time is demonstrated in a report by one Yogeshchandra Shastri. Shastri had demonstrated an icon of Jwarasur at the meeting of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta and in the course of his description of the origin of Jwarasur mentioned Siva’s anger at Daksha. He also stated that the story concurred with the narratives found in <italic>Charaka, Susruta</italic> and ‘other works of the Hindu medical science’, before proceeding to explain the story.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This version of the story of Jvara may be considered irrational and unscientific at first sight, but if carefully considered that [sic] the scientific and most rational explanation is involved in the very conception of it. Jvara is commonly defined by all the nosologists to be the heat of the body caused by irascible state of the three humours…Moreover, every one, when angry, conceives heat in the body … Hence it is obvious that the primary cause of Jvara is anger as has been stated in the Puranas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0019464613494619">42</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was the first step of what we are calling religio-moral embedding. In order to effectively realise this first step, the medical doctrines were constantly cross-referenced and embedded into Pauranic lore.</p>
<p>Ray’s narrative of Jwarasur, for instance, drew upon the Harivamsa. This was not at all unusual since, as we have seen, the <italic>Nidana</italic> too had drawn upon the same source. Indeed throughout the nineteenth century we get reports that affirm that the <italic>Nidana</italic> and its <italic>Madhukosh</italic> commentary were key texts in the education of Bengali Kavirajes. Writing at the beginning of the nineteenth century, William Ward had mentioned that the <italic>Nidana</italic> and the <italic>Rakshit</italic> (possibly Vijayrakshit’s <italic>Madhukosh</italic>) were the two texts studied by the textually grounded physicians of Bengal. Writing towards the end of the century, James Wise (Thomas Wise’s son and another noted physician–ethnographer) again mentioned that the <italic>Nidana</italic>, alongside a work by Chakrapanidatta, were the two main texts studied by Bengali Kavirajes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0019464613494619">43</xref></sup> Ray’s educational methods and exegetic techniques were therefore not at all surprising or exceptional. Rather they were likely symptomatic of the way most orthodox, erudite Bengali Kavirajes operated.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the possible universality of the practice, we must not be blinded to a crucial fact. The <italic>Charaka—</italic>which enjoyed canonical status though it was not usually taught or read in practice—and the Harivamsa provided theologically dissonant renditions of Jwarasur. In the former, Jwarasur’s birth clearly affirmed a Saivite worldview, whilst in the latter case it was a patently polemical Vaishnavite worldview. Wise’s and Shastri’s reports hint at the sustenance and thriving of the Saivite reading amongst those from whom they had collected their material, while Ray’s report points towards the efflorescence of the Vaiṣṇavite reading. We also get a truncated version of the latter reading in the district gazetteer of Khulna.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0019464613494619">44</xref></sup> This suggests that both readings most likely co-existed. Different intellectual lineages or regional groups may have then developed the lore along its own theological or sociological lines of taste and in the process embedded it further into its own religio-moral context. This process of differential embedding highlights for us the problems of arguing in favour of a single ‘unified field’ of thought and experience, as is posited by Marglin. It is worth adding however, that these differential embeddings were in the first instance aligned to varying theological affiliations such as shaiva, shakta, vaishnava, etc. Though they might, on occasion have mapped onto demographic differences too (though there is no substantial data to suggest this), unlike the modern divergence of the ‘folk’ and the ‘classical’, these older differences were not primarily or even necessarily sociological differences.</p>
<p>The shared textual corpus thus came to be connected to and cross-referenced with other shared textual traditions within the Pauranic corpus, but the nature of the cross-references may have been related to local specificities. Durga, for instance, does not appear in the <italic>Charaka</italic> and her entry into the versions collected by Wise signals precisely this sort of cross-referencing. The <italic>Charaka</italic> version, as we have seen, speaks merely of Daksha having offended Siva by not offering him his due oblations during a sacrifice. There was no mention of Durga or of Daksha actually being Siva’s father-in-law. This latter lore, however, was well-known in Bengal by the time of Wise through hugely influential texts such as Bharatchandra Ray’s mid-eighteenth century work, <italic>Annadamangal.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0019464613494619">45</xref></sup> The introduction of the Durga lore into the fever description therefore marks precisely the process of re-embedding and textual cross-referencing we have been describing.</p>

<sec id="section4-0019464613494619">
<title>Constructing the ‘Folk’</title>
<p>Thomas Wise was unique in his combination of classical textual study and quasi-anthropological enquiries. Most other British Orientalists, however, did not combine these two methods. One group of scholars, starting with H.H. Wilson, J.F. Royle and F.J. Mouat inaugurated a hallowed tradition of Sanskrit textual study of medical texts that was completely divorced from extant practice. They also put an immense premium on the question of antiquity. Proving or disproving whether the Ayurvedic texts were the oldest medical literature in the world became a hugely important issue and in the process, somewhat unwittingly, the oldest texts were established as the truest basis of Ayurvedic practice. Amongst these Medical Orientalists, we also witness, to varying degrees, a quest for a coherent ‘theory’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0019464613494619">46</xref></sup> Eventually, this quest for theory produced the powerful idea that Ayurveda understands all diseases in humoral terms—the idea that led Nicholas to see Jwarasur as being external to the Ayurvedic tradition. But this idea did not emerge all at once. Wilson, for instance, attempted to delineate all diseases discussed in <italic>Susruta</italic> into four basic types. Only one of these, however, comprised of ‘humoral’ afflictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0019464613494619">47</xref></sup> Wise was more forthright in clearly stating ‘humoral theory’ to be central to Ayurveda, but his own method undermined its importance. It appears briefly in a fifteen-page subsection within a fifty-three-page chapter on the ‘Structure of the Corporeal Parts of the Body’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0019464613494619">48</xref></sup> The rest of the book made no special reference to it. It was in the hands of late nineteenth-century Indian authors trained in the scholarship of the older generation that the idea of a ‘humoral theory’ being the sole basis of Ayurveda gained currency. Thus, it was in the Edinburgh-educated Bhagvat Singhji’s <italic>Short History of Aryan Medical Science</italic> that we find an entire chapter devoted to the ‘Theory of Indian Medicine’ that opens thus: ‘Indian Medical Science attributes all morbid phenomena to the disordered condition of the three principal humours in the body, called Doshas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0019464613494619">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is this central emphasis on ‘theory’ and, increasingly through it, on the claims to ‘scientificity’ that created a context where all that could not be fitted into the matrix of ‘scientific theory’ came to be considered external to Ayurveda. It is precisely at this time in the course of the mid to late nineteenth century that we see the emergence of an idea and an archive of the ‘folk’ and it is in this new archive that we find Jwarasur consecrated as an autonomous figure, independent of textual inscriptions.</p>
<p>The two early genres that archive the ‘folk’ are District Gazetteers and works on Popular Religion—often produced by the same or similar groups of authors. Of the former, Kumud Ranjan Biswas in his preface to the West Bengal government’s re-issue of the Bengal District Gazetteers mentions that,
<disp-quote>
<p>they [the British] produced a genre of literature called gazetteer which was entirely new in this country. Geographic descriptions of our country are strewn in our ancient and classical literature but they are neither systematic nor comprehensive. Only Abul Fazl’s <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic> compiled during the reign of Akbar is a crude approximation to a gazetteer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0019464613494619">50</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The very first set of Gazetteers, ‘in the modern sense’, were prepared and published by Richard Temple in 1866 for the Central Provinces. A large number of similar works followed in quick succession. The individual efforts, however, were uncoordinated. It was only in 1871 that Sir W.W. Hunter put forth a plan for a centrally coordinated series of Gazetteers. This proposal resulted in three important series of works. First came the <italic>Statistical Accounts of the British Empire</italic> published between the 1875 and 1881. Thereafter, in 1881 came the nine-volume <italic>Imperial Gazetteers.</italic> The next year saw the publication of the <italic>Indian Empire: Its History, People and Products.</italic> Subsequently in 1885–87 and again in 1907–09, the <italic>Imperial Gazetteer</italic> was expanded and republished. The man whose contribution is the most significant for Jwarasur’s story, however, was Lewis Sydney Stewart O’Malley. It was during work on revising the <italic>Imperial Gazetteers</italic> that O’Malley felt the need for a similar series devoted to each of the districts of British Bengal. This eventually resulted in the <italic>Bengal District Gazetteer</italic> series of which O’Malley himself wrote and edited a full twenty individual volumes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0019464613494619">51</xref></sup> It is in these volumes that we get the most consistent reports of Jwarasur’s cult and it is on these volumes that later scholars have relied for their descriptions.</p>
<p>Alongside this general administrative knowledge-production enterprise that was clearly tied to the interests of imperial governance, there was also a broader intellectual environment in which colonial officials developed an interest in ‘popular rural culture’ and particularly ‘popular religion’. The ‘popular’ here was understood mainly in opposition to the high Brahminic or classical and often mapped onto imperial ideas about South Asian society being a mix of ‘Aryan’ and ‘non-Aryan’ elements. Many of the authors who worked on the Gazetteers in their official capacities, also authored the works on ‘popular religion’ in their private capacities. LSS O’Malley, for instance, produced a number of works such as the <italic>Indian Caste Customs</italic> (1932), <italic>Indian Social Heritage</italic> (1934) and <italic>Popular Hinduism</italic> (1935). Richard Carnac Temple, the son of Richard Temple who had pioneered the gazetteer genre, launched another pioneering journal known as the <italic>Punjab Notes and Queries</italic> and produced works such as the three volume <italic>Legends of Punjab</italic> (1883–90) dealing with ‘Indian history, folklore and ethnologyʼ<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0019464613494619">52</xref></sup> The man under whom this study of the ‘folk’ acquired its apogee however, was William Crooke.</p>
<p>Sadhana Naithani has recently argued that it was with Crooke’s taking over the editorship of the <italic>Punjab Notes and Queries</italic> that the emergent new sensibilities of what Naithani calls ‘imperial folkloristics’ came to crystallise. Instead of the earlier interest in ancient manuscripts, coins, edicts, etc., the new focus of Crooke and others, she points out was decidedly on ‘the living India, the contemporary India’. This in turn led to an engagement with ‘rural society—its everyday culture, its age-old customs, its local gods and godlings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0019464613494619">53</xref></sup> Commenting on this new mode of knowledge, Manjita Mukharji points out that in these new ethnographic works, ‘by making himself invisible behind the scientific gaze and so naturalising cultural differences, the colonial ethnographer-turned-folklore-collector added significantly to the official colonial knowledge of the “folk” that masked itself as scientific, objective and value-neutral and so constituted the colonial order’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0019464613494619">54</xref></sup> Naithani, however, insists that behind this apparent ‘objectivity’ lay the brutal reality of imperial power, which both made this knowledge possible as well as marked its method of production. Moreover, both Mukharji and Naithani point out that the temporal marking of ‘folk’ culture as a primitive and anachronistic survival (Naithani calls this Crooke’s ‘survivalist paradigm’) as well as the transformation of a performed narrative into written texts marked by typically imperial gaps in translation, altered the very nature of what was being recorded.</p>
<p>‘Folk medicine’ had emerged as one of the facets of ‘folkloristics’ in metropolitan Britain and the Glaswegian solicitor, William George Black had published a book titled <italic>Folk Medicine: A Chapter in the History of Culture.</italic> This book had been published by the Folk-Lore Society of London—the main professional association of folklorists and one that Crooke would eventually preside over. Black had also acknowledged the personal help of Andrew Lang and Laurence Gomme—two of the most powerful figures in the emergent early field of British folklore studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0019464613494619">55</xref></sup> That Crooke was influenced by Black’s work can be attested to by the fact that he had included Black’s text in the short select bibliography to his multi-volume classic <italic>Popular Religion and Folklore in Northern India</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0019464613494619">56</xref></sup>  It was perhaps as a result of his reading of Black that Crooke came to include an entire chapter in the first volume of <italic>Popular Religion</italic> on ‘Godlings of Disease’. This has proved an immensely useful source for later scholars such as Arnold who have drawn on the material in this chapter. Crooke’s treatment of the ‘fever demon’ in this chapter is therefore highly significant. Clearly divorcing the ‘fever god/demon’ from any scriptural tradition and localising it within a small circumscribed area, Crooke writes that: ‘There are a number of minor disease godlings, some of whom might be mentioned here. The Benares godling of malaria is Jvaraharisvara, ‘‘the god who expels the fever’’…Among the Kols of Chaibasa, Bangara is the godling of fever and is associated with Gohem, chondu, Negra and Dichali, who are considered respectively the godlings of cholera, the itch, indigestion and death. The Bengalis have a special service for Ghentu, the itch godling’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0019464613494619">57</xref></sup> Not only does Crooke’s description flatten out the history of ‘Jvaraharisvara’ and localise it in Benares, he also makes it somehow an exemplar of a much more general typology of small locally worshipped ‘godlings’ dealing with particular diseases. Their particularities only serve to highlight their generic character that expresses what Crooke elsewhere liked to refer to as the ‘either gross or stupid drivel’ of the ahistorical ‘Oriental mind’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0019464613494619">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>In time, however, the colonised middle classes appropriated the discipline. Naithani has wonderfully shown how Crooke’s work depended crucially upon the efforts of Ram Gharib Chaube and argued that Chaube had developed a genuine interest in ‘folkloristics’ and worked tirelessly to collect, collate and preserve this ‘folk’ culture. From the closing decades of the nineteenth century, in Bengal too we see a similar interest amongst some sections of the local intelligentsia. This new interest borrowed much from imperial academic disciplines—both Indology and ethnography—but it adapted these to a wholly different set of concerns and motivations and modified the methods and strategies of the imperial disciplines to pursue these new motivations. Initially, much of this re-figuration happened around the Indological quest for ancient manuscripts. Early Bengali scholars such as Rajendralal Mitra and his disciple, Haraprasad Shastri, began to hesitantly re-imagine the Indological obsession with classical Sanskrit manuscripts, by suggesting that in-between the search for Sanskrit manuscripts, scholars should also try to recover Bengali manuscripts. By the 1890s, Shastri was more forthright. He clearly stated that Bengali manuscripts could not be found in the repositories that held Sanskrit manuscripts. Bengali manuscripts, he said, ‘are cared for by women, they are cherished by the lower classes and they are peddled only by the lowly hawkers of <italic>Battala</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0019464613494619">59</xref></sup> Gautam Bhadra rightly points out that with this statement Shastri tried to signal that, ‘Bengali manuscripts were not simply ancient fossils meant to be judged by the scholarly community, instead they were part of the very-much-alive world of everyday action’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0019464613494619">60</xref></sup> In fact, following in Shastri’s footsteps there emerged from that time onwards a robust seam of scholarly activity that Bhadra has dubbed <italic>Bangabidya</italic> [Study of Bengal]. Stalwarts such as Nagendranath Basu, Dineshchandra Sen, Abdul Karim Shahityavisharad carved out an autonomous space for the study of local, vernacular culture in its lived context. This new scholarly activity was no longer merely a dry intellectual pursuit. It began to resonate with the emergent vague aspirations and desires for a nation-state. Imperial methods and protocols however remained aligned to the hierarchic realties of colonialism and could not accommodate these diffident desires in a real world context. As a result, in the hands of the new Bengali scholars, their scholarly pursuits were supplemented with metaphoric flourishes that re-located these desires away from the contemporary world in the very language and literature they sought to recover.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0019464613494619">61</xref></sup> The passion evoked by these desires made <italic>Bangabidya</italic> ‘a symbol for the building of a shared collective identity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0019464613494619">62</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Bangabidya</italic>, however, did not remain attached to the study of manuscripts alone. Many of the scholars involved in it, increasingly moved into a more general study of the rural everyday. Shastri himself pioneered this approach through his pamphlet entitled <italic>The Discovery of Living Buddhism.</italic> In it Shastri argued that Buddhism, in a bowdlerised form had survived in Bengal in the form of Dharma Puja. To make his case, Shastri supplemented his readings of ancient manuscript records by actual observations of religious rites ‘of the lowest classes of the so-called Hindus’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0019464613494619">63</xref></sup> He compared the textual sources with Bengali mantras ‘taken down from the mouths of ignorant, illiterate, low-born priests of Dharma’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0019464613494619">64</xref></sup> Dineshchandra Sen, while writing his <italic>Brihat Banga,</italic> lived amongst numerous rural artisanal groups and sought to recover the skills of boat-makers, basket-makers, weavers, fishnet-makers, etc., as part of a living history of Greater Bengal. Naturally, much of this seems reminiscent of the well-known nexus between nascent nationalism and interest in ‘folk culture’. Yet, in the Bengali case there was one significant difference. This was in its direct emphasis on the non-elite. Particularly in colonial Bengal, where mainstream nationalism had remained largely dominated by elite, upper-caste interests, scholars like Shastri, Sen and Shahityavisharad, in their trenchant emphasis on non-elite rural culture, conspicuously demarcated an alternate agenda for scholarly engagement with the ‘folk’ that was not putatively tied to mainstream nationalism. This interest, often described as an interest in ‘<italic>lok-sanskriti</italic>’, has survived decolonisation and to a large measure retained its radical edge.</p>
<p>Bhadra however, has correctly pointed out that this interest soon overwhelmed the bounds of the institutional academia. Much of the later research happened on the fringes of, or even totally outside the academia. While some later figures such as Ahmad Sharif or Ashutosh Bhattacharya were able to carve out a successful career within the academia, many other collectors such as Girinidranath Das, Gopendrakrishna Basu, Amalendu Mitra, Maniklal Singha, Rabindranath Samanta and others have only had tenuous connections with the academia. Yet, the tradition of studying <italic>lok-sanskriti</italic> that includes, but is not limited to texts and emphasises the rural everyday and the non-elite, has clearly survived from the 1890s into our present times. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 and the electoral victory of the communist party in West Bengal in 1977, to varying degrees efforts were made on both sides of the border to institutionalise some of this interest. In West Bengal this was done through the Lok-Sanskriti O Adivasi Sanskriti Kendra (West Bengal Folk and Tribal Cultural Centre), whilst in Bangladesh, the Bangla Ekademi (Bengali Academy) came to publish a number of collections pertaining to ‘<italic>lok-sanskriti</italic>’.</p>
<p>It is in this archive, in the writings of men like Gopendrakrishna Basu and Chintaharan Chakrabarty that we encounter Jwarasur once again. Though building on the ‘folk’ framework of imperial folkloristics, this newer Bengali mode of knowledge constantly sought to find ways of reconnecting the ‘folk’ to a deeper past. While this was never a purely ‘historicised’ past retraced through the chronological frameworks of historical analysis, its repudiation of the temporal flattening of imperial folkloristics cannot be missed. Basu and Dipankar Das for instance, as already mentioned, attempted to find iconographic similarities that would allow Jwarasur to be connected to older Buddhist pasts. Chakrabarty instead collected <italic>dhyan mantra</italic>s (invocation formulas) and sought to correlate these once more to Sanskrit textual sources.</p>
<p>Whatever their different methods however, it was both the combination of imperial folkloristics and Bengali <italic>lok-sanskriti</italic> collections which combined to make it possible for generations of later scholars to write of ‘folk medicine’ as a domain clearly demarcated from that of ‘proper’ Ayurvedic medicine. Om Prakash Jaggi, author of a widely read multi-volume <italic>History of Science and Technology in India</italic>, thus explicitly states in the introduction to his volume on ‘Folk Medicine’ that,
<disp-quote>
<p>[w]hile we do know that they made use of such a system of medicine—Folk Medicine—we have no comprehensive written records. And yet we are not ignorant of them because in the last hundred years or so, anthropologists and sociologists and others have observed and studied different tribal and village communities and as they have hardly changed their beliefs, customs and practices, their findings apply not only to the present but to all the past centuries. These communities have remained static while time passed them by.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0019464613494619">65</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jaggi’s comments bring to mind V. Sujatha’s poignant recent observation that while the ‘folk’/‘classical’ dichotomy is operationalised in many areas of anthropological inquiry, it is only in medical anthropology that the ‘folk’ is clearly understood to be less valid and mainly to do with the cataloguing of quaint beliefs. By contrast, in religion, she points out, anthropologists routinely accept ‘folk’ and ‘classical’ views as being equally legitimate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0019464613494619">66</xref></sup></p>

<p>This clear-cut demarcation between a timeless ‘folk medicine’ and a historical ‘Ayurveda’ might have been easy to sustain for scholars, but was not as easy to adopt for practising Kavirajes. The latter’s textual and practical education was still—at the beginning of the twentieth century—implicated in spaces, people and texts which allowed free concourse between these allegedly discrete domains. Thus, men like Brajaballabh Ray whilst studying from his father at the turn of the century, had to still hear stories of Jwarasur, read texts which mentioned him and be exposed to contexts where patients negotiated their illness through a combination of medicines, rituals and spells. As a result, for a physician like Ray, it was not easy to suddenly claim that Jwarasur belonged to a domain wholly alien to the textually grounded classical Ayurveda he practiced. It was from this tension that there emerged a series of efforts to refigure the references to Jwarasur within the classical Ayurvedic textual corpus. Most of these efforts were grounded in an attempt to argue that the references in the texts were actually <italic>metaphors</italic> for something else.</p>
<p>Brajaballabh Ray, for instance, came to understand his father’s descriptions in the light of contemporary science. He argued that, within the body, Siva was ‘Katabolism (sic) or the bodily power of decomposition (<italic>doihik boislesik sakti</italic>)’. His wife, the Devi, was therefore ‘Anabolism’ or the digestive process that gave rise to chyme. Daksha, Siva’s father-in-law, was consequently the cause behind the production of chyme. The story about Jwarasur being born from the rage of Siva at being insulted by his father-in-law by not being offered the customary sacrificial gifts, in Ray’s rendition stood for the process motivating the body’s anabolic activity failing to pass on the necessary wastes to the catabolic process for expulsion from the body as excrements, sweat, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0019464613494619">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to Ray’s explanation, another eminent Kaviraj, Surendranath Goswami, metaphorised Jwarasur to make him consonant with the outlines of Germ Theory. Goswami argued that Bengali Kavirajes had been wrong to commence their Ayurvedic education with the <italic>Nidana.</italic> The <italic>Nidana</italic>, according to Goswami had mistakenly reversed the actual ordering of ślokas dealing with fever in the Ayurveda. As a result, Bisham-jwar had been understood to be only one type of fever amongst eight basic types. Instead, Goswami said Bisham-jwar was the parent category that comprised all other types of fevers. He supported his unorthodox reading by arguing through copiously referenced pauranic sources that, all fevers could only be either Siva-jwar or Vishnu-jwar. As Krishna had allowed Siva-jwar alone to rule the world, there was only one principal type of fever.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0019464613494619">68</xref></sup> This Siva-jwar in turn could be none other than Bisham-jwar as Siva was always accompanied by <italic>bhuta</italic>s and Bisham-jwar was known to be caused by <italic>bhuta</italic>s<italic>.</italic> Having established this position, Goswami proceeded to argue that <italic>bhuta</italic>, however, were not those creatures of popular imagination that were ‘tall as palm-trees, with huge arms, deep-set eyes and a nasal voice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0019464613494619">69</xref></sup> In reality <italic>bhutas</italic> were, allegedly, ‘vegetable and animal parasites (<italic>udbhidanu</italic> and <italic>jibanu</italic>)’. Different types of Bisham-jwar such as Satata-jwar, Santata-jwar, etc., were distinct since they were caused by different types of ‘parasites’. The former was a ‘benign parasite’, while the later was a ‘malignant parasite’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0019464613494619">70</xref></sup> The word <italic>bhuta</italic> then became, for Goswami, a redolent metaphor through which a highly complex understanding of ‘germs’ could be inveigled into Ayurvedic medicine. Jwarasur—with his three heads, six arms, etc.—was said to be nothing more than the description of a particular type of stained microscopic plate, viz. the ‘Colourdel plate’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0019464613494619">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>This style of reading reached its apogee in Gananath Sen’s immensely influential work titled <italic>Siddhanta Nidanam</italic> to which he also wrote his own commentary called the <italic>Tatwadarsini.</italic> It was in the latter that Sen fully explained his theory of the origin of fevers deploying a distinctly metaphoric rationality. Sen wrote that, ‘It has been said that Jwar was born from the anger of the god Rudra … Scholars say pitta gets increased by anger, pitta is the cause of santapa [heat] and santapa is the chief symptom of Jwar; hence importance is for pitta in Jwar. Some say Daksha is god Vayu, <italic>apamana</italic> means insulting actions (actions unsuitable to Vata), Rudra is god of <italic>pakagni</italic> [digestive fire], its anger (aggravation) comes out (to the skin) and produces <italic>santapa</italic>, which is called fever’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0019464613494619">72</xref></sup> Sen’s later translator, K.R. Srikantha Murthy, himself an Ayurvedist, has added a rare note to this particular passage, stating with obvious disapproval that, ‘Gananath Sen has distorted the ancient story of origin of fever. Daksha is nowhere alluded to as vayu … comparing <italic>pakagni</italic> (digestive power) to Rudra is something unheard of’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0019464613494619">73</xref></sup> Murthy’s disapproval is highly significant: not because it points out that Sen was ‘wrong’, but because when we compare his disapproval to the views of those like Ray and Goswami who wrote slightly before or during Sen’s career, we are struck by how radically the measure of absurdity has changed within circles of Ayurvedic practitioners over the course of the last three-quarters of a century. What was hardly a unique style of reasoning for Sen—being articulated by many of his peers—appears to Murthy so patently absurd that he is forced to drop the translator’s cloak of transparency and protest explicitly.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding their disapproval of Sen’s version of the Rudra story, Murthy and many others have accepted Sen’s text as an integral part of contemporary Ayurveda and the <italic>Siddhanta Nidanam</italic> forms, today, one of the key texts in many Ayurvedic colleges in India. A mode of reading Ayurvedic texts has thus been put in place, where the transmaterial dimensions of fevers can easily be rehabilitated into the predominantly materialist framework of modernised Ayurveda by reading the former as mere metaphors. This metaphorisation also opens up endless possibilities for constantly ‘upgrading’ Ayurvedic knowledge by reading contemporary ‘western’ scientific theories into it. Sen’s curious rendition of the story of Rudra’s anger, for instance, took up nearly a fifth of the entire text. In it, he developed a completely new vocabulary of fevers where Ayurvedic designations were exactly matched with biomedical ones. Often he fitted old Ayurvedic names to new biomedical designations. Thus, Santata-jwar became ‘malarial fever’, Santaka-jwar (usually rendered a synonym of the former) was rendered as ‘double quotidian fever’, Pralepak-jwar became hectic fever and Bisham-jwar became ‘remittent fever’. Occasionally, he also coined new terms: thus, Karnamulaka-jwar was said to be ‘mumps’, Antrika-jwar was ‘typhoid’, Slesmika-jwar was ‘influenza’, etc. The range of these designations have rendered biomedicine and Ayurveda almost completely compatible and transposable and have—through their inclusion into the educational curricula—today become completely hegemonic in governmentally-approved readings of Ayurvedic texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0019464613494619">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>This new compatibility of biomedicine and modernised Ayurveda also allowed the development of entirely new therapeutic regimes that wholly expunged the need for transmaterial therapeutics (i.e., rituals, spells, chants, etc.). Sen’s Swasanaka-jwar, which he equated with Pneumonia, gives an excellent example of how the entire diagnostic method had been over-hauled. The main test for this affliction involved the examination of the sputum and the discernment of the colour of the blood emitted in it. The hearing of breathing sounds in the lungs by the use of stethoscope and by tapping the chest (known in biomedicine as ‘percussion’) was mentioned. Yet, Sen concluded his discussion by stating that, ‘Bhavamisra has described a similar disease by the name of Karkataka Sannipata…’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0019464613494619">75</xref></sup> Bhavamisra’s Karkataka Sannipata, however, bears very little similarity to Sen’s disease. Bhāvamiśra’s disease was described mainly through physical symptoms such as inability to speak, blackness of the tongue, involuntary diarrhoea, ‘making of a pigeon-like sound’, spasms, over-sleeping, redness of face, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0019464613494619">76</xref></sup> There was no mention of any of the tests or symptoms through which Sen identified his disease-category. It was only through the metaphorical mapping of symptoms such as ‘making sounds like a pigeon’ to percussions heard by a stethoscope that Sen could establish the correspondence he posited. By thus combining new methods of diagnosis and classification, metaphorical rationality enabled the emergence of a new Ayurvedic orientation that eschewed and even berated the tendency to invoke the ineffable. Thus, Sen famously called his anatomical textbook, the <italic>Pratyaksha Sariram</italic> (The Observed Body). Goswami similarly attacked his contemporary Kavirajes for not interpreting <italic>bhuta</italic>s as ‘parasites’, by saying that
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he imaginary <italic>bhuta</italic>s of the contemporary Kavirajes bears absolutely no relation to the observed (<italic>pratyakshikrita</italic>) <italic>bhuta</italic>s of Ayurvedic science (<italic>ayurbediya bijnana</italic>). The fault for this lies with us. We tend to look at Philosophy and Science, not from the perspective of Observations (<italic>pratyaksha</italic>), but from the perspective of the Unobserved (<italic>apratyaksha</italic>) and the Hypothetical (<italic>anuman</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0019464613494619">77</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This emphasis on <italic>pratyaksha</italic> was clearly different from the emphasis of an earlier generation of practitioners, such as Brajaballabh Ray’s father, who had expressly stated that one needed a certain religio-moral attitude to grasp what was quintessentially a set of metaphoric allusions to the ineffable. It was this premium upon observation or <italic>pratyaksha</italic> that encouraged a range of diagnostic innovations that involved complex pathological tests.</p>
<p>Significantly, this visual datum itself was both obtained and interpreted through an armature of new techniques and concepts. Ganapati Panja, in an article in the journal <italic>Ayurbed</italic>, for instance, gave a detailed description of how to detect Kala-jwar by reading microscopic slides. Panja explained that Kalajwar was caused by germs (<italic>jibanu</italic>) that were found exclusively in the <italic>pliha</italic> (spleen)<italic>, jakrit</italic> (liver) and <italic>asthi</italic> (bone)<italic>.</italic> So the blood for testing had to be obtained from these organs. ‘They are only visible under a microscope (<italic>anubikshan-jantra</italic>)’, he continued, ‘and they look like small shells’. The easiest test however, Panja asserted, was the one developed by ‘Napier Saheb’ at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. This test involved keeping the drawn blood till it had coagulated and emitted a ‘yellowish liquid material’ that he explained was the ‘Serum’. Upon mixing this serum with a drop of Formaline and allowing it to stand for a while would make it take on the ‘shape and form of the white of a boiled egg’. Besides these, Panja also mentioned a number of other alternative tests involving the blood such as one developed by Charuchandra Dutta at the Medical College or another involving the mixing of the patient’s blood with a rabbit’s blood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0019464613494619">78</xref></sup> Another anonymous article published in the <italic>Ayurbed Hitaishini</italic> a few years before Panja’s gave detailed instructions on how to analyse stools. Here too we see that there was an explicit attempt to train the observer’s gaze by equipping him with complex testing methods and conceptual vocabularies. Thus, to detect <italic>slesma</italic> in the stool, the observer is asked to place a very small quantity of stool upon a glass slide, cover it with another and observe it beneath a microscope for ‘visible strands of <italic>slesma</italic>’. Similarly, for traces of blood, the observer is told to add twenty drops of turpentine oil to the stool sample that apparently would turn the stool blue or ‘brinjal-coloured’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0019464613494619">79</xref></sup> What these detailed instructions evince is an explicit attempt to educate the observer to observe in a particular way. <italic>Pratyaksha</italic> was therefore not a simple matter of seeing what is visible, but a complex matter that necessitated a certain reconfiguration of the Kaviraj’s visuality itself. It was this new visibility that over-determined the metaphoric rationality of authors like Sen. In his description of Kal-jwar, for instance, he noted that, ‘its special cause is worms which are cylindrical in shape, invisible and residing in the spleen, joints and bones and vitiating the blood’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0019464613494619">80</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>David Hardiman has recently argued that we ought to see modernised Ayurveda as ‘syndicated Ayurveda’. Borrowing the idea of ‘syndication’ from Romila Thapar’s study of Hindutva, he states that,
<disp-quote>
<p>In other words, groups or syndicates—with certain vested interests sought through combination, organisation and publicity to establish a particular, limited notion of their practice that set it apart from other forms of practice. This created a potential space for conflict, as orthodoxies were upheld and policed with varying degrees of rigour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0019464613494619">81</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hardiman’s pithy formulation does much to highlight the broader social processes at play in the modernisation of Ayurveda. To fully tease out the consequences of this process of syndication however, we need to look anew at the ontological refigurations that permitted the social processes to play out.</p>
<p>Much of the exciting new scholarship on modernised Ayurveda, of which Hardiman’s is one of the best examples, has mainly been concerned with the social history of the process of modernisation. The full import of this process, however, cannot be adequately understood without reference to the complex and specific ontological and epistemic refigurations that have both enabled and been produced by the social history of modernisation. One of the rare scholars whose work does tackle this process of ontological refiguration is Madhulika Banerjee. Banerjee has argued that modernised Ayurveda has been ‘pharmaceuticalised’, i.e., it has been reimagined through a new and partly market-driven emphasis almost exclusively on the possibility of pharmaceutical-based treatments that is utterly new to Ayurveda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0019464613494619">82</xref></sup> The present study adds to works such as those of Banerjee’s by demonstrating yet another fundamental process of ontological refiguration that operated in tandem with pharmaceuticalisation, i.e., the process of extrusion of transmateriality through metaphorisation.</p>
<p>This extrusion of transmateriality must be seen within a much broader context of refiguration of the field of knowledge about the past and present of ‘indigenous’ medical traditions. It built upon and was shaped by the emergences of such diverse fields or disciplines as Medical Orientalism, Imperial Folkloristics, <italic>Lok-sanskriti</italic>-<italic>charcha</italic>, etc. The metaphorisations of Jwarasur in the works of physician-scholars like Gananath Sen cannot be understood without reference to the basic divide between ‘classical’, ‘scientific’ Ayurveda and ‘superstitious’, ‘lower-class’ ‘folk medicine’. This divide and the extrusion of transmateriality it made possible clearly had important social consequences. It created a distinct divide between the medicine of an ‘elite Brahminic culture’ and the medicine of a ‘non-elite lower caste culture’ and delivered power onto the former.</p>
<p>A critical historical project must not stop merely by showing the investment of power by the ‘elite Brahminic Ayurveda’ at the cost of the elided ‘folk medicines’. To do so would only naturalise the historically produced division between these two, not to mention naturalise the very identities of the two social groups involved. Instead, a critical history must also unpack the historical contingency of the divisions themselves. It must, as we have here tried, show that ‘classical’ and ‘folk’ forms of knowledge have not always been distinctive bodies of knowledge that have belonged to distinctive social groups. Instead, as the case of Jwarasur demonstrates, these are components of what was once a connected network of knowledge open to multiple socially, intellectually and regionally specific iterations, elaborations and multiple, ongoing, locally resonant embeddings. Such an approach also serves to de-essentialise regionally grounded identities by demonstrating that what today appears as a quintessentially ‘Bengali’ phenomenon was available within a pan-South Asian textual tradition which included medieval west-Indian authors such as Kayastha Chamunda and temples in Benares.</p>
<p>A critical historical project that de-essentialises the sociology of medical knowledge by historicising the division between the ‘folk’ and the ‘classical’, does not however dismiss the contemporary reality of the divide. It eschews the espousal of a singular ‘unified field’ of thought and experience, in favour of a heterogeneous multiplicity of thoughts and experiences that are connected with each other through shared figures, tropes, ideas etc. Jwarasur is such a node. He was repeatedly and variously embedded into a variety of religio-moral milieus that possibly resonated with distinctive local and theological (and perhaps occasionally social) differences. His presence did not signal the existence of a discrete corpuscular domain or externality from any such domain. Instead, his appearance in elite, classical, pan-Indic as well as the non-elite, non-textual arenas of practice, connected these heterogeneous and amorphous domains into an open-ended network of variously evolving possibilities.</p>
<p>The fact that Jwarasur has continued to be viewed as a ‘Bengali’, ‘local’ or ‘folk-deity’, demonstrates the extent to which our contemporary critical apparatus remains colonised by the archival and epistemic categories developed during the colonial era. Anthropologists have encountered Jwarasur exclusively through ‘folk’ and modern print archives, Indologists have studied him only through the classical textual corpus, and historians have encountered him almost exclusively through gazetteers. Different archives and the disciplines that use them have thus respectively ‘disciplined’ Jwarasur in different ways and so remained trapped within the colonial categories. To decolonise our critical methods, we would suggest, would require a much more promiscuous and eclectic reading practice that permits freer dialogue between disciplines. Such a practice might reveal we hope, as it does in Jwarasur’s case, a much more ‘in-disciplined’, less syndicated, more nuanced medical history which will be both closer to historical reality and serve to politically upstage the apple-cart of today’s elitist Ayurveda.</p>

<fn id="fn46-0019464613494619"><label>46</label><p>When we speak of the Orientalist search for a ‘single coherent theory’, we do not wish to imply that pre-modern Ayurveda had no theory whatsoever. In fact it had a multiplicity of theories. Besides the <italic>tridosha-tattwa</italic> (the so-called ‘humoral’ theory), the <italic>pragyapradha-tatwa</italic> (disease causation through ‘violation of good judgement’), the <italic>sapta</italic>-<italic>dhatu</italic>
<italic>tatwa</italic> (theory of seven ‘bodily supports’), the theory of epidemics through the moral corruption of the monarch, theories of heredity, etc., were all available. Frequently, they were even available within the same text. Oftentimes these ‘theories’ were only partially reconciled with each other even within a single text and varied widely between different texts and authors. Even when attempts at systematisation were made, such as by Vagbhatta, he never sought to present a single all-purpose theory to account for everything. Moreover, before the very end of the nineteenth century, without the institutional undergirding of common centralised medical education and a state-regulatory apparatus to quash alternative formulations, a single theory that defined everything and was accepted by everybody practicing medicine could never have developed in India. We are grateful to Ananda Samir Chopra for helping us delineate this point with greater lucidity.</p></fn>
