<abstract>
<p>Peer victimization, or bullying, is a phenomenon that has received increasing global attention, and the use of technology, or cyberbullying, to bring about acts of bullying has certainly increased as access to various technological tools has escalated. While it is unclear whether this attention is a function of actual increases in cyberbullying or is simply a function of the fact that the same boom in technological access also enables more rapid reporting of such incidents, the reality remains the same: a number of young people use cyberspace as a means for attacking peers. An examination of the literature pertaining to cyberbullying serves as a backdrop for considering cyberbullying and its particular effects on gifted and talented students, and a call for increasing research efforts in this arena is issued.</p>

<p>Recent events have highlighted the seriousness of bullying. News media and advocacy organizations have been quick to report the devastating effects, including suicide, that bullying can have on youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429411427652">HRSA, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411427652">ABC News, 2010</xref>). Bullying is defined as repeated aggressive acts perpetrated over time with a power imbalance between the parties involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429411427652">Olweus, 1993</xref>). Bullying may be overt, involving physically or verbally aggressive behaviors, or it may be relational/social/reputational, involving gossip, damage to the target’s social status, rumor-spreading, and other subtle actions that are committed to negatively impacting the interpersonal relationships and reputation of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411427652">Card et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411427652">Crick and Grotpeter, 1995</xref>). Children involved in bullying as bullies and victims are more likely to exhibit a variety of psychosocial problems, school adjustment difficulties, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411427652">Card et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429411427652">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429411427652">Hawker and Boulton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411427652">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Bullying among gifted children</title>
<p>A limited amount of research has been conducted specific to bullying and gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411427652">Peterson and Ray, 2006</xref>), though bullying behaviors towards them as victims are described in the literature about the social and emotional needs and peer relationships of gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411427652">Cross, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411427652">Gross, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411427652">Peterson and Ray (2006</xref>) speculated that the unique characteristics, such as perfectionism, and the sensitivities and intensities of gifted children and adolescents may result in ‘hypersensitive responses to bullying’ (p. 149). Although they face similar challenges to other children, they may experience them differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411427652">Peterson, 2009</xref>). A common characteristic of gifted children is asynchronous development, or having large variations in abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261429411427652">Webb et al., 2005</xref>). A gifted child may be advanced intellectually, but may have social skills that are not as developed. Because of these differences, they may be more vulnerable to isolation and bullying than children who are not identified as gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411427652">Peterson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Gifted children, particularly profoundly gifted children, may not have any intellectual peers in their classrooms or anyone who shares their interests. They may feel that there is a poor fit with the school environment very early on and that they are out of sync intellectually, emotionally, and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411427652">Gross, 2002</xref>). The social issues in particular may increase over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411427652">Peterson, 2009</xref>). Like all children, they want to be accepted by their peers. Because they are seen as different, gifted children may deny their giftedness and hide their abilities in order to conform to what they perceive to be the standards of their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411427652">Gross, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261429411427652">Manaster et al. (1994</xref>), gifted high school students reported that some of the disadvantages of being gifted were the negative stereotypes often held by other students, as well as their jealousy and resentment of the gifted students’ abilities and attention from teachers, feelings of social isolation and alienation, and excessive expectations by adults. Gifted children are often ridiculed by other students and are called names such as ‘know-it-all’, ‘nerd’, or ‘dweeb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411427652">Alvino, 1991</xref>). For gifted students, bullies may include adults as well. The anti-intellectual atmosphere of many school environments can contribute to the mixed messages that gifted children receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411427652">Cross, 2005</xref>). Parents and teachers expect them to perform well, but some adults may tell them that everyone is gifted (or no one is gifted) and that they do not need any special consideration at school. Many teachers expect them to wait for the other students to complete their work and do not allow them to explore their areas of interest, which could lead to frustration and even anger. They may also be more likely to believe that they should be able to solve their own problems and will keep those problems to themselves, so that parents and teachers do not realize what is happening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411427652">Peterson and Ray, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of the few studies about bullying that include gifted students are somewhat contradictory. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429411427652">Estell et al. (2009</xref>) of 484 fifth grade students, including 74 gifted students and 41 students with mild disabilities, examined how students were perceived by their teachers and peers as being bullies or being bullied. Academically gifted students were defined in this study as those students who were in the top 15% of their class. Academically gifted children were rated by their peers as being less likely to be seen as being bullies than those students with mild disabilities. Academically gifted children were perceived by their teachers as less likely to be bullies or be bullied than general education students or students with mild disabilities. The students in this study gave more positive behavior nominations (naming who they liked the most in the class) to the academically gifted students than either the general education students or students with mild disabilities. Interestingly, the students who were most likely to be perceived as bullies were those who were vying for a social position in the classroom and associated with aggressive and popular peers, which could have implications for all students and would benefit from further study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411427652">Siegle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411427652">Peterson and Ray (2006</xref>) conducted a study of 432 eighth-grade students who were in formal gifted education programs in schools in 11 states. They looked at gifted children as both victims and as perpetrators of bullying. Sixty-seven percent of the students who participated had been bullied at some time in their school careers from kindergarten through eighth grade. Just over a quarter of the students experienced bullying in kindergarten and 46% experienced bullying in sixth grade. For males, the bullying reached a peak in sixth grade, reported by 54% of the boys, and then declined slightly to 46% in eighth grade. The percentage of girls who reported that they were bullied was steady (38% or 39%) from fifth grade through eighth grade. Repeated bullying was most prevalent in sixth grade for 14% of the boys, with 25% of them being bullied more than 10 times. Twenty-four percent of the girls were bullied more than 10 times in fifth grade.</p>
<p>The most prevalent kind of bullying reported by these students was name-calling, the highest being in sixth grade for 35% of the participants. Teasing about their appearance was the next most prevalent and peaked in sixth grade for 24% of the students. Teasing about their intelligence peaked in seventh and eighth grade for 19% of the students. Name-calling was most prevalent in fifth through eighth grades and involved appearance (41%) and intellectual ability (36%). Expletives and sexual references were prevalent for 8% of the students in seventh and eighth grades. Physical bullying, including pushing and shoving, being beaten up, knocking books out of their hands, and hitting and punching, were not as prevalent, but were particularly a problem for some students in sixth and eighth grades.</p>
<p>In terms of impact, the greatest number of students (13%) thought that the bullying in general greatly bothered them in fifth grade. Students tended to be most bothered by being teased about their appearance in sixth and seventh grades and their intelligence in seventh grade. Some students, from 10% to 16% in first to eighth grades, were not distressed by bullying at all. However, Peterson and Ray surmised that, for those who are greatly bothered by bullying, the impact on their self-concepts and feelings about school could be considerable, especially if they do not see an end to the bullying.</p>
<p>These gifted students also reported being bullies over the nine years in school. Twenty-eight percent (33% of males and 22% of females) had bullied someone in that time period. Fourteen to sixteen percent of the students were bullies during sixth through eighth grades. Twenty-one percent of the boys were bullies in eighth grade and 12% of the girls were bullies in each of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. As sixth grade had been the peak year for being bullied, so it was for bullying. Forty-six percent of the participants bullied during that grade: 54% of the boys and 12% of the girls. Fourteen percent of the boys bullied more than 10 times in sixth grade. Name-calling was the most prevalent form of bullying (35%) that they used and teasing about appearance was the next most prevalent (24%). This prevalence of name-calling and non-physical bullying for both victims and perpetrators may be particularly relevant for gifted children when considering their potential involvement in cyberbullying.</p>

<title>Defining cyberbullying</title>
<p>While much empirical attention has been focused on traditional bullying, a more recent form of bullying has been less researched, with no research in gifted education. Only one non-empirical article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411427652">Siegle, 2010</xref>) was found during a search for studies on cyberbullying and gifted students. However, the research on cyberbullying and children and adolescents in general will have implications for those who are gifted. Cyberbullying is defined as ‘willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411427652">Hinduja and Patchin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429411427652">Patchin and Hinduja, 2006</xref>). Cyberbullying may involve aggressive text messages, degrading or humiliating postings on social networking sites, threatening emails, or even websites created specifically to target an individual. As online activities continue to increase among children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411427652">Pew Internet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>), bullies are likely to extend their aggressive behaviors to the cyber world, in addition to the physical world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411427652">Dempsey et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cyberbullying is similar to traditional bullying in that it involves intent to harm and repeated aggression over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411427652">Willard, 2007</xref>). However, whereas traditional bullying involves a power differential, cyberbullying may be perpetrated by those often perceived as weaker in most contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411427652">Willard, 2007</xref>). For example, a student may set up a website mocking and degrading a more popular student or even a teacher. A survey by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261429411427652">Teacher Support Network (2007</xref>) found that 18% of teachers had been bullied, and 35% of these had been cyberbullied by students, often outside of the school setting. Students are often thought of as having less power than teachers, yet online students may have more ‘power’ by virtue of their technological knowledge or numbers. Many studies of cyberbullying (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411427652">Hinduja and Patchin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411427652">Katzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>) neglect to explicitly include the idea of a power differential in their definitions of cyberbullying.</p>
<p>Another difference between traditional bullying and cyberbullying concerns online displays of overt and relational bullying behaviors. Some overt bullying behaviors, such as hitting, obscene gestures, or damage of belongings are not possible in a virtual world. Instead, overt cyberbullying behaviors may include online threats, embarrassing or threatening images, and damage to online ‘property’ through a virus or impersonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>). Some ways in which relational bullying may be perpetrated online include rumors or gossip spread via mobile phone or social networking sites, impersonation by logging in to a target’s online account, or exposure of private online information.</p>
<p>One final contrast between traditional bullying and cyberbullying is that that cyberbullying is not location or time specific. Cyberbullying can occur day or night, at home, school, or in any other environment where electronic media are present. In fact, the majority of cyberbullying occurs outside of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411427652">Agatston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). In one study 11% of students had experienced cyberbullying only outside of school, compared with 3% only inside of school, and 3% both inside and outside. This means that the majority (82%) of cyberbullied students were bullied outside of school. The pervasiveness of electronic media indicates that cyberbullying may have a far greater reach and potential impact than traditional bullying.</p>
<p>It is important to note that different definitions in the literature make precise evaluation of cyberbullying difficult. In many cases, it is unclear whether targets of cyberbullying are being repeatedly bullied for long periods of time, if they are one-time victims of a number of anonymous aggressors, or if they are involved in aggression with peers of equal status, such as an argument between friends. Furthermore, some studies of cyberbullying include only Internet-related activity, whereas others include all forms of electronic media (e.g. text messages).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261429411427652">
<title>Increases in electronic media and cyberbullying</title>
<p>The last decade has seen a significant increase in Internet usage. Seventy-four percent of teens used the Internet in 2000, a figure which rose to 93% in 2010 (Center and Project, 2010). More than half of middle school students went online daily in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411427652">Gross, 2004</xref>) and virtually all (99%) had used the Internet on a weekly basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Cell phone use and ownership has also risen drastically among youth. In 2004, 45% of teens owned cell phones, a rate which increased to 75% in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>). Cell phones have become the favored method of communication by the majority of teenagers in America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>). Text messaging in particular has become common, with 72% of teens sending text messages and 66% of teens who text preferring texting to calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>). These increases in electronic media use translate into more opportunities for cyberbullying to occur.</p>
<p>Gender differences in online and electronic communication vary by media. Some data have indicated that similar numbers of males and females use the Internet, though males may be more frequent and more intense users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411427652">Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429411427652">Helsper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429411427652">Ono and Zavodny, 2003</xref>). Conversely, females are more likely than males to send text messages and make calls on their mobile phones, and engage in both activities more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As the use of these online and electronic media has risen, cyberbullying has also increased, affecting significant numbers of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>). Based on data from 1999 and 2000, 7% of 10–17 year olds were targets of online aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004a</xref>). More recent data found that 11–25% of middle school students were cyberbullied at least once in the past few months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411427652">Kowalski and Limber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>) and 14% in the past 30 days (Dempsey et al., 2009). One review of existing literature showed victimization rates of teens ranging from 9% to 34%, and perpetration rates from 4% to 21% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411427652">David-Ferdon and Hertz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Instant messages and chat rooms are the most common online venues for cyberbullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411427652">Kowalski and Limber, 2007</xref>), with 4.3% of online chatters reporting online abuse more than once a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411427652">Katzer et al., 2009</xref>). As mobile phone ownership among youth has increased, so has its use as a media for aggression. Twenty-six percent of teens report being bullied through text messages or phone calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>) and 15% of teens report having received a sexually suggestive nude picture of someone they know by text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411427652">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>). Newer mobile phones are simply very small computers, allowing youths who use them to be constantly connected to the Internet. The implications for cyberbullying are severe, as targets may literally be unable to escape online aggression.</p>

<title>Classification of students involved in cyberbullying</title>
<p>Students involved in cyberbullying may be classified as cyberbullies or targets, though significant numbers are involved as a combination of both, ‘bully/targets’. Given that gifted children have participated as both bullies and targets with traditional bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411427652">Peterson and Ray, 2006</xref>), the potential is there for them to have similar roles in cyberbullying. Additionally, students in general may be involved as bystanders who witness the cyberbullying behaviors. In a sample of 1501 regular Internet users aged 10–17, 19% were involved in online aggression. Of these, 12% were aggressors, 4% were targets, and the remaining 3% were both aggressors and targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004a</xref>). A more recent sample of 3767 middle school students found that 22% of students were engaged in online bullying, with 4% as bullies, 11% as targets, and 7% as both cyberbullies and targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411427652">Kowalski and Limber, 2007</xref>). Many of those involved in cyberbullying are involved in traditional bullying as well, as highly aggressive students tend to engage in multiple forms of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411427652">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>). The number of bystanders is difficult to accurately assess online, as their presence is not always evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411427652">Willard, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0261429411427652">
<title>Targets</title>
<p>Up to 25% of students are targets of cyberbullying, and a larger percentage are targets of cyber aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411427652">David-Ferdon and Hertz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411427652">Kowalski and Limber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>). These students are often targets of traditional bullying as well, and adolescents who are bullied in school are more likely to be victims of online bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411427652">Katzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>). One study found that two-thirds of cyberbully targets were also targets of traditional bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429411427652">Twyman et al., 2010</xref>). Targets are often cyberbullied by their peers and schoolmates. In a Canadian middle school sample, 31% of cyberbullying targets reported being bullied by schoolmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>). However, in many cases targets do not know the identity of the online bully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). In the same Canadian sample, over 40% of targets did not know who was bullying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Targets share a number of characteristics. They are more likely to have perpetrated or been involved as bystanders in cyberbullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>). Targets of cyberbullying use the Internet more often than non-targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429411427652">Twyman et al., 2010</xref>), and most targets report episodes of cyberbullying to last up to a month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Almost half (44%) of all targets tell no one of the cyberbullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411427652">
<title>Cyberbullies/aggressors</title>
<p>Around 4–15% of students may be classified as cyberbullies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411427652">Kowalski and Limber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>). Many cyberbullies are engaged in overt and relational aggression offline as well as online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411427652">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Fifty-one percent of those who engage in online aggression report being a target of traditional bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004b</xref>). Cyberbullies are also more likely to be targets of other cyberbullies’ attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>), and to have been involved in other cyberbulling incidents as targets or bystanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>). Cyberbullies frequently target the same victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411427652">Katzer et al., 2009</xref>), and find their actions to be more amusing than harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>). Almost half of all cyberbullies are in the same class or year as their target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to targets of cyberbullying, cyberbullies spend more time on computer-based social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429411427652">Twyman et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Cyberbullies tend to share a number of maladaptive psychosocial characteristics, with 32% of youth Internet aggressors reporting high rates of substance use, and 37% reporting engagement in delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004b</xref>). Those engaged in cyberbullying are more likely to experience a negative school climate, to lack peer support, and to hold moral beliefs approving of bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261429411427652">Williams and Guerra, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411427652">
<title>Bystanders</title>
<p>Bystanders are those who witness instances of bullying. Bystander involvement is an important factor in bullying, with bystanders holding a unique and important perspective that may more accurately assess severity and prevalence of bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261429411427652">Wiens and Dempsey, 2009</xref>). Bystanders also have an impact on instances of bullying through a variety of roles such as the reinforcer, the defender, the encourager, or the ignorer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261429411427652">Salmivalli et al., 1996</xref>). Some bystanders act as an assistant to the bully, taking part in the aggression directed at the target, while others may reinforce the bully’s behavior by cheering, encouraging the bully, or laughing at the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411427652">Willard, 2007</xref>). Alternatively, bystanders may attempt to help the target, or they may simply take no action. Unfortunately, bystanders are not always cognizant of the effect they are having on bullying situations. Children who are bystanders often overestimate their roles as defenders of targets, and underestimate their involvement in bullying behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261429411427652">Salmivalli et al., 1996</xref>). In one study with elementary-age children, bullying incidents involved between 2 and 14 bystanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261429411427652">O’Connell et al., 1999</xref>). These bystanders reinforced the bullying by passively watching it take place more than half (54%) of the time, and by actively modeling the bullying 21% of the time. Only 25% of the time did bystanders intervene on behalf of the target. Bystander presence was found to positively relate to the persistence of bullying behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261429411427652">O’Connell et al., 1999</xref>). The effect of bystander presence is much more difficult to measure in electronic environments, where bystanders may be invisible or less evidently active. No studies could be identified that focused explicitly on the role of bystanders involved in cyberbullying.</p>

<title>Gender differences in cyberbullying</title>
<p>Gender differences in traditional bullying involve differences in type of aggression (overt vs. relational) and frequency of aggression, with males more likely to be involved in both types of aggression than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261429411427652">Storch et al., 2004</xref>). Males tend to engage in overt aggression more often than relational aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411427652">Archer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411427652">Carbone-Lopez et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, females have been viewed as engaging in relational aggression more often than overt aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411427652">Crick and Grotpeter, 1995</xref>), though some studies show no difference, or more overt than relational aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411427652">Archer, 2004</xref>). Gifted students in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411427652">Peterson and Ray (2006</xref>) did not use much physical bullying, with 4% of the students reporting a peak of pushing other students in the fifth grade. More males reported that they did something violent some time in grades K to 8, with a peak of 19% of them reporting this in sixth grade. A small percentage of females reported doing something violent over the nine years, with a peak of 7% reporting that it occurred in eighth grade. Gender differences in cyberbullying are less pronounced. Some studies have found no gender difference in targets nor cyberbullies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411427652">Hinduja and Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429411427652">Patchin and Hinduja, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li (2007</xref>) found that cyberbully rates for males and females were similar, with 52% of cyberbullies male and 44% female. While gender differences for individuals involved in cyberbullying are minor or non-existent, groups of cyberbullies are more likely to be female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Increased rates of female bullying online compared with offline may reflect the relational or indirect nature of cyberbullying. It would be important to include an examination of this potential connection with gifted females as well.</p>

<title>Why do students cyberbully?</title>
<p>Research into why students choose to cyberbully is lacking. One theory is that being online may create a ‘disinhibition effect’, leading students to act out or self-disclose much more often online than they would in person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261429411427652">Suler, 2004</xref>). Students may be disinhibited online for a number of reasons, including anonymity, lack of authority figures or structures, and invisibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261429411427652">Suler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004b</xref>). In many cases cyberbullies cannot be identified by their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>), meaning they do not often experience negative consequences for their actions. It has been hypothesized that perpetrators of online aggression may also be disinhibited by being physically removed from the emotional reactions of their targets, and thus from the impact of their behavior on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411427652">Willard, 2007</xref>). Similarly, they may feel that actions perpetrated online are not ‘real’, that they are part of the user’s online persona, or that aggressive behaviors are the norm online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411427652">Willard, 2007</xref>). Cyberbullies may be amused by the reactions they provoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411427652">Vandebosch and Van Cleemput, 2009</xref>), or they may engage in online aggression as a means of revenge. However, these hypotheses have not yet been empirically supported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261429411427652">
<title>Outcomes and associations</title>
<p>Targets of traditional bullying are likely to experience significant and lasting effects, and studies have consistently found a number of negative associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411427652">Dempsey and Storch, 2008</xref>). Many of these associations are interpersonal in nature, such as poor social adjustment, poorer relationships with peers, increased loneliness, and poorer emotional recognition abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411427652">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261429411427652">Woods et al., 2009</xref>). A majority of students may be sympathetic to targets of bullying at first, but this effect diminishes with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429411427652">Rigby and Slee, 1991</xref>), possibly exacerbating negative social effects on targets. Targets of traditional bullying also exhibit poorer emotional adjustment, are more depressed, have higher rates of general and social anxiety, and have less self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429411427652">Hawker and Boulton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411427652">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261429411427652">Seals and Young, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>One alarming association with traditional bullying and peer victimization is an increased rate of suicidal ideation (Dempsey et al., no date; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429411427652">Kaltiala-Heino et al., 1999</xref>). Suicide is the third leading cause of death in youth between the ages of 10 and 24, with approximately 4400 deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411427652">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). Increases in suicidal ideation due to traditional forms of bullying have been observed, with 31% of boys and 36% of girls who were bullied reporting suicidal thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261429411427652">van der Wal et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent case study, or psychological autopsy, of a gifted female adolescent who killed herself at age 18 with a firearm revealed that the girl had been thinking about suicide for seven years before she accomplished it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429411427652">Hyatt, 2010</xref>). She had been bullied by her peers with name-calling, starting in kindergarten, and was bullied by adults in school as well. Her giftedness was misunderstood and unappreciated by her teachers, and, because of this, her behavior was often misinterpreted and inappropriately addressed. She perceived herself as being disciplined differently from other students and in a negative manner by an administrator for behavior that was common in the school. Her expression of her desire to commit suicide in an English assignment was not acknowledged by her teacher, who appeared to have accepted the paper without reading it. The girl had discussed suicide with her peers, but never an adult. Her experiences seemed to indicate that she did not trust adults, including her parents, because she did not think that they would not listen to her. This association with suicide holds true for cyberbullying as well, with targets of cyberbullying almost twice as likely and cyberbullies 1.5 times as likely to have attempted suicide as compared with their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411427652">Hinduja and Patchin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Other outcomes associated with traditional bullying are associated with cyberbullying as well. Similar to targets of traditional bullying, online targets are likely to be less well-liked by their peers, to show increased emotional difficulties, and to have lower self-concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411427652">Katzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411427652">Sourander et al., 2010</xref>). Targets of cyberbullying show increased fear for their safety, perhaps reflecting the ability of cyberbullies to victimize their targets in numerous environments and at unpredictable times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411427652">Sourander et al., 2010</xref>). Youth involved in cyberbullying are at a higher risk for numerous psychosomatic problems, such as headaches, abdominal pain, and sleeping problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411427652">Sourander et al., 2010</xref>). While youth in general involved in traditional bullying evidence poorer academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429411427652">Glew et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411427652">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>), this association has not been found for involvement in cyberbullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>). Additionally, targets of multiple forms of aggression (e.g. overt, relational, or cyber) are at an increased risk for adjustment difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261429411427652">Prinstein et al., 2001</xref>). This is an especially concerning finding as many targets of cyberbullying are also targets of traditional forms of bullying and peer aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411427652">Katzer et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261429411427652">
<title>The role of schools, parents, and community agents</title>
<p>Parents, teachers, and school administrators have a legal responsibility to protect youth from harm. Many students believe that adults are taking a proactive role in preventing cyberbullying. For example, 67% of students believed adults at their school tried to stop cyberbullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>). Students also believe that informing an adult that cyberbullying is occurring will help the situation, and a majority of students advocate telling a parent or teacher when cyberbullying occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411427652">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). However, those involved in cyberbullying often tell no one. Only 34% of cyberbullying targets tell adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429411427652">Li, 2007</xref>). Teachers and parents must do a better job of encouraging youth to report instances of cyberbullying, and should respond quickly when notified of cyberbullying.</p>
<p>Cyberbullying must be understood in terms of the contexts that influence and contribute to it. The school environment is arguably the most important of these contexts, as it is the primary place in which traditional peer interactions take place. When traditional forms of peer aggression are perceived as normal within a school or classroom, aggression rates are higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261429411427652">Kuppens et al., 2008</xref>). Students involved in both cyberbullying and traditional bullying are more likely to view their school climate as negative (Dempsey et al., no date; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411427652">Glew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261429411427652">Nansel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261429411427652">Williams and Guerra, 2007</xref>), which can impact socioemotional adjustment and academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411427652">Brand et al., 2003</xref>). Schools can help prevent cyberbullying by creating an environment in which cyberbullying is physically difficult and socially unacceptable. Schools can implement controls on existing media, restricting access to those areas of the Internet in which cyberbullying is likely to occur (e.g. chat rooms, social media sites), and exclude media not necessary to the learning experience, such as cell phones.</p>
<p>Another important environmental factor is the parent–child relationship. Targets of traditional bullying tend to have weaker emotional bonds with their parents, report poorer family functioning, and report negative relationships with absent fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429411427652">Rigby, 1993</xref>). Similarly, a poor parent–child emotional bond is linked with a large increase in online harassment, as is inadequate caregiver monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429411427652">Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004b</xref>). Parents can help decrease online bullying behaviors by modeling appropriate technology usage, monitoring Internet usage by their child, and creating a relationship in which the child feels safe and comfortable reporting negative online experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411427652">Siegle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important that both parents and teachers encourage and support open, honest communication with their children and the children with whom they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411427652">Siegle, 2010</xref>). The victims and bystanders of traditional bullying or cyberbullying behavior need to know that adults are willing to respond and intervene. Both teachers and parents can assist in fostering a positive school environment by helping students understand each other, appreciate their differences, and treat each other with respect.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Like people in general, when there are feelings of self-doubt and doubts about one’s own efficacy, youth may be propelled to seek ways to elevate personal status by lashing out at or denigrating others. In today’s technological, fast-paced, global society, use of cyberspace becomes not only a fairly easy mechanism for attacking others, but it also often provides a relatively anonymous means for doing so.</p>
<p>The purpose of this examination was to illuminate the phenomenon of cyberbullying and its particular impact on gifted and talented students. In so doing, the dearth of empirical research that has been completed – particularly as cyberbullying relates to giftedness – is obvious. Hence, this review of extant literature associated with cyberbullying and gifted and talented students should serve as a call to the research community to escalate studies in this arena.</p>
