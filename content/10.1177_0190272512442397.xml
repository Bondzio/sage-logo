<abstract>
<p>Classic work suggests that intergroup conflict increases intragroup cohesion and cooperation. But how do group members respond when their peers refuse to cooperate? Simmel ([1908] 1955) argued that groups in conflict quell dissent by sanctioning group members and supporting centralized leadership systems. This claim has important implications, but little direct support. This research investigates how intergroup conflict shapes individuals’ tendencies to sacrifice for their groups, enforce norms by sanctioning their peers, and relinquish decision-making autonomy to a leader. I test the predictions with two small group experiments, which find that conflict increases enforcement of norms when outgroup participation in conflict is high and increases contribution to the group regardless of outgroup participation in conflict. Evidence on support for leaders is mixed and suggests that the performance of the group may affect support for leaders. The research has broader theoretical implications for the study of group processes, collective action, and institutions.</p>

<p>Conflict between groups is an enduring aspect of the human experience and a pressing theoretical and empirical challenge for sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0190272512442397">Bowles 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0190272512442397">Cook 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0190272512442397">Fiske 2002</xref>). Sociologists and other social scientists have made important contributions to the study of conflict, particularly in developing the idea that conflict between groups promotes cohesion within groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512442397">Coser 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512442397">Simmel [1908] 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512442397">Stein 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512442397">Sumner and Keller [1906] 1960</xref>). Early theorists noted this tendency in a diverse range of settings, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512442397">Simmel’s ([1908] 1955</xref>) analysis of the Catholic Church to Marx’s view of intraclass solidarity as rooted in interclass conflict.</p>
<p>Empirical studies show that during conflict, individuals evaluate their groups more positively, show stronger affective attachment to the group, and are more willing to make costly contributions to enhance the group’s welfare, compared to nonconflict settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0190272512442397">Blake, Shepard, and Mouton 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512442397">Bornstein 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0190272512442397">Brewer 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif 1966</xref>). Yet even when a threat increases overall group cohesion, individual contributions to the group vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0190272512442397">Gould 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The present research builds on prior work by asking how individuals respond to those who do <italic>not</italic> contribute during conflict and how these responses shape the social organization of groups. Classic theories suggest that in conflict, individuals encourage contribution to the group through two mechanisms: punishing noncontributors and centralizing authority in the hands of a leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512442397">Simmel [1908] 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512442397">Sumner and Keller [1906] 1960</xref>). While we know much about the effect of conflict on group contribution and other direct measures of cohesion, we know little about the effect of conflict on mechanisms designed to maintain cohesion, such as norms and leadership systems. To address this gap, the study asks two questions. When threatened by outsiders, do people pressure their peers to make personal sacrifices for the group? And do group members grant leaders the authority to require sacrifices from the group?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions have important implications. First, they address the causal relationship between conflict, norms, and leadership. Societies that often experience conflict tend to have strict norms of sacrifice for the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0190272512442397">Black-Michaud 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0190272512442397">Gould 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512442397">Stein 1976</xref>). But does conflict produce stricter norms, or are groups with strict norms more willing or able to pursue conflict? Second, there are meaningful distinctions between willingness to sacrifice for a group and willingness to require sacrifices from others. By testing whether conflict affects not only the choices people make, but also the rules they impose on others, and the systems of authority they establish, the research examines how groups develop rudimentary forms of social structure. Enforcing norms and establishing leaders are fundamental ways that groups define their structure and boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0190272512442397">Durkheim [1894] 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0190272512442397">Erikson 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0190272512442397">Mead 1918</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I investigate whether conflict promotes not only self-sacrifice for the group, but also the enforcement of <italic>norms</italic> of self-sacrifice through the sanctioning of noncontributors, as well as support for centralized leadership. Drawing on realistic group conflict theory and the group position model, I also investigate an important moderator: the escalation of conflict by an outgroup. I test the hypotheses with two laboratory studies in which small groups interact under varying levels of conflict. I conclude by discussing the broader implications of the results and directions for further research.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0190272512442397">
<title>Defining Cohesion</title>
<p>Theory and research employ a number of definitions of cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0190272512442397">Friedkin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0190272512442397">McPherson and Smith-Lovin 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512442397">Stein 1976</xref>). Following definitions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0190272512442397">Durkheim ([1894] 1988</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512442397">Coser (1956)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0190272512442397">Hechter (1987)</xref>, I define cohesion as the extent to which people invest personal resources (e.g., time, effort, or money) in a group’s goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0190272512442397">Hechter 1987</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0190272512442397">Gould 2003</xref>). By defining cohesion in this way, enforcing norms and supporting leaders can be understood as behaviors that produce or maintain cohesion by encouraging contribution.</p>

<sec id="section3-0190272512442397">
<title>The Problem of Norm Enforcement</title>
<p>Social norms have long been of interest to sociologists, in part because they serve as the building blocks of more complex forms of social organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0190272512442397">Horne 2001b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272512442397">Hechter and Opp 2001</xref> for a review). Norms are also of interest for their durability: they are often transmitted across generations, outlasting the individuals who established them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0190272512442397">Sherif and Murphy 1936</xref>). Because of the ubiquity of norms in social life, social scientists have used them to explain a range of human behaviors, including group cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0190272512442397">Horne 2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272512442397">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, a number of definitions of norms exist. Here, I adopt a widely used definition of norms as rules that mandate or prohibit particular behaviors, supported by punishments or rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0190272512442397">Coleman 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272512442397">Hechter and Opp 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512442397">Homans [1951] 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0190272512442397">Horne 2001a</xref>). Norms exist to the extent that group members invest resources in enforcing them, including the time, effort, and resources involved in monitoring the group for rule-breakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0190272512442397">Hechter 1987</xref>) and punishing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0190272512442397">Oliver 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Because enforcing contribution is costly, even when individuals have an interest in a norm, they may be unlikely to enforce it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0190272512442397">Oliver 1980</xref>). For example, though academic departments benefit from a collegial atmosphere, confronting a disruptive colleague about her or his behavior can be uncomfortable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272512442397">Horne 2009</xref>). Yet, studies find that people do enforce group contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0190272512442397">Ostrom, Walker, and Gardner 1992</xref>; Yamigishi 1986). How intergroup conflict affects norm enforcement, however, remains unexamined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0190272512442397">Fehr and Fischbacher 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0190272512442397">
<title>Classic Approaches</title>
<p>The argument that intergroup conflict amplifies intragroup cohesion has a long history in social science theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512442397">Simmel ([1908] 1955</xref>) emphasized groups’ tendencies to punish dissent and create hierarchies in conflict (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512442397">Sumner and Keller [1906] 1960</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512442397">Coser (1956)</xref> qualified this idea, arguing that conflict does not <italic>uniformly</italic> increase cohesion. Instead, he maintained that the extent to which the outgroup poses a <italic>threat to the ingroup as a whole</italic> moderates the effect of conflict on cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512442397">Coser 1956</xref>:91–5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0190272512442397">Williams 1947</xref>). The emphasis on outgroup threats is further developed in realistic group conflict theory and the group position model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0190272512442397">
<title>Realistic Group Conflict Theory</title>
<p>Realistic group conflict theory (RGCT) argues that conflict develops when groups compete over incompatible goals, such as securing scarce resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif 1966</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0190272512442397">Jackson [1993]</xref> for a review). Competition generates frustration and social distance between groups, which result in negative evaluations of outgroup members and positive evaluations of ingroup members. These evaluations in turn stimulate greater cohesion within groups and conflict between groups. In the classic formulation and test of the theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif (1966)</xref> conducted a series of field experiments at summer camps in which he organized competitions between groups of campers. He found that competing intergroup goals intensified ingroup bias and outgroup aggression. He also reported anecdotal evidence that competition increased social sanctions for less aggressive individuals. Later studies produced substantively similar results in different domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0190272512442397">Blake et al. 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0190272512442397">Struch and Schwartz 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>A question arising from RGCT is whether conflicting goals are sufficient to motivate cohesion or whether the outgroup must pursue those goals and inflict costs on the ingroup. Sherif maintained that competing goals are the “<italic>sufficient condition</italic>” driving intragroup cohesion and intergroup conflict (1966:85, emphasis in original). If conflicting goals are sufficient, we should observe greater contribution to the group, enforcement of norms, and support for leaders when two groups are structurally interdependent, such that behavior that creates a gain for one group produces a loss for the other group. This <italic>structural conflict</italic> hypothesis predicts that when groups possess conflicting goals, compared to situations in which there is no conflict:</p>
<list id="list1-0190272512442397" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: Individuals will be more likely to enforce norms of contribution within their ingroup.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1b</italic>: Individuals will be more likely to contribute to their ingroup.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1c</italic>: Individuals will be more likely to support centralizing leadership within their ingroup.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Some evidence supports the structural conflict hypothesis. A classic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0190272512442397">Rabbie and Horwitz (1969)</xref> on the “interdependence of fate” found greater ingroup bias when an outgroup stood to earn a prize at the expense of the ingroup, compared to when no prize was at stake. This held even when the prize was awarded randomly, rather than competitively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0190272512442397">Bornstein and Ben-Yossef (1994)</xref> also found that conflicting intergroup goals increased individuals’ costly contributions to their group, even without knowledge of the outgroup’s actions. Thus, conflicting goals—independent of outgroup behavior—underlie at least some forms of cohesion.</p>
<p>It is unclear, however, whether conflicting goals are sufficient to produce norm enforcement and support for creating centralized leadership positions. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif (1966)</xref> measured ingroup and outgroup bias systematically, he observed support for norms and leaders only anecdotally. In addition, in Sherif’s studies the presence of conflicting goals is confounded with the outgroup’s pursuit of the conflict. That is, because Sherif did not measure or manipulate outgroup behavior, it is unclear whether the patterns he observes are due to conflicting goals alone or conflicting goals in conjunction with the outgroup’s pursuit of those goals. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0190272512442397">Bornstein and Ben-Yossef (1994)</xref> find evidence that conflicting goals produce contribution to conflict, but do not examine norm enforcement and support for leaders.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may be the case that the outgroup must pursue conflict, and inflict costs on the ingroup, before ingroup members will contribute, enforce norms, and create leadership positions. Such behaviors are costly and may require stronger incentives or threats. Individuals may also be reluctant to impose punishments or leaders on their peers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0190272512442397">Oliver 1980</xref>) without an impending crisis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0190272512442397">
<title>The Group Position Model</title>
<p>The group position model (GPM) was developed in the context of explaining intergroup prejudice and ethnic antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0190272512442397">Blumer 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272512442397">Bobo and Hutchings 1996</xref>). The core argument is that intergroup antagonism is strongest when a dominant group feels that its position <italic>as a group</italic> is threatened by competition from a subordinate group. The GPM emphasizes “a need to assess the degree to which individuals feel their own group is at risk for losing significant resources to other social groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>:449–50). For example, ethnic minorities in the Russian Federation perceive more conflict with ethnic Russians when they feel economically and culturally encroached upon by Russians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0190272512442397">Minescu and Poppe 2011</xref>). The GPM and RGCT are not mutually exclusive, but proponents of the GPM argue that it examines a broader range of factors in intergroup relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Relative to RGCT, the group position model highlights the importance of perceived threats, in addition to whether two groups’ goals conflict. In the GPM, the fact that two groups possess competing goals should affect intragroup relations if the outgroup pursues those goals and thereby constitutes a threat to the ingroup. This implies that the actual level of outgroup competition moderates the effect of conflicting goals.</p>
<p>While past work on the GPM focuses on intergroup behavior, I argue that the model also has important implications for intragroup behavior. I base this argument on a key assertion of the model: perceived threat of outgroup competition generates strong affective and normative responses as well as instrumental concerns for the ingroup. That is, because individuals have emotional ties to their groups, threats to the group provoke emotional reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>:456). And because individuals see their groups in normative terms (i.e., we “ought” to outperform other groups), threats to the group motivate strong reactions because they violate individuals’ sense of the normal order of intergroup relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0190272512442397">Blumer 1958</xref>:5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>:453–54).</p>
<p>In terms of affective reactions, perceived intergroup conflict increases fear, anxiety, and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272512442397">Dovidio, Gaertner, and Kawakami 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0190272512442397">Mackie, Devos, and Smith 2000</xref>; Pettigrew 1998). If perceived threats increase anger toward outgroup members, they could also motivate punishment of ingroup members suspected of disloyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0190272512442397">Gouldner 1954</xref>). In fact, individuals often evaluate norm-violating ingroup members even <italic>more</italic> negatively than outgroup members (the “black sheep effect”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0190272512442397">Marques, Yzerbyt, and Leyens 1998</xref>), and anger motivates costly punishment of noncontributors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0190272512442397">Fehr and Gächter 2002</xref>). Emotions may thus serve as “commitment devices” that lead people to punish transgressions even when the apparent cost of doing so is high; such behavior could be beneficial in the long run if it served to deter transgressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0190272512442397">Frank 1988</xref>). Strong emotions in the face of perceived threats may also encourage support for leaders to facilitate an anger-driven response to conflict with the outgroup or provide a sense of safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512442397">Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of normative reactions, outgroup competition could increase the “oughtness” of contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0190272512442397">Lindenberg, Joly, and Stapel 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0190272512442397">Lindenberg and Steg 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0190272512442397">Opp 2001</xref>). Oughtness is the extent to which one views a norm as important, disapproves of norm violations, and is motivated to conform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0190272512442397">Lindenberg et al. 2011</xref>:101). One’s sense of oughtness in regard to a behavior is activated by contexts that make goals related to that behavior salient, leading to support for norms that enhance the likelihood of achieving the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0190272512442397">Lindenberg and Steg 2007</xref>). The threat of outgroup competition highlights the goal of winning a conflict by making salient the possibility that the ingroup could lose significant resources to the outgroup and by threatening the normative sense that one’s group <italic>deserves</italic> to win (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>). As a consequence, one’s own contribution (through motivation to conform) and sanctioning of noncontributors (through disapproval of norm violators) could increase. Similarly, if leaders are seen as an effective route through which to pursue the group’s goals, support for leaders may increase.</p>
<p>If outgroup competition—in the form of the outgroup actively pursuing a conflicting goal—generates stronger affective and normative reactions than conflicting goals alone, individuals should be more willing to enforce norms, contribute, and support leaders when the ingroup and outgroup’s goals conflict <italic>and</italic> the outgroup invests in reaching those goals. I refer to this as the <italic>outgroup competition</italic> hypothesis. When conflicting goals exist and the outgroup competes with the ingroup by investing in their goals, I predict the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0190272512442397" list-type="simple">

<p>While Hypotheses 1a through 1c predict a main effect of conflicting goals, Hypotheses 2a through 2c predict a moderating effect of outgroup competition (a conflicting goals × outgroup competition interaction).</p>
<p>By experimentally testing the distinction between the structural and outgroup competition hypotheses, I extend the application of the GPM beyond its focus on durable, stratified interethnic relationships. Previous findings support the augmentation of the traditional scope of the GPM to experimental research. First, although laboratory groups lack an extensive history of interaction, social identity theory research finds that individuals form meaningful attachments to their groups and care about their group’s outcomes relative to those of an outgroup even under minimal conditions in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0190272512442397">Hewstone, Rubin, and Willis 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0190272512442397">Tajfel et al. 1971</xref>). Second, although these experimentally created groups are on equal footing rather than in a dominant-subordinate relationship, intergroup conflict research finds that equal-rank relationships can be even more contentious than those between dominant and subordinate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0190272512442397">Gould 2003</xref>). Such contentiousness arises because <italic>each</italic> group feels entitled to claim resources from their rival.</p>
<p>In the two experiments designed to investigate the hypotheses, structural conflict was operationally defined as the presence of conflicting goals between the groups, while outgroup competition was operationally defined as the extent to which the outgroup contributed to conflict with the ingroup. The studies evaluated the effect of structural conflict between groups on norm enforcement, contribution, and support for leaders and the extent to which outgroup competition moderates those effects. In both studies, small groups interacted under varying levels of conflict. Participants decided whether to contribute to the group, enforce contribution by paying to punish noncontributors, and create a centralized leadership position. Study 1 employed live groups and an endogenous measure of outgroup contribution, while Study 2 employed simulated partners and manipulated outgroup contribution.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in Study 1 consisted of 120 paid undergraduate volunteers (83 women and 37 men) at a large private university in the Northeast, recruited via flyers offering payment for participation in an experimental study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0190272512442397">1</xref></sup> There were 60 participants (10 sessions, each with two groups of three persons) in each condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0190272512442397">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>When participants arrived at the lab, a research assistant led them to a private cubicle equipped with a computer. All interaction in the study took place using experimental software and over a computer network; participants did not meet face-to-face. After they gave written consent to participate, the experimental task (described in the following) was explained using verbal and computer-based instructions. Participants were randomly divided into two teams of three participants, labeled the “Red” and “Green” teams. The instructions informed participants of their team membership and that they were or were not competing with the other team, according to condition. Each session was randomly assigned to a “conflict” or “no conflict” condition. The participants completed 30 rounds of the experimental task (preceded by a practice round). On each round, participants made contribution and norm enforcement decisions and then saw their gross earnings, losses from punishment, net earnings after punishment, total net earnings, and the number of contributors and punishers that round and in total. Participants then responded to survey questions, including demographic questions such as gender and class year, and were debriefed, paid, and thanked for participating.</p>

<sec id="section10-0190272512442397">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Study 1 includes two key independent variables: an experimental manipulation of conflict and an endogenous measure of outgroup competition. In the conflict condition, participants interacted in an <italic>intergroup prisoner’s dilemma</italic> (IPD), a standardized setting for studying intergroup conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512442397">Bornstein 2003</xref>). The IPD extends the n-person prisoner’s dilemma (NPD), which is commonly used to study cooperation in situations in which group and individual interests conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0190272512442397">Axelrod 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0190272512442397">Kollock 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0190272512442397">Komorita and Parks 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In the IPD, participants receive an endowment of money on each round and decide whether to keep it or contribute it to their group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512442397">Bornstein 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0190272512442397">Palfrey and Rosenthal 1983</xref>). Contributing is individually costly but provides benefits for the group while imposing costs on the outgroup. Not contributing is individually profitable but withholds benefits from the group and does not impose costs on the outgroup. Contributing models participating in a conflict or competition, such as voting, attacking an enemy, or joining in a protest, in which individuals spend resources for the benefit of their group and to the detriment of an outgroup.</p>
<p>The IPD includes two teams, here denoted <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. The earnings, <italic>h</italic>, of each participant, <italic>i</italic>, per round are determined as follows, shown here for a participant on Team A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512442397">Bornstein 2003</xref>):</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>Each participant receives an endowment <italic>e</italic> (<italic>e</italic> = 10) and decides to contribute (σ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 1) or keep (σ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 0) the endowment. Payoffs to individuals increase by a factor of five with the number of ingroup contributors (denoted <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) and decrease with the number of outgroup contributors (denoted <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>). Fifteen points are added to the payoffs each round to keep earnings positive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0190272512442397">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the no conflict condition, the two teams interacted in separate three-person prisoner’s dilemmas (PDs) instead of competing in a single IPD. To change the IPD used for the conflict condition into a PD, <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> in Equation 1 is set to 1, so that payoffs are determined by the behavior of one’s own team and one can neither harm nor be harmed by the outgroup. This decision was based on prior research finding that varying the constant to which <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> is set does not affect participants’ behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0190272512442397">Bornstein and Ben-Yossef 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0190272512442397">3</xref></sup> Thus, across both conditions, participants were members of one of two teams and could see the decisions and outcomes of the other team. In the PD, however, participants’ decisions did not affect the other team.</p>
<p>By design, the no conflict condition is similar to the “minimal group paradigm” used in social identity theory research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0190272512442397">Tajfel et al. 1971</xref>), in that two teams are present and are given distinct names. This ensures that any differences between the two conditions are due to conflict, rather than group identity. If the conflict condition included two teams and the no conflict condition included only one team, whether the results were the product of conflict itself or the presence of a second team would be unclear.</p>
<p>The outgroup competition variable is operationally defined as the number of outgroup contributors on every round, ranging from zero to three. Outgroup competition is defined in this way because in the conflict condition, this variable indicates the extent to which outgroup members invested resources in harming the ingroup. In the control condition, outgroup contribution does not affect payoffs to the ingroup but is observable.</p>
<p>To capture the intensity of outgroup competition, the analysis used the lagged sum of outgroup contributions each round. This cumulative measure provides a count of the total past contributions from the outgroup. The analysis also includes the interaction effect of conflict and the outgroup contribution variable, in order to test the hypothesis that participants enforce norms, contribute, and support leaders in conflict to the extent that the outgroup behaves competitively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0190272512442397">
<title>Dependent Measures</title>
<p>To test the norm enforcement hypotheses, the study allows participants to enforce norms by punishing noncontributors, using a procedure adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0190272512442397">Yamagishi (1986)</xref>. Participants received a second 10-point endowment in a “punishment account” each round. When participants decided whether to contribute to the group, they also decided whether to invest their punishment account in a group punishment fund. On each round, each noncontributor lost the total amount contributed to the group punishment fund divided by the number of noncontributors. If a participant kept their punishment account, their endowment was added to their total earnings and was not available for later investment. As in the case of contribution, not enforcing norms is a dominant strategy in the stage game.</p>
<p>To test the contribution hypotheses, participants could choose to contribute (or not contribute) their endowments to their group, as described previously. If a participant kept their endowment, it was added to their total earnings and could not be invested later.</p>
<p>To test the leadership hypotheses, the study allowed participants to create a centralized leadership position. After completing the rounds, participants were informed that the study would pause for a vote. They were asked to vote on whether the group should continue with the leaderless format or change formats and elect a leader. Participants were informed that the leader could set rules for how much each person must invest and punish those who did not invest this amount. Participants did not actually play another set of rounds.</p>
<p>The measures of norm enforcement, contribution, and leader preferences are binary variables valued at 1 if the participant punished, contributed, or voted to elect a leader and 0 otherwise. The enforcement and contribution data were collected every round, resulting in 3,600 observations (120 participants × 30 rounds). The leader question was asked after participants finished the IPD or PD, resulting in 120 observations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0190272512442397">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>The outgroup’s behaviors may be correlated with the ingroup’s behaviors, so the analysis controls for ingroup behaviors. The analysis includes measures of the number of team members contributing and punishing each round (excluding the focal participant). The study uses the cumulative lagged versions of each variable and variables measuring the interaction of the lagged variables with conflict. The analysis also includes round as a control for time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0190272512442397">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>To adjust for the nonindependence of observations, the analysis employs a multilevel model in which rounds are nested within participants, participants are nested within teams, and teams are nested within sessions, estimated using STATA’s GLLAMM program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0190272512442397">Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondall 2005</xref>). The analysis uses a logit link function to model the binary dependent measures. The unit of analysis is the participant-round for the norm enforcement and contribution data, as these were collected on each of 30 rounds. The unit of analysis is the participant for the leader analyses, which were collected once for each individual.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0190272512442397">
<title>Results</title>
<p>I present the proportions of individuals investing in norm enforcement and contribution and voting to create a leadership position by condition before turning to the round-level data to test the hypotheses. Levels of norm enforcement were similar in the conflict condition (M = .17, SD = .24) and the no conflict condition (M = .18, SD = .23, <italic>ns, t</italic>-tests of the session-level means). For the contribution variable, the results were in the direction of the hypothesis, but not statistically significant (conflict condition: M = .64, SD = .28; no conflict condition: M = .55, SD = .34, <italic>ns</italic>). Overall levels of leader preferences were also similar across conditions (conflict condition: M = .42, SD = .50; no conflict condition: M = .40, SD = .49, <italic>ns</italic>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0190272512442397">Table 1</xref> presents the coefficients for the effects of conflict, outgroup contribution, the conflict × outgroup contribution interaction, and the control variables on norm enforcement (column 1) and contribution (column 2). The structural conflict hypothesis predicts that individuals will enforce norms more often in the conflict condition than the no conflict condition (Hypothesis 1a). This hypothesis was not supported: the main effect of conflict net of the control variables (norm enforcement model, row 1) is not statistically significant, indicating that structural conflict alone does not motivate norm enforcement. The main effect of conflict is similar in these models when the control variables are excluded. The findings also reveal an unpredicted significant and negative effect of outgroup contribution, which indicates that individuals tended to enforce norms to a lesser extent when the outgroup contributed more.</p>

<p>Consistent with the outgroup competition hypothesis, when outgroup contribution is high, the predicted probability that participants will enforce norms is greater in the conflict condition (.09) than the no conflict condition (.06). That is, when the outgroup contributes at a high level, individuals’ predicted probabilities of enforcing norms are nearly 50 percent greater in the conflict condition than the no conflict condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512442397">Figure 1</xref> also illustrates that when outgroup contribution is low, participants are predicted to have a lower probability of enforcing norms in the conflict condition than the no conflict condition (.20 vs. .11), due to the negative main effect of conflict. This represents a decline in the predicted probability of nearly 50 percent.</p>
<p>The results of Study 1 support the outgroup competition hypothesis (Hypothesis 2a), finding that norm enforcement is greater in conflict, but only when the outgroup contributes. The results do not support the structural conflict prediction that conflicting goals are sufficient to motivate norm enforcement (Hypothesis 1a). In addition, the study unexpectedly found greater overall levels of norm enforcement in the no conflict condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0190272512442397">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>The analysis first evaluates the structural conflict prediction that individuals will prefer leaders to a greater extent when their group is in conflict than when it is not. The nonsignificant main effect of conflict indicates that structural conflict does not significantly affect preference for a leader. In addition, the main effect of outgroup contribution was nonsignificant. The findings support the outgroup competition hypothesis (2c). When the outgroup behaved competitively, people were more likely to prefer a leader in the conflict condition, as shown by the positive and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) interaction of conflict and outgroup contribution.</p>
<p>These patterns are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0190272512442397">Figure 2</xref>, which presents the predicted probabilities by conflict condition and low or high mean level of outgroup contribution (low = outgroup contributed on 7 percent of rounds, high = outgroup contributed on 100 percent of rounds). When outgroup contribution is high, the predicted probability of voting to create a leadership position is .83 in the conflict condition versus .32 in the no conflict condition, an increase of more than 150 percent. When outgroup contribution is low, the predicted probability is .46 in the no conflict condition versus .03 in the conflict condition, a decline of approximately 93 percent. Thus, the results of Study 1 support Hypothesis 2c, that individuals will support creating leadership positions under high outgroup contribution, but not Hypothesis 1c, that conflicting goals alone motivate support for leaders.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 1 offers initial support for some of the hypotheses. The study found that outgroup competition moderates the effect of conflict on norm enforcement and support for leaders, supporting Hypotheses 2a and 2c over Hypotheses 1a and 1c. Individuals enforced norms and supported creating leadership positions to a greater extent in the conflict condition than the no conflict condition, when the level of outgroup contribution was high. Individuals tended to contribute more in conflict, regardless of whether the outgroup contributed, though this difference was not significant.</p>
<p>A qualification to the results of Study 1 is that there was not a significant <italic>net</italic> increase in norm enforcement or contribution in the conflict condition. The main contribution of Study 1 thus lies in identifying outgroup competition as a moderator of the effect of conflict on norm enforcement and leader preferences, rather than demonstrating the conditions under which conflict causes groups to enforce norms at greater overall rates.</p>
<p>The fact that Study 1 allowed for live interaction between the study participants, rather than using simulated interaction partners, may account for the lack of a net difference between the conflict and no conflict conditions. The lower level of control afforded by live interaction raises three issues addressed in Study 2. First, Study 1 used endogenous levels of outgroup contribution as a measure of outgroup competition. Simulating and manipulating outgroup contribution would provide stronger support for the causal effect of outgroup contribution. In addition, endogenous outgroup contributions provide an imperfect measure of outgroup competition, because the average level of contribution declines over time. Second, average contributions are greater in the conflict condition (64 percent) than in the no conflict condition (55 percent). This may have reduced the incentive to enforce norms of contribution in conflict. Third, levels of sanctioning in both conditions were low, with participants sanctioning 18 percent of the time on average, which in turn could have suppressed the effects of conflict on norm enforcement.</p>
<p>Study 2 addresses these limitations by having participants interact with computer-simulated partners, presented as real. This allows for (1) manipulation of outgroup contribution, (2) constant levels of ingroup contribution across conditions, and (3) balanced levels of norm enforcement. These changes provide a cleaner test of the hypotheses and a stronger evaluation of the causal relationship between conflict, outgroup competition, and the dependent measures.</p>
<p>In addition, Study 2 expands the scope of Study 1 to vary the incentive structure of the conflict. The intergroup prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) models a broad range of conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512442397">Bornstein 2003</xref>), but other models can be used to evaluate the robustness of the findings. In particular, in the IPD individuals are always better off not contributing to the group. However, in win/lose or “all-or-nothing” conflicts, one contribution could make the difference between victory and defeat. In such cases, the cost of contributing is offset by its impact on the outcome (e.g., costly voting may be rational if it has a high probability of changing the outcome; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0190272512442397">Bornstein 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretically, norm enforcement should be higher in all-or-nothing settings because each participant’s contributions are more crucial for the group’s success. It is not clear, however, whether all-or-nothing conflict settings will produce more enforcement than all-or-nothing nonconflict settings. Study 2 examines this by manipulating the incentive structure of conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, Study 2 also refines the no conflict condition to make it more comparable to the conflict condition. In Study 1, the payoffs in the conflict condition fluctuate with the behavior of both the ingroup and outgroup, whereas in the no conflict condition payoffs fluctuate with the behavior of the ingroup only. The conflict condition may thus be more cognitively demanding because participants must attend to information about ingroup and outgroup behavior. In addition, the fact that individuals in the conflict condition faced an external threat, while those in the no conflict condition did not, raises a second issue. Individuals in the no conflict condition may have focused more on intragroup relations, such as norm enforcement, than those in the conflict condition, because participants in the no conflict condition did not need to attend to an outside threat to the group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0190272512442397">6</xref></sup> To address this, Study 2 refines the no conflict condition so that payoffs vary similarly to the conflict condition.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 144 paid undergraduate volunteers (91 women and 53 men) at a large state university in the Midwest, recruited via advertisements on campus and online. The analyses excluded 7 participants (4.8 percent) due to suspicion about some aspect of the study and 4 (2.8 percent) due to failure to understand the instructions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0190272512442397">7</xref></sup> The sessions typically included 6 participants; when fewer were present, confederates created the appearance of a full session. The study was programmed and conducted with the software z-Tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0190272512442397">Fischbacher 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0190272512442397">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Study 2 used a six-person intergroup conflict setting similar in design to Study 1, but with several differences. Study 2 simulated the behavior of each participant’s partners (described in the following). This included manipulating the number of outgroup contributors to be either high (2–3 per round) or low (0–1 per round). The study also improved the comparability of the conflict and no conflict conditions. In Study 1, <italic>m<sub>b</sub></italic>, the number of outgroup contributors in the conflict condition, was set to 1 in the no conflict condition. In Study 2, the number of outgroup contributors <italic>m<sub>b</sub></italic> is referred to as the “provision point” in the no conflict condition and varies between zero and three on each round (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0190272512442397">Marwell and Ames 1979</xref>). The provision point varies independently of outgroup contributions, but with the same probabilities. This equalizes the payoffs and the complexity of the setting across conditions. In addition, it provides an external factor affecting participants’ payoffs in the no conflict condition, equalizing participants’ incentives to focus on ingroup relations across conditions. Participants again interacted for 30 rounds, this time preceded by five practice rounds. After responding to survey questions, they were debriefed, thanked, and paid.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0190272512442397">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>To experimentally manipulate outgroup competition, Study 2 varied the behavior of the outgroup in a within-subjects design. Study 2 divided the 30 rounds of interaction into two 15-round blocks. Participants interacted with a competitive (high contributing) outgroup in one block of 15 rounds and a noncompetitive (low contributing) outgroup in the other. The order in which participants interacted with the competitive outgroup was randomly assigned. This change in outgroup behavior—from competitive to noncompetitive or vice versa—was explained by informing participants that they would be randomly assigned to new teams halfway through the study. In the competitive outgroup condition, two or three outgroup members contributed per round (with 50 percent chance of either two or three outgroup contributors). In the noncompetitive outgroup condition, zero or one outgroup members contributed each round (again with a 50 percent chance of each).</p>
<p>While the outgroup’s behavior was manipulated, the behavior of teammates was held constant across conditions. One teammate was programmed to contribute and enforce norms 70 percent of the time, while the other was programmed to contribute 30 percent of the time and not to enforce norms. The study included one high and one low contributing and enforcing teammate to balance pressures to conform to teammates’ behaviors and to ensure equal levels of teammate contribution and enforcement across conditions. Study 2 also manipulated the incentive structure of the conflict. Study 2 includes the same IPD setting used in Study 1, but also adds an additional condition implementing a step-level production function (known as an “intergroup public goods game,” or IPG; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0190272512442397">Bornstein 1992</xref>). In this setting, the total contributions of the ingroup are compared to either the outgroup’s contributions (in the conflict condition) or the provision point (in the no conflict condition). The team with greater contributions (or contributions exceeding the provision point) receives 30 points per person, while the team that fails to match or exceed the outgroup’s contributions or the provision point earns 0 points that round. In case of a tie, all participants earn 15 points. The intergroup public goods game models conflicts of a win/lose or all-or-nothing nature, such as voting. I refer to these two conditions as the “continuous” (for the IPD) and “binary” (for the IPG) conditions.</p>
<p>In the binary stage game, contribution is profitable if it changes the outcome from a tie to a win or from a loss to a tie. For this reason, participants have a greater interest in their teammates’ contributions in the binary condition. It is unknown, however, whether the incentive structure will interact with the conflict condition. For a detailed comparison of the payoffs across the IPD and the IPG, see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0190272512442397">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>In sum, Study 2 employs a 2 (conflict/no conflict, between subjects) × 2 (continuous/binary production function, between subjects) × 2 (competitive/noncompetitive outgroup, within subjects) mixed factorial design. Study 2 evaluates the findings of Study 1 in a more controlled setting and examines whether the results generalize across two different types of conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0190272512442397">
<title>Dependent Measures</title>
<p>The dependent measures in Study 2 were nearly identical to those in Study 1. Participants decided whether to invest in norm enforcement and contribution each round for 30 rounds. For the preference for a leader measure following the rounds, participants believed they would be interacting with their team from the second block in future interactions with a leader. For this reason, I used the variables from the second block in the leader analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0190272512442397">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>To analyze the data from Study 2, I used logistic regression to test for the predicted interaction effect (conflict × outgroup competitiveness) and <italic>t</italic>-tests to evaluate simple effects. The logistic regressions used round-level data, with standard errors clustered by participant ID. The <italic>t</italic>-tests were based on the individual-level data, collapsed across rounds. The analysis used indicator variables for the conflict (1 = conflict, 0 = no conflict), production function (1 = binary, 0 = continuous), and outgroup competitiveness (1 = competitive, 0 = noncompetitive) conditions. To test the prediction that outgroup competition moderates the effect of conflict on norm enforcement, the models included the conflict × outgroup competitiveness interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0190272512442397">
<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Study 2 included a within-subjects manipulation of outgroup competitiveness and randomly assigned the order in which the conditions were presented. To test for order of condition effects, I examined whether a binary variable indicating the order in which the outgroup competitiveness condition appeared (1 = competitive outgroup first, 2 = competitive outgroup second) significantly interacted with the three manipulated independent variables. For norm enforcement, there was a significant interaction (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) of the within-subjects variable and the order in which it was presented, such that the effect of outgroup competitiveness was stronger when it occurred in the first block of 15 rounds. For this reason, the results for norm enforcement are evaluated separately by block. For contribution, order did not significantly interact with outgroup competition or other variables, so the data are pooled across blocks for this measure.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0190272512442397">Table 3</xref> presents the results for norm enforcement separately for Blocks 1 and 2. As in Study 1, the effect of conflict is not significant in either block. This provides further evidence that structural conflict alone is insufficient to motivate costly norm enforcement. Unlike Study 1, the effect of outgroup competitiveness was not significant; participants were not in general less likely to enforce norms when the outgroup contributed more. The effect of production function is significant and positive, such that participants are more likely to enforce norms in binary “winner-take-all” competitions compared to those with continuous production functions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0190272512442397">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 2 was designed to address the limitations of Study 1 and also to evaluate the robustness of the findings in winner-take-all conflicts. For norm enforcement, Study 2 replicated the predicted conflict × outgroup competitiveness interaction, offering further evidence that the effect of conflict on norm enforcement is moderated by outgroup competitiveness. The results of Study 2 also showed significantly greater <italic>overall</italic> levels of norm enforcement when participants experienced conflict with a high-contributing outgroup. Indeed, this condition produced the greatest overall levels of norm enforcement in the study. In addition, while participants enforced norms at greater levels in the binary production function condition, the effect of production function did not vary by conflict condition. Thus, the conflict × outgroup competitiveness effect appears robust over at least two types of conflict.</p>
<p>Similarly, the contribution results were substantively similar to but stronger than those in Study 1. Participants contributed significantly more often in the conflict condition in Study 2, and outgroup competitiveness did not moderate the effect of conflict on contribution. Additionally, contributions were consistent across the continuous and binary production function conditions, indicating the robustness of the effect across the two different types of conflict.</p>
<p>The stronger norm enforcement and contribution results in Study 2 are most likely attributable to the control afforded by simulating partners. Study 2 experimentally manipulated outgroup competition, held contribution constant across conditions, and balanced the level of ingroup norm enforcement. In addition, manipulating outgroup competition allows for stronger causal inferences regarding the conflict × outgroup competitiveness interaction.</p>
<p>Study 2 also yielded two unpredicted results. First, the interaction of conflict and outgroup contribution was significant in the first block of rounds but not the second. This may be due to carryover effects from the first block of rounds. In particular, some participants who began enforcing norms at high rates in the first block due to a competitive outgroup may have been willing to continue doing so even when the outgroup was not competitive, and participants who began enforcing norms at low rates due to a noncompetitive outgroup may have been reluctant to increase their level of enforcement even when facing a competitive outgroup. That is, participants may have become partially locked in to their strategies, blunting the impact of outgroup behavior in the second block. Theoretically, such “lock-in” may be the result of a boundedly rational learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0190272512442397">Macy and Flache 2002</xref>) or because of the persistence of a sense of “oughtness” due to norm activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0190272512442397">Lindenberg et al. 2011</xref>). Substantively, this suggests that the effects of outgroup competition are durable and tend to persist beyond the original conflict. From a methodological perspective, this suggests that a between-subjects manipulation of outgroup competitiveness is preferable to a within-subjects manipulation, at least for studies of norm enforcement.</p>
<p>Second, Study 2 found no significant effects of conflict or the conflict × outgroup competitiveness interaction on preferences for creating a centralized leadership position. This differs from Study 1, which found a positive conflict × outgroup competitiveness effect on support for leaders. While I cannot explain the differences between the studies with certainty given the data available, existing theory suggests one possibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512442397">Coser (1956)</xref> argued that groups turn to leaders in conflict when they lack internal solidarity but not when they are cohesive. In Study 1, levels of contribution declined significantly across time. When it came time to make the leader decision, participants facing a competitive outgroup in the conflict condition may have felt the group was in decline and required a leader to solve the collective action problem. In Study 2, the simulated ingroup members consistently contributed at similar average rates across the course of the study. When participants in Study 2 reached the leader decision, they may have felt less concerned about the group’s overall direction and thus less willing to relinquish autonomy.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The question of whether conflict increases group cohesion is a classic problem in sociology and related disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512442397">Coser 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512442397">Simmel [1908] 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512442397">Stein 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512442397">Sumner and Keller [1906] 1960</xref>). Prior work has shown that conflict increases the extent to which people contribute to their groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512442397">Bornstein 2003</xref>). Little is known, however, about whether conflict motivates people to <italic>enforce</italic> contribution or support leaders who will do so, especially when it is costly. This study shows, for the first time, that individuals enforce costly norms at greater rates when their group’s interests conflict with those of an outgroup and the outgroup actively pursues the conflict. Additionally, the study replicates past work finding that conflict between groups directly increases contribution to the ingroup, even when outgroup contribution is low. A further contribution is the finding that conflict can lead participants to support creating centralized leadership positions, at least under some conditions. Potentially, individuals’ tendency to turn to leaders in conflict depends on the perception that the group is in decline.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results shed light on the predictions of realistic group conflict theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif 1966</xref>) and the group position model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0190272512442397">Blumer 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512442397">Sherif (1966)</xref> maintained that conflicting goals are sufficient to motivate intergroup conflict and intragroup solidarity, while the group position model emphasizes the importance of perceived threats to the group. Importantly, the group position model is not opposed to realistic group conflict theory, but considers a broader range of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512442397">Bobo 1999</xref>). The findings of the present studies indicate that, consistent with Sherif’s argument, conflicting goals are sufficient to motivate one form of cohesion: the willingness to contribute to the group by making costly personal sacrifices for the group’s welfare. The studies also find that, consistent with the group position model, the threat of outgroup competition is necessary to motivate individuals to <italic>enforce</italic> costly personal sacrifices from others. This may be due to outgroup competition generating stronger emotional (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0190272512442397">Frank 1988</xref>) or normative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0190272512442397">Lindenberg et al. 2011</xref>) reactions.</p>
<sec id="section32-0190272512442397">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The studies have several limitations, which suggest a number of avenues for future research. First, the research uses a nonrandom undergraduate sample. Second, the leader results are inconsistent across Studies 1 and 2. Third, the research focuses on behavioral rather than attitudinal indicators of cohesion.</p>
<p>Given that the research employs an undergraduate sample, one might ask to what extent the findings will hold across other populations. Future work could develop and test theories addressing how population characteristics—such as cultural values—might moderate these findings. A second area for future work is clarifying the conditions under which conflict produces greater support for leaders. The present findings raise the possibility that individuals prefer leaders when they feel the team is failing in conflict but not when it is succeeding. This could be tested with a study that manipulates not only conflict and outgroup competition but also ingroup performance. A third area for future work is the relationship between behavioral and attitudinal indicators of cohesion. While some past work treats behavioral and attitudinal indicators of cohesion as interchangeable, the causal relationships between them may be complex. For example, intergroup conflict could increase norm enforcement and perceptions of cohesion. Alternatively, individuals might be less likely to enforce norms if they perceive the group as highly cohesive. Understanding how attitudes and behaviors are related to intergroup conflict would deepen our understanding of the conflict-cohesion link (for an extended discussion of this issue, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0190272512442397">Benard and Doan 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, this article builds on a tradition of research addressing the role conflict plays in shaping social life. It provides evidence for how two forms of social structure—bottom-up informal rules and top-down systems of authority—can emerge from previously unstructured groups. In doing so, it shows one route by which a collection of strangers becomes a group with clearly demarcated hierarchies and rules of conduct. Conflict may thus serve as a source of “groupness” and thereby play a role in structuring human societies.</p>
<p>The research also highlights the relational aspect of conflict: people use local influence to turn their peers into partisans and support leaders to do the same. Given this, perhaps participation in conflict is driven not only by concerns about what our enemies might do to us, but also concerns about what our <italic>friends</italic> might do. Understanding how conflict affects social norms and hierarchies provides insight into the way conflict shapes the fabric of social life.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: The tables are presented here as seen by participants, except that participants saw only the table corresponding to their condition; the tables are combined here for space reasons. Alternate versions of these tables were used in the no conflict condition. They replaced outgroup contributions with the provision point, but were otherwise identical.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn8-0190272512442397">
<p>In the table, the column labels indicate the difference in payoffs between one’s own group and the outgroup. For example, 3 indicates three ingroup contributors and no outgroup contributors, while 2 indicates either two ingroup contributors and no outgroup contributors or three ingroup contributors and one outgroup contributor. The rows for each game indicate whether the focal actor contributed (“invested” in the terms presented to participants) or did not contribute.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn9-0190272512442397">
<p>As noted in the main text, participants in the intergroup prisoner’s dilemma always fared better by not contributing. Participants in the intergroup public goods game fare better by contributing only if (1) their contribution moves the group from a loss to a tie (i.e., from the –1 column to the 0 column, thus earning 15 points instead of 10 points) or (2) moves the group from a tie to a win (i.e., from the 0 column to the 1 column, thus earning 30 points instead of 25 points).</p>

<p>Note that in the intergroup prisoner’s dilemma (IPD), as in a standard prisoner’s dilemma, noncontribution is the dominant strategy in the stage game. To illustrate, if individual <italic>i</italic> contributes, along with one teammate, and one outgroup member, <italic>i</italic> earns 5(2 – 1) + 15 + 10(1 – 1) = 20 points that round, while <italic>i</italic>’s noncontributing teammate earns 30 points.</p>

<p>While this version of the no conflict condition is used in past work, an alternative would be to use a setting that lacks conflict but still includes an external threat. In Study 2, I modify the no conflict condition to include this possibility.</p>

<p>The control variables exhibited two other significant effects for norm enforcement. There was a conflict × teammate norm enforcement interaction, such that participants in the conflict condition enforced norms more frequently when their teammates also enforced norms. There was also a negative conflict × teammate contributors interaction effect, such that individuals were less likely to invest in punishing noncontributors in conflict when their teammates contributed to the group at greater rates.</p>

<p>The control variables exhibited three other significant effects for contribution. First, participants tended to contribute less as outgroup members contributed more. Second, contributions declined over time, consistent with prior research (e.g., Bornstein, Winter, and Goren 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0190272512442397">Rapoport and Chammah 1965</xref>).

<p>There were no main effects of gender, and gender did not significantly interact with the conflict manipulation. Excluded participants were distributed roughly evenly across conditions. The results are similar if the excluded participants are included.</p>
