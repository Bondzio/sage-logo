<abstract>
<p>The aim of this Grounded Theory study was to assess the motivation and outcomes of carrier testing. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who had undergone carrier testing for autosomal recessive, X-linked conditions and chromosome translocations. Reproductive empowerment emerged as the central phenomenon. A desire to manage risk was the main motivator for carrier testing, and information gathering the main facilitator. Participants were then able to make informed decisions, regain control over their reproductive risk and pass on information to family members. These findings support a patient-reported outcome measure of empowerment currently being developed for genetic services.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genetic material inherited by each individual is complex and it is thought that every human being carries a number of mutations. While many of these mutations do not cause actual harm, others may have a more deleterious effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311417193">Adkison and Brown, 2007</xref>). In autosomal or X-linked recessive conditions, one normal copy of the gene is usually sufficient to ensure cell function is not adversely affected, and these individuals are said to be ‘carriers’ of the condition. Carriers are usually healthy, however their offspring could be at risk of inheriting the disease if both parents are carriers of mutations in the same autosomal recessive or if the mother is a carrier of an X-linked recessive gene mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311417193">Skirton and Patch, 2002</xref>). The term ‘carrier’ is also used to describe individuals who have a balanced chromosome translocation. The translocation does not affect their own health, but their children could inherit an unbalanced form of the translocation that could have an adverse phenotypic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311417193">Meza-Espinoza et al., 2008</xref>). Due to the potential reproductive implications of being a carrier, individuals who are aware that they could be carriers, either because of family history, the birth of an affected child, or particular ethnic background, may wish to confirm their carrier status through genetic testing.</p>
<p>Carrier testing for a range of genetic diseases has been offered to individuals since the 1970s, for example, with the introduction of community based screening for Tay Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311417193">Kaback et al., 1993</xref>). Studies assessing the experience of carrier testing for autosomal recessive and X-linked disorders have identified a number of responses to the results of carrier testing. These include anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311417193">Anido et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311417193">Honnor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311417193">Lakeman et al., 2008</xref>), guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311417193">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311417193">James et al., 2006</xref>), relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311417193">McConkie-Rosell et al., 1997</xref>), changes to reproductive intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311417193">Anido et al., 2005</xref>) and disclosure to family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311417193">Henneman et al., 2002</xref>). A study conducted in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311417193">Williams and Schutte, 1997</xref>) examined the experiences of adults requesting carrier testing for a range of conditions including cystic fibrosis, Tay Sachs, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and fragile X. They found that many participants who expressed feelings of guilt and grief were carriers of fragile X and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, both X-linked conditions. We were, however, unable to identify any qualitative studies conducted in the United Kingdom which summarized the experience of carrier testing across a range of conditions.</p>
<p>The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the experience of carrier testing across a variety of conditions to inform the development of an information resource providing psychological and social information to carriers. In particular, we wanted to identify whether there were commonalities of experience across people carrying conditions that varied in terms of risk to offspring, severity and family history. This would influence whether or not a general resource would be suitable for carriers of a range of conditions, or whether resources specific for each type of condition would be more helpful. We did not include participants in this study who were carriers of late-onset dominantly inherited conditions such as Huntington disease or inherited forms of cancer, because the nature of the information derived from these tests may be very different from receiving carrier information for recessive, X-linked or chromosomal conditions, and therefore it would not be appropriate to include this information in the same resource.</p>
</sec>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a qualitative study to explore the experiences of people who had undergone carrier testing and to identify any experiences common to carriers of a range of conditions. Furthermore, the aim was to generate a theory to describe the phenomena under investigation. A grounded theory approach was chosen as it is suitable for exploratory and explanatory research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311417193">Payne, 2007</xref>) and is a method in which a theoretical model is developed inductively from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311417193">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Ethical approval for the study was obtained through an NHS Ethics Committee. Participants were recruited by staff at a regional genetics centre in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants were over 18 years of age, had taken a carrier test for an autosomal recessive condition, X-linked condition or chromosome translocation, and had received their test results. In order to achieve maximum variation in the purposive sample, we aimed to recruit people from the following groups: (1) males and females; (2) carriers of manageable conditions (such as cystic fibrosis where treatment is available and life expectancy is estimated to be greater than 50 years of age for those born in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311417193">Dodge et al., 2007]</xref>) and non-manageable conditions (such as Tay Sachs which is a non-treatable condition and results in a short life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311417193">Gason et al., 2005]</xref>); (3) participants with children (affected and non-affected) and without; (4) participants with a family history of the condition and participants without; and (5) participants who varied in respect of how long ago they had received their test results. Participants were excluded if they were taking a carrier test for adult onset conditions or other dominantly inherited conditions, were not fluent in English or were not able to give informed consent.</p>
<p>Potential participants considered suitable by staff of the genetic clinic were invited to participate in the study via a letter that included a participant information sheet. They were asked to return the reply slip if they were interested in participating. Thirty invitations were sent out to potential participants; eight responses (27%) were received. In three cases, both members of a couple had taken a carrier test and agreed to participate in the interview. This meant there were 11 participants in total who participated (eight women, three men). All lived in southern England. The characteristics of the participants are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311417193">Table 1</xref>. None of the participants were pregnant at the time of testing.</p>

<p>All participants were happy to be interviewed face-to-face and stated a preference to be interviewed in their own homes. The interviews were conducted by the lead researcher (CL) and consent was given in writing by all interviewees for the interview to be audiotaped. Interviews took place between November 2008 and June 2009 and lasted between 30 minutes to one hour. Theoretical sampling, the process whereby data collection, coding and analysis is done concurrently and recruitment is guided by the emerging theory, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311417193">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The interview guide was designed to facilitate examination of issues including: motivation for carrier testing, how the participant felt about their test result both initially and now, how the participant used the information derived from carrier testing, and whether they discussed their result with family members. Interviews were transcribed in full by the researcher and data were analysed using a method based on Grounded Theory to enable the researcher to draw appropriate themes and develop explanatory theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311417193">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Coding and sorting were completed using the qualitative research software NVIVO (QSR International, Pty Ltd). Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously and interview questions were amended to take into account emerging concepts. Categories were continuously checked and compared against segments of the text (constant comparison) to determine their properties and dimensions. A second researcher also coded and categorized two of the interviews to ensure inter-rater reliability. Any disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached. At the point when no new codes or categories were emerging, examination of categories was carried out to identify links and relationships between them (axial coding). Finally, as greater insight was achieved, more theoretical and abstract accounts were developed (selective coding). The results of this analysis, including proposed theoretical explanations about the data are discussed later. All identifying details have been changed to protect confidentiality.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<sec id="section4-1359105311417193">
<title>Core category: Reproductive empowerment</title>
<p>The concept of reproductive empowerment emerged as the core category that explained both the participants’ motivation for carrier testing, and how information derived from the test was used.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Well once you know you are a carrier and if your partner is a carrier too, then you can make decisions. It means you have the power to make decisions that are right for you, like whether you would abort if you found out the baby had the condition. So it gives you that control which is a positive thing.’ John</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Carrier testing enabled participants to take control of and make informed decisions regarding reproduction, and provided important information that empowered their own children as well as other family members. Four main dimensions of reproductive empowerment were identified: managing risk, information gathering, informed decision-making and empowering other family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311417193">
<title>Managing risk</title>
<p>The most commonly cited motivator for carrier testing was to manage one’s own risk relating to reproduction. Two participants had a child affected by a genetic condition, three had relatives affected by a genetic condition and two were partners of carriers. These participants were therefore aware that there was a risk to any future children they might have and hence wanted to know for certain before having any (more) children, as this comment from John highlights:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We are thinking of starting a family and there is a suspected CF [cystic fibrosis] gene in my family through my nephew having CF, so we thought it was a responsible thing to do.’ John</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly Jo, whose father had haemophilia and it was therefore very likely that she was a carrier, had a carrier test to confirm her carrier status when she wanted to have children. Jo’s experience of haemophilia had been very negative, and therefore she had put off having a carrier test until it became important for her to know for reproductive purposes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘And I suppose I’d been avoiding having the test for years until I had to for reproductive purposes as you say because I don’t think I really wanted to face up to it.’ Jo</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Increased risk of being a carrier due to ethnic background was another motivator for carrier testing. Claire and Sam, who were both Ashkenazi Jews and therefore at increased risk of being carriers of Tay Sachs disease, had both been tested at a young age at their Chedar (Religious) school. They had had their test results reconfirmed at the genetic clinic because they wanted to have children:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Well it is quite prevalent in the Jewish community and I used to go to Chedar which is like Sunday school and it was just something that was offered to all the children I think when I was about 15 or 16 . . . so I found out then . . . So when our relationship got more serious and we started thinking about children we got re-tested, so it was confirmed that we were both carriers.’ Claire</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Providing information to children and relatives was also cited as a motivator for testing. Frequently, there was more than one motivating factor that led to carrier testing and participants were generally aware of the value the information had for themselves, their children and other family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311417193">
<title>Information gathering</title>
<p>Information gathering was a central part of the empowerment process as it helped inform the choices participants went on to make. Participants gathered information about the condition itself (severity, life expectancy, care and treatment etc), the risk of having an affected pregnancy and the various prenatal testing options available. This information was primarily provided by genetic professionals; however patient support groups and the Internet were also cited. The process of information gathering was ongoing throughout the carrier testing process.</p>
<p>The genetic counsellor was a central figure who helped facilitate the empowerment process by providing both informational and emotional support, as highlighted by Sally who commented that she found ‘the support from [name of genetic clinic] is very good, as is the way they have provided information and the way they have followed up’. After reconfirming their carrier status, Claire and Sam had visited the genetic counsellor to discuss the various prenatal testing options available to them during pregnancy. Discussion had also focused around the timings of invasive testing. Knowing they were both carriers of Tay Sachs and could undergo prenatal testing around 12 weeks of pregnancy enabled Claire and Sam to take control of their pregnancy by identifying whether the foetus was affected at the earliest possible stage. This was important as if the foetus was affected, they would be able to have a termination of pregnancy as early as possible:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘What it did do, the information around the test helped us to understand how the timings would work which was really important’. Sam</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The genetic counsellor had provided information about the condition; however a local support group had also put them in touch with a couple who had had a child affected by the condition. This helped them to more fully understand the implications of the disease and in turn confirmed their decision to have a termination if the foetus was found to have the condition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Yeh that was really interesting meeting somebody, they were both carriers and they had unfortunately had children who had the disease, so that was actually quite upsetting . . . Tay Sachs is such a serious illness it was just then kind of obvious to us that if I had had a pregnancy with Tay Sachs I would have an abortion’. Claire</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For those that were opposed to termination of pregnancy, alternative options could be investigated. For Diane who already had a child affected by fragile X, knowing she was a carrier gave her the opportunity to seek out a prenatal testing procedure that was more suited to her particular beliefs. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was a procedure that she had found out about through the Fragile X Society:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We went to the fragile X conference in Birmingham and it was dealing with future children and testing and all the various options open to carriers who want to have fragile X free children’. Diane</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The support group had also provided her with information about her son’s condition, and been a good source of psychosocial support.</p>
<p>Sally, who was a carrier of a balanced chromosome translocation, had looked for information about her particular chromosome imbalance in medical textbooks to understand the implications for a child born with her particular chromosome imbalance:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘This was long before the Internet, but I went to the post-graduate centre at [local] Hospital and looked up a lot of medical genetic books . . . partly because at [the genetic clinic] they were unable to tell me if I delivered a baby that had an unbalanced translocation whether it would survive, or what abnormalities it would have, and so I was trying to look to see if there was anything in the textbooks and research papers about a 9 and 10 balanced or unbalanced translocation’. Sally</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As well as gathering information about the condition and prenatal testing options, participants also sought knowledge around inheritance and risk. Cindy, whose partner John was a carrier of cystic fibrosis, had spoken to a genetic counsellor about her risk of being a carrier and if she was, having an affected child:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘She said there is a 1 in 25 chance that you are a carrier, and if you are, statistically on average if we had 4 children 1 of them would have CF, 2 would be carriers and 1 would be unaffected’. Cindy</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This information had been the catalyst for Cindy’s decision to go ahead with carrier testing. Similarly, the information Kim had been given by the genetic counsellor had helped her understand the implications for her daughter and nieces, if she was found to be a carrier. The information gathered through specialists, the Internet and support groups facilitated informed and shared decision-making. Additionally, it enabled participants to pass on and empower other family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311417193">
<title>Informed decision-making</title>
<p>For those participants who were identified as non-carriers, the knowledge was empowering because they were able to begin their reproductive lives knowing they were not at increased risk of having a child affected by the particular genetic condition. This proved to be a relief for participants, both for themselves as well as their family:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘It’s a huge relief not having to feel like you had inflicted pain on other people, even if it was negative for them. I would have had to ring my sister up and say “you’re going to have to get yourself tested”, and that would have been really hard. So that was a huge relief’. Kim</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet for those participants identified as carriers, while the information was not necessarily what they wanted to hear, it was reframed in a positive way that enabled them to make fully informed and autonomous decisions around reproduction. The information given by the genetic counsellor, particularly around reproduction, contributed significantly to this positive reframing and enabled participants to regain a sense of control over the condition for which they were a carrier.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of knowing one’s carrier status in advance of a pregnancy was that participants could find out about and think through what options were most suitable for them. Cindy and John, for example, had discussed their feelings with each other about raising a child with cystic fibrosis, prior to Cindy taking a carrier test:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We discussed whether or not we could cope with a disabled child, and to be very honest about it we said we can’t, we are not geared up mentally. And I know if you have a baby who is disabled you bond with it, but I don’t know if I would, so we knew that if we did have an [affected] child at 12 weeks we would have seriously considered termination’. John</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The information Claire and Sam had been given by the genetic counsellor and the support group, had helped crystallize their decision to go through with invasive testing and termination of pregnancy if necessary. Diane had also made an informed decision to pursue the option of PGD if she had more children. Thus, the results of the carrier test enabled participants to make important life decisions in an informed way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311417193">
<title>Empowering other family members</title>
<p>Providing information to children and relatives was another motivator for and outcome of carrier testing. For Kim, whose son had Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it was important for her to find out whether she was a carrier because her daughter and nieces were getting to an age where they themselves would soon be thinking about having children:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘It’s not going to change anything for Toby [son with Duchenne], it’s more Susan [daughter] that I was concerned about. And by that stage my sister’s two girls were getting older too . . . so it’s beginning to be the point at which they will need to know one way or the other’. Kim</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gail also discussed how her carrier test results would provide useful information for other family members, not just in the immediate future, but in the longer term:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘You have to think about the long term and not just the short term. In the end it’s going to help other people, other family members’. Gail</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After having received their test results, participants were able to pass on carrier information to family members, thus empowering the wider family. All participants had informed family members of their test results, in particular those who might be at an increased risk themselves. Kim had informed her daughter, her sister and her two nieces. Other interviewees spoke of informing their ‘extended families’. As a result, a number of family members had accessed the genetic clinic and had undergone carrier testing:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Once I was tested they then tested my mother to see how far else it was going in the family and my mother . . . also was a carrier’. Sally</p>

<p>Most participants had found the process of passing on carrier information to family members a positive one, yet in a few cases family communication had been problematic. Diane had found it difficult to speak to her relatives because rifts existed within her extended family. Her grandmother had also reacted badly to the news, as highlighted by the following comment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘My mum spoke to my nan and she said “it’s not from me full stop”. So she blocked it off, she said “I didn’t bring anything into the family”’. Diane</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jo found it difficult telling her parents-in-law that she was a haemophilia carrier because she felt that she was ‘bringing a blight into someone else’s family’. Nevertheless, even though the information was sometimes met with resistance, all participants understood the importance of passing this information on to family members.</p>

<title>Reproductive empowerment as the core category</title>
<p>A number of stages occurred during the identification of ‘reproductive empowerment’ as a core category. These included: (1) the identification of a core concept that integrated many of the themes established during the initial coding stage, (2) the discovery of an existing theory that fitted with the concepts emerging from the analysis in the present study (emergent fit), and (3) modifying the existing theory to describe more specifically the findings as they related to carrier testing.</p>
<sec id="section10-1359105311417193">
<title>Identification of a core concept</title>
<p>The concept of control (a word taken directly from the data), and in particular reproductive control, was identified as the central phenomenon during axial coding as it was central to the patient experience. While issues such as guilt and stigma were identified in some cases, reproductive control held the most conceptual interest as it was most frequently discussed by participants and pulled together all the other emerging themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105311417193">
<title>Emergent fit</title>
<p>Reproductive control clearly resonated with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">2008</xref>) who had identified empowerment as a main outcome of clinical genetic services. McAllister and colleagues established that genetic services enabled service users to take control of their lives and have responsibility and autonomy over important life decisions and choices. Furthermore, they identified five dimensions of empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417193">McAllister et al., 2011</xref>): Cognitive Control – the knowledge and understanding derived from genetic services; Decisional Control – the ability to make important life decisions in an informed way; Behavioural Control – the ability to make effective use of the health and social care systems for the benefit of the whole family; Hope – hope for a fulfilling family life, for oneself, one’s family and/or one’s future descendents; and Emotional Regulation – addressing and dealing with difficult emotions.</p>
<p>These dimensions were all clearly evident in the findings from this study, but specifically related to the motivators and outcomes of carrier testing. Through carrier testing, participants were able to make important life decisions around issues relating to reproduction in an informed way (decisional control). They were managing their risk of having an affected child, as a result of the knowledge derived through carrier testing and their understanding of the condition and reproductive options available (cognitive control). Carriers made use of genetic services and prenatal testing options such as invasive testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (behavioural control). The participants and their family members could take control of the particular genetic disease they were concerned about and look to the future with hope for themselves, family members and future descendents (hope). Participants were provided with emotional support, mainly thought their genetic counsellor but also through patient support organizations (emotional regulation).</p>

<title>Modification of theory</title>
<p>In building on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2008)</xref> and linking them to our own findings, the term ‘empowerment’, and more specifically ‘reproductive empowerment’ was adopted to describe the central phenomenon identified in this study as it is broader in scope than the term ‘control’. Empowerment theory states that it can be viewed as both a process, incorporating actions, activities, or structures, and as an outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311417193">Zimmerman, 1995</xref>). Moreover, it has been used within the field of healthcare to describe a particular type of patient. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311417193">Funnell et al. (1991)</xref> describe an empowered patient as one who as the ‘knowledge, skills, attitudes, and self-awareness necessary to influence their own behaviour and that of others . . . to improve the quality of their lives’, attributes which resonated with the participants in this study. The authors therefore believed ‘empowerment’ to be a more suitable term than ‘control’.</p>

<title>Development of a theoretical model</title>
<p>To develop a theoretical model, links among categories to identify the conditions, actions, interactions and consequences in the data were established in order to understand the relationships between them and build a systematic, logical and integrated account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311417193">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Reproductive empowerment, the central and unifying experience for participants, was identified as a multi-dimensional process, with dimensions feeding into each other. A model was developed to highlight this dynamic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311417193">Figure 1</xref>). A desire to manage reproductive risk was the first stage of reproductive empowerment, and the main motivation for carrier testing. The context behind this was either the birth of a child affected by a genetic condition, a known genetic condition in the family, or increased risk due to ethnic background. In order to manage this risk, participants gathered information from a variety of sources. Information gathering was a central facilitator of empowerment. This occurred both before receiving carrier test results, but also after results had been received. With this information, participants were able to make informed decisions, regain control over their reproductive risk, and pass on information to family members.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The number of participants in this sample was small, and the findings therefore need to be treated with some degree of caution as they do not necessarily represent the collective experience of patients identified as carriers through the genetic clinic, particularly those that were not coping as effectively with their carrier status and did not take part in this study. Yet the findings from this study support those identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">2008</xref>). McAllister and colleagues identified that the concept of empowerment summarizes the benefit patients derive from using clinical genetics services. The findings from this study extend the work of McAllister et al. by specifying ‘reproductive empowerment’ as the key outcome of carrier testing.</p>
<p>Where differences did exist between this study and the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">2008</xref>), this was as a result of their study including participants who had experience of a variety of genetic tests, such as diagnostic and predictive tests. For example, decisional control in this study related specifically to managing the risk of passing the condition on. However, in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2008)</xref> study, genetic services were instrumental in the decision-making process around life issues outside the reproductive sphere such as whether to take on a mortgage, in the case of a woman who had taken a predictive test for Huntington disease. Similarly, having information about a child’s genetic condition was identified as empowering for parents in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2008)</xref> study, as it enabled them to advocate more effectively for their child. However in this study, empowerment to advocate was not identified as a theme.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417193">Skirton’s (2006a</xref>) work assessing the need for certainty in users of clinical genetics services also supports the findings from this study. Skirton identified that service users showed a strong tendency towards the need for closure and discomfort with ambiguity, themes closely aligned with the desire for control identified in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417193">Webster and Kruglanski (1994)</xref> claim that achieving closure improves the predictability of the situation and provides a basis for subsequent action. The participants in this group were therefore likely to be striving for certainty as they were motivated to undergo carrier testing to understand and manage their risk (improve the predictability of the situation), and used the test results as a basis for subsequent action – in this case to inform decision-making around reproduction and provide information to family members. Skirton also found that during interviews, participants spoke of the need to prepare for the future for themselves and/or their offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311417193">Skirton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311417193">2006b</xref>). This theme was also indentified in this study as a key motivator for testing.</p>
<p>Aspects of reproductive empowerment including reproductive decision-making and passing information on to family members are evident in other studies assessing the impact of carrier testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311417193">Henneman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311417193">Lakeman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311417193">Watson et al., 1992</xref>), supporting the identification in this study of reproductive empowerment as a central phenomenon of carrier testing. The concept has also been discussed widely outside of genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311417193">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311417193">Karatas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311417193">van Peperstraten et al., 2010</xref>). Yet while these findings support patients’ desire for information, choice and involvement in medical decision-making, not all patients will want to ‘take charge’ of their healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311417193">Fujimori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311417193">Nease and Brooks, 1995</xref>). Factors such as ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311417193">Ko and Lee, 2009</xref>) and religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311417193">Mobeireek et al., 2008</xref>) may also influence how much influence patients want over healthcare decisions. Finding out from patients themselves what role they want to play in the decision-making process and how much information they want to be given, is therefore vital.</p>
<p>The study sample was self-selecting and participants may have therefore have been coping more effectively than those carriers who chose not to participate. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that not all patients may want to take such an active role over their reproductive healthcare. Those who do not may not have agreed to participate in this study. Study participants were recruited from one regional genetics centre in the UK. Results might vary where carriers are identified outside of the genetic clinic, or across other regional genetics centres.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the study does have a number of notable strengths. First, it supports the development of a patient-reported outcome measure of empowerment for clinical genetics services. Furthermore, we have been able to identify a core category that explains the motivation and outcome of carrier testing across a range of conditions. This is useful as it confirms the suitability of a general resource providing psychosocial information to carriers. The findings also highlight the importance of ensuring that genetic as well as other health professionals, such as midwives and GPs, understand the implications of carrier status with regard to the risk to the foetus, and are aware of the various prenatal testing options that are currently available. Ideally, couples should be referred to genetic services before conception, so that the risk can be clarified and prenatal testing options discussed with a trained genetic counsellor.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Reproductive empowerment was identified as the central phenomenon that unified the key themes associated with the experience of carrier testing, across a range of conditions. Non-carriers regained the freedom to have children unaffected by the particular genetic condition they were concerned about; carriers were empowered to take control over their own reproductive life as well as empower other family members. These findings are relevant to genetic practitioners who provide a supportive as well as educational role to carriers and their families. Moreover, the findings support a patient-reported outcome measure focusing on empowerment currently being developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. (2011</xref>). The measure was generated using the dimension of empowerment identified through qualitative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417193">McAllister et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417193">2011</xref>), which are aspects of the patient experience found to be important in this study.</p>
