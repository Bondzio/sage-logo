<p>This year the College’s website was transferred to a new content management system which integrates the website with the College’s member database. While the general look and feel of the website remained the same, this updated system is now enabling new services to be offered to members via the website.</p>
<p>In the first instance these new services have involved the introduction of the ability for members to update their individual details. Within the ‘My Details’ area of the website you can now:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856212460348" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Update your mailing address, telephone and e-mail details with the College</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Access your latest training reports</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Record CPD activities, submit CPD Program claims and access CPD statements</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Update or add practice details for optional inclusion in the RANZCP Fellows’ Referral Directory</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Change or re-set passwords to the RANZCP website</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After logging into the website, click on the ‘My Details’ link at the top of the page to access this area.</p>
<p>Following the initial launch of the new website in May there has been an ongoing process of refining the new features to facilitate ease of use in the ‘My Details’ section.</p>
<p>Longer term possibilities of the new website include online payment for items such as fees and events, potential for group online discussion forums and document sharing, the opportunity for real-time updates to the Referral Directory and access to a College members’ listing.</p>
<p>With the new website we will be analysing web data which we can use to identify most viewed information, and also irrelevant information, and therefore decide where to focus our efforts in providing what is of most use to our members on the web.</p>
<p>There is a detailed Competency Based Fellowship Program section on the website which is regularly updated. Development of the Competency Based Fellowship Program is continuing at a pleasing rate with its introduction planned for December 2012 in New Zealand and January 2013 in Australia. Relevant details about the program such as the stages of training, syllabi, training elements and assessments, and frequently asked questions are available on the website.</p>
<p>I encourage you to peruse the College’s website and access some of the myriad of information available to you including an extensive array of medical, psychological and behavioural journals, every edition of the College journals, College statements and guidelines, psychiatry event details, latest College news and much trainee information.</p>
<p>The website is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ranzcp.org">www.ranzcp.org</ext-link></p>
<p>You will need log in details to access member only information on the website. Your website User ID is the same as your RANZCP Member / CPD number, which appears on your RANZCP Member Advantage Card and also on College correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact the College on <email>membership@ranzcp.org</email> if you have any queries.</p>
