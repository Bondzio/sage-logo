<p>For most of the twentieth century, scholarly commentaries on Lamentations suffered a similar fate to that of Daughter Zion within its pages, sitting alone with no comforter. However, this has not been the case in the last decade or so. The appearance of commentaries by F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp (<italic>Lamentations</italic>, Louisville, 2002), A. Berlin (<italic>Lamentations: A Commentary</italic>, Louisville, 2004), and P. R. House (<italic>Lamentations</italic>, Nashville, 2004), to name a few, is evidence of renewed interest in the book. One can add R. B. Salters’ commentary from the International Critical Commentary (ICC) series to this steady stream of new work. Indeed, the absence of a commentary on Lamentations in the first series of ICC stands as an example of the former comparative neglect of this book. (C. A. Briggs, who had been assigned the task in the early stages, died in 1913 before his work came to light, and S. R. Driver, another early editor, died in 1914 just before the First World War, which led to an interval in which no re-assignment was made.)</p>
<p>Salters’ commentary begins with a helpful and up to date bibliography, one section dealing with commentaries and another with articles and other studies. There are not, however, any indices and thus no references are provided for authors, topics, or biblical references.</p>
<p>The introduction is fairly straightforward and concise, as it deals with the standard concerns of title, place in the canon, authorship, date and place of composition, origin, genre, Mesopotamian links, poetry, alphabetic acrostics, text and versions, and theology. The value of the introduction does not lie in any particularly original or insightful claim (we do learn, however, that Salters’ opinion has changed concerning the unity of authorship, now adhering to the view that each poem has its own separate author), but rather in the balanced overview of the problems concerning each of these subjects.</p>
<p>When dealing with each individual chapter of Lamentations, the commentary proper is divided into four sections. First, there is a brief overview of the chapter as a whole, which surveys its structure, style, and characteristics. This is followed by a translation of the Hebrew text. The translations are not aimed at literary excellence but rather at clarity in expressing the exegetical issues involved. The third part involves notes on the Masoretic Text and other ancient Versions. These notes are placed above the fourth part, which is a verse by verse exegetical analysis of Lamentations. The third and fourth sections constitute the bulk of the commentary. Here Salters provides detailed notes on the Septuagint, Vulgate, Peshitta, Targum, and, when necessary, Qumran texts. Also cited are the translations and comments of medieval Jewish commentators such as Rashi and Ibn Ezra, Christian commentators such as Luther and Calvin, and a wide range of modern critical commentators.</p>
<p>Such attention to research on text-critical issues fills an important gap in Lamentations scholarship. Thus, this commentary is a convenient resource. However, this strength is also part of the commentary’s weakness; for example, often exhaustively detailed analysis of the ancient Versions is provided only for Salters to ultimately conclude that the MT is probably best left without emendation. Of course, this analysis does fulfill the role of bringing to light the complexity and ambiguity of the text, and yet it seems to unnecessarily distract from other areas that could have been explored in more detail. One of these areas is the vast amount of poetic features that are not fully appreciated, such as the chiasms throughout the first two chapters of Lamentations, enjambement, speaking voices, and parallelism beyond the level of the line. Salters interacts with these poetic features from time to time, but never really offers a sustained analysis of what such features might mean.</p>
<p>These criticisms are to be taken in light of the overall high value of the commentary. It is, indeed, a book that rightly belongs on the bookshelf of any serious reader of Lamentations, though it would perhaps best be found sandwiched between the aforementioned commentaries of Berlin and Dobbs-Allsopp—which deal with the poetic features of Lamentations in a more thorough way—and read in conjunction with them.</p>
