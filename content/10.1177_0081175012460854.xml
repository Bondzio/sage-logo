<p>Texts are becoming more and more a source for data collection in empirical studies. These might be descriptions of events. The formulation of such texts usually is not that complex, but the formulation of other types of texts, such as editorials in newspapers, generally is. Another aspect of such texts is that usually a position is taken or a view presented.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of quantitative text analysis are based on counting the occurrence or co-occurrence of concepts indicated by words or phrases. Today more and more attention is given to what is said exactly in a sentence, especially in a clause. For this approach, the semantic grammar is relevant, indicated as Subject–Verb–Valence–Object (SVVO). To catch the meaning of such texts interpretation is necessary, and qualitative decisions come into the picture. The paper on event counts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460854">Franzosi, De Fazio, and Vicari (this volume, 2012</xref>:1–42) does not give attention to this fact. It refers to only one problem: Although there can be good reasons to use sentences in passive voice, they are nevertheless hard to read (pages 5 and 24). Let us start here.</p>
<p>A sentence in passive voice can be rewritten in active voice; a coder only has to recognize the passive voice. For the coding, it is more important that a sentence can have four intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081175012460854">Roberts 1989</xref>). These intentions are a combination of, on the one hand, the fact that the sentence is about a state of affairs or a process and, on the other hand, that the sentence contains a description or a judgment. Much of a text’s structural ambiguity can be removed during the encoding process, if the coder begins by classifying according to one of the four types of intention. After a coder assigns a type of intention to a statement, it then becomes possible to encode the statement according to a corresponding grammatical template. One still has to be aware of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ambiguity, not to speak of typographical errors or misspellings.</p>
<p>A description of, for example, what happened during an event is “a picture in words.” It is a factual representation of what is shown. In analyses of texts, it implies that the investigator exclusively addresses questions about how often and in which way a specific word or SVVO-statement appears in a text. Such examples are in the text on events. As soon as one begins explaining what the word or statement means or why it is used in some way, one is involved in interpretation. Interpretation is always of a message as intended by someone (the source) and with respect to someone (the receiver). The researcher’s ability to empathetically understand texts’ sources and audiences becomes especially important when the latent content of a text is investigated.</p>
<p>In the interpretation, two issues are highly relevant: (1) whether the manifest and/or latent content is being considered and (2) from whose point of view is it considered.</p>
<p>Generally the manifest content is considered, but the investigator might also be interested in the latent character of a message, in the “behavioral and situational” contexts of content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081175012460854">George 1959</xref>:27). Here behavioral context refers to the goal the source pursues. Situational context encompasses information on who the source is, for whom the message is meant, under which circumstances the message is sent, and so on. Take, for example, the sentence “He looked blue from cold.” The manifest content of the word “blue” denotes a color, while the latent content refers to the fact that the person is extremely cold. This latent content is inferred as the word is mentioned within a situational context related to temperature and the known physiological consequences thereof. Such inferences give insight into the qualities of the communication’s source, yet they also reveal that the messages investigated are approached in the context of a conceptual system that serves as an ordering principle for the observations.</p>
<p>For the latent meaning and also for coding complex sentences, the interpretation by a qualified human coder is needed. When manual coding is required, it is very helpful to make transparent the rules that are followed. The coding is based on a qualitative decision that everybody should understand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081175012460854">Popping and Roberts (2009)</xref> showed that the question whether a sentence is about politics or economics, which looks at first sight very simple, can actually be highly complex.</p>
<p>Interpretation is based on a message as intended by someone. Investigators have a choice here: Follow their own view or theory, which almost inevitably occurs when automatic coding using a dictionary is used, or follow the perspective of the coder.</p>
<p>These remarks are only a beginning of a long discussion on aspects of coding, in which qualitative decisions play a very important role. These decisions are usually made by human coders. In my view this discussion needs more attention; consider the remarks as a complement to the text on event counts.</p>
