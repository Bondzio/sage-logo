<p>As an editor one receives many papers which, honestly, add nothing to what is already known and simply repeat previous work. I was involved in developing prognostic models for stroke outcome 30 years ago, and I regularly receive papers on this with many fewer patients than in my studies – and there are even earlier studies now over 40 years old. I was therefore delighted to receive the <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511433068">systematic review</related-article> of case-adjustment models published in this issue; I can now refer to it when rejecting non-novel studies! What is disappointing is that only one model has actually been validated properly. Another type of study I often receive concerns Wii Fit, usually reporting a case series showing that people enjoy using it. This is well known (it sells well). Now we have a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434996">randomised controlled study</related-article> that evaluates its specific benefit – and does not demonstrate any major unique benefit. A second popular technology is virtual reality, which is rarely very ‘real’, and <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511434575">a pilot study</related-article> reported here suggests that a full study is feasible and would require about 80 subjects. Two other trials investigating specific ‘technological’ treatments for specific stroke-related problems – <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511432016">botulinum toxin</related-article> for leg spasticity and a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511432355">functional orthosis</related-article> for shoulder subluxation – are reported here. The orthosis seemed to have a definite benefit, a finding that needs replication but if confirmed, might alter clinical practice. Very interestingly, the study of botulinum toxin did not show any effect on measured spasticity but it did benefit both pain and gait quality suggesting that it may have effects unrelated to spasticity reduction, or that the Ashworth scale is insensitive to clinically relevant change. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511432652">Another trial</related-article> reported here also found unexpected benefits from its intervention, using a treadmill. Although the patients with Parkinson’s disease who used the treadmill at home did not show any difference in walking endurance, they did report less fatigue and a better quality of life. Being able to drive is an important factor contributing to quality of life, and people with dementia often are often reluctant to stop. A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512442413">small pilot study</related-article> of a specific assessment of driving ability in people with dementia suggests it is worth further study. The <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512443031">abstracts</related-article> of the (UK) Society for Research in Rehabilitation are published at the end of this issue, illustrating the range of research being undertaken. Finally (and I declare an interest being an author) there is <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215512457319" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511432018">discussion paper</related-article> exploring the concept and process of adaptation (coping) after acute brain injury using two theoretical models – the WHO ICF biopsychosocial model of illness and a model of goal setting. Please feel free to comment on it and to improve it.</p>
