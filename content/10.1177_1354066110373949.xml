<title>Introduction</title>
<p>What is the realist position on how best to deal with the rise of China? Many academic debates invoke versions of a dichotomy of ‘containment’ versus ‘engagement’ strategies, and this suggests an implicit distinction between liberals and realists: liberal engagers and realist containers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354066110373949">1</xref></sup> Most analysts recognize these as archetypes and treat the complex issues involved with nuance and sophistication, but the distinction certainly captures some broad truth. And there is one very prominent scholar, John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001)</xref>, who argues, from a self-consciously realist orientation, not just for simple containment, but for a determined costly effort to take down China’s emerging power and influence. However, in this article I argue that while this is <italic>a</italic> realist perspective, it is not <italic>the</italic> realist perspective. There are a number of theories and resulting policy prescriptions that can derive from a realist tradition, and they do not speak with one voice. In particular, realist approaches that derive from a classical foundation suggest policies that are fundamentally different from those favored by Mearsheimer.</p>
<p>This does not mean that realists of any stripe can be at all sanguine about the implications of China’s rise. They cannot. And classical realists, if anything, in particular, must be alarmed by the rise of China. A classical realist perspective inherently observes the emergence of new great powers in the system with enormous apprehension, because it expects the ambition of rising states to expand along with their capabilities, and also because of the anxiety that this expectation provokes in their neighbors and potential adversaries. As Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354066110373949">Gilpin (1981</xref>: 93) has argued, the ‘most important factor’ for understanding world politics is not the static distribution of power, but ‘dynamics of power relations over time.’ From this perspective, changes in relative power, which ultimately derive from long-run variations in economic growth, are a mainspring of international political conflict. Economic change redistributes relative power over time, creating a natural tendency for divergences to emerge between power and privilege in world politics, which encourages rising states to challenge the status quo. A central problem in International Relations is addressing these changes to the balance of power, which historically has commonly been resolved by war.</p>
<p>But alarm in and of itself offers very little analytical purchase. There is also, I would argue, a classical realist <italic>position</italic> on what to do about rising states in general, and what to do (from the perspective of the US) about the rise of China in particular. As a general rule (from which there will necessarily be occasional exceptions), the classical realist, however inherently wary and skeptical (very, always), seeks to accommodate rising power. This accommodation is rooted in three core tenets of classical realism: first, and always, is the acknowledgment of the reality of power, which is part of seeing the world as it is, not as we would like it to be; second is an unwillingness to automatically privilege the perspective of those that would defend the status quo; and third is the belief that <italic>politics matters</italic>, and that therefore the future is largely unwritten. It is on this last point that classical realists break most sharply with their structuralist cousins. The classical view holds that while they must, irretrievably, be alert to the condition of anarchy and sensitive to the balance of power, nevertheless states — especially great powers — enjoy considerable discretion with regard to the strategic choices that they can and will make, and that these choices are shaped by the context in which they are made, that is, by both domestic and international politics.</p>
<p>This article proceeds in four parts. First, I briefly situate classical realism in the context of realism more generally and make the case for some return to its traditions. I then review why, from a classical realist perspective, the rise of China must be seen as a potentially dangerous destabilization of the international system. The third section looks closely at Mearsheimer’s influential structural realist approach to great power politics and the rise of China — offensive realism — and argues that this approach is wrong, and dangerous, both in the abstract and as it applies to contemporary China. Finally, I illustrate how many of these errors are rooted in structuralism, and that a classical realist approach, which allows for the influence of history and politics, prescribes policies that are the opposite of those urged by offensive realism.</p>

<title>Realism and classical realism</title>
<p>In making an appeal to classical realism it is necessary to consider, briefly, the main contours of realist thought and the distinct attributes of the classical school. There are many variants of realism, but they tend to share a set of common core characteristics. Realists see states, pursuing interests, in an anarchic setting where the real possibility of war, and with it the prospect of subjugation or annihilation, must be accounted for. Realists see humans as actors with political instincts, who organize into groups that are discriminatory and typically conflictual.</p>
<p>Realism can also be distinguished from other approaches to world politics, such as liberalism and varieties of Marxism. Realists see an autonomous state — that is, a state (which is currently, but not necessarily, the principal form of political organization<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354066110373949">2</xref></sup>) that is neither the sum of individual interests a la liberalism, nor the implicit or explicit representative of certain privileged interests within society anticipated by Marxism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066110373949">Kennan, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354066110373949">Krasner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066110373949">Morgenthau, 1951</xref>). And that state pursues a collective interest — which, again, is distinct from a pluralist vision that derives the national interest from the summation of individual interests, or from the radical charge that rhetorical appeals to a national interest serve only to cloak the pursuit of particular interests. Rather, for realists much of the distinctness of national interests comes from the existence of anarchy — the lack of an ultimate international authority, and thus the absence of any guarantee that the nation will not be invaded, overrun, conquered, and pillaged. Security is a public good; public goods tend to be underprovided by private actors; the state is responsible for the provision of security. Realists do not presume the imminence or ubiquity of war (nor do non-realists presume that war is impossible), but rather realists assume that states must be alert to the possibility that war could occur and are sensitive to the potentially catastrophic consequences of defeat.</p>
<p>Finally, Realists also have a distinct perspective with regard to assumptions about the nature of mankind. Liberalism and Marxism share an inherently <italic>economistic</italic> perspective: individuals are motivated by a desire to maximize their personal wealth, and behavior is best described, explained, and predicted by modeling actors as agents in the rational pursuit of material things. In his most intimate memoir, John Maynard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066110373949">Keynes (1949)</xref> skewered this ‘Benthamite calculus, based on an over-valuation of the economic criterion,’ and ‘the final <italic>reductio ad absurdum</italic> of Benthamism known as Marxism’ (p. 97). Realist expectations of human behavior, in contrast, are first informed by politics and also by anthropology and sociology. This perspective does not dismiss the considerable significance of material incentives and ambitions, but it places the influence of those tangibles in the context of a mindset captured by the title of Stanley Kubrick’s first film, <italic>Fear and Desire</italic>. Virtually all realists share the view that fear — alertness to the dangers of the world — is a primal motive of behavior, and that security is a principal and urgent desire. Beyond this, in those settings when physical security appears secure (often), realists vary with regard to their expectations regarding additional desires; or they expect states to vary with regard to the goals that they harbor. However, those desires, which will almost certainly include material comforts and luxuries, are not at bottom motivated by maximizing wealth, but rather by security, prestige, primacy, and even domination — as ends in themselves.</p>
<p>But beyond an acute sensitivity to the balance of power, to which realist analysis must be alert as it establishes the contours of potential security threats, there is nothing in these shared tenets that requires realist analysis to focus exclusively on, or even privilege, structural variables. For several decades, however, realist analysis has been profoundly shaped by the influence of Waltzian neo-realism. This approach has much to offer the study of world politics, and, at the time of its formulation, was extremely clarifying for many realist scholars. However, its extraordinary influence, as well as its emphasis — indeed its insistence — on the systemic level of analysis (a consideration of states as like units differentiated only by their relative capabilities) has skewed, unhelpfully, realist analysis.</p>
<p>Classical realism is much broader than neo-realism — it is also distinct from neo-classical realism, which is not to critique or dismiss this important and still emerging school of thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354066110373949">3</xref></sup> To begin with, as noted earlier, even at the systemic level, classical realists tend not to emphasize the static distribution of power (which certainly matters), but the ‘dynamics of power relations over time.’ Thus <italic>changes</italic> in relative power, and the tendency of these changes to generate divergences in perceptions of power and privilege in the international system, are a principal source of anxiety and ambition in world politics, generating pressures that often lead to war.</p>
<p>Beyond this question of statics versus dynamics at the systemic level, the triumph of neo-realism more generally and its insistence on structural analysis has rendered vanishingly small the applicability of ‘realism’ to practical problems. Waltz is dismissive of an appeal to variables at other levels of analysis — ‘it is not possible to understand world politics simply by looking inside of states,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066110373949">Waltz (1979</xref>: 65, 68) insists, as ‘The behavior of states and statesmen … is indeterminate.’ This may be true. However, the elephant in the neo-realist room is that this is also true for the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354066110373949">Jervis, 1976</xref>: 19–21). Certainly, realists cannot dispense with close attention to the distribution of power and change in that distribution of power over time, because, at bottom, in the context of anarchy and the possibility of war, these variables condition states’ fears and expectations, and influence the pattern of interactions between them. Nevertheless, it is not possible to understand world politics simply by looking outside of states. The implications of systemic forces are inherently and irretrievably indeterminate.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, since the microeconomic analogy was always explicit, the international system does indeed impose constraints on the states which constitute it, analogously to the way in which the range of choices presented to consumers and firms is expressed by market forces that derive from the collective behavior of all participants, but which are beyond the control of any particular actor. But the analogy is imperfect and strained. Even assuming an idealized abstract market, with similar firms seeking singular goals (maximizing profits or market share), the deterministic implications of systemic market pressure are dependent on very strict assumptions of ‘perfect competition’ — a very large set of small actors that have no market power but instead are ‘price takers.’ As the idealized assumption of perfect competition is relaxed, market forces remain vital, but individual choices — idiosyncratic choices — become increasingly central to explaining behavior. In particular, large firms in oligopolistic settings, while certainly not unconstrained by market forces, nevertheless enjoy considerable discretion as to how they will pursue their goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354066110373949">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>States in world politics are much more like large oligopolists than small firms under perfect competition. This is especially true for great powers, even though, with unintentional analytical irony, it is the very greatest powers that neo-realism is most interested in: ‘A general theory of international politics is necessarily based on the great powers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066110373949">Waltz, 1979</xref>: 73).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354066110373949">5</xref></sup> Further, despite their common attributes, states are less similar to each other than are firms of the same industry, and despite a common desire for survival, as realists have observed in the past, states pursue a broad range of goals (certainly more diverse than goals of firms), the content of which will very likely vary from state to state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354066110373949">Wolfers, 1962</xref>). And even in pursuit of that most narrow, common goal — survival — states are still less predictable than firms, because they typically have more latitude — firms are selected out of the system with much greater frequency than are states.</p>
<p>Structure thus informs importantly the environment in which all states act, but, in that context, all states, and especially great powers, enjoy considerable discretion with regard to how they will pursue their goals and what sacrifices they will make in the face of constraints. It is thus impossible to understand and anticipate the behavior of states by looking solely at structural variables and constraints. To explain world politics, it is necessary to appeal to a host of other factors, including domestic politics, history, ideology, and perceptions of legitimacy.</p>
<p>Due to the predominance of neo-realism, there is a commonly held assumption that ‘realists cannot do that.’ However, as I will elaborate later, realists can — and have — deployed and taken seriously these types of variables. Classical realists tend to envision states, in the abstract, as essentially rational, purposeful, and motivated, but they do not see states as hyper-rationalist automatons. Rather classical realists also understand that state behavior is shaped by the lessons of history (right or wrong), ideas (accurate or not), ideology (good or bad), and that states make choices influenced by fear, vulnerability, and hubris, usually in the context of considerable uncertainty. This may not result in an elegant theory, but it does offer a disciplined and general approach to the study of world politics and a guide to statecraft. And classical realism can do a better job when applied to important, practical questions, like the rise of China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1354066110373949">
<title>Why worry about China?</title>
<p>Classical realism, it must be admitted, starts out worried. Saddled with the standard realist baggage — the dangers implied by politically motivated actors dwelling in anarchy, an alertness to the real possibility of war, and, with that, the prospect of subjugation or annihilation — classical realists also tend to fret about a broader range of potential sources of conflict. (Realists, more so than liberal-materialists, for example, would be more likely to see nationalism as an important influence on state behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354066110373949">6</xref></sup>) Classical realists also tend to share a certain pessimistic view of humanity and of the prospects for fundamental progress or transformation in the nature of human behavior.</p>
<p>Indeed, Classical realists have even more reason to fear the implications of emerging great powers than do structuralists. Structural theorists, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066110373949">Waltz (1979</xref>: 91), emphasize ‘survival’ as the goal of the state — beyond that, what states may or may not want is ‘endlessly varied.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001</xref>: 30), also promoting a structural theory, agrees. Even though states behaving as Mearsheimer expects them to act look like they are hopped up on a cocktail of steroids and amphetamines, their aggressive behavior is not some unhinged expression of belligerent rage, but rather, according to his theory, is the outcome of rational, dispassionate calculation, motivated by nothing more than a desire to assure their own security. Classical realists, on the other hand, like E. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066110373949">Carr (1946</xref>: 75, 80, 108, 111, 213, 215), see politics as the clash of interests, with outcomes determined by power, and ultimately by military power, with many wars fought not for specific ends, but rather to establish military primacy. Additionally, classical realists, such as Thucydides and Hans Morgenthau (and Gilpin), place considerable emphasis on their (informal) modeling of humans as political actors. ‘Man is a political animal by nature,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1946</xref>: 168) holds, ‘born to seek power.’ More than just security, then, this perspective emphasizes that men covet what other men have; and worse still, that they have a desire for power — as an end in itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354066110373949">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Classical realists also assume that rising states will want, in a word, more. Nicholas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354066110373949">Spykman (1942</xref>: 20–4) observed that ‘the number of cases in which a strong dynamic state has stopped expanding or has set modest limits to its power aims has been very few indeed.’ According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066110373949">Carr (1946</xref>: 112), ‘the exercise of power always appears to beget the appetite for more power’; here Carr cites approvingly Niebuhr, Machiavelli, and Hobbes on the way in which the pursuit of ‘security’ chases the horizon — each incremental advance serves only to raise new insecurities at the frontier of a state’s power. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354066110373949">Gilpin (1981</xref>: 106), it is axiomatic that ‘as the power of a state increases, it seeks to extend … its political influence.’ <italic>Not that there is anything wrong with that</italic>, realists are typically quick to add, since they are generally reluctant to label the behavior of states in international politics as ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Rather, states ‘with political sense will avail themselves of the opportunity to improve their position’ in response to changes in the international balance of power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1951</xref>: 33, 135) explains. ‘The disenchanted sentimentalist and utopian cannot understand the elemental truth of international politics; that no nation can be so good as to not take advantage of a power vacuum.’</p>
<p>Rising powers in particular, then, are potential sources of instability because the self-definition of their interests will expand along with their increasing capabilities (and expectations of still greater power to come); classical realists also expect them to seek not just security, but also status, prestige, and even deference from others. In a world where power is relative (and this is the way realists define power), that extended stride cannot help but encroach on someone else’s toes. But those others, unfortunately, may see it differently, and, from a realist perspective, even without being stepped on other states cannot help but be wary of a rising power, simply because it represents, at the very least, the possibility of a threat. Thrown into this mix is the fact that states often disagree — and not just about interests, but also about narratives, history, legitimacy, justice, and assessments of relative power under the greater uncertainties associated with economic change. Thus while realists attribute most conflicts to the clash of interests — rising powers with greater ambition, other states that prefer to check those drives — an additional problem is that spiral-type conflicts are added on to that combustible heap, often indistinguishably.</p>
<p>It is a realist cliche to appeal to Thucydides on this point, but the plain-spoken clarity of the argument remains powerful: ‘The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Sparta, made war inevitable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066110373949">Strassler, 1996</xref>: 26). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354066110373949">Gilpin (1986</xref>: 306; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066110373949">1989</xref>: 15, 19, 25–6) considers Thucydides to be the greatest of all the realist writers, and in his estimation the most important contribution in <italic>The Peloponnesian War</italic> is to have identified ‘that the uneven growth of power among states is the driving force of international relations.’</p>
<p>All of this applies to contemporary international politics — to the rise of China and the response of other states to that rise. China is an emerging great power; it borders other major powers and is implicated in a host of security issues; its demand for energy is a potential source of political friction with other states; and, most notably, it is at the same time an important strategic rival of, and intimately enmeshed economically with, the US. China benefits immensely from its ability to access the American market; and its massive dollar holdings are a key pillar of support for the stability of the US dollar, which in the eyes of many observers rests upon otherwise shaky foundations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354066110373949">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As established above, from a realist perspective, this is not a pretty picture. ‘For realist pessimists,’ Aaron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354066110373949">Friedberg (2005</xref>: 17, 18–19) notes, ‘the single most important feature of the PRC today is its rising power,’ and this is seen through a lens of history that focuses on the empirical regularity that rising powers, of all stripes, have time and time again been troublemakers. With regard to the consequences of China’s rise, the realist default setting must be pessimistic: China’s participation in international agreements will be increasingly necessary for those agreements to have meaning, but cooperation between strategic rivals will be brittle; China’s economic interdependence with the US will not inhibit political conflict or even prevent war from breaking out between them; China will become more ambitious, challenging the interests of other states.</p>
<p>But, crucially, while these expectations require classical realists to be alarmed by the consequences of the rise of China, and to anticipate increased international political friction as a result, it certainly does not mean that war is inevitable, and it does not lead to the prescription of superficially obvious policy recommendations. That interdependence will not prevent war, for example — a common realist position — does not mean that interdependence is a ‘bad thing,’ which should be avoided. Rather, it is a condition with political consequences, choices about which require political assessments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354066110373949">
<title>The tragedy of offensive realism</title>
<p>Realists are thus inescapably pessimistic about and wary of a rising China. But what does this suggest for policy? One realist offers quite a clear answer to this question. John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001</xref>: 401–2; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066110373949">2005c</xref>), drawing conclusions from a structural realist theory he derives and labels ‘offensive realism,’ states plainly that ‘China cannot rise peacefully.’ Instead, as its capabilities increase, China will become ‘an aggressive state determined to achieve regional hegemony.’ The inevitability of this is such that the current US policy of engaging China is ‘misguided,’ and ‘doomed to failure.’ A powerful China will seek ‘to dominate Asia the way the United States dominates the western hemisphere.’ Given these conclusions, Mearsheimer urges the US to ‘reverse course and do what it can to slow the rise of China.’</p>
<p>Mearsheimer starts out on shaky ground; although offering a theory of how states <italic>must</italic> behave (and he reads his theory to conclude that the US will be irresistibly drawn to confront and to try and prevent the rise of China), he is forced from the start to make ad hoc appeals to variables his model otherwise rejects. In his model, states are rational; but sometimes they ‘do foolish things.’ In his model, states ‘act as realists’ and things like domestic politics and ideology are irrelevant; but Americans are ideologically predisposed to ‘dislike realism,’ which usually just results in a hypocritical divergence between America’s rhetoric and its behavior, but in some cases (like current policy toward China) this disposition can cause problems for foreign policy.</p>
<p>This problem is elided by Mearsheimer’s fallback that while offensive realism is primarily a predictive theory, it is also a normative one. As he explains, ‘offensive realism is mainly a descriptive theory … but it is also a prescriptive theory. States <italic>should</italic> behave according to the dictates of offensive realism, because it outlines the best way to survive in a dangerous world.’ Or, even more plainly, ‘if states want to survive, they should always act like good offensive realists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2001</xref>: 11–12).</p>
<p>But Mearsheimer is wrong — analytically wrong in the logic of his predictions and dangerously wrong in his prescriptions. Many (but not all) of the errors of offensive realism are rooted in its structuralism, and, as such, it productively illustrates the pathologies that can result from an over-reliance on structural variables. I first consider the problems with offensive realist analysis; I then turn to a re-evaluation of the relevant questions from a classical realist perspective that exposes the problematic nature of an exclusively structural analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001</xref>: 30) builds his theory on five ‘bedrock assumptions.’ Each of these are, indeed, good realist assumptions, although some classical realists would find the fifth, and especially the fourth, overly restrictive. Nevertheless, they are all well and good as reasonable points of departure, for realists of any stripe: 1) anarchy — that is, it is a self-help system with no guaranteed limits on how others will behave; 2) states inevitably possess some offensive capability — therefore, they are potentially dangerous; 3) intentions are uncertain — that is, you can never know for sure what other states are going to do, especially in the future; 4) the survival goal — this is crucial: ‘survival is the primary goal of great powers. Specifically, states seek to maintain their territorial integrity and the autonomy of their domestic political order’; 5) rationality — this is also vitally important: the ‘fifth assumption is that great powers are rational actors.’</p>
<p>From these assumptions, Mearsheimer concludes that states, motivated to ensure their own security, will recognize that the safest position in the system is one of regional hegemony. (Global hegemony would be safer but is essentially unattainable. Here the classical realist agrees — as George F. Kennan argued, ‘no people is great enough to establish world hegemony’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066110373949">Lukacs, 2007</xref>: 48].) Only a regional hegemon is secure in the knowledge that it will not be conquered by others. Thus, given the anarchic nature of the international system, states that can plausibly make bids for regional hegemony will do so, as a matter of their own assessment of their best chances for survival. ‘States quickly understand that the best way to ensure their survival is to be the most powerful state in the system’; ‘only a misguided state would pass up an opportunity to be the hegemon in the system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2001</xref>: 2, 3, 33, 55).</p>
<p>The fatal flaw in Mearsheimer’s argument, however, is in his failure to distinguish between <italic>being</italic> a hegemon and <italic>bidding</italic> for hegemony. It may indeed be that ‘the ideal situation is to be the hegemon in the system.’ But according to his theory, ‘survival is the number one goal of great powers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2001</xref>: 34, 46). The central question for a great power mulling a bid for hegemony, therefore, is not ‘If I was the hegemon, will I be more likely to survive?’ It is, ‘If I make a bid for hegemony, will I be more likely to survive?’ And here the answer should be obvious to any rational great power (and, again, assumption five assumes great power rationality) — bidding for hegemony is one of the few and rare paths <italic>to</italic> destruction for a great power. Most great powers are extremely likely to survive; most great powers that bid for hegemony do not.</p>
<p>In contemporary practice, the facts on the ground expose this basic contradiction of Mearsheimer’s argument, rooted in assumptions about the primacy of the survival goal and of rationality. Is China’s ‘survival’ really in jeopardy if it does not aggressively bid to dominate all of Asia? Will the US not ‘survive’ if it fails to reach across the Pacific in an effort to strangle the Confucian baby in its cradle? What exactly threatens the survival of these great powers? Given their military establishments, their nuclear deterrents, their economic might, their continental size, and their vast populations — is their survival really imperiled if they do not act as offensive realists? Or is it <italic>only</italic> imperiled if they irrationally act as offensive realists, pushing the few chips that hold the prospects for their destruction across the poker table in a reckless bet to win it all?</p>
<p>But the problem is more general than that. Only a power with a complete ignorance of history would be eager to embark upon a bid for hegemony, if survival was its main goal. After all, most states in modern history that have bid for hegemony — with one exceptional exception — have antagonized their neighbors and eventually elicited an encircling coalition that, indeed, utterly destroyed them, leading to the loss of their territorial integrity and the autonomy of their domestic political order, the two things Mearsheimer says states hold most dear. And this occurs for reasons that do not surprise realists, who assume that states have a primal preference not to be pushed around, and, thus, when they are able, will resist efforts by would-be hegemons to dominate them.</p>
<p>This ignorance — and resulting catastrophic error — on the part of would-be hegemons seems at odds with Mearsheimer’s assumption of rationality. But it is rooted in his structuralism, which cannot allow for history, or learning. Classical realists would expect states to understand that throwing their weight around — not to mention a bid for hegemony — might be self-defeating; whereas states, acting as structural realists expect them to, will make the same foolish choices over and over again. Referring to European history, Raymond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354066110373949">Aron (1966</xref>: 72) observed the self-defeating nature of this sort of excess ambition, which invariably excites:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the fear and jealousy of other states, and thereby provoking the formation of a hostile coalition. In any given system there exists an <italic>optimum of forces</italic>; to exceed it will produce a dialectal reversal. Additional force involves a relative weakening by a shift of allies to neutrality or of neutrals to the enemy camp.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thucydides observed a similar phenomenon in reporting the widespread ‘indignation felt against Athens,’ rooted in apprehension about its imperial aims, ‘which pushed men to favor Sparta’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066110373949">Strassler, 1996</xref>: 93–4).</p>
<p>Mearsheimer acknowledges the argument that he might be accused of advocating self-defeating behavior. But his counter-arguments either strengthen the case against him, by reminding the reader of just how hard it is to achieve regional hegemony, or they throw smoke, by conflating the prospects for success in a given military confrontation between two states with the prospects for success in a bid for hegemony. On the former issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001</xref>: 41, see also pp. 143, 212) repeatedly notes that the one ‘success story’ in this pursuit — the US — is extremely rare: ‘The United States is the only regional hegemon in modern history, although other states have fought major wars in pursuit of regional hegemony: imperial Japan in Northeast Asia, Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, and Nazi Germany in Europe. But none succeeded.’ (Indeed, the other four brought about their own destruction.) On the latter issue, Mearsheimer appeals to the argument that in modern history, the initiator of military conflict won about 60 percent of the time; thus history does not support the contention that resorting to the offensive is unwise. But to start a war is not the same thing as to bid for regional hegemony. Here the modern scorecard remains one success and four (catastrophic) failures; but instead Mearsheimer cherry-picks the wrong metric. He observes that the Nazis won their wars against France and Poland, but lost against the Soviet Union. Are we to count this as a 66 percent ‘success’ rate for the offensive? No. These three wars were part of <italic>one</italic> bid for hegemony, which failed. At times Mearsheimer suggests that it was a mistake for Germany to take on Russia (though at other times he suggests the opposite), but this simply fails to recognize, somewhat surprisingly given that offensive realism would predict it, that the whole point of all the wars was to bid for regional hegemony, which required confronting Russia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354066110373949">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001</xref>: 212, 213) concludes that while the success rate of one out of five is ‘not impressive,’ he nevertheless insists the take-home point is that ‘the American case demonstrates that it is possible to achieve regional hegemony,’ thus proving the naysayers wrong. Instead, ‘the pursuit of regional hegemony is not a quixotic ambition, although there is no denying it is difficult to achieve. Since the security benefits of hegemony are enormous, powerful states will invariably be tempted to emulate the United States and try to dominate their region of the world.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1354066110373949">
<title>Suicide solutions?</title>
<p>Or not. Given the enormous security risks entailed in a bid for hegemony, rational states might well ask, ‘Just how exceptional is the American case?’ Crucially, they might, and should, ask, ‘Does my neighborhood look more like the one that the US was able to achieve regional hegemony in, or the ones in which the other bidders — all of whom were destroyed — rolled their dice?’ Two attributes of the US case that probably contributed to its exceptional success were very weak neighbors and even weaker adversaries. One would think that a power motivated by its survival, before embarking on a course of action that led to the destruction of four out of the five who previously tried it, might at least engage in some back-of-the-envelope calculations on this question rather than ‘invariably be tempted to emulate the United States.’</p>
<p>Even without recognizing the exceptional nature of the American case, at the abstract level, the entire ‘inevitable bid for regional hegemony’ argument still collapses under the weight of its own illogic. If, as Mearsheimer assumes, states are rational and that their number one motive is to survive, they need to assess the probability of their survival if they do not bid for regional hegemony, and compare that with the increased increment to their survival prospects if they achieve that hegemony against the risk to their survival from attempting the bid. On the first question, what are the expectations of survival for a great power strong enough to be contemplating a bid for regional hegemony, in the absence of such a bid? A very conservative estimate would be 98 percent. Regarding the second calculation, what are their survival prospects after a successful bid? Probably something like 99.999 percent. But if the bid is unsuccessful, it will almost certainly end in their destruction. What are the chances of this? Very, very conservatively, assume that there is a 50 percent chance that bidding for hegemony will catastrophically fail (and this is extremely conservative indeed, given the 80 percent rate Mearsheimer reports and without even considering the possibility that the 20 percent success was the result of extraordinarily uncommon factors).</p>
<p>In sum, even when biasing the odds in favor of offensive realism, it is virtually nonsensical to conclude that a rational, would-be hegemon, motivated by survival, when evaluating the merits of a strategy that would slightly increase their (already extremely high) prospects for survival but which holds a 50 percent chance of resulting in their utter destruction, would embark upon the course of action predicted with near-deterministic confidence by the theory of offensive realism.</p>
<p>Finally, on a more technical note, in exploring the application of Mearsheimer’s argument to contemporary politics, it is necessary to consider the influence of nuclear weapons. On the one hand, classical realists tend to stress continuity over change in world politics, and do not expect nuclear weapons, which matter, to stop states from resorting to force to settle their differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066110373949">Gilpin, 1989</xref>: 35–6). But on the other hand, the existence of nuclear weapons, especially as they apply to great power politics, does fundamentally affect the application of offensive realism, rooted as it is in the perspective that states are motivated first and foremost by a desire to survive. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer (2001</xref>: 44, 129, 146) observes, ‘states with survivable nuclear weapons are likely to fear each other less’; and ‘there is no question that MAD [Mutual Assured Destruction] makes war among the great powers less likely.’ This raises the questions of whether China, with a secure nuclear deterrent, will be compelled to assure its survival by embarking upon a bid for hegemony; whether such bids for hegemony, however plausible historically, are now even more impractical and self-defeating than ever; and whether the US, to assure its survival, must act immediately and forcefully to stop that (potential) bid before it occurs.</p>
<p>Mearsheimer thus offers illogical predictions about, and, worse, dangerous and self-defeating policy prescriptions for, both China and the US. Consider China. Mearsheimer expects a bid for hegemony; again, not due to any grand ambitions, ‘wicked motives,’ or inherently aggressive designs, but rather and nothing more than as the best way to maximize the prospects for China’s survival. Following the discussion above, however, the first question to ask of this claim is what the baseline expectations for China’s survival are against foreign threats in the foreseeable future. They would already seem extremely high. The issue, then, is to calculate the benefits of the added security from achieving hegemony, weighed against the risks of pursuing the bid. And a crucial question here is, ‘Does China’s neighborhood look more like the American experience, or that of those who tried and failed?’</p>
<p>The answer is obvious. China lives in a very crowded neighborhood. It shares a very long border with Russia, with whom, Mearsheimer notes, it has fought in the past; which he codes as a ‘great power’; and which has a very large nuclear force. Japan is also very close by. Mearsheimer also codes Japan as a great power; and he notes the mutual suspicion between the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2001</xref>: 375, 381–2, 393, 396). If frightened or provoked, Japan has the capability to develop an independent nuclear force, and it is difficult to imagine a realist account that would not expect them to do so in such circumstances. China also borders India, a very large, rising, nuclear-armed state, also with whom China has fought in the past, and which has a latent economic potential similar even to that of China’s own. China also borders Vietnam, not a great power, but no pushover, and yet another state with whom China has fought in living memory. A unified (and also nuclear-capable) Korea would be another regional player sharing a border with China.</p>
<p>In sum, there is no good reason to believe that if China is a rational actor motivated primarily to survive, it would embark upon a bid for hegemony. Realists would expect such a bid to elicit hostile responses from its great and regional power neighbors, and contribute to nuclear proliferation of a kind that China would prefer not to see. The fundamental realist question, always, remains, ‘Is my national interest better or worse off by pursuing this course of action?’; with regard to China, and an aggressive bid for hegemony, the answer is an obvious ‘no.’ It is worth noting that <italic>classical</italic> realists cannot rule out that China would not be so ambitious (or so foolish) as to give it a try; it is simply that such behavior cannot be accounted for by the logic of offensive realism.</p>
<p>As for contemporary American policy, Mearsheimer’s logic is on even shakier ground. Again, it is the assumption that ‘survival is the number one goal of great powers’ that takes much of the wind from the sails of his advice to the US. Mearsheimer wants the US to do everything it can to slow China’s growth, but why? Aside from the fact that China is extremely unlikely to achieve regional hegemony in Asia, even if it somehow did, Mearsheimer makes a convincing case that, while the US might find this at times irritating, this would not threaten the survival of America. And since survival is its primary motive, from that position of security it should enjoy the luxury of choosing its China policy from a broad range of possible options.</p>
<p>After all, the reason why states want to be regional hegemons in the first place is because that position provides them with incredible security, even from other similarly situated powers. As Mearsheimer notes, ‘regional hegemons certainly pack a powerful military punch, but launching amphibious assaults across oceans against territory controlled and defended by another power would be a suicidal undertaking.’ Mearsheimer elaborates, repeatedly, the secure status of the regional hegemon, and in particular the security of the United States as an ‘insular state,’ given the ‘stopping power of water,’ which he appeals to numerous times as a law-like statement. Indeed, ‘the best outcome a great power can hope for is to be a regional hegemon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2001</xref>: 40, 41, 114–9, 126, 141). Thus, even before we put the US nuclear deterrent on the table, its survival is simply not threatened by China, even one that somehow, against the odds, achieves regional hegemony.</p>
<p>Mearsheimer raises the notion that if China did achieve regional hegemony, it would find it in its interest to distract the US by trying to foment trouble in America’s backyard, and this might jeopardize regional hegemony. But this is a very problematic fallback position, for two reasons. First, there is nothing to stop China from doing that even without being a regional hegemon. Second, and more to Mearsheimer’s point, such meddling is extremely unlikely to undermine America’s position as a region hegemon, not only because of the realities on the ground in North America, but also because the durability of regional hegemony, once achieved, is extremely robust — after all, that is the engine that motivates his entire theory.</p>
<p>Even by Mearsheimer’s own logic, then, the US is in no way compelled to try and make life miserable for China. And so we are back to the primary realist question — should it? Would such a policy achieve valuable political goals? Setting aside (false) concerns for survival, would an attempt to stem China’s growth advance the national interest of the United States? According to hard-nosed China experts like Tom Christensen, even if US–China relations could be described as a zero-sum competition, such a strategy would be ‘counterproductive,’ because its political ramifications would leave the US ‘much weaker in the region in relation to China’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066110373949">Christensen, 2006</xref>: 83, 85; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354066110373949">Art, 2008</xref>: 266).</p>

<title>What is a (classical) realist to do?</title>
<p>An awareness of the errors and limitations of structural realism in general and offensive realism in particular only gets us so far: there remains the alarming rise of China, and the question of what to do about it. While classical realism must be wary and pessimistic regarding the consequences of China’s rise, its perspective nevertheless leads to the conclusion that engaging rather than confronting China is the wisest strategy, in the only context that ever matters to realist analysis — that strategy compared to the likely consequences of other options.</p>
<p>This position derives from two foundational classical realist tenets, and two consequences of those beliefs. First is the need to always acknowledge power: both the reality of the power of others and the necessary limitations of one’s own. Related to this is the central importance of accommodation in classical realist thought (and it is on this basis that realists chastise the utopians and idealists). Second is that politics matters: both domestic and international. That is, choices made by states are affected by what goes on inside of them, and choices made by states are also affected by choices made by other states. Related to this is the classical resistance to deterministic theories. Since politics matters, and policies can be chosen, despite the fact that anarchy and the balance of power must powerfully inform state behavior, there are a number of very distinct trajectories along which the foreign policy of a great power can develop. For classical realists, the future is unwritten, and so wise policy matters.</p>
<sec id="section7-1354066110373949">
<title>Acknowledging power</title>
<p>Classical realists cannot speak more clearly and with one voice on this issue. Morgenthau, who considered the Soviet Union to be a present military threat (more present, more clearly defined, and more dangerous than anything China currently approaches), nevertheless wrote at the height of the Cold War — and the height of McCarthyism — that ‘military preparations must join hands with an accommodating diplomacy.’ Morgenthau’s Cold War policy was rooted in general lessons: ‘We must be strong enough to resist aggression and wise enough to accommodate foreign interests which do not impinge upon our own,’ he explained, and urged policymakers to remember, above all, that ‘no nation’s power is without limits, and hence that its policies must respect the power and interests of others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066110373949">Morgenthau, 1951</xref>: 70, 88, 242, see also p. 136).</p>
<p>Kennan’s perspective was similar. At the height of the same hysteria, he favored (the then scandalous position of) seating the Chinese communists at the UN, but was ‘shouted down.’ For Kennan, what mattered was not what we wanted, but what was, and the ‘significant reality was created when the Chinese communists overran the mainland of China.’ The realities of power had to be acknowledged: ‘we cannot recoil from the struggle for power as something shocking or abnormal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354066110373949">Kennan, 1967</xref>: 256, 491, 493, 495–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066110373949">Lukacs, 2007</xref>: 62). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1951</xref>: 150), Kennan was also quick to support, recognize, and respect the spheres of influence of other great powers, even (especially) those of potential adversaries. He favored a modest, ‘less ambitious’ pursuit of the national interest, with ‘an attitude of detachment and soberness … unsullied by arrogance or hostility toward other people or delusions of superiority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066110373949">Kennan, 1951</xref>: 88).</p>
<p>Carr was the realist champion not simply of the need to acknowledge power, but of the wisdom — indeed the necessity — of accommodating rising power. ‘Consistent realism … involves acceptance of the whole historical process and precludes moral judgment on it,’ he admonished. The maintenance of international order requires that those at the top make ‘sufficient concessions,’ ‘and the responsibility for seeing that these changes take place as far as possible in an orderly way rests as much on the defenders as on the challengers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066110373949">Carr, 1946</xref>: 91, 169).</p>
<p>Appealing to Carr raises the stakes in the debate. Mearsheimer considers <italic>The Twenty Years’ Crisis</italic> to be ‘a seminal realist work,’ and he defines Carr ‘as a realist on the basis of his arguments’ in that book, which is also why, he explains, Carr ‘is widely — and correctly — seen as a realist.’ Mearsheimer cites Carr approvingly as exposing ‘the utopian,’ who ‘believes in the possibility of more or less radically rejecting reality, and substituting his utopia for it by an act of will,’ committing the cardinal sin ‘of ignoring power almost completely’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2005a</xref>: 355; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066110373949">2005b</xref>: 141, 143; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354066110373949">Gilpin, 1986</xref>: 309).</p>
<p>But just who is the utopian here? Who is ignoring power, and hoping to reject reality — those who would seek to stop the rise of China, or those who would acknowledge reality and seek to find a way to best accommodate it? In Carr’s view, ‘defense of the status quo is not a policy which can be lastingly successful. It will end in war as surely as rigid conservatism will end in revolution.’ Thus while Carr the realist insists ‘we shall do our best to make ourselves as powerful as we can,’ Carr the realist also requires ‘adjustment to the changes of the balance of power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066110373949">Carr, 1946</xref>: 222). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1951</xref>: 133) holds a similar position, mocking ‘the crusader,’ for whom ‘compromise is a synonym for appeasement,’ and who thinks that agreeing to spheres of influence ‘reveals both weakness and vice.’ For the crusader, the ‘middle ground of compromise and peaceful settlement is lost.’</p>
<p>It is the utopian who seeks to turn back the rise of power by force of will. Naive idealists come in many stripes: not all of them are doe-eyed well-wishers, some are dangerous crusaders; but from a classical realist perspective they both share a cavalier attitude toward power (one underestimates its danger; the other disregards its limits), and a blind spot for the ubiquity of politics (one underestimating the clash of interests; the other the consequences of the will to resist domination).</p>
<p>The need to acknowledge the reality of power and accommodate its rise is so deeply ingrained in classical realism that on at least one occasion its instinctive deployment was a blunder, which serves as a reminder that few laws are sacrosanct, and there are exceptions to every rule. And so both Carr and Kennan, it must be recognized, supported (at the time) the Munich accords, for reasons that flowed naturally from their theoretical predispositions. For Kennan, Czechoslovakia was ‘a central European state. Its fortunes must in the long run lie with — and not against — the dominant forces in this area.’ Adjusting to this ‘painful’ reality was a better solution than ‘the romantic one of hopeless resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354066110373949">Kennan, 1968</xref>: 5, 107; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354066110373949">Kennan, 1967</xref>: 97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066110373949">Lukacs, 2007</xref>: 41, 42, 44). For Carr, as he wrote in the first edition of <italic>The Twenty Years’ Crisis</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>if the power relations of Europe in 1938 should make it inevitable that Czechoslovakia should lose part of her territory, and eventually her independence, it was preferable (quite apart from any question of justice or injustice) that this should come about as the result of discussions round a table in Munich rather than as of result … of a war. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066110373949">Carr, 1939a</xref>: 278)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354066110373949">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is most interesting about this blunder for present purposes is that it derived from an over-reliance on structural-level analysis. Kennan and Carr based their recommendations by focusing only on the balance of power and how it was changing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354066110373949">11</xref></sup> But Nazi Germany was different. And it was different for reasons that could only be understood by appealing to variables central to classical realism, but forbidden by structural realism: history, ideology, domestic politics, and the nature of its leadership. Morgenthau, on the other hand, opposed the Munich accords, and he did so for good classical reasons. Simply put he recognized, for those reasons, that the Nazis were different, and dangerously so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354066110373949">Morgenthau, 1939</xref>: 483–4). As a classical realist he could see the red flags waving vigorously here; the narrow structuralist is willfully color-blind.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized, however, that while Morgenthau was right about Munich, this experience did not change his perspective on the importance, more generally, for the need to respect and accommodate power whenever circumstances would safely permit it. Never wavering in his harsh critique of the Munich accords, Morgenthau was nevertheless also critical of the subsequent trotting out of the Munich analogy to discredit all attempts at accommodation. He quoted Churchill’s 1950 speech before the House of Commons approvingly: ‘Appeasement in itself may be good or bad according to the circumstances. Appeasement from weakness and fear is alike futile and fatal. Appeasement from strength is magnanimous and noble and might be the surest and perhaps the only path to world peace.’ To this, Morgenthau himself added, ‘Future historians will have to decide whether the Western world has suffered more from the surrender at Munich … or from the intellectual confusion that equates a negotiated settlement with appeasement and thus discredits the sole rational alternative to war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066110373949">Morgenthau, 1951</xref>: 137, 138).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1354066110373949">
<title>Politics matters</title>
<p>Classical realism also places great emphasis on politics, domestic and international, and even considers the role of things like ideas, norms, and legitimacy; politics that structural realism rejects, and concepts that it dismisses at most as solely instrumental of power. This can be a source of some confusion. Classical realists do not expect norms to prevent states from pursuing radically dangerous foreign policies; moreover in their unwillingness to label actions as ‘good’ or ‘bad,’ and in emphasizing the role of power in shaping state behavior, they recognize the instrumental use of ideas and have placed less emphasis on variables like regime type. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066110373949">Carr (1946</xref>: 65, 69, 73, 150, 208), for example, went out of his way to stress ‘the relativity of thought to the interests and circumstances of the thinker,’ and insisted that there was no moral difference between revisionist and status quo aims; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066110373949">Kennan (1951</xref>: 50, 87) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1945</xref>: 18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066110373949">1960</xref>: 10–11) devoted gallons of ink in defense of the proposition that traditional standards of morality cannot (and should not) be used to explain and inform an understanding of how states behave in world politics. But the desire of classical realist scholars to study world politics ‘scientifically’ — that is, without reference to ‘good and bad’ or ‘right and wrong’ — and with an acute sensitivity to the ways in which universal moral claims often serve as a cloak for particular interests, does not mean that domestic politics or ideational variables are irrelevant for them. There may be no <italic>moral</italic> difference between states that prefer the status quo and those that pursue revisionist strategies, but they will nevertheless behave differently; similarly, norms will not stop states from engaging in acts of barbaric aggression, but historical experience and perceptions of legitimacy nevertheless condition the way in which states interpret the meaning of each other’s actions — certainly this view was central, for example, to Carr’s thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066110373949">Carr, 1946</xref>: 92, 97, 98, 101, 108, 143, 152, 220–2).</p>
<p>In particular, for the classical realist, domestic politics matters. Thucydides routinely appealed to regime type (and factional conflict within regimes) in his explanation of why actors behaved in a certain way in world politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066110373949">Strassler, 1996</xref>: 14, 318, 328, 346, 348, 481). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354066110373949">Gilpin (1971</xref>: 401, 403; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066110373949">1989</xref>: 23) repeatedly gives causal weight to domestic and ideational variables. Indeed, he highlights the distinct realist emphasis on ‘national sentiment’ and ‘political values.’ Carr took very seriously the role of public opinion (‘power over opinion … is a necessary part of all power’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066110373949">1939a</xref>: 130), and both Morgenthau and Kennan noted the influence of domestic politics and ideology on the practice of American foreign policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066110373949">Kennan’s (1947)</xref> most famous and influential work rooted ‘The sources of Soviet conduct’ to internal Russian politics, historical experience, and the nature of the Russian character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1354066110373949">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>If domestic politics matters (and classical realists think it does), then things that influence it — like the foreign policy choices of other states — matter as well. International politics can affect the balance of economic and political power within states by creating (or foreclosing) opportunities in the international system that benefit some groups within states over others, and make more or less plausible (and defensible, in domestic debates) certain grand strategies. Policies of containment and restriction disempower those groups with the most to gain from warm relations with the rest of the world, reinforce negative perceptions of the hostile intentions of others, and reduce the opportunity costs of a belligerent foreign policy. The collapse of the global economy in the 1930s, for example, shifted the domestic balance of power within societies away from liberal internationalists, and contributed to (which is not to say it caused) the rise of fascism.</p>
<p>This is another perspective that divides classical from structural realists that invites confusion, perhaps because it sounds a little too much like the notion that ‘interdependence causes peace,’ which realists of all stripes reject. But this argument is different, and has a good realist pedigree. Albert Hirschman, in a study of economic coercion, also illustrated how economic relations between states strengthened ‘like-minded’ groups at the expense of others, and influenced the trajectory of how the national interest was defined. Classical realists see politics shaping the pattern of economic relations, and those relations reinforcing their political foundations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1354066110373949">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion: The unwritten future</title>
<p>The trajectory of state choices — especially of great powers, which have room for maneuver — is uncertain, and contingent. This is true in general, and this is true for contemporary China. Structural realists, of course, cannot distinguish between the Japan of the 1920s and the Japan of the 1930s; for them the former was necessarily pregnant with the latter. Nor can they distinguish between Weimar Germany and Nazi Germany; or mourn the blunders of the Western powers in the 1920s, rooted in a tragically short-sighted and narrow (and un-realistic) conception of the national interest. Classical realists, on the other hand, looking back tend to see the catastrophes of the 1930s not as the inevitable consequences of physical laws, but rooted in the dismal political choices of the 1920s. A classical realist would have preferred to live in a world where Weimar thrived, and was reintegrated into the international economy, and, however a bitter pill this might be to swallow, to re-emerge with some respect of its power and interests. In Kennan’s view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066110373949">1951</xref>: 69, 70), ‘the great misfortune of the west … was not Hitler but the weakness of German society which made possible his triumph … which takes us back to the question of the attitude of the Western democracies toward the Weimar Republic,’ and the ‘lost opportunities’ of the 1920s. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1946</xref>: 150), ‘The German situation in 1932, for instance, contained essentially three such germinal developments: parliamentary democracy, military dictatorship, and Nazism,’ any one of which could have ‘finally materialize[d].’</p>
<p>Which one? The classical realist cannot be sure. It depended on ‘the contingent elements of the situation,’ and ‘could not be foreseen.’ This remains true today. ‘The first lesson the student of international politics must learn and never forget,’ Morgenthau lectured, ‘is that the complexities of international affairs make simple solutions and trustworthy prophecies impossible.’ This admonition weaves its way as a central theme throughout his writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066110373949">Morgenthau, 1960</xref>: 20, 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066110373949">1946</xref>: 150, also pp. 129, 139, 146–8, 220, 221).</p>
<p>This is not to duck the question at hand. Emphasizing contingency does not provide a get-out-of-jail-free card — quite the opposite. It requires a political evaluation of a political question, more or less on a case-by-case basis, if informed by a consistent set of assumptions and analytical tools. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066110373949">Morgenthau (1960</xref>: 10, 11) wrote, ‘Realism, then, considers prudence — the weighing of the consequences of alternative political actions — to be the supreme virtue in politics.’ For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066110373949">Kennan (1951</xref>: 47, 50), the ‘recognition of power realities’ would encourage ‘the gentle civilizer of national self-interest.’</p>
<p>What, then, are the consequences of alternative political actions for the US with regard to the rise of China? Almost all China hands and Asian security specialists consider its future foreign policy trajectory to be uncertain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1354066110373949">14</xref></sup> It may emerge as a responsible great power, or it may blunder into a disastrous bid for hegemony. American foreign policy will be one factor among several that shapes this choice. An ‘offensive realist’ approach, designed to ‘make sure that China does not become a peer competitor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066110373949">Mearsheimer, 2001</xref>: 400), is suspect (at best) in its logic, handcuffed by the limits of its structuralism, and, ironically, rooted in utopianism — an attempt to reshape the world as one would like to see it, rather than respecting the realities of power. It is also, from the perspective of the self-interest of the US, almost certainly a self-fulfilling, and self-defeating, prophesy. If it turns out (as is likely) that the US simply does not have the capability to inhibit China’s rise, certainly the prophesy of a powerful and hostile China will be realized by the attempt. If by chance it is ‘successful,’ the effort by the US to slow China’s rise would backfire, for three reasons: it would be very costly, it would seriously harm America’s international political position, and it would make China much more dangerous.</p>
<p>China holds over two trillion dollars in foreign exchange reserves, most of which are in the form of US dollar assets, in particular US government debt. This can sound ominous, but, in practice, this position gives China much less practical coercive leverage over the US than it might seem. China has found itself (if with mixed emotions after the financial crisis of 2007–8) with considerable vested interests in both the future of the dollar and in the general health of the US economy, its largest export market. China would be a big loser in a confrontation that undermined either the greenback or American consumer demand. But if push came to shove cooler heads would be unlikely to prevail, and a Sino-American macroeconomic tussle that seriously implicated the dollar would leave both countries much worse off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1354066110373949">15</xref></sup> But it is not hard to imagine China going ‘financially nuclear’ in response to US policies explicitly designed to take down the People’s Republic. In aggressively confronting China, the US would be inviting the very high costs of an unwanted and major crisis of the dollar, which would seriously harm not just its economy, but America’s global military capacity as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066110373949">Kirshner, 2008</xref>: 431).</p>
<p>The US would not be the only victim of its ‘success’ in damaging China’s economy — the collateral damage would be widespread and considerable, for China has become both a pillar and an engine of global economic growth. It is commonly reported with fanfare that China is the world’s second largest economy, and that it has surpassed Germany to become the world’s largest exporter. Less discussed is China’s increasing importance as an <italic>importer</italic> of other countries’ products. In 2008 China was the world’s third largest importer, and it is poised to take the number two slot, behind the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1354066110373949">16</xref></sup> In 2008 China was the biggest export market for — among others — Argentina, Chile, Iran, Kazakhstan, Oman, Yemen, Burma, Taiwan, and South Korea (which exported twice as much to China as it did to the United States). China was the second most important importer of goods from a host of countries including Australia, Japan, and Peru, and was a very important export market for scores of others, including the United States, which exported more to China than it did to any other country except for Canada and Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066110373949">International Monetary Fund, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354066110373949">World Trade Organization, 2009</xref>). China’s value as an export market for the world is only likely to increase in importance in the coming years, both as it recovers earlier than others from the ‘great recession’ and as it resumes high rates of annual economic growth. If, then, the US was somehow able, at great cost and effort, to knock down China’s rate of economic growth, it would also take the wind from the sails of China’s demand for imports, leaving behind an angry mob of exporting countries in distress, who would (correctly) blame the US for their economic (and subsequent political) woes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1354066110373949">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, successful US policies that wounded the Chinese economy would generate perverse outcomes; the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, desperate for a new foundation of legitimacy, could easily resort to virulent nationalism; and stripped of the expectation that many of its foreign policy goals will be best achieved implicitly as a natural consequence of its continued ascendance, China might adopt more aggressive, risk-acceptant international strategies, especially it if perceived its relative power to be diminishing. More generally, a highly antagonistic US posture toward China would almost certainly bring about that self-fulfilling prophecy; assuring a wounded, hostile, dangerous adversary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1354066110373949">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, a full-blown confrontation with China along the lines suggested by offensive realism would be a self-mutilating geopolitical gesture that would damage the US, undermine its international political influence, and result in an angry and unstable China — and that is if it worked. Classical realism, on the other hand, expects a rising China to be more ambitious, assertive, and, often, difficult to deal with. There is cause for concern — even grave concern. But however wary and pessimistic as they approach the table, classical realists nevertheless place their (always) hedged bets on those policies that have the best chance of shaping China’s domestic political debates and international opportunities so as to encourage and accommodate its peaceful rise to great power status.</p>

<p>Realists see humans as organizing into political groups, and expect the relationship between these groups, under anarchy, to tend toward conflict. The state is currently the most successful form of political organization. But realism (at least, classical realism) does not depend so much on the ‘state’ as it does on the idea of politically defined conflict groups, pursuing an aggregate interest, dwelling in anarchy with other politically defined conflict groups.
