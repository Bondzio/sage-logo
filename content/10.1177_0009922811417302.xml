<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This commentary will explore the topic of international children’s rights. The first section will focus on several seminal documents from the United Nations with an emphasis on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). These documents provide a Human Rights Framework for international children’s health as well as providing a beacon for programs dedicated to the alleviation of suffering faced by children and youth who find themselves invisible and excluded. The second section of the article then examines in detail the overarching goal of this framework, which is the provision of basic needs and the protection of vulnerable children in “harm’s way” as the result of conflict and/or natural disasters that impinge on their ability to survive and flourish. The article ends with a brief discussion of the how international children’s rights informs the delivery of pediatric care in the global context.</p>

<title>United Nations Documents for Children’s Rights</title>
<p>The establishment of a codex of human rights in general and of children’s rights in particular has evolved over the past 60 years. This section will provide a description of the major children’s rights documents that have been established by the United Nations over this time period. These consist of declarations, treaties, and conventions that articulate the inalienable rights of the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811417302">1</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-0009922811417302">
<title>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</title>
<p>The newly formed United Nations in 1948 formulated and passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that provided a broad framework for the assurance of basic human rights. The preamble states that, “… recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.” The Declaration then goes on to articulate 30 Articles to delineate what those rights entail. There are 2 that are of particular relevance to this discussion of children’s rights. First, Articles 3 proclaim, “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.” Second, Article 5 states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811417302">2</xref></sup> These 2 statements provide the foundation for the importance of “to provide” and “to protect” that emerge and are clarified in subsequent documents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922811417302">
<title>The United Nations Declaration and Convention on the Rights of the Child</title>
<p>The UNDR established the universally accepted framework for human rights but left significant gaps regarding the specific rights of children. A focus on children’s rights began with Eglantyne Jebb, who witnessed and documented the devastating effects of World War I on European children. She drafted a set of children’s rights that was later adopted by the League of Nations as the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child. In 1952, the United Nations adopted and reaffirmed the Declaration of the Rights of the Child and directed its members to follow its principles of protection for all children. The Declaration espoused the basic principle of civil and political as well as economic, societal and cultural rights for all children. Over the course of the remainder of the 20th century, the United Nations tried to craft a document that would articulate specific actionable principles that embodied this Declaration. The General Assembly on November 20, 1989, passed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). On September 1, 1990 the CRC was put into force making it the fastest international treaty to move from passage, ratification, and implementation by member nations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811417302">3</xref></sup> The Convention establishes the responsibility of governments, institutions, citizens, and families to ensure that the rights of the child are respected and all actions are directed toward achieving the “best interest of the child.” The UN CRC was the first legally binding international document to recognize the rights of the child. The essential themes of the UN CRC include the right to the basic needs necessary for optimal growth and development, civil and political rights, and a right to safety and protection. Safety and protection frequently is interpreted as a freedom from forced child labor and unsafe work conditions. However, it embraces a much broader focus and includes safety from child maltreatment, domestic violence, and the witnessing of violence in the home and/or the larger communities. It also encompasses freedom from sexual exploitation and death.</p>

<title>UN Millennium Development Goals and a World Fit for Children</title>
<p>In September 2000, building on a decade of major United Nations conferences and summits, world leaders came together at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to adopt the United Nations Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting out a series of time-bound targets—with a deadline of 2015—which have become known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811417302">4</xref></sup> The focus of the MDGs was on the world’s most vulnerable populations—particularly children. The 8 goals include the eradication of extreme hunger and poverty; the achievement of universal primary education; gender equity and the empowerment of women; reducing child mortality and improving maternal health; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other infectious diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing global partnership for development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811417302">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, a Special Session of the UN General Assembly reaffirmed the unfinished agenda of the 1990 World Summit for Children and the UN CRC. The Summit created a document titled “A World Fit for Children,” and established an Action Plan with measurable goals consistent and based on the MDGs to focus international efforts on improving the lives of children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811417302">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922811417302">
<title>To Provide and Protect the Child</title>
<p>The CRC and the MDGs clearly articulate that a child has the right to life’s basic needs which include the warmth of shelter, nutritional food, appropriate seasonal clothing, primary education, and quality health care. It is in such a milieu that we nurture our children to strive for optimal growth and development.</p>
<p>Inadequate access to life’s basic needs is linked to the lack of economic security for families with children. It is estimated that in 2005, there were 1.4 billion persons still living in extreme poverty with a family income of less than $1.25 per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811417302">7</xref>(p6)</sup> These families frequently lack access to life’s basic necessities of shelter, adequate nutrition, and safe potable water. It is estimated that 50% of all deaths to children younger than 5 years in the developing world are linked to nutritional deficiencies due to severe caloric, protein, or micronutrient malnutrition. It is estimated that there has been progress made in the reduction in the percentage of children who are severely underweight with a reduction from 1990 to 2008 of 31% to 26%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811417302">8</xref>(p14)</sup> A frequently used marker for micronutrient malnutrition is the percentage of children in the developing world who receive 2 doses of vitamin A. Again there has been progress made with an increase of 16% to 72% from 1990 to 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811417302">9</xref>(p9)</sup> In addition, lack of safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene also contribute substantially to illness and mortality with lack of clean water tied to outbreaks of cholera, dysentery, guinea worm, and typhoid. MDG 4 seeks to reduce mortality for children younger than 5 years. Substantial progress has been made in reducing child deaths. Since 1990, the mortality rate for children younger than 5 years in developing countries decreased from 89 deaths per 1000 live births to 60 in 2009. In total numbers, the under-5 deaths declined from 12.4 million in 1990 to 8.1 million in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811417302">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-0009922811417302">
<title>Refugees and Displaced Children</title>
<p>The quintessential risk of poverty, starvation, and lack of essential basic services frequently occurs in families and children who are displaced from their homes and villages. This can be the result of natural disasters such as famines, floods, earthquakes, or tsunamis. It may also result from conflict that cuts across international boundaries or is contained within a country facing civil unrest and war. It is estimated that 1.5 billion children or 2/3 of the world’s child population live in 42 countries affected by violence. The UN Refugee Agency UNHRC estimates that there are 11 million refugees with 48% being children. In addition, there are another 25 million internally displaced persons as a result of natural catastrophes and/or violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811417302">11</xref>(p38)</sup></p>
<p>Approximately 70% of the world refugee population is in Africa and the Middle East. The world’s largest source countries for refugees include Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sierra Leone, again highlighting the role of violence, conflict, and war. Refugees frequently cross international borders to enter neighboring countries. Hence, some of the countries hosting the most refugees include Pakistan, Syria, Jordan, Iran, and Guinea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811417302">12</xref></sup> As examples of this migration, in 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Afghanis fled to Iran and Pakistan. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, refugees flooded into Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania to escape the genocide and terror in their country. Today, refugees from Iraq migrate to Syria or Jordan. The Darfur region of Sudan provides another example of the impact of civil war and genocide within a country on the refugee and displaced persons population. As the Janjaweed attacked villages, it resulted in the mass displacement of Sudanese to Internal Displacement Camps in the Sudan or to refugee camps in Chad. It has been estimated by UNICEF that 1.8 million children have been internally displaced and/ or traveled externally to refugee camps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811417302">13</xref></sup> Once displaced, children continue to be particularly vulnerable. This displacement exacerbates the malnutrition, acute and chronic disease, as well as the emotional trauma of lost loved ones, confinement, and the ongoing fear of attack by armed militias. The genocide includes a “strategy of systematic and deliberate starvation” of those who are trying to survive in displacement camps within the Darfur borders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811417302">14</xref>(p113)</sup> Food production is disrupted, livestock attacked, and humanitarian aid blocked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811417302">15</xref></sup> Children being deprived of basic needs suffer from acute malnutrition (wasting) and chronically malnourished (stunting). In 2004, the World Health Organization stated that up to 70 000 of the displaced individuals in Darfur died as a result of the condition in which they were living, including those in the camps. In 2007, acute malnutrition rates in Darfur rose above the emergency level, reaching 16.1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811417302">16</xref></sup> In addition, Internal Displacement Camps are reporting reductions in the availability of clean, potable water. With poor sanitation and food insecurity, disease and death consume the camps.</p>
<p>The devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010 demonstrates the correlation between the impact of natural disasters on internal displacement and health. At the peak of displacement, some 2.3 million people were living away from their former homes. Today, 1.5 million people remain in spontaneous settlements. Most of the displaced are in settlements in and around Port-au-Prince. It is estimated that there were more than 200 000 deaths. The devastation from the earthquake was followed by the cholera epidemic, which compounded the recovering and rebuilding. As of the spring of 2011 more than 300 000 people have contracted the disease and more than 5234 have died.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811417302">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Sexual Violence and Rape</title>
<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo has suffered through 2 wars since 1996. In addition to the grotesque human right violations that deprive children of life’s basic needs, sexual violence, rape, and sex trafficking are also evident.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811417302">18</xref></sup> This sexual violence against women and girls has been a particularly heinous pattern of abuse and torture with more than 42 000 women and girls experiencing rape and sexual slavery since the beginning of the second war in August 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811417302">19</xref></sup> In the South Kivu province alone, 27 000 sexual assaults were officially reported in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811417302">20</xref></sup> These atrocities have numerous physical and mental health implications for the women and young girls. Health problems include HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, sterility, sexually transmitted infections, and gynecological complications such as fistulas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811417302">21</xref></sup> Other intentional consequences of this sexual violence are the humiliation and alienation from families and communities, and/or unwanted pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811417302">22</xref></sup> Machel states, “These forms of sexual attack and exploitation were dismissed as the inevitable side-effects of armed conflict. A more accurate view is that sexual attacks and exploitation are systematic during armed conflict to humiliate and terrorize”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811417302">22</xref>(p19)</sup> In a momentous step forward, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1820 in June of 2008 classifying rape as a weapon of war. The resolution reiterates the status of sexual violence as a war crime, a crime against humanity, a form of torture, and a constituent act of genocide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811417302">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Child trafficking is a fast-growing crime in the world and is second only to the criminal drug trade. Globally, an estimated 1.2 million children are trafficked each year, and 95% of victims experienced physical or sexual violence during trafficking. Trafficking is estimated to generate more than $12 billion per year. The average age of entry for children victimized by the sex trade is 12 years. There are 161 countries that have reported to being affected by human trafficking either by being a source and/or country of destination. It has been estimated that there are up to 17 500 foreign nationals trafficked into the United States each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811417302">24</xref></sup> The majority of trafficking victims are between 18 and 24 years of age. In 2002, The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography was ratified because of the growing concern at the significant increase in international trafficking of children. It stipulates that “State parties must fully cover children in its criminal law, independent of offences committed domestically or transnational for the sale of children for: sexual exploitation, transfer of organs of the child for profit, engagement of the child in forced labor.”</p>

<title>Child Soldiers</title>
<p>On the west coast of Africa another civil war continued for more than a decade from 1991 to 2002 in the country of Sierra Leone. It is estimated to have claimed 250 000 lives and displaced 1.3 million persons rendering half the country homeless with a large number of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811417302">25</xref></sup> The war began with the Revolutionary United Front rebels, funded by Libya and entering from Liberia with the intent of overthrowing the government of the All People’s Congress. As the civil war raged on, the abduction of children from their families and community became a recruitment strategy used by both the rebels and the government. It has been estimated that more than 10 000 child combatants participated in the conflict on either side of the civil war and that half of the Revolutionary United Front combatants were between 8 and 14 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811417302">26</xref></sup> These child soldiers were exposed to physical, emotional, and mental abuse and were forced to commit heinous acts against the enemy and civilians.</p>
<p>Children as young as 6 years were abducted and forced to participate in the war as combatants. In addition, the child soldiers were tortured, brainwashed, drugged, and forced to commit atrocities such as brutal indiscriminant killings and the maiming of the enemy through amputations. It has been estimated that more than 400 000 people survived limb amputations thus becoming the symbol of the Sierra Leone conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811417302">27</xref></sup> Girls were often recruited as sex slaves, which frequently lead to HIV/AIDS infection and transmission of other sexually transmitted infections. Richard Wilson described his experience in a child soldier demobilization camp, “We meet a group of boys, mostly 13-16 years old, who were kidnapped by the rebels when they were 8 years old and put in the front line as cannon fodder against government troops.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922811417302">28</xref></sup> The extreme brutality experienced, witnessed, and committed by these young child combatants has dire consequences on their growth and development, such as the loss of self, difficulty reintegrating into one’s family and/or community, posttraumatic stress, and antisocial and violent behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811417302">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Serving Children: Pediatrics in Action</title>
<p>There are hundreds of organizations both large and small that provide an opportunity for pediatricians to participate in global pediatrics. In part, these efforts are driven by a commitment to care for the vulnerable children and youth in developing countries. In addition, this commitment is motivation by an appreciation of International Children’s Rights and the need to alleviate the suffering of those whose rights have been neglected or denied. This section will highlight 2 of the better known organizations that provide pediatric care for vulnerable children based on the principles of human rights and social justice.</p>
<sec id="section11-0009922811417302">
<title>Partners in Health</title>
<p>Partners in Health (PIH) originated in Haiti with the establishment of a community-based health project known as Zanmi Lasante (“Partners in Health”). PIH is a well-known nonprofit organization founded by Dr Paul Farmer in 1987 and is dedicated to providing care to the poor and vulnerable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811417302">29</xref></sup> PIH uses an approach that incorporates public health principles of prevention with the practice of medicine to maximize the chance of recovery and minimize the chance of recurrence or complications. The organization embraces the concept of health care as an essential human right.</p>
<p>Initially dedicated to the treatment of HIV/AIDS in rural Haiti, the organization has broadened it vision to a more holistic approach that addresses the social determinants of disease by providing food, potable water, education, and housing to sick patients. Empowerment is also one of the underpinning principles of PIH with its commitment to hiring and training people who live in the communities where the organization works. Of the nearly 15 000 employees working for PIH, fewer than 150 are American. In 1993, Dr Farmer founded the Institute for Health and Social Justice to promote the research and community based efforts that are dedicated to promoting the principles of health equity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811417302">30</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-0009922811417302">
<title>Doctors Without Borders</title>
<p>Doctors Without Borders or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is an international medical humanitarian organization that was created in France in 1971.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922811417302">31</xref></sup> Today, MSF provides aid in nearly 60 countries to people whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe from either armed conflict or natural disasters. MSF brings attention to neglected crises and advocates for improved medical treatments for those who are affected. The organization has more than 22 000 committed individuals working in 45 countries. The staff includes doctors, nurses, logistics experts, administrators, epidemiologists, laboratory technicians, mental health professionals, and others who work together in accordance with MSF’s guiding principles of humanitarian action and medical ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811417302">32</xref></sup> Similar to PIH, the vast majority of MSF’s workers are from the communities where the crises are occurring.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>As clinicians, pediatricians need to be cognizant of the how the principles of equity, social justice, and children’s rights help to inform and guide us as we strive for the health and well being of all children. Children of the world are frequently the most vulnerable global citizens facing poverty, displacement, and lack of life’s basic necessities. An awareness of international children’s rights can serve as a catalyst for working toward the ultimate dream that all children have the right to be raised in a warm and loving family as part of the global community where health and well-being is realized. To that end, the American Academy of Pediatrics has a number of valuable resources designed to promote a better understanding of international children’s rights. These include the Community Pediatric Section’s Children’s Rights Curriculum dedicated to increasing awareness of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Children and the relationship between public policy, advocacy, and children’s health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922811417302">33</xref></sup> In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on International Child Health is committed to improving the health and well-being of the world’s children through education, advocacy, research, and the delivery of health services and the creation of effective global partnerships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922811417302">34</xref></sup></p>
