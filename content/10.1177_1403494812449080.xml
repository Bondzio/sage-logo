<title>Background</title>
<p>The primary purpose of preventive child health care (PCHC) by general practitioners (GPs) in Denmark is to help ensure a healthy childhood and to create preconditions for a healthy adult life. Children between birth and 5 years of age are offered seven visits free of charge − three in the first year of life and one each at the ages of 2, 3, 4, and 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449080">1</xref>]. The PCHC focuses on the individual child’s physical, mental, and social development as well as on the interaction between parent, child, and GP and also on immunisations which are offered at the PCHC at the ages of 5 and 12 months and 4 and 5 years. An evaluation of the PCHC has shown lower levels of participation by children from socially disadvantaged families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449080">2</xref>]. The effect of the PCHC on use of healthcare services is not well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449080">3</xref>]. The PCHC focuses on individual needs and one of its key outcomes could be to help ensure that children in disadvantaged families obtain the best possible health care, and health in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449080">4</xref>].</p>
<p>In Denmark, the healthcare system is divided into primary health care, provided by GPs, and secondary health care, based either at hospitals or by specialists working outside hospitals. The specialists working outside the hospital are privately functioning entities. Access to specialist care is free in Denmark, both at the hospital and at the private functioning entities, but usually requires a referral from the GP, except for ear, nose, and throat and eye specialities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449080">5</xref>]. Previous studies of the use of specialist care in Denmark have shown that children in families with low income and low education have fewer contacts with specialist care and that income is a significant predictor of its use by adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449080">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449080"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449080">8</xref>]. A Danish study has shown that social inequality is only present when studying visits to private practising specialist and does not exist for visits to hospitals. Therefore, this paper only concentrates on this social gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449080">9</xref>]. For children, most specialist care is provided by specialist working outside the hospitals within the fields of dermatology, ear, nose, and throat, and paediatrics. We hypothesise that participation in PCHC diminishes the inequality in use of specialist health care outside the hospital sector. The mediating factors could be improved GP−parent−child relationships, increased self- efficacy by parents in relation to handling sick children, and increased understanding of the children’s development and of the wider healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449080">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449080">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449080"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812449080">15</xref>]. Furthermore participation in the PCHC can affect morbidity through prevention of disease and detection of chronic illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449080">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449080">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812449080">17</xref>]. It is likely that these effects would be higher in the lowest socioeconomic groups where the accumulation of risk factors and morbidity is greater. The relationship between participation in PCHC and later use of specialised care outside the hospital system may, according to the literature, be confounded by characteristics of the child including sex, parity, and country of origin as well as by general health status which might affect both participation in PCHC and use of specialist care (i.e. exposure and outcome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449080">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449080">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449080"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449080">23</xref>]. Furthermore, characteristics of the family including parents’ income, education, occupation status and marital status, and age of mother as well as characteristics of the GP (age or gender) and area of residence (supply of health care) could influence both participation in and use of health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449080">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449080">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449080">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449080">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449080">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812449080">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812449080"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812449080"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449080">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494812449080">
<title>Definition of the study cohort</title>
<p>The study cohort consisted of 68,366 children registered in the Danish Civil Register as born in 1999. Children who died during the data collection period were excluded (<italic>n</italic>=93) as were children not living in Denmark during the full data collection period, i.e. from 2002 to 2006 (<italic>n</italic>=3317). Also excluded were children not satisfying the criterion of independence across observations (<italic>n</italic>=1247), i.e. we kept data on only one of twins or triplets and on one of the children in families with more than one child born in 1999. Finally, we excluded children who did not live with either of their parents (<italic>n</italic>=495) i.e. institutionalised children. After these exclusions, the final cohort consisted of 63,214 children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812449080">
<title>Exposure variable</title>
<p>Participation in the PCHC at 3, 4, and 5 years of age were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service Registry for the period from 2002 to 2005. This ensured that all the PCHC visits were included independently of when in 1999 the children were born. If it was registered that a child had participated more than once in one of the PCHC visits, this was viewed as a registration error and only one visit was counted. Hence the children could participate in a maximum of three visits and a minimum of zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494812449080">
<title>Outcome variable</title>
<p>Contacts with specialists was defined as a first contact with any practitioner practising outside the hospitals within the specialties of anaesthesiology, venereology and dermatology, rheumatology, gynaecology and obstetrics, internal medicine, surgery, clinical biochemistry, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, ear, nose, and throat, plastic surgery, psychiatry, paediatrics, child and youth psychiatry, and tropical medicine (this includes all specialities with private practitioners in Denmark). All first contacts in 2006, i.e. in the year after the last PCHC visit, were added for each child. Data were obtained from the National Health Service Register.</p>

<title>Confounder variables</title>
<sec id="section7-1403494812449080">
<title>Characteristics of the child</title>
<p>The data include information on the child’s sex and birth number. Birth number was defined using the mother’s parity, thus half-siblings on the father’s side and non-biological siblings were not included. Country of origin was defined according to the following criteria used by Statistics Denmark:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494812449080" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If neither of the parents was known, the child’s country of origin was defined according to the child’s own information; it was assumed that the country of origin was the country of birth if the person was an immigrant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If only one parent was known, the country of origin was defined as that of this parent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If both parents were known, the country of origin was defined as that of the mother.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In accordance with the definition provided by Statistics Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812449080">30</xref>], the variable country of origin was divided into three groups: Denmark, developed countries, and less developed countries. General health status was described with two variables: (1) the amount of money registered as having been spent on prescribed drugs for the child; and (2) the number of visits to GPs registered in the National Health Insurance Service Registry. To avoid adjusting for intermediary outcome of the PCHC, the health status variables were measured only in 2002 (i.e. before exposure).</p>

<p>Equivalent income was defined as disposable income weighted by the number of children and adults in the family according to the formula provided by Statistics Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1403494812449080">31</xref>]:</p>

<p>Equivalent disposable income was obtained from 2002 to 2005 and the average for the period was used. Education level was available for both the adult female and male with whom the child lived in 2006. Occupational status of the parents was assessed in the period from 2002 to 2005 counting a working single parent as equal to two parents with employment. Marital status was assessed in the period from 2002 to 2005. Mother’s age at birth of the child was calculated by subtracting the biological mother’s year of birth from 1999.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494812449080">
<title>Characteristics of the child’s GP and the GP’s medical context</title>
<p>All variables related to the child’s GP and specialist doctors were measured in 2005. Data about the GP practice that the child was assigned to included information about the average age of the GPs, proportion of female GPs, number of GPs, and proportion of children in the practice population. The Density of the GPs was measured in two ways: numbers of GPs per km<sup>2</sup> in the municipality and the number of GPs per 10,000 inhabitants in the municipality. Density of specialists was measured in the same way as for GPs using information about the number of practising specialists provided by the Danish Regions. To account for possible geographical differences in treatment caused by differences in culture or structure of the healthcare system, the county of the GP was included.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812449080">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>To assess the dependence of PCHC participation on the number of contacts with a specialist, a multilevel Poisson regression model was used. The multilevel model was used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data in which the same GP refers different children to specialist care. This results in an association between numbers of contacts with a specialist for children referred by the same GP. If this association is not accounted for in the model, the statistical inference will be invalid. In the model, the GPs were at the highest level and the children at the lowest level. Furthermore, this model allowed us to assess the exposure while taking into account measured confounders as well as a general effect of differences attributable to the GP.</p>
<p>A stepwise backward model search was used to eliminate variables that did not contribute to explaining the number of contacts with a specialist. Because of the large sample of more than 60,000 children, a significance level of 1% was used. Only interactions between PCHC participation and socioeconomic factors were tested. Data were analysed using the statistical software Stata version 10.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812449080">Table II</xref> shows some key descriptive statistics of the dependent variable and the exposure variable. Of the total cohort, 58.3% participated in all of the PCHC offered to children in the age group with the highest participation rate for the visits offered at the age of 5 (84.1%) and 25% had one or more contacts with a specialist during the year of follow up. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812449080">Table II</xref> further shows that an increase in participation rate was associated with an increase in the average number of contacts with a specialist practising outside the hospitals. In addition, participation in the individual 3, 4, or 5 year PCHC visits was associated with a significantly higher average number of contacts with a specialist practising outside the hospitals.</p>

<p>The results of the multilevel analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812449080">Table III</xref>, where the relative risks compared to the reference group are shown for each included variable in the model. We present the results only from the final model after elimination of insignificant explanatory variables. The primary finding was the significant interaction between equivalent disposable income and participation in PCHC, which is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812449080">Figure 1</xref>. The final model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812449080">Table III</xref> also shows that the mother’s first child had more contacts with specialists practising outside the hospitals than succeeding children and that there were positive associations between both GP visits and medication used and the number of contacts with a specialist. With regard to education, the analyses showed that children not living with their mother and those living with a mother with a Masters degree had fewer contacts with specialists practising outside the hospitals. Additionally, the analysis showed that children living in the capital Copenhagen or in Frederiksborg (an affluent area close to Copenhagen) had more contacts with specialists than did those from other areas of Denmark.</p>

It shows that the social inequality in specialist care was removed when participating in one visit compared with none. For children in families with an equivalent disposable income lower than 100,000 DKr per year, the relative risk increased substantially (from 1 to 1.76) if the child participated in one PCHC visits compared to those who participated in none. In contrast, the relative risk only increased from 1.32 to 1.75 for children in families with an equivalent income between 100,000 and 149,999 DKr per year. For the income group between 150,000 and 199,999 DKr, a slight decline was seen, from a RR of 2.01 to 1.93.

In the lowest income group, the RR increased from 1 to 1.76 when children participated in one PCHC visit as opposed to none. In comparison, the increase in RR was only from 1.32 to 1.75 for the children in the second lowest income group, and for the other intermediary income group, a slight decline was seen, from a RR of 2.01 to 1.93. The present study showed that the children had a high participation rate in the PCHC, which is in accordance with the previously mentioned evaluation of the PCHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449080">2</xref>]. The high participation rate indicates that parents find the PCHC important. The 5-year visits had the highest participation rate, which is probably due to immunisation being offered at this visit. It is also the last visit offered to the children and the families. Children in families with low equivalent income had a lower probability of contact with specialists practising outside the hospitals compared to those in families with higher equivalent income. No significant difference was found for education. Halldórsson et al. found, in contrast to these findings, that the mother’s education influenced the use of specialist care and that low education level was associated with low use of specialist care, whereas income was not significantly related to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449080">7</xref>]. Differences in design, and items included in the two studies, may explain some of this difference: the results were based on cross-sectional data of 3000 Danish children between 2 and 17 years of age. The education variable was divided into fewer groups than in this study and need for health care was adjusted for with the inclusion of chronic diseases in the model. Furthermore, changes in utilisation patterns over time could affect the association. We believe that our study is generally more sensitive due to our large cohort of children, the many confounding variables included in the analysis, and the separate measurement of exposure and outcome variables. On the other hand, our quantification of the children’s health status as a proxy for healthcare needs could be criticised for not measuring the need of children who are not in contact with the healthcare system − most often those in socially disadvantaged families − thereby underestimating the need of this group in particular.</p>
<sec id="section13-1403494812449080">
<title>Is utilisation of specialist care an appropriate outcome measure and is a higher utilisation rate better?</title>
<p>It may be debated whether utilisation of specialist care is the most appropriate outcome measure, since the primary purpose of PCHC is not to increase its use. The measurement was chosen for the current study based on previous knowledge of inequalities in utilisation across socioeconomic groups and based on the hypothesis that the PCHC might minimise this gap. If the aim had been to evaluate the total effect of the PCHC, including long-term consequences, this evaluation should also include assessment of the children’s physical, mental, and social wellbeing after PCHC as well as further in the future.</p>
<p>The finding that participation in PCHC increases use of specialist care poses the questions, is more use of specialist care desirable? and could this be considered excess use? In the analysis that was adjusted for health status, it was found that children from low-income families who did not participate in PCHC had a lower risk of contact with a specialist compared to those in higher income families. This indicates that, for their level of health, they underutilise specialists. The equal probability of contact with a specialist when participating in all three PCHC visits should therefore not be seen as excess use, rather as a narrowing of the utilisation gap between the income groups. With the present analysis and the health status variable used as a proxy for need for health care, it is not possible for us to assess whether there is overutilisation of specialist care according to need in Denmark. For this to be done, we would require a much more sensitive need variable. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of the contacts with the specialists should be ensured by the need for a referral based on an objective examination by the GP, which is necessary to gain access to most specialities. This assumption can of course be questioned, since referrals are given in an interaction between the patient and the GP which is influenced by various factors including the social status of the patient, the patient’s communication skills, and the relationship between the patient and the GP. In the long run, we would expect that participation in PCHC reduces morbidity of the children and therefore decreases uptake of health care. Since we were not able to include possible mediating factors in the analysis, the present study does not reveal the reason why children who participate in PCHC also have more contacts with specialists.</p>

<title>Methodological issues</title>
<p>Because this study had both exposure and outcome as utilisation of healthcare services, it naturally poses the question of whether the positive effect of the PCHC on the use of specialist care is only an effect of differences in utilisation patterns or a real effect of participating in the PCHC. Other studies have used a utilisation variable to control for this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449080">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812449080">24</xref>]. In this study, one of the health status variables was visits to GPs prior to the measurement of exposure and outcome, and utilisation pattern could therefore be said to be controlled for. A more relevant control variable may have been the parents’ use of healthcare services, which may better reflect differences in utilisation patterns across families. The association between participation in PCHC and the use of specialist care was additionally controlled for differences in education, country of origin, income, mother’s age at birth, and the GP’s place of residence, which could be proposed as factors that may affect utilisation of healthcare services. This means that, if what is seen is caused only by differences in healthcare utilisation patterns, these should be related to factors other than the ones already controlled for, such as psychological differences which affect help seeking behaviour or presence of disease (i.e. need for health care which is not captured by the health status variables). On the other hand, the many variables included in this analysis ensure that there is only a minimum of residual confounding of factors related to propensity to seek health care.</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are the use of register-based data of high quality and the use of multilevel analyses to account for the hierarchical structure of data, as well as the many control variables that were included in the analysis. To reduce the risk of a type I error, we chose a significance level of 1%, and to further validate the results, we reran the analyses with the income variable regrouped into quartiles and found the same significant result. The analyses were controlled for the child’s health status as proxy for need for health care, which is seldom done. However, the variables used to control for need can be criticised for not being an adequate reflection of the children’s true need for specialist health care. Children who have previously used prescribed medication or have had a large number of contacts with a GP need not be the ones needing specialist medical care later in life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ensuring participation in all preventive child health care available from GPs can potentially reduce the gap in utilisation of specialist health care that exists between children in high- and low-income families.</p>
