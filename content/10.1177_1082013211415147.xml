<p>Effects of active modified atmosphere packaging (initial O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>: 5/5; 30/5; and 80/0) and passive packaging [initial O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>: 20.8/0 (air)] on the antioxidant capacity and sensory quality of fresh-cut ‘Yaoshan’ pear stored at 4 °C for 12 days were investigated. Samples stored in high O<sub>2</sub> (30% and 80%) packages had higher phenolics and anthocyanin contents compared with those in passive and low O<sub>2</sub> packages. After 12 days of storage, phenolics and anthocyanin contents of 80% O<sub>2</sub> samples were 2.5 and 12 times, respectively, higher than those in the passive package and 3 and 2 times higher than those in low O<sub>2</sub> package. High O<sub>2</sub> modified atmosphere packaging was effective in keeping free radical scavenging capacity as measured by the DPPH assay. The sensory evaluation indicated that surface color of cut fruits were stable for at least 12 days in the high O<sub>2</sub> modified atmosphere packaging. The results suggested that high O<sub>2</sub> modified atmosphere packaging could be used to inhibit browning and prolong the shelf life of fresh-cut ‘Yaoshan’ pears in spite of more than 50% loss in vitamin C content.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211415147" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Antioxidant constituents in fresh fruits have become the research focus in the recent years due to increasing awareness of their health benefits such as prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211415147">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). In the meantime, consumption of fresh-cut fruits has increased due to demand for fresh, healthy, convenient, and additive-free prepared produce items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211415147">Rico et al., 2007</xref>). Among many fruits, peeled ready to eat pear has drawn the attention of food industry and research as a novel minimally processed product.</p>
<p>Pear, a good source of antioxidant compounds such as phenolic, anthocyanin, and vitamin C, is a popular and commercially important cultivar which served as the main fresh-cut fruit item. Similar to other fresh-cut produces, processing operations could cause undesirable changes in fresh color, appearance, and nutrition throughout the storage. Enzymatic browning, degradation and oxidation of pigments, water loss, whitening, and surface dehydration are likely to occur as a consequence of wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415147">Rojas-Grau et al., 2009</xref>). During cutting, phenolic compounds were released from cells due to loss of compartmentalization while internal tissues expose to air (oxygen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211415147">Amiot et al., 1995</xref>). Tissue browning in sliced pear catalyzed by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is result of the reaction of phenolic compounds with oxygen.</p>
<p>Abundant chemical and physical preservation techniques, including anti-browning treatment (calcium chloride, ascorbic acid), edible coating, mild heat treatment, high carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) treatment, elevated O<sub>2</sub> pretreatment, and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) flushed with N<sub>2</sub>, were applied to inhibit enzymatic browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211415147">Chung and Moon, 2009</xref>) and tissue softening after processing. CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched atmospheres (5–10%) combined with exiguous O<sub>2</sub> (1–5%) have been proved to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut fruit by reducing respiration, ethylene production, and inhibiting fruit tissue softening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211415147">Gorny et al., 2002</xref>). Most methods for controlling cut-surface browning have focused on theoretical approaches to modulate PPO enzyme activities. However, low O<sub>2</sub> or high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres could not effectively prevent enzyme browning of fresh-cut fruits, such as apple or pear, due to their high phenolic content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415147">Rojas-Grau et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, the application of elevated O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres (&gt;70 kPa O<sub>2</sub>) has been proposed as an alternative to low O<sub>2</sub> condition to prevent undesired anoxic respirative processes and maintain the fresh-like quality of fresh-cut fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415147">Rojas-Grau et al., 2009</xref>). In previous work, high O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere was proved to be an effective way to prevent enzymatic discoloration, inhibit anaerobic fermentation reactions, and decrease aerobic and anaerobic microbial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211415147">Day, 1996</xref>). Nevertheless, the effects of high O<sub>2</sub> active packaging on antioxidant properties and related enzymatic activity of fresh-cut pears have not been demonstrated. Studies on the impact of MAP on the shelf life of fresh-cut pears have always focused on the sensory quality of the products. Research studies on the influence of packaging condition, especially high O<sub>2</sub> packaging, on antioxidant capacities of fresh-cut pears is still limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of high O<sub>2</sub> active packaging, low O<sub>2</sub> and passively packaging on phenolic, vitamin C, antioxidant capacity, and sensory quality of fresh-cut ‘Yaoshan’ pears stored at 4 °C for 12 days.</p>

<p>Pears (<italic>Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd</italic> cv. Yaoshan) with a pH of 4.5, soluble solids content of 15 °Brix, titratable acidity of 0.29 g citric acid/100 g were picked from a commercial orchard from Jianghua, Hunan province, China, and transported to the laboratory of Tianjin University of Science and Technology by air. The fruits were then placed in a cold room at 0 °C for 24 h for precooling.</p>
<p>The next day, the pears were washed with tap water and sanitized in 250 mg/L NaClO solution for 2 min at 4 °C, rinsed with tap water. Pears were peeled by a sharp stainless steel knife and the core tissue was removed. The remaining flesh was cut into eight wedges. The pear pieces were then dipped into a chemical solution (0.5% ascorbic acid, 2% CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.75% cysteine) for 2 min and were drained.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1082013211415147"><title>Packaging of pear slices and storage</title>
<p>Pear slices (100 g) were randomly packaged in polypropylene film bags (30 × 20 cm<sup>2</sup>, 70 µm thickness). According to the supplier, film permeability to O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> were 5.2 × 10<sup>−13 </sup>mol O<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup> s Pa and 2.4 × 10<sup>−12 </sup>mol CO<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup> s Pa, respectively, at 23 °C and 0% relative humidity (RH). The active modification of package atmosphere was carried out by flushing film bags with following gas mixtures (kPa O<sub>2</sub>/kPa CO<sub>2</sub>/kPa N<sub>2</sub>): T1, 5/5/90; T2, 30/5/65; and T3, 80/0/20. Then, these packaging were sealed using a digitally controlled compensated vacuum packaging machine (Model DZ400/2D, Packaging Engineering Ltd., Wenzhou, China). The samples sealed in the bag with the gas mixture of approximately 21 kPa O<sub>2</sub>/0 kPa CO<sub>2</sub>/79 kPa N<sub>2</sub> (air) were served as control (CK). The samples were stored at 4 °C, 95% RH for 12 days. The O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gas compositions of the package headspace were determined using a O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> meter (Model Checkpoint, PBI-Dansensor A/S, Danish) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.</p>
<p>Extraction methods for determination of total phenolic, anthocyanin content, and antioxidant activity (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)).</p>
<p>Flesh tissues taken from the pear slices were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The frozen tissues were crushed into coarse pieces, and 80 g samples were homogenized for 10 min with 500 mL of 80/20 acetone/water using a commercial blender (Black and Decker, 626 Hanover Pike Hampstead, MD, USA). The homogenate was filtered through Whatman no. 1 paper. The filtrate was recovered and the acetone was evaporated off by a rotary evaporator (Model 78820-00, Labconco, Kansas City, MO) at 45 °C. The residues were then brought to 10 mL with deionized water, divided into several aliquots, and kept frozen at −80 °C until analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211415147"><title>Total phenolic content measurement</title>
<p>The total phenolic content was measured using the Folin–Ciocalteu procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211415147">Antunes et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, pear tissues (8 g) were extracted with 80 mL of 80% methanol, and centrifuged at 8000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (1 mL) were added with 1.5 mL of the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. After 10 min, 10 mL of 7.5% Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution was added into the mixture. Then, the absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer ((Model DU–7400 UV–vis, Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA) at 765 nm after 90 min at room temperature in dark. The total phenolic content was determined by comparison with the absorbance of gallic acid, and total phenolic were expressed as mg/100 g of fresh fruit weight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211415147"><title>The total anthocyanin concentration measurement.</title>
<p>The total anthocyanin concentration of the peel extracts was determined using a modified pH differential method described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211415147">Wolfe et al. (2003)</xref>. A spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter DU – 7400 UV–vis Spectrophotometer) was used to measure absorbance at 510 and 700 nm in buffers at pH 1.0 and 4.5. Absorbance readings were converted to mg cyanidin 3-glucoside, using the molar extinction coefficient of 26,900 and absorbance of <italic>A</italic> = [(A510–A700) pH 1.0 – (A510–A700) pH4.5] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211415147">Meyers et al., 2003</xref>). Total anthocyanin was expressed as cyanidin 3-glucoside on a fresh weight basis, g/kg.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211415147"><title>Antioxidant capacity (DPPH) measurement</title>
<p>The radical scavenging activity of methanol extract of pear tissues was determined using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211415147">Larrauri et al. (1998)</xref>. Briefly, 5 mL of 0.1 mmol/L DPPH-methanol solution was added with 10 mL of methanol extract. After the solution was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in darkness, the decrease in the absorbance at 517 nm was measured. The control contained methanol instead of the methanol extract, while the blank contained methanol instead of DPPH solution. The inhibition of DPPH radicals by the samples was calculated according to the following formula

<sec id="sec10-1082013211415147"><title>Vitamin C measurement</title>
<p>The vitamin C content in fresh-cut pear was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) with ultraviolet detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211415147">Odriozola-Serrano et al., 2007</xref>). The frozen flesh tissues were crushed into coarse pieces, and 10 g samples were homogenized with 100 mL of buffer (2% metaphosphoric acid containing 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) using a Waring commercial blender for 3 min. The slurry was centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C and was passed through a Millipore 0.45 µm membrane filter (Millex-HN Nylon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and injected into the HPLC system. The HPLC system was equipped with a Varian 325-LC UV Detector (Varian Inc. Palo Alto, CA) working at 245 nm and a reverse-phase C18 Varian HPLC column (250 × 4.6 mm<sup>2</sup>; Varian) was used. A 0.01% solution of sulfuric acid, adjusted to pH 2.6, was used as the mobile phase. The ﬂow rate was ﬁxed at 1 mL/min at room temperature. Results were expressed as vitamin C on a fresh weight basis, mg/kg.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1082013211415147"><title>Color attributes measurement</title>
<p>Color of fresh-cut pear was determined with a Minolta CR-400 Chroma meter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan), equipped with a D65 light source and the observer at 10 and calibrated using a standard white plate.</p>
<p>Five fruit pieces were evaluated for each package condition. Three readings were obtained for each replicate by changing the position of the pear wedges in the optical glass cell to get uniform color measurements. Color values of CIE <italic>L*</italic> (lightness), <italic>a*</italic> (red–green), and <italic>b*</italic> (yellow–blue) were determined through reflectance values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211415147"><title>Overall visual quality measurement</title>
<p>The overall visual quality (OVQ) evaluation method was determined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211415147">Aguayo et al. (2010)</xref>. A group of five people was trained to recognize and score the quality attributes of 10 of pear slices in each treatment. All assessments were compared to slices freshly cut from whole air-stored pear of the same variety and purchase data. Appearance, taste, and texture were scored on a nine-point hedonic scale where 1 = complete soft to 9 = fully characteristic of fresh. A similar scale, where 1 = inedible, 3 = poor, 5 = fair (limit of marketability), 7 = good, and 9 = excellent was used for the evaluation of the overall acceptability. Only overall acceptability data are presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1082013211415147"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Experiments were performed in triplicate on different treatments, and each replicate had 10 bags. SPSS 13.0 software (Statistical Systems, Kaysville, UT) was used for data analysis. Data on quality parameters were analyzed by multifactor analysis of variance, and a Duncan’s multiple range test was applied to determine differences among means, with a signiﬁcance level of 0.05.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1082013211415147"><title>Changes in headspace gas composition</title>
<p>A modified atmosphere was created inside film bags as a result of film’s restriction on gas diffusion and fruit’s respiration. The changes in partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in package headspace during storage of fresh-cut pears stored under different modified atmospheres are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211415147">Figure 1</xref>. A decline in O<sub>2</sub> levels and a rise in the CO<sub>2</sub> levels were observed in all samples. The O<sub>2</sub> levels inside high O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (80%) packages linearly decreased during storage to approximately 55% on day 12. The O<sub>2</sub> levels in 5% O<sub>2</sub> + 5% CO<sub>2</sub> fell below 1% on day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211415147">Figure 1</xref>), a level that could result in anaerobic respiration. On the other hand, the CO<sub>2</sub> levels continuously increased inside all packages exceeding 10% on day 12. The CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the air package (passive MAP) increased more rapidly than those in other packages, reaching more than 25% on day 6 and 55% on day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211415147">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Fruit respiration rate is influenced by several factors, among which temperature and oxygen partial pressure show great effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211415147">Fonseca et al., 2002</xref>). Also, the respiratory quotient (RQ = <italic>R</italic><sub>CO2</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>O2</sub>, rates of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> uptakes) for aerobic respiration of fresh-cut ‘Yaoshan’ pear in the control package with air stored at 4 °C was higher than 1.3 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211415147">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211415147">2</xref>), in accordance with the usage of organic acids as major respiratory substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211415147">Fonseca et al., 2002</xref>). It was reported that RQ values for ‘Bartlett’ pear changed from 0.8 at the initial climacteric to 1.4 at fully ripe stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211415147">Biale, 1950</xref>). RQ for ‘Conference’ pear slices above 1.7 after 1 day following processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211415147">Soliva-Fortuny et al., 2007</xref>) is generally an indicative of a switch to fermentative reactions.

<p>Our results suggested that high O<sub>2</sub> reduced respiration (CO<sub>2</sub> production) compared to the passive MAP. High O<sub>2</sub> could accelerate, have no effect on, or depress respiration rates, depending on the maturity and ripeness stage, storage temperature, as well as CO<sub>2</sub> and ethylene concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211415147">Kader and Ben-Yehoshua, 2000</xref>). For the reduction of respiration rate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211415147">Barker and Mapson (1955)</xref> suggested that high O<sub>2</sub> concentration blocks the tricarboxylic acid cycle between citrate and α-ketoglutarate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211415147">Escalona et al. (2006)</xref> suggested a decrease in the respiration rates may be due to intracellular pH change and consequential changes in the enzymatic activity of the respiratory pathways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1082013211415147"><title>Total phenolic content</title>
<p>The initial level of total phenolic content in untreated slices prior to storage was approximately 80 mg/100 g and high O<sub>2</sub> active packaging tended to reduce the loss of total phenolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211415147">Figure 2</xref>). After 6 days of storage, there was a significant decrease of the total phenolic contents in the low O<sub>2</sub>-treated fruits (51%) and the control (32%), a moderate reduction in the high O<sub>2</sub> (80%) treated samples (12.4%).</p>
<p>Our results suggested that high O<sub>2</sub> reduced the loss of phenolic compounds, which was similar to previous reports on some fruits kept under 60–100% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211415147">Yang et al., 2005</xref>), but contradictable to the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211415147">Oms-Oliu et al. (2008)</xref> who found that high O<sub>2</sub> caused a greater degradation of the major phenolic acids of fresh-cut pears than under oxygen-restrictive surroundings. Our study also showed that the amount of total phenolic in pear slices dramatically decreased during low O<sub>2</sub> storage, and were the lowest among the treatments, which contradicts to many earlier studies. It was also found that low O<sub>2</sub> can restrain the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in fresh-cut fruits, which are considered as a response to cutting injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211415147">Artes et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211415147">Cocci et al. (2006)</xref> observed that the fresh-cut apple slices exposed to low O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres (5 kPa O<sub>2</sub> + 5 kPa CO<sub>2</sub>) led to the preservation of phenolic compounds in comparison to air. Therefore, the reduction of phenolic in fresh-cut products could depend not only on the O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels inside packages, but also on fruit varieties. For the ‘Yaoshan’ pear, high O<sub>2</sub> was more effective on maintaining the phenolic concentration compared with low O<sub>2</sub> packaging.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1082013211415147"><title>Total anthocyanin content</title>
<p>The anthocyanin concentration were reduced during storage for all samples and declined with increasing browning index (data not shown). The total anthocyanin value exhibited a similar pattern of change as did the total phenolic during storage in response to high O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013211415147">Figure 3</xref>). While the total anthocyanin level in all samples showed a decrease during storage, the fruit stored under high O<sub>2</sub> packaging had a higher anthocyanin content compared with other fruits. Signiﬁcantly higher levels of anthocyanin level was detected in 80% O<sub>2</sub>-packaged fruit when compared to 30% O<sub>2</sub>-treated slices on day 6 of storage. However, no signiﬁcant differences in total anthocyanin content were found between the two samples at the end of the storage.

<p>The inhibitory effect of high O<sub>2</sub> on the loss of anthocyanin could be due to a lower phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211415147">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>), which is an important enzyme in the biosynthesis of phenolic. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211415147">Qu et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that the PAL enzyme activity was decreased associated with the increasing rate of browning index in ‘Huaizhi’ litchi fruit and the reduction in anthocyanin content in pear fruit could be a result of reduction in PAL enzyme activity. High O<sub>2</sub> has been proved to influence changes in anthocyanin content in other fruits such as strawberries. As previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211415147">Perez and Sanz (2001)</xref>, strawberries stored under 80 kPa O<sub>2</sub> + 20 kPa CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of total anthocyanin through the 4 days of storage compared to those stored in air, but remarkably lower content of total anthocyanin were detected at the latter storage period. The above results suggest that the various effects of high O<sub>2</sub> on total anthocyanin, total phenolic, and antioxidant activity may be due to the cultivars, and O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Further investigations on PAL enzyme activity with respect to different concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> would help to explain the retention of anthocyanin content.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1082013211415147"><title>Antioxidant activity (DPPH)</title>
<p>Antioxidant activity was measured using the free radical scavenging activity. DPPH radical scavenging activity of pear tissues tended to decrease during the storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211415147">Figure 4</xref>). The DPPH assay of antioxidant activity of untreated pear slices on day 0 was 42.5%. Changes in antioxidant capacity were significantly affected by the storage atmosphere (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). After 3 days of storage, DPPH decreased more markedly for pear slices packaged in air than those in MA (low O<sub>2</sub>/high CO<sub>2</sub>). Fresh-cut pears exposed to 80% O<sub>2</sub> showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity after 12 days of storage, followed by fruit held in 30% O<sub>2</sub>. The amount of antioxidant capacity in pears stored in high O<sub>2</sub> package was approximately 30%, which was nearly six times higher than the control and low O<sub>2</sub> (5%) treated fruits after 12 days of storage. Moreover, a relatively long shelf life was found in the pear slices under the 30% O<sub>2</sub> + 5% CO<sub>2</sub> treatment at 4 °C, with 24% antioxidant activity after 20 days. In this study, it seemed that a correlation existed between phenolic compounds level and DPPH radical scavenging activity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211415147">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211415147">4</xref>). The decrease of phenolic content resulted in a low DPPH radical scavenging activity, which, in turn, possibly accelerated oxidation of phenolic and tissue browning.

<p>The antioxidant status of the fruit could offer a valuable predictor for the overall pear slice quality. When the processing oxidative stress exceeded the natural antioxidant system’s capacity, it resulted in reactive oxygen species-induced injury and development of disorders such as browning and deterioration in sensory quality. Among the antioxidant compound, the total antioxidant capacity was the major index which has been widely applied for screening antioxidant activity in plant extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211415147">Benjakul et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211415147">Martinez-Sanchez et al. (2006)</xref> have shown a substantial protection in the antioxidant capacity of wild rocket leaves stored under 10 kPa of CO<sub>2</sub> + 5 kPa of O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres in comparison to samples stored under atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> levels. Our results are consistent with others obtained in ‘Flor de Invierno’ pear, <italic>Pyrus communis L</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211415147">Varela et al., 2007</xref>), and the high O<sub>2</sub> packaging could hold the antioxidant activity by restraining the respiration as well as delaying the senecence.</p>
<sec id="sec19-1082013211415147"><title>Vitamin C</title>
<p>Initial vitamin C level in fresh-cut ‘Yaoshan’ pear ranged from 4.5 to 4.8 mg/100 g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1082013211415147">Figure 5</xref>). The vitamin C contents were significantly affected by the packaging atmospheres during storage (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The higher level of O<sub>2</sub> in the package headspace, the higher the loss in vitamin C. The degradation of vitamin C could be extensively related to the O<sub>2</sub> concentrations inside the bags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415147">Soliva-Fortuny et al., 2002</xref>). In our study, the highest decrease in vitamin C was detected in fresh-cut pears stored at 80% O<sub>2</sub> packaging which was consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211415147">Oms-Oliu et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, fresh-cut pears stored under initial 5% O<sub>2</sub> + 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere preserved a relatively high vitamin C level (3.0–4.5 mg/100 g) for 12 days. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415147">Soliva-Fortuny et al. (2002)</xref> suggested that exposure to the absence of O<sub>2</sub> conditions of fresh-cut ‘Conference’ pears could keep the vitamin C at a constant level throughout storage. We observed that low O<sub>2</sub> (T1) packaging significantly slowed down the reduction in vitamin C levels. Low O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres slow vitamin C loss by inhibiting its oxidation. However, some studies reported that high CO<sub>2</sub> (beyond 5 kPa) showed negative effects on vitamin C maintenance of apple slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211415147">Cocci et al., 2006</xref>). High CO<sub>2</sub> could lead to vitamin C loss by accelerating ascorbate peroxidase catalyzed oxidation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211415147">Tudela et al., 2002</xref>). Our results showed that CO<sub>2</sub> levels in all packages increased during storage reaching 10% or higher during later period of storage. The extremly high CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the air package (passive MAP) is probably responsible for the loss of vitamin C in the samples.

<sec id="sec20-1082013211415147"><title>Changes in color parameters</title>
<p>Color is one of the most important visual attributes in many fresh-cut products including cut pears. Cutting, although operated under controlled conditions, usually leads to enzymatic browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211415147">Gorny et al., 2002</xref>). Changes in color parameters <italic>L*</italic> (lightness), <italic>a*</italic> (red–green) and <italic>b*</italic> (−blue to ±yellow) of fresh-cut pears were evaluated at 4 °C throughout 12-day storage. The higher the<italic> L*</italic> value of fresh-cut pear, the brighter is the cutting surface. <italic>L*</italic> values decreased with time of storage. Obviously, after 6 days of storage, samples stored in low O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres showed significantly lower values of <italic>L*</italic> than samples exposed to air (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211415147">Table 1</xref>).

<p>A large and rapid increase in <italic>a*</italic> and <italic>b*</italic> values was observed in the control samples which had the highest <italic>a*</italic> and <italic>b*</italic> values after 12 days compared with that of other packaging treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211415147">Table 1</xref>).

Nevertheless, the low O<sub>2</sub>-treated samples showed the fastest increase in <italic>a*</italic> values during the storage.

<p>Color changes could be attributed to the wound-induced response resulting from peeling and slicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211415147">Siomos et al., 2010</xref>).

<sec id="sec21-1082013211415147"><title>OVQ of fresh-cut pears</title>
<p>OVQ was measured to decide the limit of acceptability of fresh-cut pears from the view of the consumer. Changes in sensory qualities of firmness, juiciness, taste, and visual appearance of the fresh-cut pear slices during 12 days of storage are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211415147">Figure 6</xref>. After treatments, the control showed a decrease in visual appearance during storage. At the end of the storage, the control had an OVQ score of 3.8, indicating the sample was below the limit of marketability. Particularly, the OVQ score (5.5) for the sample in low O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere was lower than those (8.2–8.6) of high O<sub>2</sub> treatments (30% and 80%) after 12 days of storage. In addition, the low O<sub>2</sub> MAP delayed loss of firmness and aroma compared with the control. No significant difference was detected for flavor among all the packaged fruits, though the color and visual appearance scores were higher for the high O<sub>2</sub> slices. Moreover, there were no significant changes in the juiciness between the samples treated by 30% O<sub>2</sub> and the ones treated by 80% O<sub>2</sub> (data not shown). Compared with day 0, all the treatments had a decrease in sensory attributes on day 12.

<sec id="sec22-1082013211415147" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The study demonstrated that the initial concentration of atmosphere in MAP could significantly influence antioxidants and sensory quality of packaged fresh-cut ‘Yaoshan’ pears. Using of high O<sub>2</sub> MAP helped to not only retard enzymatic browning, but also inhibit the decrease of antioxidant activity except vitamin C content. The low O<sub>2</sub> packaging offered the best maintenance of vitamin C during the storage. The retention of phenolic contents was observed with the use of high O<sub>2</sub> (30, 80% O<sub>2</sub>) active packaging. In addition, the high O<sub>2</sub> active packaging could contribute to preserve the overall quality compared with low O<sub>2</sub> and passive packaging condition. Furthermore, results showed that high O<sub>2</sub> active MAP offers a better approach over traditional MAP in maintaining antioxidants and sensory quality of fresh-cut pears.</p>
