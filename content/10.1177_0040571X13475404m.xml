            <title>Gritsch, Eric W., <bold><italic>Martin Luther’s Anti-Semitism: Against
                        His Better Judgment</italic></bold>, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2012; 176 pp.:
                9780802866769, £16.99/$25.00 (pbk)</title>
            <p>In the light of both the discourse on the so-called ‘New Perspective on
                Paul’ (Gunn, Sanders) and a gradually emerging sensitivity towards
                Luther’s judgements on the Jews (e.g., Hans-Martin Barth), a book on Martin
                Luther’s anti-Semitism is most welcome. Gritsch is, of course, someone who
                has been engaged in the field for decades; his latest book both summarizes and
                finalizes his rich insights. His thesis concludes as follows:
                ‘Luther’s anti-Semitism is an integral part of his life and work,
                clearly evidenced in his literary legacy. But his anti-Semitism is neither in
                harmony with the core of his theology nor with the stance of the Apostle Paul
                regarding the relationship between Jews and Christians. Consequently,
                Luther’s attitude to the Jews is against his better judgment’ (p.
                138).</p>
            <p>Gritsch develops his thesis in three stages. First he provides, an excellent overview
                of the complex phenomenon of anti-Semitism both in etymology and history, and
                explores the different aspects that have allowed for a Christian manifestation of
                anti-Semitism. It is interesting to learn in detail that famous humanists like
                Erasmus (even more so than Reuchlin) were also anti-Semites (pp. 24–5).
                Gritsch’s first section provides a working definition according to which
                ‘anti-Semitism is at its core hatred of the Jews, or the projection of
                stereotypes on the Jewish people as a whole that portray them as essentially
                evil’ (p. 31).</p>
            <p>A second section works through different stages of Luther’s writings in fine
                detail. Gritsch differentiates between: (1) ‘Traditional Polemics’
                against the Jews (Luther’s writing between 1513 and 1521); (2) an
                ‘Interlude of Pastoral Evangelism’ (written after the hearings in
                Worms, 1521–37); (3) ‘a tragic conclusion’ (written in 1538,
                in the aftermath of the Smalcald Articles while Luther was frustrated ‘by
                his failure to create a cadre of Jewish converts by exegetical-theological
                argumentation, especially among the intelligentsia’ [p. 71]); and, finally,
                (4) ‘demonizing attacks (1539–46)’ which reflect
                ‘the popularity of anti-Semitism and other topics at dinner tables’
                (pp. 77–8.). This includes other writings by Luther such as the pamphlet
                ‘On the Jews and their lies’.</p>
            <p>The third section is concerned with the ‘After-Effects’ (pp.
                97–137) of the explored developments of Luther’s anti-Semitism. It
                is particularly illuminating to learn about the various scholars between the end of
                the sixteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century who viewed Luther’s
                anti-Semitism critically. Here Gritsch follows Friedrich Lezius’s 1892 study
                (p. 109), and looks at Bonhoeffer (among other voices) for a fight against
                anti-Semitism in the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that many of the references to secondary literature come from
                earlier decades (and one wonders if a richer engagement with more recent studies
                such as Hans-Martin Barth’s <italic>Die Theologie Martin Luthers. Eine
                    Kritische Würdigung</italic> with its strong chapter on Luther’s
                anti-Semitism, would have more deeply contributed to his thesis), this is a thorough
                study that is both accessible, and thus recommendable for clergy, and simultaneously
                engages deeply with its sources.</p>
