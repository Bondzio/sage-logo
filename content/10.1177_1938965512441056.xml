<abstract>
<p>The hotel industry generally recognizes the advantages of a central business district location, resulting in higher demand, pricing ability, and profitability. What research has not done is to consider the negative effects of agglomeration and competition among centrally located hotels. Reasoning that hotels engage in price competition through revenue management, the authors developed a theoretical framework of bounded price competition. The authors theorize that rate-based competition would intensify among contiguous hotels, but they also propose that such rate-based competition is contingent on demand levels. When demand is strong, one would not expect rate-based competition. A test of this hypothesis using data from the downtown Chicago hotel market supported that a central location has a dual effect on hotel room rates. Hotels see higher premiums in the peak season, due to strong demand, and steeper discounts in shoulder seasons, as a result of competition with nearby hotels. The findings also suggest that existing models, which do not consider hotel spacing, may have overestimated the central location premium.</p>

<body>
<p>Given the wide recognition of the importance of location to a hotel’s success, one thread of research has focused on the concentration of hotels in a city’s central business district (CBD) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965512441056">Pearce 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965512441056">Urtasun and Gutierrez 2006</xref>; Chou, Hsu, and Chen 2007). These studies of the agglomeration of hotels in the CBD have reported, among other phenomena, that hotels located in or close to the CBD have the advantage of enjoying a “premium” on room rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938965512441056">Thrane 2007</xref>). From the hotels’ perspective, the CBD premium justifies higher land costs, and CBD premiums serve as indirect evidence of guests’ willingness to pay higher rates. The CBD premium has also proven powerful in comparison to other locations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938965512441056">Weaver (1993)</xref> explained that a CBD location can be preferable to beachfronts in the Caribbean Islands for hotel development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512441056">Lee and Jang (2011)</xref> showed that on average, the CBD premium is greater than the airport premium when the two premiums were jointly estimated for airport hotels.</p>
<p>As a natural consequence, hotels in and near the CBD generally enjoy heightened room demand and the privilege of pricing rooms at a higher rate than hotels at a greater distance from the city core. At the same time, the effects of CBD agglomeration may also have a negative side, particularly when intense competition collides with limited demand. Given the sizable number of studies that have reported the favorable outcomes of a CBD location, we are concerned that a central location may be overvalued by the industry and academics, particularly since only a few studies have noted the negative effects of spatial competition among hotels. These studies have suggested, for example, that spatial competition explains the high failure rate in the Manhattan hotel industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965512441056">Baum and Mezias 1992</xref>). It is also cited as the reason for hotels to differentiate themselves from their neighbors to avoid direct competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965512441056">Baum and Havemen 1997</xref>), for depressed revenues per room for operating hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965512441056">Chung and Kalnins 2001</xref>), and ultimately for hotels to completely avoid choosing certain locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965512441056">Kalnins and Chung 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One gap we would like to note from the literature is that existing studies provide only partial evidence as to the ways in which competition is contingent on demand. Furthermore, they fall short of fully explaining or modeling the competition itself. This study attempts to investigate the negative effects of hotel concentration in the CBD. More specifically, we propose a price competition framework for hotels in a spatially defined market and use the spatial hedonic model to examine distance-related competition in the downtown Chicago hotel market. By comparing the estimation results of the model that considers hotel distances against the result of a traditional approach that does not consider hotels’ adjacency, we also identify potential problems associated with the conventional approach.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938965512441056">
<title>Central Business District and Competition</title>
<p>Under the general assumption that land costs are higher for a central location, a hotel’s optimal distance from the CBD can be expressed as a function of potential revenues and costs that simultaneously increase with proximity to the CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512441056">Egan and Nield 2000</xref>). Empirically, luxury hotels and hotels catering to a high percentage of independent travelers are found closer to the CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965512441056">Shoval 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to exogenous externality—the effect of a location that exists regardless of the presence of other hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965512441056">McCann and Folta 2008</xref>)—the CBD is traditionally viewed as a potential site for hotel agglomeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965512441056">Ashworth and Tunbridge 1990</xref>). Moreover, the CBD is made even more attractive by the endogenous externalities of agglomeration—the effect of a location created by the presence of other businesses, including other hotels. As hotels concentrate in and around the CBD, competition in this area inevitably escalates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965512441056">Urtasun and Gutierrez (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965512441056">Kalnins and Chung (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965512441056">Baum and Havemen (1997)</xref> argued that hotels will differentiate from their neighbors in an attempt to avoid direct competition. However, differentiation cannot eliminate competition altogether, and variability of room availability in the market and steep discounts imply that there is always some possibility of rate inversions (or at least rate compression) between, say, a five-star hotel and a budget hotel.</p>
<p>Although the studies that we mentioned above have reported the adverse effects from localized hotel competition (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965512441056">Baum and Mezias 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965512441056">Chung and Kalnins 2001</xref>), they fall short of providing quantifiable measures of competition. The lack of a conceptual model on the dynamics of competition, as well as the lack of a testable model, puts potential developers who are about to enter any hotel market at a disadvantage. Whereas the yearly measures of favorable operating statistics such as occupancy percentage or average daily rates will justify the high cost of locating in the CBD, in the short-run operation may suffer from a large number of neighboring competitors, especially when the demand is low. To address this issue of competition due to hotel agglomeration, we develop a theoretical framework based on the supposition that competition among hotels will take the form of bounded price-related competition where its effects can be estimated using a spatial hedonic model described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1938965512441056">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Despite their efforts to differentiate long-term possibilities of adding or closing rooms, hotels operate in an environment of price competition, in the short run. Classic theory suggests that firms under pure price competition (à la <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512441056">Bertrand 1883</xref>) would generally be expected to locate themselves away from one another in hopes of reducing customers’ ability to compare prices and to create product differentiation from location.</p>
<p>Instead, hotels agglomerate adjacent to the CBD, and even in such tightly competitive markets as Manhattan, new entrants seek available locations. Consequently, we deduce that the benefits of a CBD location outweigh the negative effects of competition. Although location is considered the most important attribute for hotel rooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512441056">Bull 1994</xref>), there are also other factors identified from the literature that somewhat mitigate localized competition. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512441056">dePalma et al. (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965512441056">Anderson and dePalma (1988)</xref> asserted that firms differentiated by product attributes other than location may find it optimal to concentrate in the center. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965512441056">Stahl (1982)</xref> posited that increased search costs may lead firms to locate close to one another despite the price competition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965512441056">McCann and Folta (2008)</xref> also pointed out that a concentration of hotels may reduce search costs for guests. We anticipate that both effects exist for hotels, as each hotel is unique in terms of its location, offerings, and amenities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965512441056">Exhibit 1</xref> illustrates price competition for two identical hotels, A and B, which are at exactly the same location. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512441056">Bertrand’s (1883)</xref> theory predicts that these two hotels will bring their prices down to their marginal costs, <italic>P</italic> = <italic>MC</italic><sub>A</sub> = <italic>MC</italic><sub>B</sub>. However, CBD hotels are differentiated to one extent or another (indeed, location is one dimension of differentiation in this regard). Add to this the reduced search costs, and hotels in the CBD will always sell above the marginal cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512441056">dePalma et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965512441056">Stahl 1982</xref>). Taking the extreme case, if there is enough demand to occupy the room supply of the entire market, there is no need for competition. Although Conrad Hilton famously filled banquet rooms with guest beds during an oil boom in an earlier century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938965512441056">Lee 1985</xref>), to appeal to the general case we will assume that a hotel cannot sell more rooms than it has. Thus, when demand exceeds the fixed supply: <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>Q</italic><sub>A</sub> + <italic>Q</italic><sub>B</sub>, room rates will be set by the firms to maximize revenue at <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub>* = <italic>P</italic><sub>A</sub>*.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on this line of reasoning, this study hypothesizes that hotel price competition is bounded by capacity. In the high-demand season, a hotel need not discount room rates, and hence there is no incentive to compete. Conversely, in low-demand seasons, there is an incentive for one hotel to undercut the room rates of other hotels to fill its rooms and for other hotels to respond by discounting. Price competition of this type will theoretically continue until a stable state is reached where further discounts would not be profitable for any of the hotels. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is formulated: in low-demand seasons, there will be increased price-based competition due to the profit-maximizing behavior of hotels; whereas there will be less or minimal price competition among hotels in peak, high-demand seasons of the market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be hypothesized that competition will intensify as the distance between hotels becomes closer based on the rationale discussed above that location has long been acknowledged as an imperative dimension of hotel products and the smaller the distance between hotels, the smaller the degree of product differentiation among them will be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, land costs, which generally increase monotonically toward the city center, may lead hotels of similar quality to locate adjacently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512441056">Egan and Nield 2000</xref>). This also lessens product differentiation in terms of quality dimensions. Less product differentiation in terms of quality, which can also be thought of as enhanced substitutability, is expected to lead to intensified competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512441056">dePalma et al. 1985</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample and Data</title>
<p>We selected the downtown Chicago hotel market to test our hypothesis for the following reasons. Monocentricity is a crucial assumption in observing the effect of central location, and Chicago is one of the largest monocentric cities remaining today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938965512441056">McMillen 2003</xref>). It has a saturated hotel market with some thirty-eight thousand rooms, and we anticipate a temporary oversupply of rooms due to the recent economic recession in the United States and to speculative development before Chicago lost its bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. As a consequence, we foresee fierce price competition among the hotels. For this analysis, we excluded independent motels with less than thirty rooms, bed and breakfast operations, hotels with year-round flat rates, and apartments or corporate housing, yielding a final sample of eighty-one hotels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965512441056">Exhibit 2</xref> illustrates the downtown Chicago hotel market, which has pronounced agglomeration around the city center, commonly known as the Loop (roughly centered at the intersection of State and Madison Streets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965512441056">Kawamura 2001</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938965512441056-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We collected data on average weekday room rates from the hotels’ brand websites one week prior to the shoulder season stay dates (March 15–19, 2010) and three months prior to the peak season stay dates (May 24–28, 2010). The peak and shoulder seasons were identified by HVS historical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965512441056">HVS 2009</xref>). We used rates from the hotels’ brand websites, because they account for the majority of online reservations and generally offer the hotels’ best available rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965512441056">Rohlfs and Kimes 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on information available on the hotel websites we also recorded the number of rooms and number of restaurants, and set up binary (dummy) variables for the following amenities: minibar, flat-screen television, pool, function space, lounge, business center, spa, fitness center, room service, and valet parking (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965512441056">Exhibit 3</xref>). We used global positioning system (GPS) coordinates to calculate the distance from the hotel to the city center.</p>

<title>Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis</title>
<p>Given the structure of our theoretical framework, which assumes that competition decreases with distance, we constructed a neighborhood scheme in which <italic>W</italic> weighting matrix (that is, the row-standardized weight matrix) was calculated based on a distance threshold of one kilometer, reflecting the assumption that hotels are first-order neighbors if they are located within one kilometer of each other. The <italic>W</italic> matrix has distance-based weight elements that take on values between neighbors, standardized to sum to one in every row, and zero between nonneighbors.</p>
<p>We analyzed the data using spatial weight types of both inverse (linear) distances and inverse squares of distances (curvilinear). After testing both weight matrices, we continued our analysis with the linear distance weights for two reasons. This gave us a relatively better data fit (a higher average model <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), and we had no theoretical grounds to reject the assumption that spatial competition is a linear function of distance. Nevertheless, the estimation results using both types of weights are qualitatively similar and available upon request.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938965512441056">Exhibit 4</xref> shows scatterplots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965512441056">Moran 1948</xref>) for the room rates of Chicago hotels in both March and May, illustrating the spatial correlation among hotel room rates. The estimated slopes of the scatterplots are slightly negative for March rates and slightly positive for May rates, suggesting weak correlation among the room rates of neighboring hotels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965512441056">Moran’s (1948)</xref> <italic>I</italic> tests on the low season rates did not reject the null (<italic>p</italic> = .6172), perhaps due to the limited sample size. This was the same for the high season as well (<italic>p</italic> = .3108). Nevertheless, the exploratory analysis provides only preliminary evidence of potential spatial autocorrelation. Thus, we reserve a definitive conclusion until the analysis of the full spatial hedonic pricing model.</p>

<title>Data Reduction</title>
<p>To address this multicollinearity issue, we applied factor analysis. Studies using hedonic pricing models often see high correlations among independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965512441056">Haroutunian and Pashardes 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965512441056">Andersson 2010</xref>), which inevitably leads to multicollinearity problems in the regression models and inflates the standard errors. Yet using a composite index, such as star ratings, is generally not feasible due to questions on uniformity, reliability, and availability of such systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938965512441056">Thrane 2007</xref>). The high correlations among the physical attributes and amenity variables in the dataset suggest that multicollinearity would be unavoidable if the regression model were to include all relevant explanatory variables (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965512441056">appendix</xref>). Furthermore, the nature of spatial data does not allow for a larger sample, as each spatial system is unique. The limited degree of freedom calls for a parsimonious model. For these reasons, we reduced the data using factor analysis (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938965512441056">Theriault et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965512441056">Oczkowski 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Since many of the variables are in binary form, the following two-count variables were generated:</p>
<p>IN-ROOM: number of in-room amenities, including flat-screen television, minibar, and room service (maximum: 3, minimum 0, sample average: 1.89); and</p>
<p>ON-SITE: number of on-site amenities, including pool, lounge, business center, spa, and fitness center (maximum: 5, minimum 3, sample average: 3.58).</p>
<p>Of the five variables above describing physical attributes of hotels, namely, number of rooms, function space, number of restaurants, IN-ROOM, and ON-SITE, we extracted two principal factors that have eigenvalues higher than 1 using principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965512441056">Exhibit 5</xref>). These two principal component factors explained 78.25 percent of the total variance. The first factor, SIZE, relates to the physical capacity of the hotel, loading heavily (&gt;.5 factor loading) on the number of rooms and function space. The second factor, AMENITY, is closely associated (&gt;.5 factor loading) with amenities the hotel provides. We suspect REST, the number of restaurants, to be almost bidirectional, loading almost equally on each factor.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965512441056">Exhibit 6</xref>, the spatial lag parameter ρ in the spatial model was significant with a coefficient of .66 in the low season. However, the coefficient was considerably smaller in the high season at .1, which is statistically insignificant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1. The magnitude and significance of the spatial lag parameter support our hypothesis that hotel room rates become strongly dependent on those of other hotels when the market starts to discount room rates due to low demand, thereby initiating rate-based competition.</p>
<p>The central premium was significant in the high-demand season, generating an $18.39 CBD premium per kilometer of proximity to the city center. On the other hand, the coefficient was smaller in size ($7.39) and statistically insignificant in the low season. This can be explained by guests’ lower willingness to pay in the low season. Despite the lack of statistical significance, on average the CBD premium (as opposed to the CBD discount) still seems to exist. Yet a difference between the low and high seasons is clear. In the low season, the effects of price competition are strong. Jointly observing the effect and significance of coefficients on the <italic>Wy</italic> and CENTER variables, in the high season the magnitude and statistical significance of the two coefficients (competition and central premium) are reversed. Although we cannot completely dismiss the possibility of price competition in the high season and the existence of the CBD premium in the low season, the contrast between the two seasons is evident. Thus, our hypothesis that price competition is conditional on the seasonality of demand and competition increases with contiguity to other hotels is supported by these results.</p>
<p>The CHAIN variable was significant in both seasons, consistent with past studies that found a premium for chain hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512441056">Lee and Jang 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965512441056">Wu 1999</xref>). Of particular interest was the size of the coefficient on the CHAIN variable in the low season. The chain hotel premium of $29.61 is considerably greater than the high season estimate and the WLS estimates. This suggests that after taking spatial competition into consideration, chain hotels are protected in the low season from lack of demand due to the central reservation system (CRS) or guest reward systems that brands offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965512441056">Sigala, Lockwood, and Jones 2001</xref>). Compared with the WLS estimates, which show a relatively stable CHAIN coefficient in both seasons, the chain premium seems to have been underrated due to the use of aspatial hedonic models.</p>
<p>Valet parking and amenity factors, which are proxies for service quality and physical qualities, were found to be highly significant in both regressions. The coefficients were greater in magnitude for the high season, which is intuitive since guests would be willing to pay more for higher-quality services and amenities when demand in general is high.</p>
<p>Coefficients on the LAUNDRY variable were insignificant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1. This may be attributed to the limited sample size and the high significance of the VALET variable, which is also a proxy variable for service quality. SIZE was also found to be insignificant. Although some groups (e.g., conventions) may require large properties, the size factor does not seem to translate into enhanced pricing ability for hotels, on average or statistically.</p>
<p>Comparing the coefficients on the CENTER variable between the STSLS and WLS estimates reveals the most critical finding of this study, as well as the biggest contradiction to the findings of past studies. Using the aspatial model as most other studies would do, one finds the coefficients of the CENTER variable to be almost identical in both seasons, which would lead one to believe that a central premium of almost $18 per kilometer of CBD proximity is stable, regardless of demand seasonality. However, in the spatial model, the premium from CBD proximity was found to be lower and insignificant during the low-demand season. This is a joint outcome of guests’ decreased willingness to pay (since it is low season) and intensified competition in the central area.</p>
<p>Another interesting way of observing spatial competition is looking at the global spatial multiplier, which is the effect on <italic>y</italic> from <italic>X</italic>, if a marginal change of <italic>X</italic> were to be induced by every hotel in the system (i.e., if all hotels in the market initially discounted the same price from their room rates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965512441056">Kim, Phipps, and Anselin 2003</xref>). If all hotels in downtown Chicago discounted room rates by a certain amount due to spatial competition, the hotel would ultimately be forced to discount the initial amount times the global spatial multiplier. Using our estimation results, we calculated the global spatial multiplier as follows:</p>

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Interpreting the multiplier is straightforward. If all hotels were to simultaneously discount their original room rates by 10 percent (≈$23.30) due to depressed demand, they would have to discount the room rate by 29.41 percent (≈$68.53) on average after the efforts to undercut their competitors have reached a stable state. In the sample data, the average difference in room rates between the high and low seasons was approximately $48.45, which is an average room rate discount of 20.81 percent. Had there been no competition in the market (ρ = 0), the hotels would have needed only a 7.08 percent discount on average. This may have been the hotels’ intended initial discount rate and is approximately consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965512441056">Kalnins’s (2006)</xref> observations.</p>
<p>The results provide some meaningful guidance to potential hotel developers who anticipate entering an urban market. Although expected pricing ability and demand will be high for metropolitan areas, entering a saturated market means that low-demand seasons must be taken into account as well. Revenue management by other hotels in the market will lead to price competition among all hotels in the market. This eventually leads the market to achieve a lower average daily rate as a whole, by forcing discounts that do not necessarily stimulate demand but are simply offered to keep up with the competing hotels.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Location is an intrinsic characteristic of a hotel’s product, price, and competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512441056">Lee and Jang 2011</xref>). For many reasons, selecting an appropriate location is an important decision for hotel developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965512441056">Urtasun and Gutierrez 2006</xref>). Despite the many studies that have proclaimed the benefits of a central location, the Bertrand theory of price-related competition and limited evidence suggest that the benefits of a central location may be constrained by the competition arising from concentration.</p>
<p>Our study investigated the effects of central location on hotel pricing in high and low seasons, highlighting the potential negative effects of agglomeration that have been largely ignored to date. Based on our analysis of the Chicago hotel market, we supported our hypothesis that hotels’ room rates depend on those of neighboring hotels only in the shoulder season, since demand is inadequate during that time. Moreover, we found that the CBD premium operated only when demand was high, and rooms were filled regardless of rate. We conclude that a location in the CBD has a dual effect on hotel rates. In the high-demand season, proximity to the CBD allows hotels to enjoy a high room rate premium. On the other hand, in the low-demand season, proximity to the CBD forces hotels to discount their room rates in consideration of the actions of adjacent properties.</p>
<p>The significance of the spatial lag parameter also suggests that coefficients and standard errors from conventional aspatial hedonic models, which have been used extensively to date, may be unreliable. In short, the benefits of centrality may have been overrated, as the competition factor is not taken into account in the nonspatial models commonly in use. Perhaps less surprising, chain hotels seem to enjoy a premium even during periods of low demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965512441056">Sigala, Lockwood, and Jones 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This study enhances the understanding of spatial competition among hotels. First, we proposed a framework based on seasonal price competition bounded by the maximum number of rooms and mitigated by product differentiation and search costs.</p>
<p>Second, we also proposed a quantitative measure of competition by estimating the spatial lag coefficient ρ. Scaled between 0 and 1, this parameter is a convenient and effective way to compare the strength of competition across seasons and geographic locations. By calculating the global spatial multiplier, researchers can also develop a scientific method for future discount rates when depressed demand is anticipated.</p>
<p>Third, this study empirically identified the negative externality of central agglomeration, which has been largely overlooked by research to date. As proximity to the center will inevitably intensify localized competition, the optimal selection of a hotel’s location should not be based on a simple function of hedonic prices, expected demand, and land costs. Instead, it must also take into account the seasonality of demand and its effect on price competition.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the results between STSLS and WLS estimates and concluded that the hedonic parameters obtained through aspatial models are biased, even when using robust estimation techniques. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation–robust estimation procedures may improve the standard error estimates, but they do not help correct the bias introduced by the spatial lag ρ. We argue that to date, aspatial hedonic models may have overestimated the CBD-proximity premium and recommend that future studies take into account the possibility of endogenous spatial lags in hedonic room rate models.</p>
<p>Despite the significance and relevance of these findings, the study is not free from limitations. Limited sample size, and thus utilization of PCA, limits the generalizability of the hedonic model and direct comparability of results. More to the point, Chicago may not offer a representative case, because it is one of a handful of identifiable monocentric metropolitan cities.</p>
<p>Even with those limitations, this study makes a primary contribution providing a theoretical framework and evidence of localized price competition among hotels. In the future, studies may examine the development of a more generalizable spatial model of hotel competition encompassing the dynamics of demand changes and price competition, or any other factors influencing competition. Empirical research on the investigation of other endogenous externalities, such as the long-term demand generation effect of hotel agglomeration or the competition-mitigating effects of product differentiation, also seem warranted.</p>
