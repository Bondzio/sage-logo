<abstract>
<p>Implanting the acetabular cup of hard-on-hard bearings, like metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic, requires considerable surgeon skill to avoid the complications associated with edge loading. Successful cup positioning instruments have been designed in the past by pioneering surgeons, like Peter Ring and Michael Freeman, and these are re-visited in this article. An advantage of these instruments is that they could position the acetabular cup without defining a reference pelvic plane. Computer-assisted cup orientation is able to reduce outliers in cup orientation, but the technology has not been widely adopted. There may be an opportunity to improve the uptake of computer-assisted surgery by incorporating some of the concepts from historically successful manual instruments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Total hip replacement (THR) is considered the most successful procedure in orthopaedic surgery, with excellent survival rates and better patient satisfaction than any other joint arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445735">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445735">2</xref></sup> There is a variety of THR designs available to the surgeon – the National Joint Registry reports 126 brands of femoral stem and 151 brands of acetabular cup implanted in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445735">1</xref></sup> In the UK, the use of cement to fix the components in the bone is on the decline, despite continuing impressive results from Exeter and Wrightington,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445735">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912445735">4</xref></sup> and in 2009 the use of press-fit designs surpassed cemented devices for the first time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445735">1</xref></sup> Assuming the surgeon is more inclined to choose a press-fit fixation for the femoral stem and acetabular cup, the other remaining choice is the bearing combination. For younger patients, where pain relief is taken as a given and they demand to return to their active lifestyles without compromise, this choice has been primarily made on bearing longevity, i.e. hard-on-hard bearings like ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) or metal-on-metal (MoM). These bearings have the potential for extremely low wear, even for highly active patients, but are not without their limitations. CoC bearings have been associated with fracture and squeaking, and the popularity of MoM bearings is on the decline owing to concerns about metallic wear debris in the local tissues. The aim of this article is to describe how correct orientation of the acetabular cup is critical to ensure proper function of hard-on-hard bearings, discuss several instruments that have been developed in the past to orientate the acetabular cup, and identify ways in which contemporary cup alignment technology could be more widely adopted in clinical practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0954411912445735">
<title>Contemporary CoC designs</title>
<p>Since the early 1990s, the dominant CoC design has been a porous-coated acetabular titanium shell with an alumina liner. The shell is impacted into the acetabulum and the surgeon then impacts the ceramic liner into the shell. The bearing diameter is typically a 28 mm, 32 mm, or 36 mm alumina femoral ball attached to a cemented or press-fit femoral stem via a Morse taper. Contemporary fixation technology (cemented and press-fit) has dramatically reduced the aseptic loosening rates, which are now typically 1–2% at 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912445735">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445735">6</xref></sup> The ceramic material has also improved and fracture rates are now typically 1% at 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445735">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912445735">8</xref></sup> In addition to alumina, most manufacturers now offer an alumina–zirconia composite ceramic. This material holds the zirconia phase at a lower volume crystalline structure than it naturally occupies at room temperature and, when a crack is present in the material, the restraint on the zirconia is released and it transforms to its natural, greater volume, crystalline structure. The increased volume compresses the crack tip, thus retarding its progression. Despite the improved mechanical properties of these transformation toughened ceramics, the reported fracture rate is similar to the pure alumina material, and has been associated with improper ceramic liner positioning and impaction into the titanium shell during the surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912445735">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912445735">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The latest CoC designs come as a pre-assembled ceramic–titanium shell unit, thus overcoming the limitations of intra-operative assembly. Because the risks associated with intra-operative assembly are overcome, manufacturers can reduce the wall thickness of the acetabular cup and the thinnest commercially available devices now have a 5 mm wall thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912445735">Figure 1</xref>). This has the benefit of allowing a larger diameter articulation in the same size acetabular cup, thus reducing dislocation risk and increasing available range of motion. Early clinical experience with the pre-assembled thin-walled design has been promising, but longer term data are required to prove the effectiveness of the design.</p>

<title>Contemporary MoM designs</title>
<p>In the late 1980s, the Metasul (Sultzer, Wintertuhr, Switzerland) MoM bearing was developed with a 28 mm and 32 mm bearing diameter and tight control of the clearance to promote lubrication. The design was a success – clinical survival rates were the same as the MoP designs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912445735">11</xref></sup> but the wear rate was decreased some 60-fold compared with metal-on-polymer (MoP) designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912445735">12</xref></sup> At around the same time, Derek McMinn was considering using the same technology to develop hip resurfacing. The resurfacing concept had previously been tried and abandoned owing to high wear rates of the polymer materials used. However, early versions of the McMinn MoM resurfacing were successful and evolved into the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR), which became a mainstream product when Smith &amp; Nephew bought Midland Medical Technology (the company that owned the BHR at the time, although the device was manufactured by Finsbury Orthopaedics) in 2004. In 2009, Smith and Nephew started manufacturing the BHR in house, thus changing the manufacturing site. However, the heritage and manufacturing know-how of the early BHRs was maintained through Finsbury’s own Adept hip-resurfacing device, which was manufactured alongside BHR prior to 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912445735">Figure 2</xref>). The BHR and Adept continue to generate the best survival data in the UK and Australian registries and these have not been matched by more recently developed devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445735">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912445735">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Concerns with CoC and MoM bearings</title>
<p>Poor positioning of the acetabular cup has the potential to cause problems with both CoC and MoM bearings. For CoC bearings, squeaking is occasionally reported (about 1% overall, but as high as 36% when particular components are used together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912445735">14</xref></sup>), and while this is rarely a serious clinical problem it makes sense to try and prevent it. The impulse for CoC squeaking likely comes from stick–slip friction at the bearing surface, which causes the ceramic material to vibrate. The frequency of this vibration depends on the properties of the system – the speed of rotation, bearing clearance, coefficient of friction, etc, and not necessarily on the natural resonant frequency of the individual parts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445735">15</xref></sup> The amplification may, therefore, be the ceramic components themselves vibrating audibly, but clinical studies have found increased rates of squeaking when a particular bearing and stem design are used together, indicating the stem may have been resonating at a similar frequency to the impulse at the bearing surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912445735">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The impulse for squeaking must come from the bearing surface, but the friction of a virgin CoC bearing under optimal lubrication conditions is too low to initiate stick–slip. The friction of a virgin bearing under edge loading increases the friction force between three- and six-fold, but this may still be too low to initiate stick–slip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445735">17</xref></sup> However, for a damaged bearing surface, particularly at the edge of the cup, the friction is considerably higher, and could initiate stick–slip conditions. The most commonly seen damage on CoC bearings is stripe wear, generated when the femoral head comes into contact with the edge of the acetabular bearing surface and the increased contact pressure damages the surface of the head in a characteristic stripe shape. This can occur when the cup is implanted at a steep angle, or if there is laxity in the joint allowing joint separation during gait, but the most common mechanism is deep flexion activities, where the head loads against the posterior edge of the acetabular cup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445735">18</xref></sup> Damage to the bearing surfaces owing to edge loading may, therefore, generate the conditions required for squeaking. Indeed clinical observations have been that squeaking usually becomes apparent at least six months after surgery, before which time the bearing is not sufficiently damaged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912445735">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>For MoM bearings, the most concerning complication is currently an adverse reaction to metal debris (ARMD), which is an umbrella description for several mechanisms through which metallic wear debris from the bearing surface can cause localised tissue destruction. This usually manifests as pain and, for a well-designed device, occurs in about 1% of resurfacing cases during the first 10 postoperative years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912445735">20</xref></sup> Upon revision, tissue destruction associated with fluid-filled bursae or soft tissue masses in the vicinity of the joint have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445735">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912445735">22</xref></sup> These bursae or soft tissue masses can contain macrophages and necrotic tissue, and most, but not all, contain high levels of metallic wear debris.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445735">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912445735">22</xref></sup> Indeed, retrieval analysis has found a strong correlation between high wear of the bearing surfaces and ARMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912445735">20</xref></sup> Several aspects of the bearing design may influence wear, but some are highly contested, for example, the influence of heat treatment to the cast Cobalt Chromium (CoCr) alloy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912445735">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912445735">24</xref></sup> and clearance between the head and cup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912445735">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912445735"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912445735">27</xref></sup> However, there is a consensus that the position of the acetabular cup edge relative to the load vector is a key factor in the wear of MoM bearings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912445735">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912445735"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912445735">30</xref></sup> If the edge of the cup gets too close to the load vector, lubrication of the bearing is disrupted and high edge wear of the cup can occur. MoM cups are already at a disadvantage in this regard as their included bearing surface is less than 180° (angle ‘θ’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445735">Figure 3</xref>), such that a cup implanted at 45° can have an effective inclination of between 50° and 63°, depending on the design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912445735">31</xref></sup> (angle ‘α’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445735">Figure 3</xref>). Coverage arc is another way of describing this (arc ‘d’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445735">Figure 3</xref>), and a significant relationship between the smaller coverage arc and metal ions has been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912445735">30</xref></sup> This may partially explain the worse performance of resurfacing in smaller sizes (and perhaps female patients who generally receive smaller components). It follows that a cup design with a smaller included bearing angle (angle ‘θ’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445735">Figure 3</xref>) will increase the risk of edge loading, and this is a critical parameter in implant design.</p>

</fig>
<p>Cup positioning is therefore critical for CoC and MoM bearings to reduce the occurrence of impingement and/or edge loading, which has been related to squeaking for CoC bearings and ARMD for MoM bearings. The natural hip deals with edge loading through the soft tissues at the perimeter of the acetabulum, i.e. the labrum and the joint capsule, which extends the support structure for the femoral head. Commercially available designs do not replicate the function of these structures, and until they do, edge loading may never be completely eliminated. Cup orientation is, therefore, the largest single contributing factor to the position of the cup edge – more so than implant design – and therefore represents one of the most critical aspects of the THR procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411912445735">
<title>Cup positioning assistance</title>
<p>Clinical experience indicates that acetabular cup positioning is one of the most critical aspects of CoC or MoM hip replacement/resurfacing, and difficulties in even measuring the actual orientation have been reviewed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912445735">32</xref></sup> Despite the importance of positioning, the instrumentation provided by the manufacturer is usually a simple aerial device that connects to the introducer to provide a predetermined inclination/anteversion with respect to the introducer. This device has limited effectiveness partly because it doesn’t relate to the position of the pelvis on the operating table, but mainly because it is seldom used. The default method of cup alignment is using anatomic landmarks to position the cup, for example the transverse acetabular ligament,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912445735">33</xref></sup> or bony landmarks around the periphery of the acetabulum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912445735">34</xref></sup> or even by pointing the introducer handle towards the corner of the operating theatre, and the resulting orientation is usually with an increased inclination and anteversion compared with the conventional Lewinnek safe zone, with a wide variability from 30° to 70° inclination and 0° to 50° anteversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912445735">35</xref></sup> The placement of the acetabular cup is, therefore, the most uncontrolled part of the surgery. In an effort to reduce the variability, several solutions have been proposed, and these can be categorised into manual and computer-assisted instrumentation.</p>
<sec id="section6-0954411912445735">
<title>Manual instrumentation</title>
<p>Two distinct concepts exist for manual instrumentation, those that define the pelvic orientation and align the cup relative to this coordinate frame, and those that do not define the pelvic orientation and orientate the cup relative to the local exposed acetabulum.</p>
<p>Considering the former, instrumentation has been developed that locates a temporary frame on the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) and the pubic symphysis to define the orientation of the pelvis and align the introducer relative to this frame using a system of reflected light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912445735">36</xref></sup> Another group attached a two-dimensional (2D) spirit level to the pelvis and adjusted it to be level when the pelvis was in strict lateral decubitus using a reference frame located against the ASIS. The introducer also had a 2D spirit level attached and a guide rod to align with the pelvis reference frame with a pre-defined inclination and anteversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912445735">37</xref></sup> Both these studies report improved alignment of the acetabular cup, but are limited by the location accuracy of the ASIS and pubic symphysis bony reference points. Cadaver testing indicates that locating these points through the skin can generate an error of 16° version in pelvic plane definition, increasing to 19° when surgical drapes are added.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912445735">38</xref></sup> Perhaps a more fundamental limitation of systems such as these, is that they intend to orientate the cup to a predefined orientation (usually 45° inclination and 15° anteversion), and these values may not be appropriate for every patient owing to the architecture of the acetabulum and the version of the femoral neck or stem in the case of resurfacing or THR, respectively.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Michael Freeman devised instrumentation to orientate the acetabular cup without knowing the exact orientation of the pelvis, thus overcoming the limitations associated with finding the ASIS and symphysis. He used a ‘soup-spoon’ device that was essentially a trial acetabulum with a handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445735">Figure 4</xref>). This instrument was placed in the acetabulum, the hip was reduced, a range of motion analysis performed and the acetabular trial adjusted (using the handle) until a position was found that maximised range of motion without impingement. The trial was then pinned in place, the hip dislocated and a locating hole drilled through the trial that corresponded to a peg in the acetabular component, thus allowing the component to be placed in the same orientation as the trial. More recently, the same concept was developed for acetabular cups without a protruding peg by using a system of sterile single-use laser pointers to mark the position of the trial and align the introducer in the same orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445735">Figure 5</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912445735">39</xref></sup> One of the advantages of these methods is that a patient-specific cup orientation is defined that considers the version of the femoral stem, or femoral neck in the case of resurfacing, without the need for knowing the exact orientation of the pelvis. Both of these methods have been used successfully, but they are more difficult with a posterior surgical approach where the abductors can interfere with the trial during the trial range of movement in flexion. Another limitation of these instruments is that they require a different instrument for each implant size and add to the number of instruments to be manufactured, sterilised and transported to the surgery.</p>

<p>Another example of cup orientation without knowing the exact orientation of the pelvis was that developed by Peter Ring in the 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445735">40</xref></sup> This device had a guide that hooked around the greater sciatic notch of the pelvis, and a mushroom that fitted in the centre of the acetabulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445735">Figure 6</xref>). These two points locate the axis of the cup collinear to the weight-bearing axis of the acetabulum and ensure the load vector through the resulting hip replacement passes through the pole of the cup, i.e. as far as possible from the edge of the bearing surface.</p>

</fig>
<p>Conventional manual instrumentation is usually adopted by the surgeon if it comes with the instrument set, but is quickly discarded if not user friendly. A limitation of manual instrumentation is that a different sized instrument is usually required for each implant size. A typical acetabular cup implant has 10 sizes, such that 10 extra instruments could be required as part of the set. The industry is moving towards reducing the number of instrument trays required for a procedure, and this goes against introducing another tray for cup alignment. Indeed, several hospitals now limit the number and weight of a set of instrument trays. Patient-specific disposable instrumentation may be a suitable alternative – these guides are based on a CT or MRI scan of the patient’s geometry, manufactured by additive manufacturing and clip onto the bone in the correct place. This concept is now commonly found in knee replacement, and early trials have been made in hip replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954411912445735">41</xref></sup> The concept of patient-specific instruments removes the bulk of the instrumentation from the operating theatre, but concerns exist that the surgeon will just accept the ‘default’ guide from the manufacturer rather than spend time themselves positioning the components in preoperative planning. The process also requires robust quality assurance control over the manufacturing and delivery of the correct instruments to the correct patient, and lacks the flexibility to change the cutting planes intra-operatively.</p>

<p>Navigation has been around for over 10 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411912445735">42</xref></sup> and locates the position of the bones using cameras that track optical markers attached to the femur and pelvis with intracortical screws. The shape of the bones is either taken from a pre-operative CT scan or morphed from the computer’s database using a pointer to ‘paint’ the surface of the bone in different areas. In a prospective randomised study comparing navigated and freehand cup placement, the mean inclination and version were the same, but navigation reduced the number of outliers from 57% to 20%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954411912445735">43</xref></sup> and similar findings are summarised in a recently published meta-analysis of navigated versus manual cup positioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0954411912445735">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Robotic assistance has evolved from autonomous robots with little surgeon control to contemporary systems that are completely controlled by the surgeon and provide haptic feedback to guide bone cutting and implant placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0954411912445735">45</xref></sup> The first of the latter was developed in the UK (The Acrobot Company Ltd, London, UK, recently acquired by Stanmore Implants, London, UK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912445735">Figure 7</xref>) and, like navigation, has significantly reduced the number of outliers in terms of implant placement compared with conventional methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0954411912445735">46</xref></sup> A similar robot has been developed in the USA by MAKO Surgical Corp (Florida, USA) with a similar reduction in implant orientation outliers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954411912445735">47</xref></sup></p>

<p>Computer assistance, whether navigation or robotic, therefore defines the pelvic plane and the acetabular cup is oriented relative to that plane, but this remains a limitation of the technology as locating these landmarks during surgery can give an incorrect pelvic version by up to 20°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912445735">38</xref></sup> A further limitation is that these systems usually orient the cup to predefined values that may not be suitable for individual patients owing to the femoral neck version for example. These are the same limitations of the manual instruments that define a pelvic plane. However, the instrumentation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445735">Figures 4</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445735"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445735">6</xref> overcome these limitations and there may be scope for using such concepts in computer-assisted equipment. Indeed, the difficult part of the Freeman soup spoon procedure was repositioning the cup in the same place as the trial, but this could easily be achieved with computer assistance without bulky instruments. By attempting to achieve less, i.e. just repositioning the cup introducer in the same orientation as a trial, the computer assistance may become more widely adopted than has been in the past.</p>
<p>Indeed computer-assisted surgery remains to be widely adopted, despite being heavily marketed by the big orthopaedic companies during the past decade. While there is evidence that a patient with a poorly placed component may be at increased risk of a poor outcome, and there is also evidence that navigation improves component positioning, there is no evidence directly linking the use of navigation to improved outcome, and as such, some surgeons have become sceptical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0954411912445735">48</xref></sup> For the MoM and CoC bearings discussed in this article, adverse events related to poor cup position occur in only about 1–2% of cases (for well designed bearings). Using standard outcome measures, like implant survival or patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), a large trial would, therefore, be necessary to demonstrate significant improvement in the navigated group. An alternative approach is to use more sensitive post-operative assessment methods. Gait analysis and force plates are available in many institutions and can provide an idea of the loads applied during heel strike and toe-off, albeit slightly remote from the joint. Radiographic or fluoroscopic analysis during dynamic activities can increase the information available in post-operative assessment, and one of the most promising set-ups is the biplanar rig developed by Tashman and colleagues that can measure kinematics to within a couple of hundred microns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0954411912445735">49</xref></sup> These may be able to demonstrate the benefits of component positioning better than the conventional outcome measures.</p>
<p>In addition to improving component alignment, robotic surgery has the potential to remove instrument trays from the operating theatre altogether. The cutting burr of a robotic system is restrained by the robot to only make cuts defined in the pre-operative planning stage and, therefore, does not require mechanical guides, or even different sized hemispherical reamers, for the acetabulum. The surgeon also can change the cutting planes intra-operatively if they are not happy with the pre-planned cuts, for example, if they uncover unexpected bone quality. The cost of the robotic system, however, may still be prohibitive – the Mako robot and software costs $950k,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954411912445735">47</xref></sup> but there is no reason why these costs cannot be recovered in a more innovative way. Currently, the implant manufacturer provides instrument sets that can cost approximately £15–£20k per set, and considers these a capital cost that is not charged to the hospital or healthcare provider. A robotic system in an operating theatre, therefore, saves the manufacturer the cost of manufacturing these sets and also saves the hospital the cost of sterilising, storing, and transporting those sets to the theatre. If these savings were offset against the cost of the robot, the financial cost of using robotic technology may not be prohibitive. Indeed, the Sculptor robot (Stanmore Implants, London, UK) follows such a model in the UK market and is loaned without charge, provided the hospital provides the company with a sufficient volume of joints per annum.</p>
<p>THR is considered the most successful procedure in orthopaedic surgery, with excellent survival rates and better patient satisfaction than any other joint arthroplasty. In the case of most technology, the better something gets, the more difficult it is to improve, and perhaps that is also the case with hip replacement. It must be remembered that the problems cited in this article relating to the cup placement are rare and occur in less than 1% for well designed components after 10 years. Eventually there will come a time where technology can provide a small margin of improvement, but at a cost that is considered prohibitive. However, improved post-operative assessment methods to demonstrate the clinical benefit of precise cup positioning, together with an instrument-free operation and limited cost to the healthcare provider, may be enough to tip the balance and convince clinicians to adopt the available technology more widely than has been done in the past.</p>
