<title>Background Information</title>
<p><italic>The Handbook of Race and Adult Education</italic> is an edited volume that makes an important contribution to furthering dialogue about race. Its publication is timely given the increasing skepticism expressed by some vocal Whites who claim that the United States has moved to a “post-racial and post-ethnic” (p. 335) period, which flies in the face of the lived experience of people of color.</p>
<p>The <italic>Handbook</italic> challenges educators to examine their racial identity and critically reflect on how it shapes their worldview and practice. The editors use a dialogical model, a metaphoric kitchen table discussion, to explore race and racism from “social, educational, political, and psychological perspectives” (p. 1). They engage a diverse group of scholars from a range of education disciplines who draw on their personal experiences with racism to foster an understanding of the impact of systemic racism. This moves the dialogue beyond an academic discourse to a soul-searching and soul-baring conversation.</p>

<title>Structure and Content</title>
<p>“The Beginning: Kitchen Table Dialogue” explains the intent of the book, frames the discussion, and demonstrates that nothing is off the (kitchen) table in this informative and provocative book. Parts One, Two, Three, and Four respectively address the myth versus the reality of race and racism; problematizing “whiteness,” supremacy, and privilege; theoretical responses; and reframing the field through the lens of race. Each part concludes with a reflection by its respective editor who synthesizes the discussion, shares insights, and identifies key questions for further dialogue. The focus of Part Five is responses to race and racism. It begins with the shared reflections of the editors. Their openness and honesty reminds us how difficult it is to have authentic conversations about race. They demonstrate that working through the challenges can lead to powerful personal and collective insights. The <italic>Handbook</italic> concludes with an epilogue that addresses implications for curriculum, programming, and research.</p>

<title>Critique and Future Considerations</title>
<p>The breadth and depth of the <italic>Handbook</italic>’s content gives readers a wide-ranging overview of this complex topic. It has much to offer new and veteran scholars and practitioners.</p>
<p>The <italic>Handbook</italic> has many strong points in addition to its dialogical model and collective reflection process. First, the authors’ moving, personal stories take place at different points in time and in different locales offering readers an array of experiences with, and responses to, racism. The chapters by Rose Borunda and Doris A. Flowers are particularly compelling and insightful. Second, several authors use an examination of racism to also explore other forms of oppression (e.g., classism, heterosexism) and the intersections between them. The chapters by Raquel A. González and Maria Mejorado, Mitsunori Misawa, and Luis Kong are noteworthy. Third, the <italic>Handbook</italic> has a strong practice focus. Many chapters provide concrete methods for addressing race in a range of educational settings. Yolanda Sealey-Ruiz’s chapter provides an excellent example of creating safe spaces for critical reflection and analysis on deconstructing systemic racism.</p>
<p>The <italic>Handbook</italic> should be commended for its critical examination of Whiteness, supremacy, and privilege. We would like to see future work include more soul-searching and soul-baring discussions such as Doug Paxton’s chapter and offer more techniques that foster critical reflection such as those presented by the European–American Collaborative Challenging Whiteness. The <italic>Handbook</italic>’s strong Afrocentric focus provides significant exposure to this theoretical perspective that has been largely underused and undertaught. We suggest that future work use this as a positive example of how to expose readers to an array of theoretical perspectives that emanate from the lived experience of oppressed groups. We also suggest that future work place additional emphasis on issues of race and racism in education research.</p>

<title>Audiences and Uses</title>
<p>The <italic>Handbook</italic> will be of interest and use to a wide range of audiences including faculty members, students, administrators, practitioners, and funders. Despite its title, which focuses on adult education, the <italic>Handbook</italic> will also be of interest to individuals in other education and social science disciplines. The book can be used in formal and nonformal education programs. Uses include a guide for curriculum revision, a text for courses on race and racism, core and elective course readings, self and group reflection, and the generation of research ideas. Finally, we recommend that the Commission of Professors of Adult Education (CPAE) use the <italic>Handbook</italic> as a guide to revising the CPAE Standards for Graduate Programs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the <italic>Handbook of Race and Adult Education</italic> makes a major contribution to furthering dialogue on race and racism. We highly recommend it and hope that this <italic>Handbook</italic> edition is the first of many editions of this important text.</p>
