<abstract>
<p>Several qualitative studies, conducted in Chicago, provide the framework for the argument that, despite the massive illicit dealings of the Italian American organized crime, the residential neighborhoods in which they live and work remain relatively free of violent crime, more so than other similar urban neighborhoods. This study quantitatively examines the characteristics of the “defended neighborhood,” and how they are uniquely applied to Chicago neighborhoods. Focusing on neighborhood reputation, this research considers the influence of public reputation as informal social control over violent street crime. The results indicate that neighborhoods with an Italian American concentration have significantly lower rates of robbery compared with the rest of the city of Chicago.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986213485619">Black (1983)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986213485619">Cooney (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986213485619">Patillo (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles (1972)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte (1943)</xref> theoretically and qualitatively discuss informal social control as a key factor in maintaining low violent crime rates in urban neighborhoods. Without denying the plausibility or validity of any of these suggestions, an alternative explanation for the variability in violent crime across urban neighborhoods should be explored. This study builds on current arguments for population homogeneity, collective efficacy, and informal social control as explanations for lowered rates of violent crime. Ethnic concentration is often linked to lowered crime rates at the neighborhood level through increased collective efficacy and informal social control based on cultural similarities and strong community ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986213485619">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986213485619">Hirschi, 1969/2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986213485619">Hunter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986213485619">Shaw &amp; McKay, 1942/1969</xref>). Many neighborhoods that enjoy lowered rates of violent crime are often neighborhoods with internal organized criminal groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986213485619">Patillo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986213485619">Reider, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>). Gang activity, delinquent behaviors, and illicit businesses exist in neighborhoods that simultaneously maintain relatively safe streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485619">McIllwain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986213485619">Patillo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>). This intricate balance of known neighborhood criminal activity and low recorded violent crime is paradoxically intriguing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986213485619">DeSena (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986213485619">Patillo (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles (1972)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte (1943)</xref> conducted ethnographies of these unique neighborhoods that maintain social control without the traditional elements of high socioeconomic status (SES) and access to public social control like reliable law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986213485619">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986213485619">Hunter, 1985</xref>). The findings of the aforementioned research paint the picture that many times collective efficacy and tight social networks can protect a neighborhood, even if those social networks stem from existing criminal activity like street gangs or drug dealing. In sum, not all perceived safe neighborhoods are White, affluent, and crime free, lending support to the argument that reputation, collective efficacy and social networks are far more important than SES and racial segregation to defending a neighborhood.</p>
<p>Italian ethnic concentration, typically studied qualitatively on limited populations, has been notably discussed as an influence on neighborhood protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485619">McIllwain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte, 1943</xref>). Ethnographies paint Italians as commanding authority in their respective neighborhoods based on a reputation for violence and a rumored relationship to the Italian American organized crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986213485619">Lombardo &amp; Lurigio, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte, 1943</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1043986213485619">
<title>The Defended Neighborhood</title>
<p>Suttles discusses defended neighborhoods to describe communities whose members collectively eradicate selected delinquency and crime from their community. “The residential group which seals itself off through the efforts of delinquent gangs, by restrictive covenants, by sharp boundaries, or by a forbidding reputation—what I will call the defended neighborhood—was for a time a major category in sociological analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>, p. 21). These communities are able to exert formal and informal social controls on community residents, on outsiders to the neighborhood, or on both. The literature makes clear that four elements are necessary to establish a successful defended neighborhood: fear, reputation, organization, and social control. The following sections will present an overview of these elements of defended neighborhoods.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043986213485619">
<title>Fear and Reputation</title>
<p>Personal views of a neighborhood vary; for some it might be the two block radius from their home, for others it might be the area they travel between their job and their home, and for others their “neighborhood” is simply the street on which they live. However, there are typically general areas defined by the public and adopted by residents that are considered “neighborhoods” and are often used as a reference point for residents to identify where they live. In several larger cities, including Chicago and New York City, these neighborhoods have official status and have been widely used by planning agencies and other municipal offices, in some cases for over a century.</p>
<p>Suttles writes, “‘The Neighborhood,’ . . . has a more fixed referent and usually possesses a name and some sort of reputation known to persons other than the residents” (p. 37). This public reputation of a neighborhood is often its most important asset, and it is the responsibility of neighborhood residents to establish and maintain this reputation. For residents to become actively involved in securing their neighborhood, first there must be an element of fear. This perceived threat could stem from inside or outside the neighborhood; but there has to be a feeling of imminent danger or “urban unease” on some level for people to take up the cause of their neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986213485619">Boggs, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986213485619">Liska &amp; Baccaglini, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043986213485619">Skogan &amp; Maxfield, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986213485619">Taylor &amp; Hale, 1986</xref>). Residents must create a reputation of fear for the rest of the city and find a successful way to advertise their defenses, letting others know that if they mess with people in this neighborhood, there will be negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>). This can be done through the social networks they create that collectively comprise the organization of the neighborhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043986213485619">
<title>Organization</title>
<p>Shaw and McKay explain that the more organized the residents are in neighborhoods, the more social control the neighborhood experiences and, therefore, the lower the levels of violent crime, and deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986213485619">DeSena, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986213485619">Kornhauser, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986213485619">Shaw &amp; McKay, 1942/1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte (1943)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles (1972)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986213485619">Kornhauser (1979)</xref> recognize that those with low SES and high rates of delinquency or violent crime do not necessarily suffer from a lack of organization. Whyte discusses the “Millers” and their highly organized order of operations, despite their low SES. Organizing to protecting turf from outsiders, despite the status of the neighborhood, and successfully maintaining relatively “safe” streets, regardless of SES, is part of the key to “defended neighborhoods.”</p>

<title>Social Control (or Networks)</title>
<p>Hunter disaggregates social control into three categories: personal, public, and parochial. <italic>Personal</italic> control is among families and friends; those who are closest to each other have a stronger effect on monitoring and maintaining desired behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986213485619">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986213485619">Hunter, 1985</xref>). “Within such groups, social control is usually achieved through the allocation or threatened withdrawal of sentiment, social support, and mutual esteem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986213485619">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 2001</xref>, p. 16). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986213485619">Hirschi (1969/2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986213485619">Kornhauser (1979)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986213485619">Crutchfield, Geerken, &amp; Gove (1982)</xref> describe family composition as an important factor in organizing and stabilizing a community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986213485619">Sampson (1985)</xref> writes, “It is suggested that areas with pronounced family disorganization are less able to provide an effective network of social controls. In contrast, communities with a strong familial base are likely to be areas where families know each other and provide mutual support” (p. 11). Family composition appears to be a key factor in the defended neighborhood. <italic>Parochial</italic> control derives from schools, churches, and other formal institutions that expect certain behaviors from participants. Bursik and Grasmick clarified that “. . . the parochial order refers to relationships among neighbors who do not have the same sentimental attachment” (p. 17). Finally, <italic>public</italic> control comes from the police department and other government agencies. “The second, and perhaps most important, external resource concerning the control of crime concerns the relationships that exist between the neighborhood and the police department of the city in which it is located” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986213485619">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 2001</xref>, p. 17). A defended neighborhood is at its strongest if all three of these aspects of control are maintained. Neighborhoods that have strong family composition, solid public schools, and a reasonable amount of money to support their police department have a stronger defense against delinquency and street crime. “Hence, the greater density of networks among persons in a community, the greater the constraint on deviant behavior within the purview of the social network” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986213485619">Krohn, 1986</xref>, p. 84).</p>

<sec id="section6-1043986213485619">
<title>Neighborhoods and Socioeconomics</title>
<p>“In cities and suburbs, middle-class neighborhoods may experience less noise and nuisance from teenagers and night-time revelers than working-class neighborhoods, but are usually quicker to seek official help eliminating it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986213485619">Cooney, 2009</xref>, p. 488). However, neighborhoods with any level of SES can achieve levels of social control. “In a very real sense, many of our slum communities in large cities come to approximate warrior societies because they must perform so much of their own policing and other functions which are ostensibly the responsibility of public institutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>, p. 191). Those of lower SES are many times more tightly networked than those who have more of an economic advantage, and they will personally fight for the neighborhood, taking up where the government leaves off. “In a sense, violent crime becomes a workplace dispute mechanism for them because it is one of the few viable social control options that they possess” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986213485619">Martinez, 2010</xref>, p. 190). The literature, however, makes clear that this is not an actual sign of social disorganization. “Thus in these defended communities, a significant amount of delinquency did not represent internal social disorganization but <italic>organized</italic> responses to perceived external threats” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986213485619">Heitgard &amp; Bursik, 1987</xref>, p. 785). Moreover, if a slum neighborhood has a reputation for violence or other street crime, it lowers the likelihood that outsiders will enter their territory; delinquency in one’s own neighborhood can be a deterrent to external threats. Other recent studies grounded in the defended neighborhoods perspective have emphasized the use of violence by residents in reaction to perceived external threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986213485619">Christopher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986213485619">Grattet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986213485619">Green, Strolovitch, &amp; Wong, 1998</xref>). Based in the existing literature, for a neighborhood to have the best defense against outsiders, it must have the elements of fear, reputation, social organization, and social control. Some urban neighborhoods with a heavy ethnic concentration, particularly Italian American, exhibit all of these characteristics. Neighborhoods with an Italian American organized crime presence possess all of the characteristics suggested for a defended neighborhood: fear, reputation, organization, and social control.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the Defended Organized Crime Neighborhood</title>
<sec id="section8-1043986213485619">
<title>Fear and Reputation</title>
<p>Fear is an essential component of the defended neighborhood and the public perception of Italian crime families invokes widespread fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986213485619">Boggs, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986213485619">Liska &amp; Baccaglini, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043986213485619">Skogan &amp; Maxfield, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986213485619">Taylor &amp; Hale, 1986</xref>). In cities with an active Italian organized crime families, it is commonly believed that you may be injured or killed if you do the wrong thing inside a neighborhood or business establishment controlled by the organized crime; this fear of immediate and severe punishment deters residents and outside street criminals from acting out. Discussing Chicago’s Addams neighborhood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles (1972)</xref> notes that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Italian boys, as well as the Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Black ones, tended to behave rather gingerly when in the presence of their Italian male elders. Rumor had it that many of the Italian males had ready access to professional “skullers” and could carry out heavy handed retaliation against anyone who challenged their authority or dignity. (p. 202)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A former resident of Chicago’s Little Italy explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>The outfit guys never bothered anybody except their own . . . If you’d cross them, they would take care of you . . . you could even say they protected the neighborhood. Nobody came on Taylor Street to do robberies or to break into houses, they’d be dead if they tried anything like that. (Respondent 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986213485619">Lombardo &amp; Lurigio, 1995</xref>, p. 106)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These are some of many examples where the social network of the Italian crime families has stabilized its reputation for violence. Rumors can have a profound effect on the behavior of people in particular neighborhoods, although they may be embellished and not completely based in reality.</p>
<p>The Italian American organized crime families have a notorious reputation for retaliating against those who cross them. This idea is reinforced in popular culture by films like the <italic>Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino</italic>, and <italic>Dick Tracy</italic> and TV series like <italic>The Sopranos.</italic> Without even coming into contact with Italian organized crime members, the general public already has a preconceived idea about the organization based on media representation.</p>
<p>The reputation of Italian American organized crime families and their association with particular neighborhoods is so strong that it extends far beyond adjacent communities; residents all over the city of Chicago are aware of the organized crime presence in different neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986213485619">Ianni &amp; Reuss-Ianni, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte, 1943</xref>). The Italian crime families not only put their roots in their neighborhoods; they tend to take over government, business, and local industry, for example, garbage trucks, construction, and manufacturing districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986213485619">Jacobs, Panarella, &amp; Worthington, 1994</xref>). As the Italian American organized crime families get deeply involved within a city, both financially and physically, more and more people become an indirect part of “this thing of ours” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986213485619">Block, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986213485619">Maas, 1999</xref>). “People who understood power and ‘the way things worked’ recognized the mafia as a force in politics, vice, and legitimate business including shipping, trucking, garbage disposal, and the garment trade” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986213485619">Jacobs et al., 1994</xref>, p. 3). Members of the five families were elected to government offices and took jobs in the police department to make things like bribery, extortion, and other crimes a bit easier, and to also allow for protection from the government and the police department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>). The Italian American organized crime families are rarely questioned or opposed by local law enforcement; a position they achieve through bribery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986213485619">Jacobs et al., 1994</xref>). “People fear the violence, because it often spills over and hurts innocent bystanders. But at the same time, people give the mob credit for occasionally mediating in community disputes and for enforcing a certain set of rules on the street” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986213485619">Dillon, 1992</xref>, p. 35). In neighborhoods defended by street gangs outsiders can see what they are up against, but in organized crime neighborhoods everything is behind closed doors. The blending of tall tales and true stories that circulate about the Italian American organized crime families maintains this reputation even if their presence wanes in a neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986213485619">Jacobs et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485619">McIllwain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986213485619">Whyte, 1943</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043986213485619">
<title>Organization</title>
<p>Italian organized crime keeps their families and their businesses under strict rules and codes that many times extend into their neighborhoods. The strict code of rules applies to their families and organization but also in the neighborhood they choose to live or work in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986213485619">Block, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986213485619">Ianni &amp; Reuss-Ianni, 1972</xref>). Criminologist James Jacobs from New York University also believes that the Italian crime families and other organized criminal activities can make a neighborhood safer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>). Jacobs said “Mafiosi were a force for stability in neighborhoods . . . They wanted to live in safe neighborhoods, and because they had a reputation for violence and a willingness to use violence, the neighborhoods in which they had presence were safe” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>, p. 60). The vast organization and social network that the Italian American organized crime families constructed is responsible for social control through its reputation, both real and rumored, for retaliation.</p>

<title>Social Control</title>
<p>A final detail of the defended Italian American organized crime neighborhoods is the emphasis on family values. As previously noted, family composition is a significant predictor of social disorganization and is most likely a significant factor in the organization of the Italian crime families and their neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485619">McIllwain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986213485619">Sampson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986213485619">Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989</xref>). The home life builds this personal control through emphasis on respect and trust. Because Italian heritage is one of the most important elements of <italic>La Cosa Nostra</italic> (except in Chicago, you cannot be considered for full membership unless you are Italian), many people involved in the organization carry the same family and religious values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986213485619">Ianni &amp; Reuss-Ianni, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986213485619">Maas, 1999</xref>). This makes it easier for the family values to cross over into the neighborhood; it is not solely fear that drives the organization; strong family values aid in creating a successfully defended neighborhood.</p>
<p>Within neighborhoods the crime families make trade-offs with residents so that their illegal businesses behind closed doors will not be of concern; providing safety for residents is one of the benefits of looking the other way in the presence of their illegal enterprises. The social network of Italian American organized crime extends far beyond their tiny neighborhood. “Network density refers to the extent to which all actors in a social network are connected by direct relations. When network density is high, the ability to control delinquency is increased because the behavior of participants in such a network is potentially subject to the reactions of all network members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986213485619">Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989</xref>, p. 779). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485619">Mcillwain (1999)</xref> discusses social networking as a new framework for understanding organized crime; the criminal organizations are successful on the large scale because they are so tightly networked. James Jacobs explains “So, the mafia was functional. That’s why it lasted so long, why it was so powerful, because it served needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>, p. 61).</p>
<p>Residents of neighborhoods with reputations for being home to Italian organized crime members are fully aware of the presence (both rumored and real) in their neighborhood, and the majority of those living there do not mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986213485619">Bohlen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986213485619">Dillon, 1992</xref>). For them it is extra security; the same kind of security that the mafia was initiated for back in Sicily; protection for those who cannot protect themselves. Despite the vast underworld of criminal activity, rumored the “outfit” neighborhoods are continually discussed as some of the safest neighborhoods within Chicago. Most Italian American concentrations that are rumored to be organized crime related are touted as being quiet, safe, family-oriented, and extremely aware of outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986213485619">Ianni &amp; Reuss-Ianni, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986213485619">Maas, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Most Italian American organized crime neighborhoods are also described as unchanged for decades; this could explain the ability of these neighborhoods to have such dense social networks and strong social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986213485619">DeStefano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986213485619">Maas, 1999</xref>). Having substantial time to develop and maintain reputations of quiet streets but underground fear enhances the effectiveness of collective efficacy and social control in these areas, lending further support to low mobility as suggested by social-disorganization theory. Strong organization, social networks, and the strong reputation for violence create fear and deter delinquency and street crime. Italian American concentrations within urban areas appear to have effective defended neighborhoods, because they tend to envelop all of the basic criteria set forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986213485619">Bursik and Grasmick (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986213485619">Shaw and McKay (1942/1969)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986213485619">Suttles (1972)</xref>.</p>
<p>The traditionally organized Italian American organized crime families possess the characteristics that are emphasized by defended neighborhood theory and would diffuse throughout the neighborhood. People are less likely to participate in overt illegal behaviors because they do not know who is watching, and the fear of what the crime families might do keeps residents and visitors to the neighborhood relatively well-behaved. This study provides a quantitative extension to the existing literature on defended neighborhoods, which up to this point has been predominantly ethnographic. Logically, a more holistic and quantitative approach can potentially be more generalizable than the existing qualitative studies because it goes beyond singular neighborhoods to estimate the trends within an entire city.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses that urban neighborhoods with high Italian American and White ethnic concentrations have lower violent crime counts compared with other sections of a city, the neighborhoods in Chicago are examined. As well as being the location for the previously referenced ethnographies, Chicago has a long and rich history of Italian American concentration as well as Italian American organized crime operations making it a prime location to test the protective factors of the Italian crime family reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986213485619">Holli &amp; Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986213485619">Nelli, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986213485619">Quaife, 1916</xref>).</p>
<p>Robbery is the crime measure of interest for this study. These violent crimes are a major concern for the public and the police in any urban area as they are overt and predatory. Furthermore, these data are some of the most reliable of all of the reported crime data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986213485619">O’Brien, 1985</xref>). “The severities of these violent crimes, coupled with their high visibility, make them the most reliably reported crimes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986213485619">Landau &amp; Fridman, 1993</xref>, p. 170). The influence of neighborhood reputation would have little effect on more covert or domestic crimes and therefore would not be used in an analysis of this type. The robbery counts were collected at the census tract level for Chicago, and then aggregated at the neighborhood level.</p>
<sec id="section12-1043986213485619">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section13-1043986213485619">
<title>Italian Ancestry</title>
<p>The proxy variable Italian Ancestry is defined as the percentage of residents in census tracts and neighborhoods in Chicago that report their first ancestry as Italian. This choice is based on two considerations. First, because of the origination of the Italian crime organization, potential recruits, and organizational strength are most likely to be concentrated in neighborhoods with a strong Italian presence. Second, the neighborhoods where some members of the outfit originated and gained reputation in Chicago were at one point Italian enclaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986213485619">Gage, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986213485619">Holli &amp; Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986213485619">Ianni &amp; Reuss-Ianni, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986213485619">Maas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986213485619">McIllwain, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043986213485619">
<title>Ethnic Concentration</title>
<p>The problem with this choice of a proxy measurement for Italian American organized crime presence is that social-disorganization theory asserts that any neighborhood with a strong concentration of an ethnic group would enjoy lowered crime levels because of the ameliorating effect of population homogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986213485619">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993</xref>). This introduces an alternative explanation: if a negative relationship between percentage of Italians and homicide rates is found, it may have nothing specifically to do with Italian concentration, but more to do with an ethnic enclave per se. The variable Ethnic Concentration will be included in a second model that excludes percentage of Italians. This variable is measured as the highest percentage of any White ethnic group within each census tract or neighborhood; if ethnic concentration per se reduces the robbery count in Chicago neighborhoods, this variable should have a negative and significant effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043986213485619">
<title>Neighborhood Characteristics</title>
<p>The following data are measures of the neighborhood characteristics that consistently have been associated with different levels of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986213485619">Land, McCall, &amp; Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986213485619">McCall, Land &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>). The neighborhood demographic and socioeconomic characteristics included in the analyses are percentage of Blacks, percentage of population on public assistance, percentage of households headed by females with dependent children, population change from 2000 to 2010, population density, median family income, percentage of owner-occupied housing, percentage of population with high school or higher education, and percentage of population below 18.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1043986213485619">
<title>Socioeconomic Indicators</title>
<p>The percentage of households on public assistance, the percentage with official poverty status, the percentage of households headed by females with dependent children, percentage using public transit as their only option, the percentage of owner-occupied housing, and the percentage with high school or higher education are included as indicators of the SES of the areas examined.</p>
<p>The measures for low SES showed serious multicollinearity (variance inflation factor, VIF ≥ 4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986213485619">Fisher &amp; Mason, 1981</xref>). Therefore the variables measuring public assistance, poverty, female-headed households, and education of high school or higher were converted to <italic>z</italic> scores and combined into a composite variable called low SES. Because of the direction of the relationship between an education of high school or higher and both robbery and homicide, this <italic>z</italic> score was multiplied by −1 before it was added with the other variables to calculate the composite variable measuring low SES. The variables measuring public transit and owner-occupied housing were left out of the composite variable based on the variance inflation factor scores below 4 and their insignificant relationships in the factor analysis. Instead, they are used separately as additional controls for SES.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1043986213485619">
<title>Other Measures</title>
<p>A variable that measures mobility is used because social-disorganization theory suggests higher population mobility can lead to augmented crime rates. This variable is defined as the percentage of the population that moved to a different house in the past 3 years. Population density has been positively associated with increased levels of homicide in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986213485619">McCall et al., 2010</xref>). This variable is defined as the population per square mile in each city. Percentage of population below 18 is the percentage of those below the age of 18 in each level of aggregation for Chicago; the assumption being that individuals below the age of 18 are more susceptible to becoming involved in criminal activity. The Black homicide rate is substantially higher than that for Whites in the United States, so percentage of Blacks is included as a measure of racial population composition and defined as the total percentage of residents who identify themselves as Black in the census tracts and neighborhoods for Chicago.</p>
<p>The following independent variables are available in percentages for each census tract from the American Community Survey (2006-2010). However, to obtain the total percentages for the Chicago neighborhood data that are aggregated from the Chicago census tract, some individual variables are calculated. Percentage of households headed by females is calculated by dividing the number of households headed by females by the total number of households in the district and multiplying by 100. The percentage below the age of 18 is calculated by dividing the number below 18 by the total population of the tract and multiplying by 100. Population density is calculated by dividing the total population by the number of square miles in the neighborhood.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section18-1043986213485619">
<title>Data Collection and Analyses</title>
<p>Data for demographic and socioeconomic indicators comes from the United States Census American Community Survey averages for 2006 to 2010. The crime data were collected as counts from the Chicago Police Department’s 2010 and 2011 reported crime data. The crime data for Chicago came with coordinate projections so the crime counts were visible on a map of Chicago census tracts; a neighborhood map overlay was used to get the same crime counts at the neighborhood level.</p>
<p>The units of analysis for this study are Chicago census tracts and the listed Chicago neighborhoods; these are used as proxy measures for the general idea of neighborhood or community within an urban locale. The research on neighborhoods and crime commonly employs this methodology, so the choice to approximate neighborhoods has a well-established foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986213485619">Bernasco &amp; Block, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986213485619">Graif &amp; Sampson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986213485619">Hipp, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986213485619">Sampson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986213485619">Stultz, 2010</xref>). For the given data, there are 786 census tracts for Chicago city, 220 neighborhoods for Chicago city, the Geographical Areas Reference Manual cites 2,500 to 8,000 people as the average populations for census tracts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043986213485619">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>, pp. 1-17).</p>
<p>A negative binomial regression analysis is used to examine the relationships between the social characteristics and robbery in Chicago. Similar to the Poisson regression, but considered to be a more general model, the negative binomial regression can account for greater variance in the model (Berk &amp; Macdonald, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986213485619">Gardner, Mulvey, &amp; Shaw, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986213485619">Land, McCall, &amp; Nagin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986213485619">Osgood, 2000</xref>). When measuring crimes at lower aggregate levels like census tracts and neighborhoods, more zeros will be present in the data, thereby increasing the variance between cases by a large number and affecting a normal distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986213485619">Gardner et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986213485619">Land et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986213485619">Osgood, 2000</xref>). Therefore, the count variables of robbery and homicide are logged by the regression model so as to create a normal distribution.</p>

When all other variables are held constant, the robbery rate will decrease by a factor of .988 for every 1% increase in the below 18 population.

<title>Predicting Robbery in Chicago</title>
<p>The significance of percentage of Italian and White ethnic concentration are important to the initial hypotheses. In both Chicago census tracts and Chicago neighborhoods, an increase in the percentage of Italians is significantly related to a lowered count of robbery. While it is unscientific to speculate that this is due to Italian organized crime presence, it can rather be thought of as an influence of public reputation as a result of the Italian American organized crime presence having been a more prominent issue in the past. In an urban area, once a neighborhood achieves a particular reputation (be it for gangs, organized crimes, or families), it carries this reputation long after many of the residents move out or on. Neighborhoods with high concentration of Italians still carry the reputation of the 1950s and 1960s where ties to the underworld or other political influences were standard. These assumed behaviors are what aid in the reduction of overt criminal activity in their neighborhoods. Because many urban residents are always uncertain as to the explicit connections of the Italians, they air on the side of caution and try not to disrupt the peace; no one wants to accidentally anger an organized crime boss.</p>
<p>However, the significance of White ethnic concentration at both aggregate levels for robbery suggest that also having large percentages of White ethnic concentrations within a community (which include Italian) provide similar reductions in the robbery count. This does not necessarily indicate a lack of support for the idea that there would be a stronger relationship between Italian communities and robbery because a portion of the ethnic concentration measure is Italian. On the other hand, these results support the idea of population homogeneity as a mechanism for social control and defended neighborhoods. Communities with common interests and common goals have greater success at protecting their neighborhoods through reputation and social networks; stands to reason that if these communities have similar ethnic backgrounds, they would share some common interests and common goals as well as maintain a community reputation.</p>
<p>Quantitatively testing the concept of defended neighborhoods and the theories of social control can overlook some neighborhood contextual effects such as community dynamics and other social factors that can influence neighborhood crime. For the purposes of this study, it is important to keep in mind the possible contextual effects cited in prior ethnographic research (i.e., the development of gangs, community solidarity, and other such neighborhood influences) when considering the implications of the present study. Interviews and observations of Italian neighborhoods within the literature highlight the protective factors of an organized crime reputation and this pattern of Italian American concentrations significantly predicting robbery in Chicago is empirically supported here.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although it has not been quantitatively tested before, there is a seemingly distinct pattern across Chicago that communities that have large populations with Italian ancestry also have lower counts of robbery. The reason for this pattern can only be speculated at this point and, of course, the ideas of reputation and Italian American organized crime presence are at the top of the list of explanations. This study suggests that there must be some reason why the Italian American dominated neighborhoods significantly predict the violent crime counts of robbery in Chicago.</p>
<p>The immense history of Italian American organized crime presence within these cities is the longest in the country and is most easily argued as the persistence of reputation in the present day. However, it must be considered that this study looks at three different levels of aggregation and a proper comparison and generalization cannot be made in this instance. Only a platform for future examination with appropriate level data can be assessed at this time. In any case, regardless of scientific accuracy, it still remains quite suspect that percentage of Italians would carry so much significance in urban areas that are known for the illicit dealings of the Italian American organized crime. Perhaps the organized crime presence is as influential as we think, but there is a lack of quantitative proof.</p>
<p>Hidden populations are a common problem in social research; it is not unheard of to approximate to scientifically advance our knowledge. So while this is a limitation for drawing solid conclusions, it is a step in the direction of further understanding the influence of the hidden population, the Italian American organized crime. For now, moving forward with the knowledge that there is a distinct pattern for the significant and negative relationship between Italian American concentration and the counts of robbery and homicide will suffice. This pattern should be critically thought about and discussed in future scholarly endeavors.</p>

<p>After calculating univariate Global Moran’s I for the robbery count t in Chicago neighborhoods and census tracts the Moran’s I scores were not significant. This indicates that robberies (<italic>I</italic> = .44, <italic>z</italic> = 1.86), in Chicago census tracts and Chicago neighborhoods (<italic>I</italic> = .3, <italic>z</italic> = 1.42) are likely to be occurring by random chance and not influenced by neighboring areas.
