<abstract>
<p>Researchers are often encouraged to shape an existing theoretical framework around their arguments to make them more convincing to readers. This can improve the coherence of their narratives and better ground them in existing literature. However, overarching theoretical frameworks can in many cases serve to insulate the author’s unique and presumably novel arguments from criticism concerning omitted variables and ambiguous causal direction. After discussing reasons authors appropriate external theoretical frameworks into their papers I suggest that relying on a small number of prestigious overarching theories as explanatory, rather than simply organizational frameworks may have subtle and pernicious influences on inquiry by (a) restricting the boundaries of the phenomena that are considered relevant, (b) introducing barriers to changing or supplanting theories, (c) biasing estimation of relationships due to omitted variables, (d) encouraging authors to exclude contradictory evidence and insights from their narratives, and (e) limiting how scholars evaluate theoretical contributions.</p>

<p>“Hawkeye Pierce” (character in the television show M*A*S*H)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Often after absorbing painful rejection of their work submitted to journals, scholars learn quickly that in order to publish an article in a high-quality research journal their arguments in developing their model and its constituent hypotheses need to be developed in a more “convincing” manner. While organizational scholars have access to stores of knowledge and opinion as to the elements of a good theory, a good theoretical contribution, and modes of thinking about how to achieve these ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2041386612459536">Dubin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2041386612459536">Weick, 1989</xref>), very little has been published about exactly how one goes about rewriting arguments used to develop one’s hypotheses in a way that is more convincing. To some extent this is a craft we learn by writing and getting feedback from mentors, colleagues, reviewers, and editors. We learn what “works” in terms of avoiding criticism and moving the reader along a “garden path” toward the conclusion that our hypotheses are suitable. We may later come to believe that a higher “hit rate” of acceptance of our work is evidence that our theory development is maturing, and that our learning and application of “tactics” has played at most a minor role in any publishing success. Given the level of critical examination afforded to other aspects of our theories and our theory development processes, it is surprising to me how little scrutiny organizational psychology and management scholars give to our explicit and implicit assumptions about how we <italic>write</italic> theory.</p>
<p>An author may have an inherently sound theory that is a potentially major contribution to understanding some organizational phenomenon, but if his or her ideas are not organized and presented in a manner that boundedly rational humans can process efficiently and which fits their schema of a good theoretical argument, it is likely to be labeled as “unconvincing.” I sometimes wonder if our tactics for communicating theoretical ideas in a way that is convincing to reviewers has outstripped advancement in the actual quality of our theories. Use of tactics in communicating ideas may be more influential to publishing success and scholarly impact than most scholars may realize. This may help to explain the low optimism that is often expressed about the progress of knowledge development in the organizational psychology/behavior (OP/OB) literature. Like politicians who desire to have a useful impact but want even more to be reelected, we often serve up what we believe is appealing to our base (reviewers) and party gatekeepers (editors) and avoid bolder initiatives.</p>
<p>Other explanations for a slow rate of scientific progress, such as inadequate paradigm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2041386612459536">Pfeffer, 1993</xref>), may be more accurate in research areas in which the adequacy criterion prevails. Few areas in OP/OB use a criterion of adequacy in judging contributions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2041386612459536">Brief &amp; Dukerich, 1991</xref>) because in most of our constituent domains reviewers and editors are not confident that accumulated evidence from studies can serve a substantial role in advancing knowledge. Technical adequacy is emphasized more often in topical areas that rely almost exclusively on laboratory experimentation, such as judgment and decision making and negotiation, and very quantitatively driven areas such as employee selection. In these areas reviewers and editors strive to identify novelty, promote logical coherence, and fix errors in design and analysis. When an adequacy criterion does not prevail, more emphasis is placed on judging the <italic>extent</italic> of a theoretical contribution, and thus the need is greater for authors to use more convincing approaches to communicating their conceptual merits. Therefore it should not be surprising that there is a high level of disagreement in most areas of OP/OB as to whether a given article is a sufficiently meaningful contribution to warrant publication in our premier journals.</p>
<p>In this paper I will not be discussing theory formulation per se, but rather the devices and tactics scholars are encouraged to use in their writing in order to garner acceptance in the review process. While I acknowledge the benefits of incorporating guiding theoretical frameworks to frame unique conceptual arguments, this approach may also have pernicious influences on the scope and richness of our thinking. I suggest that appropriating a prestigious theoretical framework as a framing device often becomes the end in itself rather than a means toward a more coherent theory development that is better tied to existing literature. Because we rely more upon assessments of “convincingness” than methods and findings, our assumptions about theory development, together with the incentives they create, may be undermining progress in OP/OB by limiting the conceptual landscapes that we consider and reducing consensus about the qualities of a conceptual contribution.</p>
<sec id="section1-2041386612459536">
<title>Theoretical framing as a tactic</title>
<p>Part of the process of maturing as a scholar is to learn tactics for communicating theoretical arguments. By “tactics” I am referring to the packaging of one’s conceptualization, not to the gift of formulating a sound theoretical framework. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2041386612459536">Cohen, March, and Olsen’s (1972)</xref> metaphor about organizational decision making, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2041386612459536">Martin (1982</xref>) suggested that theory formulation in the social sciences can be characterized as a “garbage can process.” As Martin noted, once we have what are the essential elements of our own theory, there is much rooting around the can in an effort to persuade our readers, both before and after we put pen to paper. My focus in this paper is on the post hoc appropriation of an “overarching theoretical framework” to structure one’s paper, which is one component of Martin’s reality-based model of the research process.</p>
<p>Presuming you have done at least a little reviewing, you probably have read (or composed) decision letters in which the authors were encouraged to revise and resubmit a paper after incorporating an overarching theoretical framework around their ideas. I’ll also bet you have read (and very likely submitted) a revision which presented a theoretical framework that did not exist in the first version. Did the quality of the arguments improve in any way? If they did improve, I suspect that you were too rushed in submitting the initial paper, or the review process provided you with some really good arguments you had not previously considered. Now consider your own best work. Did the core ideas crystallize through your thinking about the phenomenon from the perspective of some broad theory? Unless you were tinkering with that theory as part of an effort to improve it, I suspect not. Normally organizational scholars’ ideas about a specific phenomenon evolve from their own ideas about that phenomenon, what others have written or said about it, and relatively disciplined use of their imaginations. But it is common practice to appropriate others’ theories to frame one’s own arguments post hoc. I expect few would disagree in principle that it is often useful to use others’ theories to frame one’s own arguments. But in many cases I wonder, “What is the appropriated theory useful for, the publication of the work or the quality of the ideas?” A theory can be overlaid onto an existing set of arguments in a way that enhances the quality of the arguments themselves in no way whatsoever, but which helps makes the paper more convincing to reviewers.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2041386612459536">Sutton and Staw (1995</xref>) noted, our field is populated by many perspectives concerning how one should develop theory. I will leave it to others to argue about which perspective on theory development should be imposed on our world, or whether a diversity of perspectives is better. But in the meantime we can all think more critically about what it really means to develop novel ideas by utilizing an overarching theoretical framework, and perhaps this will produce a more realistic sense of the value, and pitfalls, of appropriating such frameworks to structure the narratives of particular research studies. This is not the first article, even in this series, to question conventional wisdom of how one goes about developing a theoretical contribution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2041386612459536">Ferris, Hochwarter, &amp; Buckley, 2012</xref>), but I am not familiar with any published work that has sought to encourage scrutiny of the particular practice of using another’s broader theory as an overarching framework to “guide” one’s own arguments and the specific tactics that are required to do this successfully. By “successfully” I mean in a way that is convincing to reviewers.</p>
<p>To frame my discussion I will describe contingencies facing an imaginary doctoral student. Suppose a student develops an interest in a phenomenon that he believes other researchers have not examined fully enough, say romantic relationships in organizations. (I am using the male pronoun to avoid the complexity of using “he or she,” and also to avoid being dismissed as an ogre for implying that only a woman could be interested in studying romantic relationships. Even one’s choice of pronouns is a tactic.) Our young scholar may very carefully review the literature in all related areas and develop some seemingly novel ideas about what precipitates and sustains the phenomenon. His model includes characteristics of males and females, differences in relationship quality, antecedents of personal intimacy, etcetera, and it describes how these variables together form a process that determines the propensity for amorous couplings within work units. (Do I have your attention?)</p>
<p>Next, a mentor hears his presentation and kills his buzz by expressing her low opinion of the model, noting that it does not present an overarching theoretical framework. Why not frame it in terms of social identity theory (SIT) or social exchange theory (SET), or some such prestigious framework? If his model includes variables suitable for both SET and SIT (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2041386612459536">Flynn, 2005</xref>), his mentor might suggest that the novelty of his arguments could be even more convincing if he has the right variables and he integrates them deftly. Better yet, can he integrate theory regarding sexual selection into an exchange-based perspective? We have not seen that before and that certainly would be “sexy” if it was done with great clarity; you would be positioning yourself in some very good company; and so forth. These are all such wonderful ideas that the student is reminded why he is lucky to have chosen this doctoral program. However, as I will discuss in what follows, it is one thing to appropriate a broader theory as an <italic>organizing</italic> framework and quite another to allow it to serve as an <italic>explanatory</italic> framework which supplants much of the novelty in his thinking and may even confine his later thinking about the topic to the conceptual and empirical orthodoxies that are imposed by the framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2041386612459536">
<title>Benefits of post hoc theoretical framing</title>
<p>The “right” reasons to incorporate an overarching theoretical framework around one’s preexisting conceptual model are compelling enough. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2041386612459536">Shalley (2012</xref>) observed. “it is also very important to place the new conceptual ideas that you have developed within the context of prior work in order to demonstrate how you are advancing theory” (2012, p. 5). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2041386612459536">Sparrowe and Mayer (2011</xref>) noted that “it is important to avoid … focusing exclusively on the argument and ignoring prior related conversation…. Entering the conversation in previous research means engaging the underlying theoretical narrative that is the foundation for past empirical research” (2011, p. 1098). Second, use of preexisting theory to frame new models is considered a means of persuading other scholars that appropriate constructs have been included. Third, to the extent that some key constructs described in the preexisting theory are included in his model, then it is less likely that other scholars will argue that he has omitted important variables. They are also less likely to question the causal order of his constructs or whether this or that variable should be specified as a mediator rather than as a moderator, assuming his arguments about such processes are consistent with the broader theory (Theory A, hereafter). Considering the limitations of the data in our field, such as cross-sectional sampling, some preexisting schema is normally needed to identify the most suitable hypotheses and interpret the findings.</p>
<p>Framing his theory within a Theory A that is broad and prestigious might also be good advice for the new scholar, especially given that he should want to publish his article in a good journal and convince other academics that he is very capable of developing good theory. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2041386612459536">Peter and Olson (1983</xref>) noted, scholars are more successful (in publishing) in using others’ theories when the theory has high status, meaning it has been widely promulgated in the field by the most respected researchers. It also helps, according to Peter and Olsen, when the theory is not too complicated for others to understand and does not contain elements that conflict with the prevailing values and social schemas of other scholars. Theoretical frameworks such as social exchange theory and social identity theory are, especially at the rather superficial level that is considered sufficient to understand them, both easy to understand and intrinsically appealing to many scholars.</p>
<p>It is also important that one’s “overarching theoretical framework” was developed in a larger, more broadly respected field, rather than being “invented here,” in the smaller area to which the scholar seeks to contribute, such as organizational psychology/behavior. For example, SIT and SET have pedigrees in both sociology and psychology. Other similarly broad and prestigious theories that are frequently utilized to frame organizational behavior/psychology research include attribution theory, reinforcement theory, social cognitive theory, social information processing theory, self-determination theory, person–environment fit theory, social comparison theory, multilevel theory, regulatory focus theory, expectancy theory, and conservation of resources theory. Scholars also convincingly use established theories that are narrower in the scope of phenomena they were developed to explain. A few examples are justice theories (e.g., the group value model, fairness heuristic theory, the relational model of authority in groups, the group engagement model), prospect theory, social dominance theory, affective events theory, goal setting theory, the job characteristics model, control theory, cognitive categorization theory, and uncertainty management theory. But it is less likely that an author could generate, let alone publish in premier journals, a series of genuinely distinct articles relating to a topic that utilizes the same “narrower” framework (“Didn’t Sherzzbuk already publish an article using a social dominance approach to workplace romance?”).</p>
<p>If our young scholar can persuade the reader that an “exchange perspective” is, when combined with the dollop of sexual selection (which persuades readers he is fully cognizant of the physical dimensions of his problem as well as the social and psychological ones), sufficient for framing his research question, then many other speculations and critiques are less likely to be directed toward him. If reviewers suggest there are a host of other variables that may be omitted relevant causes, he can retort that “from an exchange perspective” these are not relevant. In what follows I will discuss why this counterpoint should not necessarily succeed in dismissing these reviewer complaints, but it is remarkable how often it does. Scholars are more accepting that another’s arguments have sufficient scope when the author has delimited the theoretical universe. For example, our student ultimately may elect not to include sexual selection in his framing because doing so might provoke questions that are difficult for him to answer definitively, such as “What about workplace romances among gay employees—does sexual selection apply to them as well? If so, how?” and stone walls, such as, “You haven’t convinced me that these sexual selection principles really apply to empowered women.” Thus it is often prudent for a scholar to frame his or her paper in such a way as to insulate his model from troublesome questions and reviewer biases. Sexual selection processes may be operating, but they can be compartmentalized out of the discussion through the use of framing. This may avoid a frustrating entanglement with a reviewer, but to the extent the end result is a less accurate or comprehensive explanation for the phenomenon the field is the loser.</p>
<p>It also benefits our emerging scholar that there are a number of different social identity and social exchange theories, and so he can follow the example of other authors by selectively making reference to various different writings about the theory that are useful to framing different components of his model while ignoring others. Assuming he chooses to use social exchange theory, he does not need to commit himself to the framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2041386612459536">Homans (1958</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2041386612459536">Gouldner (1960</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2041386612459536">Blau (1964</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2041386612459536">Emerson (1976</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2041386612459536">Kelley and Thibault (1978</xref>), or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2041386612459536">Foa and Foa (1980</xref>). He can cite each of them where it best suits his argument. Citing more than one may signal all the more convincingly that he is cognizant of the breadth of the social exchange literature. Our student can also draw variables and arguments from narrower theories that were framed using these social exchange “perspectives,” such as leader–member exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2041386612459536">Graen &amp; Scandura, 1987</xref>). This rather high degree of wiggle room in committing oneself to a theoretical structure also applies to social identity theory, attribution theory, person–environment fit theory, social comparison theory, and multilevel theory. But it is less applicable for certain other favored Theories A, such as social cognitive theory, self-determination theory, and conservation of resources theory, because (arguably) only one version of these theories exists.</p>
<p>But what should guide the scholar’s thinking when doing the actual writing that is demanded to incorporate Theory A into his arguments? First, he should be careful to explain <italic>why</italic> this overarching theoretical perspective is so useful for organizing his narrative. (If he really believes the theory also adds explanatory value he must take pains to explain how his ideas are not simply derivative from the theory.) Most reviewers can distinguish a lame attempt to superimpose a theory from a good one. It is just as important to persuade readers of the usefulness of one’s Theory A for one’s present purpose as it is to ensure that the reader appreciates the importance and novelty of his research question and the quality of his unique arguments. A number of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2041386612459536">Whetten’s (1989)</xref> principles about what makes a good theory also apply to what makes a good application of someone else’s theory: What is it about Theory A that applies to my study (“What?”)? In what ways does the theory apply to my study (“How?”)? What underlying dynamics of Theory A are valuable for describing why one variable in my model is related to another (“Why?”)?</p>
<p>In short, an astute reviewer will question how the Theory A helps him advance his arguments. Of course, this may beg the question as to why the same reviewer thought the author needed to incorporate a Theory A to make his existing ideas more convincing in the first place. In my own view a good reason for a reviewer to have done so might be shared with the author in a way like this:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I like your research question and several of your ideas. They may affect how scholars think about these issues because…. I also think you have high quality data. But your narrative looks like spaghetti and I got a headache trying to make sense of it all. I think your study should be published, but if it were published in its current form others would suffer headaches. It would also be embarrassing to the journal to publish such an article if you don’t come up with some scheme for pulling this together into a coherent text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Referring to the broader theoretical framework in developing his hypotheses will likely only succeed in convincing reviewers, however, if he can make seemingly intuitive connections between Theory A and his arguments which make the theory convincing as an <italic>organizing</italic> framework. These connections can be particularly helpful to explain why particular constructs are entering the narrative or to justify causal directionality. But if the theory does not provide guideposts for incorporating constructs or “back up” certain causal processes that apply directly to his model, scholars are likely to perceive the theory as “window dressing” rather than a genuine application. My own view is that this difference is often more apparent than real. There are many ways one can organize the same unique arguments. Opting out of using one of the relatively few Theories A that have been promulgated in OP/OB would not necessarily affect the actual contribution of his arguments to the literature. Thus whereas it is necessary to “engage the underlying theoretical narrative that has grounded past research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2041386612459536">Sparrowe &amp; Mayer, 2011</xref>, p. 1098), it is not always prudent to attempt to frame one’s theory in terms of another theory, particularly if the latter is not a precise explanatory framework for the author’s conceptual linkages and it is employed in an effort to explain rather than simply to organize the narrative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2041386612459536">
<title>Costs and limitations of appropriating theoretical frames</title>
<p>Although appropriating overarching theoretical frameworks has advantages for achieving coherence and delimiting focus, the use of prestigious (and sometimes not so prestigious) frameworks often succeeds more in insulating authors from criticism than in edifying their readers. But my concerns about scholars’ felt need to appropriate existing theoretical frames post hoc into their narratives reflect broader issues about using mainstay theories to frame research in organizational behavior/psychology <italic>in general</italic>. There are costs of reframing models in terms of broader theories that are seldom, if ever, considered in writing about theory development. These include restricting the range of phenomena and mechanisms underlying each phenomenon that are considered relevant, restricting how one can advance a new theory, producing potentially misleading statistical results, encouraging potentially misleading “garden path” approaches to developing hypotheses, and reinforcing an almost profound superficiality in the way many scholars come to understand and appreciate what constitutes a genuine theoretical contribution.</p>
<sec id="section4-2041386612459536">
<title>Restriction of theoretical range</title>
<p>To the extent that scholars believe only a small number of prestigious theoretical perspectives are credible enough to be used as Theories A, this substantially limits the types of questions that are considered valid to address and may encourage them to prune ideas that are not consistent with these theories. If anything involving workplace relationships has to be framed from a social exchange perspective, for example, then researchers will tend to limit themselves to conceptualizing relationships in terms of exchanges of resources. Relationships will be evaluated in terms of their structure, the frequency of exchanges, and types of resources exchanged. This effect of broader theories in stultifying conceptual work is reflected in the literature concerning social networks that has emerged in the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2041386612459536">Phelps, Heidl, &amp; Wadhwa, 2012</xref>). A central concept in this literature is “tie strength,” which differentiates strong and loose ties among actors in a network. It is based upon actors’ subjective assessments of their socioemotional closeness with other parties and the frequency of their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2041386612459536">Hansen, Mors, &amp; Løvås, 2005</xref>). For no apparent reason the formulation of tie strength seems conceptually bound to the way OP/OB researchers typically appropriate social exchange theory. Other variables related to the quality of work relationships, such as resource compatibility and alignment of personal goals, may be more influential in producing the outcomes of interest in the networks literature, such as knowledge sharing and innovation, than whether the parties like each other and talk a lot.</p>
<p>Organizational scholars should be careful to avoid confusing any of our favored theoretical frameworks with the standard model of physics, with which new models of specific phenomena need to be reconciled to demonstrate their validity. The theories that are favored in our literature are not sufficiently rich to generate an endless supply of novel and important predictions pertaining to the fairly limited range of phenomena that are deemed relevant to OP/OB, particularly when those theories play a large role in determining what is considered relevant to examine.</p>
<p>Scholars should also avoid compromising their theoretical innovations by relying on existing theories to define their relevant constructs when new conceptualizations of these constructs might lead to a richer model. Our field rewards a “pick one” mentality in choosing theoretical frameworks even when two or more theoretical frameworks might help organize the narrative around one’s ideas. Because reviewers and the authors themselves often conflate the value of a framework for organizing ideas with explanatory usefulness, authors who choose to discuss more than one broad theory in developing their arguments are often criticized for failing to show how the theories can be integrated in such a way that they will seem to have produced the author’s original ideas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2041386612459536">
<title>Creation of barriers to the entry of competing ideas</title>
<p>When a particular theoretical perspective becomes attached to a particular topic by a seminal article, this can become a roadblock for researchers who seek to be innovative and apply a different theoretical perspective to the same topic. One must convince reviewers that by focusing on aspects of a topic that are pertinent to a different theoretical base one’s new theory cannot be better explained by the originally favored theory. To accomplish this one normally must include measures that are suitable for testing both perspectives, and thus if the readers find the new ideas convincing, the assessment as to whether they should change prevailing thinking becomes an empirical exercise in which new concept measures compete for variance in outcome variables with the measures of constructs that are at least part of the established theory. But in many cases the established theoretical approach has a big advantage in any empirical competition for variance in dependent variables because the measures of the independent and dependent variables in the seminal work were contrived to maximize explained variance. To illustrate, the power literature focuses predominantly on the corrupting influences of power and the pernicious effects that powerful people have on others as a result of their tendencies to dehumanize people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2041386612459536">Gruenfeld, Inesi, Magee, &amp; Galinsky, 2008</xref>). Most of the research base is drawn from the laboratory and thus we merely learn what power holders might be capable of, not how power relations actually play out in the workplace. If a researcher were to seek to integrate a broader perspective in which less powerful people play a role in enacting relationships with the powerful, and power holders’ responses are also based on unique situational demands that arise from being accountable for outcomes, the kinds of empirical results he or she is likely to find might be very hard to reconcile with the laboratory findings.</p>
<p>Scholars’ expectations regarding the quality of a new theoretical framework should be high. However, by creating methodological barriers to entry, a given theoretical approach to investigating a phenomenon becomes, for all practical purposes, sacral.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2041386612459536">
<title>Producing potentially misleading statistical results</title>
<p>As I noted earlier, researchers often use major theoretical perspectives as a means to justify the narrow scope of the constructs they include in their tested model. For example, suppose a researcher seeks to explain cognitive effort on a task in terms of social identity. He or she would likely be permitted to ignore a very broad suite of other established predictors of effort on tasks of the same nature because the other work used a completely different theoretical perspective. However, an omitted relevant cause (i.e., an unmeasured variable that commonly correlates with predictor and criterion variables in one’s model) has the same effect, biased coefficients, even when it has no scholarly kinship with the variables in the model. Thus relying upon an overarching theoretical framework because others have done so can encourage the omission of relevant causes and accordingly produce consistently misleading results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2041386612459536">
<title>Encouraging “garden path” writing</title>
<p>Advancements in our field depend on intellectually honest exposition that identifies the most pertinent links of new arguments to established arguments and other knowledge. For example, there are often pertinent studies and findings that are directly relevant to the plausibility of a hypothesis but which may contradict the narrative which advances toward the hypothesis. To maintain a focus on a theoretical narrative, it is often deemed unnecessary to consider such inconvenient facts because they lie outside the scope of the theoretical narrative that the author has chosen. Readers would be more edified about the literature base surrounding the topic if more authors were to acknowledge these inconvenient facts and explain why they believe that they are not pertinent to their model of the phenomenon. This concern is not exclusive to work that is framed within a broader theory, but I believe that such theories are often used to insulate the authors from providing a more thorough grounding of their topic in the existing literature. Doctoral students often learn from their professors that they should lead readers down a garden path which leads inescapably to their own conclusions. It was surprising to me that when I searched for “garden path” in Google Scholar and PsycArticles, there were no articles about theoretical writing or theoretical development that included this term. There were plenty of articles about psychological processes associated with reading “garden path” sentences. These are sentences that can be interpreted in different ways depending on one’s perceptual focus (e.g., “While Anna bathed the baby spit up on the bed”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2041386612459536">Patson, Darowski, Moon, &amp; Ferriera, 2009</xref>, p. 280). There are also discussions of garden path arguments, which are arguments in which the author emphasizes category elements associated with his or her favored premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2041386612459536">Feeney, Coley, &amp; Crisp, 2010</xref>). I don’t think we need to be concerned about either phenomenon. However, the lack of attention in published work to our own garden path metaphor is a subtle indication that it is an approach to communicating theory that professors teach their students but which no one wishes to endorse in a public forum by speaking its name. This used to be the case for hypothesizing results after they are known (“HARKing”), until Norbert Kerr wrote openly about it (N. L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2041386612459536">Kerr, 1998</xref>). I expect there will always be less controversy about garden path writing because it is widely viewed to be justified by an author’s theoretical focus. There is no prevailing justification for HARKing. But most of us have done it, or been party to it, at some point in our careers. Both issues illustrate the dictum of a different Kerr (Steve Kerr): The folly of rewarding A and hoping for B (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2041386612459536">Kerr, 1975</xref>).</p>

<title>Coarsening the evaluation of conceptual work</title>
<p>Emphasizing a small number of broad theories to guide investigations ultimately may be leading consumers of the literature to confuse an author’s facility in “integrating” broader theories into arguments that are novel with the actual extent to which he or she has developed theory. Thinking more clearly about how prestigious theories both advance and obscure critical thinking may better enable us to distinguish a genuinely novel and valuable conceptual argument from a retread cast from an overused framework that, in the context of the author’s research question, reifies an outmoded schema about the phenomenon. A better understanding of the limits of the contributions of Theories A to studies and a stronger desire to challenge prevailing assumptions about the applicability of those theories to specific phenomena might promote more agreement among reviewers about levels of conceptual contribution. This would remove a major root cause of the skepticism that many authors, including the most successful among us, express about the review process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2041386612459536">Pfeffer, 2007</xref>). If scholars can better agree on how to identify a theoretical contribution, this would likely translate into more rapid conceptual advances. Scholars would focus less attention on packaging their ideas using the insulation provided by broader theories and more attention on aspects of the phenomenon that were restricted from consideration by those theories.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although I have emphasized their pitfalls in this paper because I believe they are so rarely considered, developing scholars should be encouraged to learn how to develop broader understandings of phenomena through the use of existing theoretical frameworks. However, input from such frameworks need not always be so extensive as to constitute an overarching infrastructure that encompasses one’s already crystallized ideas. As I have emphasized in this paper, authors and reviewers should be encouraged to consider overarching theories not as explanatory frameworks their usefulness in shaping the arguments authors advance but rather for their usefulness in adding coherence to conceptual arguments. I believe that if one could accurately account for how most genuinely novel conceptual arguments crystallized, we would find that nearly all research that heavily references a broader theory as an explanatory framework has probably appropriated this frame post hoc. (If I seem too sure about the pervasiveness of researchers’ misuse, and overuse, of overarching theoretical frames, it may be due to self-based consensus bias. I have engaged in these practices as an author, reviewer, and an editor.) But whether one’s framework was incorporated post hoc or not should not matter in assessing his or her work. Good conceptual work is not path dependent.</p>
<p>The tasks of navigating through different literatures, learning research methods, and absorbing good advice about developing and interpreting theory are perplexing enough for a developing scholar. Calling into question how many scholars operationalize <italic>engaging the underlying theoretical narrative that is the foundation for past empirical research</italic> in their work might just feed youthful cynicism and misguided contempt for well-motivated scientific work. But I am optimistic that research mentors can be mindful of these issues without promoting cynicism. We need to come to grips with the implicit messages we send to new scholars by advocating use of external theoretical frames without also carefully explaining why we believe this will enable a better research model, if indeed it might, while also promoting a healthy self-awareness that doing so also insulates their work from reviewer criticism. In short, we should encourage new scholars to develop a promotion focus toward theory development as well as a prevention focus that is suitable for navigating the review process. We seek to help students learn a craft and to develop healthy, romanticized identities as discoverers in uncharted terrain, not to insulate themselves from the controversial and complex realities that one encounters upon entering these territories.</p>
