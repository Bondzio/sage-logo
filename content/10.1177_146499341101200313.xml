<p>The text emphasizes the global power dynamics that affect the interrelationship between society and the environment in particular for tourism-dependent communities through an analysis of coastal areas in Greece. With grounding in the international relations discourse surrounding the global political economy, global governance and global environmental politics, the author utilizes an effective structure in first espousing key conceptual arguments in the global environment in the first section of the book. In part two, these concepts are applied to context through the use of three case studies which emphasize different outcomes.</p>
<p>One of the unique qualities of this work is that it frames very popular issues of degradation, equity and consumption outside of the usual paradigm of sustainable development. This approach allows for a more critical analysis and facilitates a type of ‘outsider’s view’ of the issues in contrast to approaches taken in the sustainable development paradigm. It removes some of the previous simplistic notions that the problem is no more than a competition between man and his natural environment by highlighting more deep-seated concerns surrounding the interplay between society and the environment. For example, it gives resonance to complexity issues in environmental policy-making by claiming that in the face of economic challenges and competing policies of a myriad of sectors and the trade arena, environmental policies are usually relegated to the background. Furthermore, multiple levels of governance make it particularly difficult to galvanize support for a single environmental initiative.</p>
<p>In discussing the global political economy associated with the environmental effects of tourism, Kutting demonstrates that this complexity may only be addressed through a combination of structural and actor-based analyses. This is not the first work to articulate a structure-agency approach; however, it does so very coherently and succinctly by anchoring this debate in the sphere of the power-influence dynamic in tourism communities. The important point is made that varying structures and circumstances collide in a touristic environment, such as those of tourists, intermediaries and locals. This moves the development debate a step further than previous works by refusing to singularly assess social injustice from the perspective of the victimization of local residents. In fact, there is an arguable propensity of locals to willingly change their surroundings for economic gain.</p>
<p>Primarily in the discussions of consumption and equity, there was recognition given to the fact that there is ambiguity about who was entitled to speak on behalf of the local environment. This is typically abandoned in the mainstream and this more philosophical point brings to the fore an important issue of whether local stakeholders automatically have this right because of their proximity to that environment. In the great run of cases for tourism, it was found that it was actually external civil society groups which were the main advocates, further complicating who knows what is best for local peoples and places.</p>
<p>In many ways, this challenges the territorial nature of tourism destinations and promotes a borderless type of citizenship which gives rights to a global community of stakeholders who become stewards over global ecosystems rather than just those with immediacy. Having said that, a striking argument is made which espouses that despite the overconsumption associated with tourism, its absence would not result in greater equity or untainted natural environments. While this is true, there are obvious increased options for greater equity, where finite resources are used more responsibly. The mainstream discourse is useful here in pointing out that one of the most irresponsible uses of natural resources stems from uninhibited visitors who enjoy massive amounts of resources; for example, water for pools. Although the author points out that resort-type tourism may be the culprit, a more ideological point is that all tourism reduces finite resources for local peoples.</p>
<p>The issue of equity is therefore a complex one. The claim made in the book that ‘…a focus on environment-society relations, consumption and equity has not made it into mainstream debates so far’ (p. 5) is not completely accurate since issues of inter-generational and intra-generational equity are hardly new in mainstream debates (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-146499341101200313">Edgell, 2006</xref>). It must be noted here that this text seems primarily concerned with intra-generational equity, which in part is a positive since typical sustainable development debates are preoccupied with future generations.</p>
<p>The consumption and equity debate would benefit from a greater distinction between preservation and conservation. This was alluded to by the author in pointing out that instead of adopting extreme positions rooted in either anthropocentrism or ecocentrism, a centrist position would be best. Therefore, rather than a competition between humans and the environment, a view that both have the right to exist will lead to discussions about the extent of use which may address some anthropogenic concerns.</p>
<p>The use of three very different case studies helped to demonstrate the practicality of these issues. One revealed a disinvestment in the future of its environment due to politics and poverty, another demonstrates short-sightedness and the lack of a common goal and the other was a relative success story which highlighted the ability to keep some power in the hands of locals. With the concepts in Part 1 of the book so masterfully written, there could have been a greater intertwining of these concepts in each case study. The writing style, which addressed some key international relations constructs in Part 1, was suited only for academicians and the case studies were a beautiful way to ground the concepts in context. Greater connectivity was therefore needed.</p>
<p>Overall, this text has played an important role in advancing the debate on the approach to environmental analysis by pointing out that the inclusion of nature–society relations and historical elements of environmental value systems will make these analyses more robust. Its key contribution is its emphasis on the power dynamic, which fuels much of the complexity surrounding the environment and tourism – an element which has been largely ignored in mainstream literature.</p>
