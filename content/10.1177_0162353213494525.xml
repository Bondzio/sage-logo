<p>This special issue of the <italic>Journal for the Education of the Gifted</italic> (JEG) is the second in this volume focusing on the history and nature of gifted programs in other countries, their research base for operation, and intended developments for the future. In the first issue, Dr. Joyce VanTassel-Baska served as the guest editor and highlighted the work in gifted education in Great Britain and seven different countries in Europe. The current issue includes articles from Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, Peru, Austria, and German-speaking Europe.</p>
<p>The reason for these two issues may be of interest to readers. As a student in a doctoral program in gifted education and as a practitioner in the field, I have had the privilege to work with individuals and organizations throughout the United States and in other countries. I have benefited from the expertise of many people both here and abroad. However, I have always been concerned that some of our graduate students in the United States did not have the same opportunity to see the many burgeoning and established programs that exist globally. I approached Dr. Tracy L. Cross, editor of <italic>JEG</italic>, about my idea to share the work of our foreign colleagues with the readers of this journal. He graciously agreed, as one of his mantras is about the importance of “serving gifted children globally.” and thus the two special issues were conceived. I asked Dr. VanTassel to participate in the endeavor, as she has worked internationally throughout her career and has provided me with both opportunities and her wisdom regarding how to work effectively in a context other than my own. It was my intention that these special issues would provide a glimpse into some of the varied practices that our colleagues have developed in their contexts and that we have had the privilege to observe.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the invited authors were asked to follow a template (loosely) in order that they would all address the same information about their countries:</p>
<list id="list1-0162353213494525" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What talents are valued? How are they developed in schools and other contexts?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the primary conception of giftedness?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What beliefs do people have about gifted individuals?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the most difficult issues that need to be addressed to provide appropriate programs and services for gifted learners?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In your view, what are the most important contributions to gifted education that have been made in your country?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What have been the most important research findings that have emerged during the past 10 years?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What do you see as future directions for research and program development?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In his article about Hong Kong’s work in gifted education, Stephen Tommis illustrates the status of an Asian country that has developed well-articulated provisions for gifted students. Tommis describes the development of thinking in gifted education since 1990 and outlines the framework for delivery called the “Three Tier Implementation Model.” He describes the current status of gifted education in terms of its school-based and off-site approaches to gifted education within this model. It is evident that there is strong governmental support for gifted education in spite of the lack of a mandate. As support for gifted education grows, so too does the call for a research agenda that documents the efficacy of current approaches and the need for other provisions, as Tommis notes.</p>
<p>In his article about gifted education in Japan, Manabu Sumida showcases previous and current efforts to address the needs of gifted students in a society that philosophically values egalitarianism. In a country known for its high scores on international tests, the author questions the stringent adherence to a national curriculum and resulting pedagogy that does not provide differentiation for the most able students. He paints a picture of a country in which standardization is important, yet is also in need of programming that will allow its most able students to achieve in such a way that they may contribute to the society. He describes the nascent efforts that are occurring there, particularly in science education, that may pave the way for more systematic programming in gifted education in the future.</p>
<p>Maureen Neihart and Chua Tee Teo discuss the expansion and diversification of Singapore’s programming for its most able students. They also describe the Singaporean government’s requirement for data related to student achievement; while the other countries featured in this issue might also need to show the efficacy of their programs, in Singapore it is already a formal aspect of the evaluation of programs.</p>
<p>In their article about gifted education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Abdullah Aljughaiman and Elena Grigorenko highlight certain aspects of Saudi society and its general system of education as the backdrop for their discussion. They note the importance of the context of the society and its general education system as the framework upon which any discussion of gifted education must be built. An example of one aspect of the Saudi context that distinguishes it from others is the gender-based segregation of students; it is an important component and can only be understood through the contextual lens.</p>
<p>In describing gifted education in Cyprus, Alexandra Ieridou also emphasizes the cultural context as an essential component for understanding what is happening in that country relative to gifted education. Ieridou discusses the historical and political circumstances that have resulted in a mind-set that stresses homogeneity rather than differentiation. The author argues for a culturally relevant approach that may utilize ideas brought from other countries, but that does not adopt them without respect to the local reality and needs.</p>
<p>Sheyla Blumen discusses the work that has been done in Peru, emphasizing the need for much more work on the topic of talent development as it is influenced by ethnolinguistic diversity and poverty specifically. Like other authors in this issue, she describes the educational environment in Peru to help the reader understand the constraints that exist for developing programs in gifted education.</p>
<p>In her article about Austria, Sieglinde Weyringer describes an increasing acceptance of the idea of gifted education within the last decade. As in some of the other countries, however, Austria’s government is trying to balance deeply held societal beliefs about egalitarianism with the need to provide services that will help children to develop their skills and talents in such a way that the country benefits. She argues for the promotion of gifted education throughout Europe as a way to participate proactively in the European Union’s investment in scientific development.</p>
<p>Albert Ziegler, Heidrun Stoeger, Bettina Harder, and Daniel Patrick Balestrini address German-speaking Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tirol, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the Principality of Liechtenstein) in their article, noting that there are many differences among the countries’ educational systems as they relate to gifted education, due to the heterogeneity of the school regulations. In spite of the variations that would be expected in different countries, they see two major needs that are common to all of the German states: delineating a goal structure that reflects modern needs and improving the methods utilized with gifted students.</p>
<p>In examining these articles collectively, several themes emerge:</p>
<list id="list2-0162353213494525" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>The context drives the ideas about gifted education, the conceptions of giftedness, identification protocols, and provisions for programming.</italic> It is important to understand the political, philosophical, and economic climate in each country, as well as the educational landscape. Just as in the United States, the larger societal forces influence what is happening in gifted education in significant ways. As we work with our colleagues in other countries, it is essential that we develop a deep understanding of the context in order to be effective in our collaboration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Gifted education is seen as a way to benefit the society</italic>. In many of these countries, the proponents of gifted education taut it as a way to develop students so that they can contribute to the society. This view of educational provisions as a way to help the country is different from the American view of education as a pathway to personal success and gratification. This mind-set corresponds to the importance of context that was discussed previously.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>In many countries, there is a state of synergy that represents a shift in philosophy.</italic> In some of these countries, there was previously a widely held belief that highly able students did not require special educational services or accommodations. The result was that provisions for highly able students were not available and were not even part of the educational dialogue. Within the past few decades, however, there has been recognition of the special needs of these students and an increasing interest in related research and practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research in gifted education is in its infancy in many countries.</italic> Because the provision of gifted education programs is relatively recent in some of these countries, research agendas have just begun to be established. This represents an area for potential significant growth in the field, as well as the opportunity for collaboration between researchers that will benefit gifted children.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Terminology is important for describing the nuances of how student ability is viewed</italic>. Most of the authors of these articles are from countries in which a language other than English is spoken. The specific terminology that is used in a given country to describe gifted students cannot be easily translated, indicating the importance of language for describing the essence of what we are trying to convey to our stakeholders.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>There is a commitment to gifted education that transcends global borders.</italic> Although these articles provide just a limited view of the many efforts on behalf of gifted students around the world, they also represent an overview of how some of our colleagues are addressing the needs of their most able students. It is encouraging to see that there are so many people working internationally to provide programs and services for gifted children.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The purposes of these special issues of <italic>JEG</italic> were (a) to promote international collaboration in gifted education, (b) to promote cross-cultural research in gifted education, and (c) to enhance the development of programs and services worldwide for gifted children. These articles highlighting such diverse contexts and varied programming can provide the basis for additional investigations, discussions, and sharing in our field. Collectively, the articles can provide a point of departure for such efforts.</p>
<p>I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Tracy L. Cross, Dr. Joyce VanTassel-Baska, the authors of the articles, and the many reviewers for their assistance in preparing these two issues.</p>
