<abstract>
<p>The aim of this population-based study was to examine how parents of Icelandic children with physical disability view the services of physical, occupational, and speech therapists and how family centered those services are. A secondary aim was to compare the differences of parental perceptions of therapy services based on age, residence, and disabilities. Parents of 88 (46%) children aged 2–18 answered the Measure of Processes of Care–20 (MPOC-20), and six parents participated in a focus group interview. Descriptive data were used to explore central tendency and variability, and comparisons were made using analysis of variance. Overall, the parents found the therapy services respectful, supportive, and coordinated; they felt enabled in their parent role and worked mostly in partnership with the professionals. Nevertheless, parents perceived they received insufficient information from therapists. Parents reported a wish for more cooperation, teamwork, and a key worker. Findings indicate that the MPOC is reliable and easy to use within the Icelandic context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ideas related to family-centered service (FCS) for children with disabilities and their families emerged at the second half of the 20th century, at a time of the increasing awareness of the importance of meeting the extensive needs of children and supporting their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511423769">Rosenbaum et al., 1998</xref>). Today, the focus is on a comprehensive approach, which corresponds with the emphases of the International Classification of Function, Disabilities, and Health [ICF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493511423769">Stewart and Rosenbaum, 2003</xref>; World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493511423769">(WHO), 2002</xref>]. It is considered more important to assess the child’s strengths instead of concentrating on weaknesses. The interaction of the family and the community is the center of attention, in addition to well-being and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511423769">King et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493511423769">Rosenbaum and Stewart, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The essence of FCS is the partnership between the service providers and the family. It is recognized that each family is unique, the constant in the child’s life and the experts on the child’s abilities and needs, and that the child is best helped by assisting the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511423769">CanChild Centre for Childhood Disability Research, 2003</xref>). Showing respect and affirming families’ strengths and control over the services they receive is considered to be of utmost importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511423769">Dempsey and Keen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511423769">King et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511423769">Rosenbaum et al., 1998</xref>). This has been confirmed in recent studies, suggesting that parental perceptions and experience with family-centered professional support are associated with families’ quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511423769">Davis and Gravidia-Payne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493511423769">Trute and Hiebert-Murphy, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Service providers’ attempt to base their practices on evidence has been facilitated by the recent development of reliable and valid instruments to assess FCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511423769">Dyke et al., 2006</xref>). The Measure of Processes of Care (MPOC) is one of the first instruments to be developed to measure FCS in pediatric settings. It was first published in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423769">King et al., 1995</xref>) and has been used across countries to assess services to children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511423769">Dyke et al., 2006</xref>). The instrument was developed to gain information on how parents of children with disabilities and chronic health conditions evaluate the services provided to their children and themselves and the impact that this service delivery has on the children and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423769">King et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511423769">2004b</xref>). The MPOC has five domains that coincide with the key components concerning service that have been reported in the literature, that is, access to information, respect and support, and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511423769">King et al., 1996</xref>). The instrument has a long (MPOC-56) and a short (MPOC-20) version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511423769">King et al., 2004b</xref>). Both versions have demonstrated good validity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423769">King et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511423769">2004a</xref>).</p>
<p>The population of Iceland is a little more than 300,000 and two thirds live in the capital area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493511423769">Statistics Iceland, 2011</xref>). Icelandic children with physical disabilities typically receive regular therapy services in their home communities one to three times per week. There are two rehabilitation centers for children in the country. These are located in the largest towns and only provide physical and occupational therapy services. The State Diagnostic and Counselling Centre (SDCC) has an important role in supporting children with disabilities and their families wherever they live in the country, by providing counseling and education to parents and professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493511423769">The SDCC, 2010</xref>). The SDCC runs specialty clinics for children with myelomeningocele and neuromuscular disorders. SDCC furthermore maintains a database of all Icelandic children with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>Iceland is among the 145 countries that signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (2007). The convention claims that in all actions concerning children with disabilities, the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration and that comprehensive information, service, and support should be provided to the children and their families. These emphases correspond with the Icelandic Ministry of Social Affairs policy statement (2007) focusing on service cooperation for families of children with disabilities in order to meet their needs and wants.</p>
<p>At present, only one qualitative study has explored the perspectives of Icelandic parents of children with physical disabilities on the therapy services provided to their child. The results indicated that many parents were poorly informed of intervention goals and what took place during therapy sessions. The parents became increasingly critical of the services as their children grew older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511423769">Egilson, 2011</xref>). This present study is the first study to use the MPOC to explore the perspectives of parents of children with disabilities in Iceland.</p>
<p>It has two main purposes: The first purpose is to examine how parents of children with physical disabilities view the services of physical, occupational, and speech therapists and how family centered those services are. The second is to compare the differences of parental perceptions of therapy services based on age, residence, and disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367493511423769">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was conducted using a mixed-methods design. Participants completed the MPOC questionnaire, and a representative convenience sample was asked to attend a focus group to elaborate on the quantitative results. The study was carried out by the first author and approved by the Icelandic Bioethical Committee (08-072).</p>
<sec id="section3-1367493511423769">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A list of the population of Icelandic children with physical disabilities ranging in age from 2–18 years was compiled from the SDCC database, resulting in a total of 191 children. The parents of these children were invited to participate in the study. Altogether 164 children had cerebral palsy (CP), 10 children had myelomeningocele, and 17 children had neuromuscular or musculoskeletal conditions. The parents of 96 children agreed to participate in the study. For practical purposes, parents of children under age 2 were excluded as these families often are new to the system and not likely to have experienced all three services.</p>
<p>Six parents were chosen as a purposeful sample to participate in a focus group discussion about the quantitative findings. Four had a child with CP, one had a child with myelomeningocele, and another had a child with a neuromuscular condition. Their children received physical therapy on a regular basis, but occupational therapy and speech therapy services were not as consistent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367493511423769">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>The MPOC-20 is a self-administered measure of parental perception of the extent to which the services they receive are family centered. The 20 items cover five scales: Enabling and Partnership, Providing General Information, Providing Specific Information About the Child, Coordinated and Comprehensive Care, and Respectful and Supportive Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423769">King et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511423769">2004b</xref>). The items are answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 7 (to a very great extent) to 1 (not at all). A higher score reflects a more favorable judgment of the care process. An open question was added at the end of the instrument asking the caregivers to add their personal view of the therapy services provided to their child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367493511423769">
<title>Demographic information</title>
<p>Parent and child demographic data were collected on the survey by allowing the respondent to select the most appropriate description from a list of options. Information collected included the child’s age and medical diagnosis. Information about functional status and severity of impairment was collected in line with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) and then assigned the appropriate classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511423769">Eliasson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493511423769">Palisano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493511423769">Rosenbaum et al., 2008</xref>). The parents were also asked where they lived and which caregiver answered the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367493511423769">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The MPOC-20 was translated from English to Icelandic and then translated back into English for comparison and development of the final Icelandic version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511423769">Halldorsdottir and Birgisdottir, 2006</xref>). The original questions were used, but the explanations and clarifications were slightly adapted (e.g. that “people” in the list referred to occupational, physical, and speech therapists). Initially, a pilot study was performed with the parents of 16 young children with developmental disabilities. The information obtained was used to refine the wording of the final Icelandic edition of the instrument. The questionnaires and a prepaid return envelope were then sent to the participants. After 4 weeks, a reminder was sent out.</p>
<p>The focus group interview was performed following the calculation of the quantitative results. The participants were asked their opinions of the questionnaire, such as whether or not the questions were relevant, important, and easy to understand. The MPOC results were then presented for discussion and exploration of their meaning. Last, the participants were asked to prioritize issues of specific importance to them. The interview lasted 2 hours, and an effort was made to make it look like a conversation. The interview was taped and transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367493511423769">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The scoring rules and procedures prescribed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423769">King et al. (1995)</xref> were applied in the analysis of the MPOC questionnaires. Descriptive data were used to explore central tendency and variability of the scores of the study sample on all scales of the instrument. Comparisons between more than two means were made using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated for each of the five scales of the MPOC-20 as a measure of internal consistency. The alpha level for all statistical procedures was 0.05.</p>
<p>Analysis of the data from the focus group interview was guided by the work process recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511423769">Bogdan and Biklen (1998)</xref> for a descriptive analysis. First an open coding was performed with codes emerging from the transcribed text followed by a focused coding to validate similarities and differences across cases. The comments from the open question in the MPOC were included in the qualitative analysis, which was performed by the first author and verified by the second author.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367493511423769">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 191, 96 (50.3%) parents returned the MPOC-20 questionnaires. The results are based on 88 (46%) usable questionnaires. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423769">King et al. (1995)</xref>, a valid questionnaire must have at least half of the items marked, and the alternative “not applicable” is not considered a valid response. In order to calculate scale score, at least two thirds of the scale items must have a valid response. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511423769">Table 1</xref>

<p>Descriptive information from the MPOC is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511423769">Table 2</xref>
. The scale that the parents rated the highest was the <italic>Respectful and Supportive Scale</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 5.27), which indicated they perceived therapists provided this type of care to a fairly great extent. The lowest rating was in the <italic>Providing General Information</italic>

<title>Residence</title>
<p>Significant differences in parents’ perceptions of therapy services were not obtained between groups originally identified according to residence. Since few participants lived in rural areas, the group was combined with the group “small urban areas” under the name “small urban and rural areas” (<italic>n</italic> = 36) and then compared with the group “capital area” (<italic>n</italic> = 49). On all scales, parents who live in the capital area registered higher scores on MPOC than those living in small urban and rural areas. There were significant differences between these parent groups in <italic>Providing Specific Information</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = .03) where the mean for the capital area was 4.47 (95% CI = 3.99–4.95) and 3.61 (95% CI = 2.96–4.26) for other areas.</p>

<p>Comparison by diagnostic categories was complicated by the uneven distribution of participants in each group. The groups of “myelomeningocele” and “neuromuscular/musculoskeletal” were therefore combined (<italic>n</italic> = 21), as they share some similarities, for example, the form of service provided (access to specialty clinics) and functional limitations. Slight differences were obtained between the CP and “other,” indicating that parents of children with CP (<italic>n</italic> = 65) are more satisfied with the cooperation with professionals and with the specific information they receive than the parents of children with other diagnoses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1367493511423769">Table 4</xref>

<title>Qualitative results</title>
<p>Five mothers and one father participated in the focus group. Four lived in the capital area and two in small urban areas. Their children ranged in age from 6–17 years, and their functional status and severity of impairment varied from minor (no assistance needed) to major (major assistance needed). Almost half of the parents answering the MPOC questionnaire added a comment in the open question at the end about service received. The analysis of the results from the focus group and the open-ended question in the questionnaire revealed several concepts, which were grouped into two categories: “service arrangements” and “communication and respect.”</p>
<sec id="section15-1367493511423769">
<title>Service arrangements</title>
<p>The extent to which the therapists collaborated with families varied extensively between service providers. Overall, parents desired more cooperation and teamwork with the therapists working with the children. They considered coordination of services as very important, and specifically, they wanted a key worker to advocate for the family, to provide information and advice, and to improve access to services. Limited availability and accessibility to services, as well as staff turnover, was a worry for many. The need for stability also came up consistently. A parent of a 6-year-old reported,<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>I realize that I am privileged because my child has received physical therapy since he was eighteen months… and still has the same physical therapist. And then there is a team that meets regularly, like every five, six weeks and the physical therapist gives report so everything is out in the open.</italic>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Parents valued therapy provided in natural settings, and in particular, they wanted therapists to work more actively with school staff. They also stressed that the services should correspond to the family’s differing needs and that special emphasis be placed on periods of transition in the child’s and family’s lives, such as when the child starts school. Parents often perceived services to be organized according to the needs and preferences of professionals and communities. The parents of the older children were more critical of the services than were the parents of the younger children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1367493511423769">
<title>Communication and respect</title>
<p>The participants in the focus group complained of not getting enough information about their various concerns. They also wanted better communication between therapists and schools. This corresponds with comments from the MPOC questionnaires such as “would be good to get more information” and “information from professionals not coordinated.” Some of the participants’ children used bus services to attend therapy sessions, resulting in reduced contact and communication between parents and therapists. Although most participants in the focus group considered themselves as highly respected by their child’s therapists, they also emphasized that professionals must acknowledge that parents know their children best. They stressed that parents should be encouraged to make use of their knowledge instead of professionals unilaterally defining the role that the parents are to play. One parent said, “It changed everything when I figured out that, of course, I am the expert regarding my child and I just know what is right.”</p>

). The participants in the focus group considered the questionnaire as important, comprehensible, and easy to answer, but a few reported that it was difficult to focus on just the last 12 months when answering the MPOC.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>On three of five MPOC scales, the parents of Icelandic children with physical disabilities consider the therapy services that their children receive as family centered to a fairly great extent. Overall, the parents find the services respectful and supportive, coordinated, and comprehensive; they feel enabled in their parent role and work mostly in partnership with the professionals. Nevertheless, there is a notable shortage of general information from professionals and others whom the family interacts with regarding the child’s disability. In many ways, these findings are consistent with those of other studies using the MPOC in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511423769">Dyke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511423769">Granat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511423769">McConachie and Logan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511423769">Raghavendra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511423769">Whitton et al., 2008</xref>). However, the descriptive statistics for the three highest MPOC scale scores in this study are lower than reported in these particular studies. This may be related to the fact that there is no children’s rehabilitation center with an interdisciplinary focus in Iceland. Also, as noted in another study, the parent–therapist partnership reported in the literature may not be as well adopted in Iceland as one would prefer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511423769">Egilson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, the parents report a lack of information in various forms, such as about options for services, written information about what their child is doing in therapy, and about their progress. Similar findings have been reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511423769">Dyke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511423769">Raghavendra et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that professionals need to emphasize providing oral and written information so that parents can make informed decisions. They also have to ensure that the information given is important, timely, and situation specific.</p>
<p>The parents in this study also convey that a long-term relationship with one team member is not ensured as can been seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511423769">Table 3</xref> and was verified in the focus group interview. It has been reported that parents often value human relationships and working together more than the technical competencies of professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511423769">Bamm and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511423769">Egilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511423769">MacKean et al., 2005</xref>). Working with a trusted professional, a key worker who manages and coordinates services for the child and the family, is therefore of utmost importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511423769">McConachie and Logan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511423769">Pickering and Busse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493511423769">Sloper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493511423769">Trute et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511423769">Whitton et al., 2008</xref>). Studies have shown that the strongest indication about parents’ satisfaction with services is when the key worker carries out that role to its full extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493511423769">Sloper et al., 2006</xref>). The MPOC-20 has only one question about a key worker but does not ask specifically about his or her importance to the families. Icelandic communities need to acknowledge the significance of a key worker now that the services for people with disabilities have just been transferred from the state to the communities. A simple way to start is to gather information about the professionals who work with the child and family and to promote networking.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493511423769">United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (2007)</xref>, which is to be ratified by Icelandic authorities, stresses information, service, and support to children with disabilities and their families. So does the policy statement from the Icelandic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511423769">Ministry of Social Affairs (2007)</xref>. It is important that the SDCC and Icelandic professionals serving children with disabilities unite in these emphases by strengthening cooperation between the various systems involving the child and the family. Incorporating family choice and decision making into how therapists work with families is a priority at this stage. To ensure success, barriers and supports to implementation of family-centered practices in Iceland need to be further analyzed, but as indicated in the literature, they may be at multiple levels, including political, conceptual, financial, and attitudinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511423769">Bamm and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511423769">MacKean et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the parents of children with CP consider the services more family centered than do the parents of children with myelomeningocele and neuromuscular/musculoskeletal conditions. Possibly, knowledge about these conditions is not as available since they affect fewer children. Neuromuscular disorders are often changeable and some of them are degenerative and thus the parents might be in need for extra information and support. Furthermore, the parents in the capital area register higher values than parents in other areas on all scales of the instrument and register significantly higher values in the <italic>Providing Specific Information</italic>
<italic>Scale</italic>. In the small towns where parents and therapists live in close vicinity, information might be provided orally instead of written. Quite likely, professional expertise is lacking in some of the rural areas. The qualitative findings substantiated these points.</p>
<p>Although this study only found a difference in the <italic>Providing General Information</italic>
<italic>Scale</italic> between parents of younger and older children, the parents in the focus group became increasingly critical of the services as their child grew older, corresponding to Egilson’s findings (2011) as well as the findings from other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511423769">Bjerre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511423769">Raghavendra et al., 2007</xref>). This is of concern as parents have consistently reported that professionals must attend to the changing needs and challenges that arise with increased age of their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511423769">Dyke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511423769">King et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The study findings indicate that the MPOC is reliable and easy to use within the Icelandic context, although it does not ask specifically about whether or not a key worker coordinates the services provided to the child and family. The study has implications beyond Iceland, as it emphasizes the importance that service providers should listen to the voices of families and organize their interventions to meet their needs.</p>
<sec id="section20-1367493511423769">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study has a few limitations. The MOPC-20 was the only instrument used. Information about parents’ satisfaction was not gathered and thus could not be compared with the MPOC results. Parent demographic information, such as age, employment status, and household income, was not collected. The GMFCS and MACS, used to collect information about functional status and severity of impairment, are designed for children with CP only, but it has been suggested that they can also be used for children with other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493511423769">Rosenbaum et al., 2008</xref>). Just about half of the participants returned the questionnaires, and no information is available about the nonrespondent group. Likewise, no information was gathered about the professionals from whom the child received therapy. Information from the professionals would have provided valuable insight about the extent they consider they work according to family-centered principles. In addition, obtaining the perspectives of the children and youth about the services they receive would have been advantageous. The small number of children with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal conditions may have made the comparision between the different groups less statistically sound.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the great majority of the respondents were mothers, implying that, overall, the study reflects their views. Possibly parents’ responses are more valid for physical therapy than for occupational and speech therapies as these services are not as widespread in Iceland as physical therapy.</p>
<p>The strength of the study is that it is population based. Also, the qualitative data obtained in the focus group interview assisted in interpreting the quantitative findings from the instrument.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section21-1367493511423769">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although therapists possess important information about the child’s strengths and needs as well as the various resources that may benefit the child and their family, they must acknowledge that the family is the child’s primary source of strength and support. It is important that therapists work with families in finding ways to increase the participation and well-being of the child and family in daily life. Parents want to be involved in the decision making regarding the therapy their children receive and to be a valued team member. The recent emphasis on social perspectives on disability and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493511423769">WHO, 2002</xref>) encourages us to take the feelings and perspectives of children and their families more seriously than has been done previously by researchers and professionals. Practicing therapists should critically evaluate their services so that they reflect these trends in reality.</p>
