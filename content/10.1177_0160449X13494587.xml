<p>There is probably not a union activist who does not know the name Joe Hill. Ironically, for a songwriter, he is probably best known as the subject of a song. In this much needed biography, Adler paints a picture of the man behind the ballad.</p>
<p>While Adler does an excellent job researching Hill’s life, particularly his life in Sweden before he immigrated to America, much of Hill’s short life is conjecture. In many instances, all Adler has to work with is the knowledge that the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) were present in a certain location conducting some form of action and the presumption that Hill was involved in this action.</p>
<p>The absence of real information is not surprising in that people of Hill’s economic and social class generally left very few records behind to document their lives. One facet of Hill’s life that has received little notice is his participation in the Mexican Revolution, fighting in support of the Magon brothers against both the forces of Mexican President Diaz and the forces of his opponent, Francisco Madero.</p>
<p>Of course, the crux of <italic>The Man Who Never Died</italic> is Hill’s trial and execution in Salt Lake City for the murder of a shopkeeper and his son. Adler makes a compelling case for Hill’s innocence and offers an explanation for the origin of Hill’s gunshot wound, which was a crucial piece of evidence in his conviction. Adler asserts that the true killer was a drifter and career criminal named Frank Wilson, and that Hill, who was in fact with his lady friend, Hilda Erickson, was shot by Otto Applequist, a friend of his and erstwhile rival for Hilda’s hand.</p>
<p>Adler next turns to the issue of why Hill kept silent. Traditionally, historians have concluded this was due to his reluctance to name his lady friend. Adler instead argues that Hill felt that as an innocent man, he had no need to disprove the government’s case.</p>
<p>During the appeal process, when he was given the opportunity both in court and before the parole board to rebut the prosecution, he continued to refuse. As Hill stated to the parole board in his demand for a new trial, he had evidence that “prove[s] absolutely my innocence and send[s] four or five perjurers to penitentiary, where they belong.” When asked why he did not produce this evidence at the first trial, he replied, “I didn’t think it was necessary to prove my innocence. … I thought the state would have to prove a man guilty” (p. 291).</p>
<p>Given the anti-IWW sentiment, particularly in Utah, Hill’s guilt or innocence was probably irrelevant to his eventual execution. As the date neared, Hill accepted his martyrdom and in perhaps his most famous statement, ordered IWW leader Bill Haywood, “Don’t waste any time in mourning—organize” (p. 325). This was later revised by Alfred Hayes in the song “I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill” to “What they could never kill, went on to organize.”</p>
<p>Adler ably demonstrates that, while Hill had an effect on the labor movement through his song-writing skills in many songs published in the <italic>Little Red Songbook</italic>, his principal impact on the labor movement is as an icon. Adler allows us to see behind the facade to the man beyond and has provided as detailed a life of Hill as will ever be written.</p>
