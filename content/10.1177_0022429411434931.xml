<abstract>
<p>“Flow” is a highly coveted yet elusive state of mind that is characterized by complete absorption in the task at hand as well as by enhanced skilled performance. Unfortunately, because most measures of this construct have been developed in physical activity and sport settings, little is known about the applicability of flow scales to the experiences of performers in other domains such as music. To fill this gap in the research literature, the present study had two objectives. First, we investigated the psychometric adequacy of the Dispositional Flow Scale–2 (DFS-2) for a large sample (<italic>n</italic> = 205) of musicians. In addition, we examined the experience of flow among amateur and elite music students. Results indicated that the DFS-2 is a generally reliable and factorially-sound measure of flow and that flow states are experienced quite frequently by music students. Nevertheless, the results also raise questions about the validity of certain subscales of this test (e.g., <italic>merging of action and awareness, loss of self-consciousness</italic>). The theoretical and practical significance of these findings is discussed and suggestions are provided for future research on flow.</p>

<p>“Flow” is a highly coveted yet elusive state of mind that is characterized by complete absorption in a given task as well as by enhanced skilled performance. Regarded as “an almost automatic, effortless, yet highly focused state of consciousness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi, 1996</xref>, p. 110), flow is an intuitively appealing construct that has attracted considerable interest in fields such as sport psychology (e.g., see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Kimiecik, 2008</xref>) and positive psychology (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022429411434931">Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2002</xref>). Since the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi (1975)</xref>, studies on flow have been conducted in a variety of domains such as education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429411434931">Beard &amp; Hoy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022429411434931">Seitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022429411434931">Shernoff &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022429411434931">Shernoff, Csikszentmihalyi, Schneider, &amp; Steele Shernoff, 2003</xref>), work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022429411434931">Salanova, Bakker, &amp; Llorens, 2006</xref>), leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; LeFevre, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429411434931">Havitz &amp; Mannell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429411434931">LeFevre, 1992</xref>), motivation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022429411434931">Keller &amp; Bless, 2008</xref>), attention theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429411434931">Bruya, 2010</xref>), and perhaps most extensively, athletic performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429411434931">Jackson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Marsh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429411434931">Jackson, Martin, &amp; Eklund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A.

<p>From such studies, a constellation of psychological correlates of the flow experience has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Kimiecik, 2008</xref>). These characteristics form the nine dimensions of flow models postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi (1999)</xref>. Specifically, these dimensions include:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>challenge-skill balance (feeling competent enough to meet the high demands of the situation), action-awareness merging (doing things spontaneously and automatically without having to think), clear goals (having a strong sense of what one wants to do), unambiguous feedback (knowing how well one is doing during the performance itself), concentration on the task at hand (being completely focused on the task at hand), sense of control (having a feeling of total control over what one is doing), loss of self-consciousness (not worrying what others think of oneself), transformation of time (having the sense that time passes in a way that is different from normal), and autotelic experience (feeling the experience to be extremely rewarding). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A. J. Martin &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>, p. 146)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At least six psychometric measures of flow have been published by Jackson and colleagues since the mid 1990s. These measures have been developed and validated largely in physical activity and elite sport settings and have not been used widely in other performance domains. Initially, based on the twin assumptions that flow is a specific psychological state and that people differ in their propensity to experience it on a regular basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Kimiecik, 2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429411434931">Jackson and Marsh (1996)</xref> devised two complementary instruments—the Flow State Scale (FSS) and the Dispositional Flow Scale (DFS)—known as the Flow Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>). Whereas the FSS is a 36-item, multifactor instrument “designed to be answered after a specific event to assess the experience of flow in that event” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Kimiecik, 2008</xref>, p. 395), the DFS is a 36-item measure purporting to assess “the frequency with which respondents report experiencing flow in general during participation in their main activity” (p. 395). Both of these measures contain four items for each of the nine flow dimensions that were postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi (1999)</xref>.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson and Kimiecik (2008)</xref>, the Flow Scales “provide a valid and reliable means of assessing flow in physical activity” (p. 396). In particular, these scales have been shown to display acceptable factor structure and reliability (with alpha coefficient values of 0.78 to 0.90 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>) in the physical activity domain. For example, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) generally corroborated the nine-dimensional structure of these two scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Kimiecik, 2008</xref>). However, doubts exist about the validity of two of the dimensions of flow: loss of self-consciousness and time transformation. Jackson and colleagues have speculated that the two dimensions may not be central to athletes’ experience of flow. Subsequently, following some modification of items, the Flow Scales were revised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson and Eklund (2002)</xref> to produce the Flow State Scale–2 (FSS-2) and the Dispositional Flow Scale–2 (DFS-2). As with earlier versions, these measures have been shown to exhibit acceptable factor structure and impressive reliability.</p>

<title>Flow in Musicians</title>
<p>Only a handful of published studies on the self-reported flow experiences of musicians could be located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429411434931">Bakker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429411434931">Bloom &amp; Skutnick-Henley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429411434931">Fritz &amp; Avsec, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022429411434931">MacDonald, Byrne, &amp; Carlton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022429411434931">O’Neill, 1999</xref>). The paucity of research on flow among musicians as compared with athletes is surprising in view of the fact that music is an activity that commonly is understood to elicit peak performance experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429411434931">Lowis, 2002</xref>), even among very young children engaged in music making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429411434931">Custodero, 2005</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi (1993)</xref> has suggested that children spend much, perhaps most, of their time in flow, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429411434931">Custodero (2005)</xref> has indicated how descriptive observations of children in naturally occurring music-learning environments can provide evidence of intense experiences of flow, our focus in this article was on making a comparison between the way in which the concept of flow is captured psychometrically in domains like athletics and sport performance, and that of music. This latter objective required the use of self-report scales rather than observations. Of the studies that we located, only three are directly relevant to the aims of the present investigation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429411434931">Bloom and Skutnick-Henley (2005)</xref> used a survey to explore 90 classical musicians’ experiences of flow. Unfortunately, the authors did not specify the type or level of expertise of the musicians in their sample (e.g., whether they were professional or nonprofessional), but judging by the small number of playing hours reported per week by the participants, it seems reasonable to conclude that the musicians in question were nonprofessionals. Accordingly, this survey provides no insights into the flow experiences of student musicians or their professional counterparts. Perhaps more importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429411434931">Bloom and Skutnick-Henley (2005)</xref> did not clearly explain precisely how they measured flow experiences in their survey. Although some written accounts of such experiences were elicited (and there is a reference to a “numeric rating” of some flow items), these are not specified adequately, and therefore, it is not known how these items actually measured flow.</p>
<p>In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429411434931">Fritz and Avsec (2007)</xref> investigated the relationship between flow and subjective well-being in 84 students of music. Interestingly, they found that although some dimensions of flow (e.g., challenge-skill balance) were related to well-being, others (such as loss of self-consciousness and time transformation) were not. This latter finding again raises doubts about the assumption of equal importance of all nine dimensions of flow in performers.</p>
<p>Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A. J. Martin and Jackson (2008)</xref> administered the short nine-item measure of flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429411434931">Jackson et al., 2008</xref>) to a sample of musicians. This sample comprised 224 classical music students at the high school or university levels. The authors reported high reliability (alpha = 0.73) of this scale and also concluded that all nine dimensions of flow were salient to these performers. Unfortunately, the psychometric adequacy of the longer, more established flow scale (DFS-2) with musicians is unknown.</p>
<p>To summarize, although some research has been conducted on the flow experiences of musicians, a number of unresolved issues hamper research in this area. Firstly, it appears from the literature that there is some inconsistency between the domains of sport and music with regard to the question of whether or not all nine dimensions of flow are equally important correlates of the flow experiences of the performers concerned. One way of resolving this issue is to conduct a psychometric analysis of a key flow scale such as the DFS-2 using a large sample of musicians. Research on flow in sport (using the long version of the flow scales) has reported low intercorrelations between global flow scores and the subscales of <italic>time transformation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429411434931">Kowal &amp; Fortier, 1999</xref>), for both <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> and <italic>time transformation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429411434931">Jackson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429411434931">Jackson, Kimiecik, Ford, &amp; Marsh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Marsh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429411434931">Jackson, Thomas, Marsh, &amp; Smethurst, 2001</xref>), and <italic>clear goals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429411434931">Kowal &amp; Fortier, 1999</xref>). Typically, explanations for this phenomenon have focused on the likelihood that these particular dimensions of flow are less salient for the particular sample investigated. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429411434931">Russell (2001)</xref> suggested that “for less elite athletes, clear goals may not be as related to helping flow occurrence” (p. 102). A second unresolved issue is that although flow has been investigated widely in the domain of sport, there is only one peer-reviewed published paper exploring adults’ flow states in <italic>music</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A. J. Martin &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>), a study that examined the effectiveness of the new short version of the flow scales—not the (long) flow scales (DFS-2 or FSS-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>) that generally have been used in sport research. Therefore, little is known about musicians’ experience of flow. While the domains of sport and music are similar in many ways, there are some vital differences. In music, for example, there is the expression of emotion, presentation, communication and rapport with an audience, evocation of emotion in others, duty to a composer’s wishes through communication of music to an audience, and the production of sound. While some of these issues may also be relevant to some sport activities, they have not been researched widely.</p>

<title>Aims of the Present Investigation</title>
<p>In the present study we aimed to investigate the psychometric adequacy of the Dispositional Flow Scale–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>) in the domain of music performance. In addition, we wished to examine the experience of flow among two different kinds of music students—those who were studying music at an amateur level of weekly instrumental lessons at a music conservatory and their elite counterparts who were studying music performance in third-level education in a music conservatory with the aim of carrying out a career in music performance.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 205 student musicians studying a musical instrument or voice at two conservatories of music in a European city. The sample comprised two types of student musicians. The first sample of participants was 125 students who were attending musical instrumental lessons on a weekly basis at the conservatory and ranged in age from 8 to 19 years, with a mean age of 15.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.46). This sample is characterized by a number of factors: those who were studying music in their spare time, were still at school, were not aiming (as yet) to become professional musicians, engaged in a number of musical activities in the conservatory (e.g., orchestra, band, choir, musicianship classes), and were between Grades 1 and 8 of official music examination standards. The second sample of participants was 80 elite student musicians, ranging in age from 18 to 22 (mean age = 20.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.87) who, following a number of years of learning an instrument, were studying music performance on a full-time basis, with the aim of pursuing a professional career in music. The two samples are labeled, respectively, <italic>amateur</italic> and <italic>elite</italic>.</p>

<title>Dispositional Flow Scale–2</title>
<p>The Dispositional Flow Scale–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>) is a 36-item instrument designed to measure people’s general flow experiences in a target activity. Using a 5-point Likert-type scale, participants are asked to rate how often they generally experience various aspects of the flow experience within that activity. For example, statements such as “I make the correct movements without thinking about trying to do so” (Item 3) relate to the <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic> dimension. Similarly, “I am not concerned with what others may be thinking of me” (Item 8) relates to the <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> dimension, and “I have a strong sense of what I want to do” (Item 13) relates to the <italic>clear goals</italic> dimension. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale and range from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always</italic>). Higher scores are held to reflect a higher frequency of experiencing flow.</p>
<p>Prior to distribution of the survey, a pilot survey was carried out in order to determine the appropriateness of items for musicians. Twenty elite music students and 20 amateur music students participated in the pilot study. Overall reliability of the scales was found to be good, with an alpha level of 0.8722 for the elite student sample and an alpha level of 0.8436 for the amateur student sample. For the present sample of musicians, Item 4 was altered from “I know clearly what I want to do” to “I know clearly what I want to do or how I want to play,” and Item 14 was altered following a pilot study from “it is no effort to keep my mind on what is happening” to “it is an effort to keep my mind on what is happening.” This change in wording was undertaken after the pilot study had shown some confusion among music students with regard to the wording of the original item. The revised item was reverse scored for data analysis. The DFS-2 was shortened from 36 items to 27 items (i.e., from 4 items to 3 items per flow dimension) for administration to the amateur students (<italic>n</italic> = 125). This modification was deemed necessary in order to make this measure more intelligible to, and shorter for, the younger participants. Items were chosen based on language and ease of understanding. Scale reliability was found to be sufficient for both the 3-item per dimension version and the 4-item per dimension version.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022429411434931">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The amateur students were approached while attending classes and were asked to participate. Subsequent to their agreement, departmental, teacher, and parental permission (where necessary) was obtained. The elite musicians were asked to participate in the study during individual tuition with their principal teacher. In order to complete the Dispositional Flow Scale (DFS-2), students were asked to rate the statements based on their experience while performing music. The instructions also stated that there were no right or wrong answers.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429411434931">Table 1</xref> shows, overall reliability for the DFS-2 was high (alpha value of 0.92) for the total sample of 205 music students. The overall alpha value for the amateur students (<italic>n</italic> = 125) was 0.89 and that for the elite student sample (<italic>n</italic> = 80) was 0.92. The internal consistency scores for the various DFS-2 subscales were impressive—ranging from 0.72 (“clear goals” dimension for elite musicians) to 0.91 (“clear feedback” dimension for amateur musicians)—with all exceeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022429411434931">Nunnally’s (1978)</xref> criterion of .70 for acceptable reliability. Generally, the scales were found to have impressive reliability, with high alpha levels on all dimensions. The mean scores are largely in line with those reported in previous studies (but note that the bulk of research carried out by Jackson and colleagues does not report mean scores). It is notable, though, that as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429411434931">Table 1</xref> shows, the flow subscale measuring <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> has a lower mean score and a higher standard deviation than other flow dimensions both for the overall sample and for the elite sample. There are no such anomalies, however, in the case of the <italic>time transformation</italic> dimension that often has been found to be problematic in previous research with athletes.</p>

<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>In order to examine the factorial structure of the DFS-2, a principal components analysis was carried out on all 36 items. As noted earlier, there were 205 participants in total, with missing values ranging from 4 to 7 on the scores; on 34 of the items, the analysis was based on 200 or 201 participants. Missing value imputation was not used given the small percentage of missing cases. The analysis was carried out using the data reduction/principal components command in SPSS. The criterion for extracting a component was the default setting of eigenvalue &gt; 1.0. Varimax rotation was applied. For presentation purposes, the variable-component coefficients were set to “blank” for any value below 0.5, and the coefficients were sorted. Nine components were extracted, with eigenvalues ranging from 10.37 down to 1.14. The nine components explained 73.59% of the variance in the original 36 DFS-2 variables. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022429411434931">Table 2</xref>, the rotated variable-component coefficients are displayed.</p>

<p>As is evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022429411434931">Table 2</xref>, and keeping in mind that the settings of the principal components analysis in SPSS were what one would consider “default,” the correspondence between the nine constructs of the DFS-2 and the outcome of the principal components is remarkably close.</p>
<p>Confirmatory factor analysis typically is performed via structural equation modeling (SEM) software. Therefore, the SEM rule of 10 observations per indicator must at a minimum be met and, in the context of this analysis, would have required a sample size exceeding 360. So although a formal CFA could not be carried out, nonetheless, it is clear that the DFS-2 constructs fit very well onto the dimensions of the definition of flow for the musician-as-performer. Only one variable, <italic>concentration 1</italic>, loads onto an unexpected component of <italic>control</italic>. That variable also loads almost as well onto its hypothesized component. In all other 35 cases, the variables reduce neatly into their predicted construct.</p>

<title>Correlations Between the Subscales of the Dispositional Flow Scale–2</title>
<p>Pearson correlations were carried out among the DFS-2 subscales of flow and also between these subscales and the global flow score. All subscales of flow correlated significantly with global flow (i.e., overall flow scores) at the .01 level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429411434931">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that each of these dimensions of flow was significant for the experience of flow among student musicians. This finding supports the theoretical foundation upon which the flow scale is based (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A. J. Martin &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429411434931">Table 3</xref> also shows some evidence of non-significant relationships between the flow dimensions.

These results suggest that not all flow dimensions contribute equally to overall flow scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022429411434931">
<title>Frequency of Flow Experience</title>
<p>Frequency data for the overall flow score should help to identify those individuals who are more likely to experience flow, with higher scores on the DFS-2 implying higher frequency of flow occurrence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022429411434931">Table 4</xref>). These data indicate that 95% of elite students reported experiencing flow <italic>frequently</italic> or <italic>always</italic>, with a lower figure of 87% of the younger and amateur students reporting similar experiences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429411434931">Table 4</xref>). However, on further observation of frequency data for the various dimensions of flow, greater variance in scores was found across the subscales. For example, although 95% of the elite music students reported experiencing flow frequently, 55% reported experiencing a <italic>sense of control</italic> frequently, 65% reported experiencing <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic>, and a much lower percentage of 26% reported experiencing <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> frequently. This is a troubling result for the interpretation of overall flow scores, considering the importance of each of these dimensions to the experience and occurrence of flow, and in particular for the <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic> dimension, which is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi (1999)</xref> as “the most telling aspect of the flow experience” (p. 20). Again, this raises the possibilities that not all dimensions of flow are equally important or that the relevant items do not capture the dimensions of flow that they are aiming to investigate.</p>

<p>With regard to the amateur music students, there were nonsignificant correlations between the flow dimension of <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> and six of the remaining eight subscales: <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.09), <italic>clear goals</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = −0.09), <italic>clear feedback</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.09), <italic>sense of control</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.18), <italic>time transformation</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.16), and <italic>autotelic experience</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.13).

<title>Loss of Self-Consciousness Dimension of Flow</title>
<p>We investigated the <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> dimension further because of the anomalous descriptive data reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429411434931">Table 1</xref> (recall that this subscale had a lower mean score and a higher standard deviation than that for the other flow subscales) and because of the frequency data inconsistency reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022429411434931">Table 4</xref> (e.g., 95% of elite students reported experiencing flow <italic>frequently</italic> or <italic>always</italic> but only 26% reported experiencing loss of self-consciousness <italic>frequently</italic> or <italic>always</italic>). On carrying out paired samples <italic>t</italic> tests, significant differences were found between the mean scores on <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> and mean scores on the other eight dimensions of flow, again demonstrating how scores on the <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> dimension differ from scores on the other dimensions.</p>
<p>Pearson bivariate correlations were used to examine relationships between <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> and other aspects of flow. For the total sample of 205 participants, <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> was found to correlate significantly with five of the eight other dimensions of flow: <italic>challenge-skill balance, concentration, sense of control, time transformation</italic>, and <italic>autotelic experience</italic>. For the elite music students, significant correlations were obtained between <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> and all of the other dimensions but one, the exception being <italic>clear feedback</italic>. For the amateur music students, significant correlations were found only between <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> and two of the other dimensions: <italic>challenge-skill balance</italic> and <italic>concentration</italic>.</p>
<p>These results suggest that there are differences between the experience of elite students and amateur students and that when elite students experience flow, loss of self-consciousness is indeed part of the flow experience. Therefore, it is problematic to interpret high global flow scores as a measure of flow when scores for <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> are low. <italic>Loss of self-consciousness</italic> is an important dimension of flow (“closely aligned to the <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic>,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1999</xref>, p. 27), and the results suggest that loss of self-consciousness does not occur as frequently as flow is reported to occur. This seems to imply that flow is not occurring as frequently as the data findings suggest and that interpretation of global flow scores is potentially hazardous.</p>

<sec id="section16-0022429411434931">
<title>Summary of Study Findings</title>
<p>The present study attempted to fill a gap in the research literature by investigating the flow experiences of a large sample (<italic>n</italic> = 205) of elite and amateur music students using the Dispositional Flow Scale–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>). A number of conclusions emerged from the results. First, experiences of flow were very common among the musician participants. To illustrate, 95% of the elite students and 87% of amateur students reported experiencing flow frequently. Interestingly, few, if any, previous authors have provided any data on how many of the performers in their sample experienced flow. In a similar study with theater actors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429411434931">J. J. Martin and Cutler (2002)</xref> compared graduate actors’ and undergraduate actors’ levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, but they did not report or compare frequency data for flow. Although there is no significant difference between these types of music student in the frequency of their overall flow experience, there are some points of contrast between their ratings of the various component dimensions of flow. For example, amateur music students rated two dimensions lower than did their elite counterparts, <italic>challenge-skill balance</italic> and <italic>clear goals</italic>, but higher on <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic>.</p>
<p>Second, a psychometric evaluation of the DFS-2 revealed impressive reliability and factorial purity for the test. For example, the internal consistency of this measure for the entire sample of musicians was 0.92, which is higher than the alpha level (0.84) found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A. J. Martin and Jackson (2008)</xref> for the recently proposed short scale when carried out with musicians. Similarly, the internal consistency scores of the various subscales of this instrument were high, ranging from 0.72 to 0.91; these scores were comparable with those found in previous studies in both the sport and performing arts domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429411434931">Fournier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429411434931">Kawabata, Mallett, &amp; Jackson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429411434931">J. J. Martin &amp; Cutler, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, a CFA showed that the DFS-2 fits very well into its postulated nine-dimensional structure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429411434931">Csikszentmihalyi, 1990</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1999</xref>). Indeed, the factors extracted from the data accounted for up to 74% of the variance in test scores.</p>
<p>A third finding from the significant positive intercorrelations between subscales of the DSF-2 is that all dimensions of flow are important for the experience of flow for musicians. This finding is somewhat unusual, however, as previous research with athletes has shown that the <italic>time transformation</italic> and <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> dimensions of flow received lower levels of endorsement than the other dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429411434931">Jackson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022429411434931">Russell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022429411434931">Vlachopoulos, Karageorghis, &amp; Terry, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, the findings in the present study support research recently carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429411434931">A. J. Martin and Jackson (2008)</xref>, who found, using the short version of the flow scales, that all dimensions of flow were important for musicians. A similar finding was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429411434931">J. J. Martin and Cutler (2002)</xref> with theater actors. This pattern of results suggests that there may be differences between the flow experience of athletes and those from the performing arts.</p>

<title>Implications for Researchers</title>
<p>Although the DFS-2 has provided important insights into flow experiences, it has a number of psychometric weaknesses that emerged in the present study. Firstly, one of its subscales, <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic>, had relatively low mean scores and relatively high standard deviations compared to the other dimensions of flow. This was the case despite the fact that intercorrelational analysis showed all dimensions to be important for musicians, including <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic>. Secondly, inconsistent scores for the music students across the various flow dimensions on the DFS-2 (e.g., whereas they scored high on <italic>global flow</italic> but low on <italic>merging of action and awareness, loss of self-consciousness</italic>, and <italic>sense of control</italic>) suggest that there may be difficulties in interpreting global flow results. In previous studies, relatively low scores on individual dimensions have been interpreted to indicate a perceived lack of saliency of dimensions to the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429411434931">Jackson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Marsh, 1996</xref>) as distinct from indicating possible psychometric problems with the scales. If this interpretation is correct, then different flow scales may be required for different populations of skilled performers. Despite such reservations about the DFS-2, it is important to note that in this study, CFA, intercorrelations, and reliability analysis all show that the scale is valid and reliable and that all dimensions are important for musicians.</p>
<p>However, on examination of the subscales, a third issue arises concerning psychometric weakness. The <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic> subscale was experienced with less frequency than the global flow score may indicate. Unfortunately, the validity of the scale hinges on this <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic> dimension, which is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi (1999)</xref> as “the most telling aspect of the experience of flow” (p. 20). Indeed, it is precisely this dimension that gave rise to the word <italic>flow</italic> being chosen to describe the optimal experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Kimiecik, 2008</xref>). This seems to suggest that flow actually has not occurred for those who score low on this dimension. Similarly, low frequency scores were found for <italic>sense of control</italic> and for <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic>. Again, these anomalies are notable because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429411434931">Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi (1999)</xref> described both of these dimensions as having “special significance” to the flow experience (p. 72). Despite this claim, participants completing the DFS-2 may have high scores on global flow but relatively low scores on key flow dimensions such as <italic>merging of action and awareness, sense of control</italic>, and/or <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic>. For example, whereas 90% of the total sample reported experiencing flow frequently, only 56% reported experiencing <italic>merging of action and awareness</italic> frequently, 49% experienced <italic>sense of control</italic> frequently, and 29% reported experiencing <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> frequently. Clearly, low scores on these dimensions may mean that flow is not being experienced as often as high global flow scores suggest.</p>
<p>It has been acknowledged in previous research (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429411434931">Jackson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429411434931">Jackson &amp; Eklund, 2002</xref>) that flow states are difficult to measure, particularly since some dimensions of the construct, such as the aforementioned <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic>, are characterized by more ephemeral qualities than are other dimensions. To resolve this issue, and to provide additional evidence on the validity of the various flow scales in the literature, further research is required on the salience of the dimensions of flow for performers in different domains (e.g., music, sport). Within the domain of music, surprisingly little research has been carried out on flow states. Therefore, an obvious avenue for future research in this field is the systematic investigation of the antecedents and correlates of flow among professional musicians. In this regard, a multi-method approach would be appropriate in which psychometric measures of flow are augmented by in-depth interviews and perhaps a longitudinal diary study of musicians’ experiences of peak performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429411434931">Custodero (1998)</xref> employed an approach using video recording to observe and analyze the flow experiences of very young music makers that could potentially be adapted for use with professional musicians. Although existing flow scales are adapted easily from sport to music, domain-specific qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, diary studies) are required to capture adequately the richness of musicians’ experience of flow.</p>

<title>Implications for Educators</title>
<p>A key theme in the findings is <italic>continuity</italic>. Although there are important differences between the amateurs and elite musicians, the fact that large majorities in both groups had experienced flow in musical settings means that educators could potentially begin thinking about supporting and looking for flow experiences even in those who are in the early stages of their learning experiences in music. Given that flow is an unambiguously positive experience, then a case could be made that promoting its frequency for the novice musician is especially important since it is likely to encourage the individual to persist in learning, at a stage when his or her performance will lack the necessary polish to elicit positive feedback from audiences. Of course, the difficulty for educators is that, thus far, research has been able to retrospectively record experiences of flow; creating the necessary foundations to actually intervene to promote the phenomenon is still some time away. However, the lag between accurate <italic>understanding</italic> and actual <italic>application</italic> is ubiquitous across scientific domains, and at least knowing that the phenomenon of flow exists and is beneficial to performance could be a useful asset to the educator. In fact, our guess is that most music educators already have an informal knowledge of a flow–performance link; the diffusion of the idea that the concept of flow has been confirmed formally by empirical research with music performers may encourage some educators to strive toward accelerating its presence among their students.</p>
<p>The other element of continuity that has some importance in terms of educational application is the idea that some of the walls between performance domains are artificial. The key finding was that the way in which flow was experienced in the music conservatory was not found to differ from the experience of flow on the sports campus. It may well be that many of the highly formalized approaches to training and self-control devised by sport psychologists with highly specific physical activities in mind turn out to be at least partially applicable to the performance of music. In other words, there are more continuities than differences to the challenge of encouraging optimal performance in various domains than typically is perceived. And putting it most bluntly, it is feasible that music educators could consider cherry-picking and adapting some of the most successful training techniques found in sports settings.</p>
<p>Finally, to discontinuity, the subtle but significant differences between the amateurs and elite cannot be overlooked. The elite musicians did not score as high on <italic>loss of self-consciousness</italic> in comparison to the amateurs. Accomplished musicians may find that at a certain point of expertise and professional development, they tend to be at least partially self-aware and experience flow only in the most intensely challenging situations. Novices, on the other hand, may be fully engaged in the task and may lose the self, because all of their psychological resources are focused highly on the task in hand.</p>
<p>The present study has demonstrated not only that the Dispositional Flow Scale–2 is a generally reliable and factorially-sound measure of the construct of flow but also that flow states are experienced frequently by music students. Even so, our results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting high global flow scores as occurrence of flow states, particularly in the case of low scores on dimensions that are key to the experience of flow. Flow is complex and difficult to measure, and it is therefore recommended that, for in-depth knowledge of flow, other methodologies be employed to supplement the self-report survey investigations. There is great scope for flow research to be expanded in the field of music and the performing arts. Further in-depth investigation of musicians’ experiences of flow and how flow occurs for musicians would have implications and untold benefits for education within music performance.</p>
