<p>This stimulating volume consists in ten essays, each of which undertakes to reveal how various parts or themes of the book of Ezekiel transform earlier biblical material in ways which are textually or theologically innovative. The final chapter shows how the writer of the New Testament book of Revelation identified himself closely with Ezekiel’s personality and theology in expressing his vision and message to churches of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>In the first essay Michael Lyons deals with Ezekiel’s use of the Holiness Code. He writes ‘by transforming earlier legal material into accusations, and conditional covenant promises into descriptions of actual devastation, Ezekiel could account for the exile by creating a causal connection between the people’s behaviour and the disaster they experienced.’ Tova Ganzel shows how, in Ezekiel 8 especially, the prophet knows and melds together the oracles in the Priestly Code and in Deuteronomy so as to produce a theology of a defilement, which is not purely physical but deriving from idolatrous worship, and is the prime cause of Babylonian exile. In the next, and longest essay, William Tooman uses the Gog oracles to show how, in them, a priestly author in the Hellenistic period has used a pastiche of earlier texts to assert an eschatological restoration of exiled Israel, in which all God’s promises will be poured out on God’s people in the end, in a passage which was never part of Ezekiel’s earlier theology.</p>
<p>The second part of the volume is concerned not so much with the book of Ezekiel’s use of older texts but with its transformation of earlier traditions and theology. Jill Middlemas shows how the book ‘establishes a type of distance between divinity and forms.’ ‘Images are employed only to reject them.’ The divine image, in Ezekiel, fades from view and is replaced by the divine word, as in the Final Temple vision. Paul Joyce writes of moral transformation in the book, whereby ‘the righteousness that would not avert disaster and the sin that does not prevent deliverance highlight that all depends on God’s continuity of providential activity.’ For Joyce it is God who alone makes possible Israel’s restoration, for his own name’s sake, making Ezekiel ‘the most God-centred book in the Bible.’ Thomas Krüger then demonstrates how history is transformed in Ezekiel 20, where it is understood as a kind of educative process leading to ‘a better understanding of what is good for life and for freedom, and a better understanding of Yahweh as the force of life and freedom.’</p>
<p>Next Paul Raabe addresses Ezekiel’s oracles against the nations. They are punished for despising Judah and Jerusalem; for human pride and hubris; and in order to ensure that Israel, and not the nations, will focus the world’s eyes upon their God, who does all these things. The nations are not to be admired: hope for Israel lies pre-eminently in the splendour of their God. Daniel Block then shows how royal ideology is transformed by Ezekiel, where Israel’s post kings were failures, Nebuchadnezzar their deliverer from the entail of such misrule, and the idealised picture of the Prince (not King) in the final chapters is to ensure that deity, people and land can at last enjoy the ancient ideals which their kings had not lived up to.</p>
<p>In the last part of the volume Timothy Mackie compares Ezekiel 7 in the Masoretic Text and in the Septuagint, showing how the language of the MT’s additions to the Ur-text is drawn directly from the text of Daniel 7-12, i.e. the Daniel text is by now viewed as part of the scripture which bears on contemporary early second-century challenges to Israel’s faith, so that a new ‘canon-consciousness’ is attested in the MT expansion. Finally, the book of Revelation, according to Beate Kowalski, is based on much of Ezekiel’s experience and material: spirit-transportation; plagues and living creatures; merkabah-mysticism; vocation narrative; lamentation; visions, and Jerusalem-centredness. Steve Moyise is quoted approvingly, ‘(John) has taken on the mind of Ezekiel and invites “in the spirit’’’</p>
<p>This volume’s riches deserve careful study, and will undoubtedly promote the already burgeoning scholarly dialogue about the history, text, and theology of Ezekiel, to which the useful bibliographies bear eloquent witness.</p>
