<p>The video <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> is a part-documentary, part-fictional argument that our present activities, if left unchecked, will cause climate change that will result in the end of humans and most or all other living species by the middle of this century. It is set in 2055 and only one man (portrayed by the actor Peter Postlethwaite) is alive, living in an enormous tower in the Arctic Ocean. He is our narrator and the tower is the Global Archive, a digitized repository of documents and museum of pickled animals and cultural artifacts. At the film’s start and finish are rapid time-lapse sequences of horrific images leading up to 2055: the Amazon forest aflame, the Alps bare of any snow, the Arctic ice sheet melted, London covered by water, Sydney burning, the Taj Mahal in ruins, Las Vegas lying under sand, New Orleans ravaged by numerous hurricanes, famines, wars, mass migrations, refugee camps, and nuclear war, all leading to a world without recognizable life. The narrator tells us that the 2055 conditions were caused by human activities up to the year 2015, that we observed the beginning consequences, and that our own experts told us what would happen if we did not reduce greenhouse gases. Why didn’t we save ourselves? he asks, and then uses a computer and the digital archive to take us back to 2007 and become acquainted with eight genuine people.</p>
<p>Fernand Pareau of France is an elderly guide on an alpine glacier who has watched the glacier retreat greatly during his lifetime; he despairs at unnecessary truck traffic adjacent to the glacier and the expanding highways and tunnels necessary for them and eventually joins others protesting further expansion. Alvin DuVernay of New Orleans is a middle-class paleontologist who works for Shell Oil and who rescued more than 100 people from the floodwaters after Katrina while his own home was destroyed. He describes the devastation of losing his home and all of his belongings and his frustration with inefficient use of petroleum. Jeh Wadia of India is an elite businessman who is launching a new, budget airline called GoAir with the aim of making air travel affordable to many more people. Layefa Malin of Nigeria is a young woman whose aspirations to be a doctor are severely constrained by poverty despite living in an oil-producing area; she first tries to make a living fishing but turns to selling black-market diesel because the few fish she catches must first be cleaned of oil before she can sell them. She describes the pollution, crime, poverty, and other damages that Shell Oil has caused to the people and environment where she lives. Adnan and Jamila Bayyoud of Jordan are brother and sister, child refugees from the U.S.-led Iraq war who sell used shoes donated from the United States. Their father was killed and older brother badly burned when a U.S. missile destroyed their home on the second day of that conflict, and their brother is still in Iraq despite repeated attempts to cross the border illegally to join them. The two portray house-to-house gun and grenade battles and agonizing death; Jamila also portrays herself as an Al-Jazeera reporter, her professional dream. Finally there are Piers and Lisa Guy of England and their three children. Piers is a wind-farm developer whose proposed projects are blocked by nearby residents who are also concerned about the environment. In addition, the Guy family decide they must reduce their carbon footprint dramatically and successfully do so, and Piers explains that they feel it is a moral choice because not doing so could cause the deaths of people in the future.</p>
<p>There are also several animated shorts and a brief interview with a climate-change expert as well as interspersed commentary from the narrator. One animated short is about wars for resources that move from battle with archery and spear over goats, to various colonial wars, to the war in Iraq over oil. A second argues that the combination of consumerism and capitalism requires the ever-enlarging consumption of resources and thus climate change. A third describes a mechanism for stabilizing and reducing greenhouse gases that has been agreed upon by the World Bank and many other nations: capping greenhouse gas emissions and distributing shares to nations. The sole climate-change expert interviewed in the film is Mark Lynas, journalist and author of the book <italic>Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X13485554">2008</xref>). He states that conservation groups, international corporations, and government agencies agree we must stabilize global temperatures within 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Beyond that we cross a tipping point, global warming goes out of control, and most of life on earth is eventually wiped out. To achieve this stabilization, greenhouse gas emissions must begin decreasing by 2015 and decline at least 80 percent by the year 2050. He does acknowledge that this is probably the greatest task that humanity has ever faced.</p>
<p>All of the above is presented as a patchwork of short segments so that each person’s story moves forward simultaneously, interspersed with other elements and commentary from the narrator. There is a companion website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.spannerfilms.net/films/ageofstupid">http://www.spannerfilms.net/films/ageofstupid</ext-link>) with a great deal more information about the film and related efforts, some of it current and some not, but nothing specifically for instructors.</p>
<p>The film has important positive attributes. It connects individual actions from persons across the world to processes and events of potentially enormous impact. The personal stories, the dramatic trope of the narrator, and the clever and amusing animated shorts certainly keep the viewer’s attention, and the film is appropriate for undergraduates at all levels.</p>
<p>But <italic>The Age of Stupid</italic> has serious flaws. First, the climate changes it presents and the resulting end of human as well as most other life forms are gross exaggerations of the same scientific agreements that the filmmakers state they are based upon: current reports from the United Nations and the European Union. Projections to the end of this century from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X13485554">IPCC 2007</xref>) or the European Union Directorate-General for Climate Action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X13485554">DG CLIMA 2011</xref>) include extremely grim consequences, but far short of what is depicted in the film, much less by 2055. This extremism is also evident in several of the animated sequences, and it led the director to include segments that only distract from the central theme of the film. For example, the extraction and burning of petroleum as fuel and its contribution to climate change can take place with or without wars such as Iraq or the local effects depicted in Nigeria. The film would have been more coherent and more effective had it maintained a focus on climate change.</p>
<p>Second, the film is a call for all to take immediate actions but falls short in explaining what those actions can or should be or that many are carrying them out. There is little description of specific actions to reduce climate change. That is why the makers of the video also launched 10:10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1010global.org/">http://www.1010global.org/</ext-link>), a campaign to persuade people and organizations to pledge to reduce their carbon footprint by at least 10 percent during the next year. The Guy family in England serves as a very good role model for reducing carbon output, and more such examples are needed. Instead, the film paints nearly all of its audience as wasteful and stupid. Such an approach not only insults the viewers but also violates the tenets of social norming, a technique of persuasion that has been demonstrably successful in reducing energy use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X13485554">Griskevicius, Cialdini, and Goldstein 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, I cannot recommend this film for the classroom unless an instructor is willing to point out its significant flaws and provide additional information. Given that it is 90 minutes long to start with, that is asking a great deal.</p>
