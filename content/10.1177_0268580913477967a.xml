<body>
<p>Although in <italic>Wissenschaft als Beruf</italic> Weber states unequivocally that all scientific work is necessarily a temporary achievement destined to be bypassed (see Dreijmanis, p. 40), this rule does not seem to be applicable to his own work. During the almost 100 years since his death in 1920, his publications have been the subject of countless articles, chapters and books in dozens of languages. Since he is hailed as one of the founding fathers of sociology, Weber is cited in every textbook that deals with social science. Enthusiastic disciples and radical critics alike confront – defend, denounce, interpret and reinterpret – his writings on economics, on religion, on politics, as well as on methodology and on culture. Despite the many rapid changes that characterize the twenty-first century, interest in Weber’s thought and work has not declined. This is disclosed in ongoing publications. Among the examples: a new translation by Stephen Kalberg of Weber’s probably most widely quoted work, <italic>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</italic>, was published just a decade ago. A special journal, <italic>Max Weber Studies</italic>, was initiated in 2000, and is published regularly twice a year. Decisive testimony of how widespread and unrelenting is the interest in Weber can, of course, be found in Alan Sica’s <italic>Comprehensive Bibliography</italic>, which was published in 2004. Thus, even when approaching the modest volume of this review, a far more extensive discussion than I can undertake here seems to be required. I will, however, limit my remarks to the contribution that Dreijmanis’s volume makes.</p>
<p>Among all the analyses of Weber’s work, relatively little attention has been paid to how Weber actually lived. At best, biographical notes tend to flatten the life into an exhaustive outline of dates and places. The complex human being that his widow Marianne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580913477967">M Weber, 1926</xref>) described in a monograph is rarely explored further or, in some cases, even borne in mind. It is from this perspective that we can appreciate the book prepared by John Dreijmanis. The handy volume presents in German the texts of ‘Science as a Vocation’ and ‘Politics [and Policy] as a Vocation’. Both texts are, of course, available in German and in translation in various editions. But Dreijmanis has made several important additions to the originals. For one thing, the sources and in some cases (too few to my taste), the contexts of passages in the lectures are annotated. For another, Dreijmanis has written an introduction which attempts a theoretical characterization of Weber the man. Finally, the book includes relevant newspaper articles, letters and even a few protocols from meetings in the German Sociological Society and in university conclaves. As observations written by Weber, or as summaries of discussions in which Weber took part, all of these items illustrate how in practice, the ideas explicated at length in the renowned talks came into play when Weber encountered what he interpreted as urgent professional or political issues.</p>
<p>Dreijmanis’s Introduction (pp. 1–29) is fascinating in its description of Weber as a person with the strengths of a great scientist and the weaknesses of an explosive human being. He quotes liberally not only from Marianne Weber’s biography, but also from letters written by the Webers’ friend, the phenomenologist Karl Jaspers, from letters written by Weber to members of his family and to a mistress, as well as comments by people who knew him in various contexts. From the different points of view, the reader is shown Weber’s electrifying personality, his defence of truthfulness in research, and his refusal to compromise on rationality in political matters.</p>
<p>In these few dozen pages, the reader becomes more fully aware of the complexity of Weber’s accomplishment. Weber’s biography is that of a brilliant jurist–historian–social scientist who suffered for years from breakdowns and bouts of depression. Despite his conviction (as quoted in Dreijmanis) that lecturing was his most satisfying pursuit, he had to withdraw from being a professor at Heidelberg because the stress of university life had negative effects on his health. He did not, however, withdraw from sociological affairs. For more than a decade, he worked at research, was co-editor of the <italic>Archiv für Socialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik</italic>, and was one of the founders of the German Sociological Association, which he left because of a disagreement on its scientific orientation. Only in 1918 did Weber feel strong enough to return to the university, and this, of course, was a short time before his death from pneumonia in 1920.</p>
<p>The lively sketch of Weber’s life, which provides evocative hints of what it was like for Weber to live as a giant social scientist, is marred, however, by Dreijmanis’s decision to describe Weber in terms of Jung’s theory of personality types, with support from Myers–Briggs indicators. The introduction begins with a description of the types, leading to a ‘definition’ of Weber in terms of that typology. After this overture, the chapter goes on with the story as revealed by colleagues, students and friends, but every so often, the editor stops to summarize Weber’s behaviour in the terminology presented at the outset. Considering that a typology of personalities can at best be seen as one which provides a basis for understanding how every particular person is indeed unique (an ideal type in the Weberian sense), it is not clear why conclusions as to the degree to which Weber conforms to the framework should be underlined. In a sense, the exercise seems to be testing Weber for his capacity to fulfil the editor’s interpretation of Jung <italic>cum</italic> Myers–Briggs. The psychologism adds nothing to an understanding of ideal types as a methodology, nor does it add anything to the reader’s understanding of Weber as a person. A more enlightening choice would have been to provide details and perhaps even an analysis of the sociological and political context in which Weber acted.</p>
<p>As to the written materials that are presented between <italic>Wissenschaft als Beruf</italic> and <italic>Politik als Beruf</italic>, they are fascinating reading. All of them actually have to do with academic life. In tirelessly defending the application of purely scientific criteria against government intervention in appointments, for example, Weber’s actions and polemical writing illustrate his passion for academic freedom in the most basic sense of the concept. He opposed the appointment of a professor who was supported by a government minister. He defended the right of Michels to do a doctorate on an unpopular subject. In his statement against recognizing what he calls a Department of Catholic Theology in Salzburg as a university, he provides an insight into the universality he held necessary to justify the recognition of a truly academic institution. A significant document is the quotation of an interchange between Weber and the Senate of the University of Munich after nationalistic students demonstrated against his lecture on the condition of German society after the First World War. Called to task by the Senate of the University, Weber insists that his statements were analytical, and were he to carry out the lecture again, he would not change a word. As we know, Weber was adamant that scientific texts must be laid out so as not to evoke emotional responses, but he did not always apply the principle. As his apologies for disappointing the hearers of the two lectures included here indicate, he knowingly chose points of analysis that were likely to provoke opposition even though he chose a rather pedestrian tone. It has, moreover, been rightly noted that his rational description of political behaviour in the <italic>Politik</italic> paper is brutal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913477967">Turner, 2009</xref>). Indeed, when he defended his stand on concrete issues, Weber was passionately militant. In short, the 35 items in this volume seem to be telling a story of their own. And as these selections show, when fighting for justice in academic institutions, Weber did not hesitate to write, and to behave as a person with politics as a vocation.</p>
<p>All together, this collection provides interesting points of view on Weber and the choice of items is, as noted, illuminating. Still, one must be aware that this is not <italic>all</italic> of Weber’s writings on science and politics. Actually, the editor himself cites collections that include additional materials; and in the 53-volume edition of Weber’s ‘Complete Works’ that is being prepared by Mohr Siebeck (see Driejmanis, p. 11), there will no doubt be additional polemical writings on these topics. In sum, however, the volume does provide provocative insights for readers who are meeting the vocation papers for the first, or even the <italic>n</italic>-teenth time.</p>
