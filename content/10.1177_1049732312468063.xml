<abstract>
<p>There is a paucity of explicit literature outlining methods for single-interview studies with children, and almost none have focused on engaging children with disabilities. Drawing from a pilot study, we address these gaps by describing innovative techniques, strategies, and methods for engaging children and youth with disabilities in a single qualitative interview. In the study, we explored the beliefs, assumptions, and experiences of children and youth with cerebral palsy and their parents regarding the importance of walking. We describe three key aspects of our child-interview methodological approach: collaboration with parents, a toolkit of customizable interview techniques, and strategies to consider the power differential inherent in child–researcher interactions. Examples from our research illustrate what worked well and what was less successful. Researchers can optimize single interviews with children with disabilities by collaborating with family members and by preparing a toolkit of customizable interview techniques.</p>

<p>In this article, we outline an innovative methodological approach to combining techniques, strategies, and methods with the aim of optimizing single interviews conducted with children and youth with disabilities. These young people accumulate a great deal of first-hand expertise developed during their early immersion in the worlds of rehabilitation and health. Their perspectives are vital to informing understandings of the impact of rehabilitation services on the lives of people with disabilities. However, there is little information to guide researchers in eliciting these children’s views through interviews. There is a burgeoning literature on child qualitative methods, with many articles focused on the process of engaging children in interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">Christensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312468063">Danby, Ewing, &amp; Thorpe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312468063">Docherty &amp; Sandelowski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468063">Irwin &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468063">Kirk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312468063">Kortesluoma, Hentinen, &amp; Nikkonen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312468063">Morrow, 2001</xref>). Most often, the study methods described involve multiple interviews or prolonged engagement with children in participatory ethnographic designs. Little information is available regarding optimizing single-interview data collection, and almost none are focused on engaging children with disabilities in research.</p>
<p>Following an overview of our study context and a brief outline of principles guiding critical children’s research, we discuss and illustrate three key aspects of our methodological approach: (a) collaboration with parents, (b) a toolkit of customizable interview techniques, and (c) strategies to consider the power differential inherent in child–researcher interactions. Throughout the article, we reflect on the potential benefits and limitations of our approaches and comment on the iterative process of modifying and adapting interviewing methods. We conclude with recommendations for interviewing children with disabilities that we suggest might be equally useful for interviewing individuals of varying ages and abilities.</p>
<p>A note on language usage: Acknowledging debate on the matter, we use the term <italic>children with disabilities</italic> and other variants of “people-first” language in this article, which is common in a North American context. There is no one agreed-on or correct way to use terminology when writing about disability. Placing the noun <italic>children</italic> before <italic>disability</italic> is a signifier that the individual is a child first and foremost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312468063">Royea &amp; Appl, 2009</xref>). Conversely, the term <italic>disabled children</italic> is more commonly used in the United Kingdom and in the field of disability studies. In this usage, disability is not considered a condition of individuals, as might be implied by the phrase <italic>with disabilities</italic>, but rather something experienced because of prejudice, discrimination, and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312468063">Barnes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312468063">Morris, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312468063">
<title>Principles of Critical Research With Children</title>
<p>The “new social studies of childhood” positions children as viable, competent, expert research participants whose perspectives on issues that affect their daily lives in the “here and now” are important and different from those of their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">Christensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312468063">James &amp; Prout, 1997</xref>). This view contrasts with more conventional approaches wherein children are seen as not fully formed and as incapable of understanding and sharing their own experiences, and wherein it has been suggested that children’s lives need to be viewed and interpreted through a more “mature,” adult lens.</p>
<p>A growing body of literature reflects the challenges faced by researchers attempting to reconcile newer ways of conceptualizing childhood with taken-for-granted assumptions that are inherent in many methods developed specifically for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312468063">Christensen &amp; Prout, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">Christensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468063">Irwin &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468063">Kirk, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">Christensen (2004)</xref> noted a weakening of conventional research approaches in which researchers do things “to” children, and a move toward researchers researching “with” children. She strongly advocated
<disp-quote>
<p>the importance of researchers seeing children primarily as fellow human beings. . . . This entails not treating children as in principle different from adults. The approach does not assume that particular methods are needed for research with children just because they are children, that a different set of ethical standards is required or that the problems faced during research process are unique to working with children. (p. 165)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead of assuming that some methods are necessarily best suited to interviewing children, it has been recommended that researchers engage children in the research process by ensuring that practices are reflective of individual children’s experiences, interests, values, and everyday routines, and that researchers consider the unique ways they routinely express and represent themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">Christensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312468063">Kortesluoma et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In a review of methodological issues related to conducting research with children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468063">Kirk (2007)</xref> debated whether or not there is a need for developing “child-friendly” methods, concluding that novel techniques for use in qualitative research with children might be equally helpful with interviewing adults. In fact, many visual and arts-based methods described in research with children were originally developed and continue to evolve in research with adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312468063">Catterall &amp; Ibbotson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312468063">Miles, 1990</xref>). Whereas some exemplary work is available to guide studies involving more extended engagement in children’s health contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312468063">Drew, Duncan, &amp; Sawyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312468063">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312468063">Nicholas, Picone, &amp; Selkirk, 2011</xref>), little is available to guide single interview methods with children and youth with disabilities. Researchers might design studies involving single interviews with child participants in a variety of circumstances; for example, when there are limits on the time available with participants and their families, when multiple interviews might create an unreasonable economic burden for families, or when access to participants is limited by distance.</p>

<sec id="section2-1049732312468063">
<title>Study Context</title>
<p>In a pilot study conducted in Ontario, Canada, we explored the beliefs, assumptions, and experiences of children with disabilities, their parents, and clinicians regarding the importance of walking. We obtained ethics approval from the children’s rehabilitation center where we conducted the study. We aimed to refine innovative interview methods developed in earlier research by members of the investigative team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312468063">Epstein, Stevens, McKeever, Baruchel, &amp; Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312468063">Teachman, 2006</xref>), with a view to optimizing researchers’ understandings of children’s world views while respecting and acknowledging their potential vulnerabilities. We framed the study within a critical social science perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468063">Eakin, Robertson, Poland, Coburn, &amp; Edwards, 1996</xref>), with explicit intentions to explore ways that dominant normative discourses about walking are reproduced, reformulated, and resisted, and to (re)consider taken-for-granted assumptions in the field of children’s rehabilitation.</p>
<p>We interviewed six pairs, with each pair consisting of a child or youth with cerebral palsy and one of his or her parents, for a total of 12 study participants. The children and youth who participated were between 7 and 18 years of age. All had had been involved in some type of walking therapy and used some type of walking aid (e.g., walker, wheelchair) for at least some of their mobility needs. We conducted separate one-on-one interviews with parents and their children in participants’ homes or at the rehabilitation center, as described below. Two researchers with clinical and research expertise in childhood disability (Gail Teachman and Barbara Gibson) conducted the interviews. The interviews with child and youth participants averaged 45 minutes in length, ranging from 35 to 65 minutes. We have reported the study results elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312468063">Gibson &amp; Teachman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312468063">Gibson et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Three Key Elements of Our Methodological Approach</title>
<sec id="section4-1049732312468063">
<title>Collaboration With Parents</title>
<p>Researchers have recommended working with parents prior to an interview to learn about the preferences of the child of those parents, and to identify strategies that might contribute to the child’s comfort in the interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468063">Irwin &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). Knowledge of contextual details of a child participant’s life and circumstances can enrich interactions, helping the researcher to identify potential relevant avenues for exploration. Early in the study, we realized the value of obtaining contextual information from the parent prior to the interview with the child, with a view to strengthening the quality of the data we were able to generate. Initially, we prepared for the child interviews using only basic information about their age, diagnosis, and walking ability, which we elicited from the study recruiter and from an initial phone contact with parents. With the first two families, two researchers in separate areas within the family home interviewed the parent and child participants simultaneously.</p>
<p>It was clear, when reflecting on those initial interviews, that it would be helpful to gather more contextual information from parents about the child’s current and recent therapies, their school placement, their typical modes of mobility, and the assistive devices they used. In subsequent interviews, we gathered this information through a brief discussion with a parent prior to conducting the child interview. By doing so, we could more readily adapt elements of our interview methods, such as role-play and vignette activities (described below) to include familiar types of therapy, similar school settings, and characters that were “like” the individual child or youth.</p>
<p>For example, in an interview with a 12-year-old boy, a vignette scenario was adapted to include a character of the same gender and age who used similar modes of mobility and attended a similar type of therapy activity. We found that this contextual background information was critical to the interviewer, who then customized the interview methods to resonate with that child’s own experiences and improvised her own dialogue to match that of the participant. This is consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312468063">Barter &amp; Renold (2000)</xref> who, in a study of peer violence among youth in residential children’s homes, noted that study participants were better able to engage in discussion when they had experience with the situations depicted in the vignettes. The following extract from the interviewer’s notes describes another example from our study:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had followed through on the idea of getting a little more information ahead of time from the parent to allow me to customize the role-play and other vignette activities, to assist the child to draw from their own experiences and project these onto the characters. This appeared to be very helpful today, as the young girl commented: “Just like me!” on hearing the vignette and when asked, “Do you have any stories like that?” she readily described similar situations that she had experienced.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Reflecting on this process, we did not believe that our prior collaboration with parents presented a challenge to the children’s ability to represent their own views about walking and mobility. Rather, we viewed the parents’ collaboration as vital to establishing a safe and comfortable interview frame in which there was acknowledgment of the interdependence of family members. By speaking with parents ahead of the interview, we were better able to frame and contextualize the interview in ways that we hoped would resonate with the child. We did not view the parent comments as representations or proxies of the child’s viewpoints, but only as points of departure for later engagement of the child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312468063">
<title>A Toolkit of Customizable Interview Techniques</title>
<p>Initially we anticipated the need to develop an interview guide based on normative developmental assumptions about participants’ cognitive and language skills; however, based on newer critical approaches to research with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">Christensen, 2004</xref>), we decided to develop methods that we could readily individualize. We began by developing a traditional interview guide based on the research questions and aims. Based on a number of novel or emerging interview methods and techniques, we then prepared a toolkit of materials to support a dynamic, individualized interview process. These methods included (a) warm-up activities, (b) role play with puppets, (c) vignettes about an imaginary child who has cerebral palsy, (d) cartoon captioning, (e) photographs depicting children’s geographies, and (f) sentence starters.</p>
<p>Selection and presentation of these interview methods (along with more traditional interviewing question-and-answer discussion) varied according to each participant’s self-representation, demonstrated abilities, preferences, and comfort during the interview. We did not use all methods with every child. We aimed to optimize the existing skill, confidence, comfort, and experience of the interviewer through use of the toolkit to elicit the highest quality data. We briefly describe each of the methods that made up our toolkit, using examples drawn from our study to highlight issues related to using these methods.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732312468063">
<title>Warm-up activities</title>
<p>At the onset of the interview, we invited child and youth participants to engage in an interviewer card game as a preinterview “warm up.” Our use of this transitional activity aimed to (a) increase comfort and reduce anxiety on the part of participants; (b) aid the interviewer in gauging the communication style of the participant; (c) diminish the power differentials by giving explicit permission for the child to question the interviewer and by reinforcing that there were no “right” answers; and (d) provide early cues to guide the interviewer’s choices of strategies, techniques, and methods from the toolkit best suited for that participant. Our method was similar to the “talking cards” approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312468063">Moore, McArthur, and Noble-Carr (2008)</xref>, an approach that was highly rated by child participants when they were asked to reflect on interview methods that they would recommend.</p>
<p>The interviewer card game in our study involved choosing from a deck of question cards, then playing the role of interviewer by asking the question printed on the card. Two identical sets of three cards were prepared: one set for the participant and an identical set for the interviewer. The child was given the opportunity to go first by selecting one of his or her cards, and then reading the question to the interviewer, who would answer the question. The questions were as follows: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? What is your best talent? If you could have any super power, which super power would you choose? Even though the questions did not relate to our research focus (concerning the value of walking and walking therapies), some of the children’s responses provided rich insights into ways they viewed themselves, their bodies, their mobility options, and their assistive devices, as in this excerpt from an interview with a 13-year-old girl:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer (I):</speaker>
<p>If you could have any super power, what would you choose?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Child (C):</speaker>
<p>Make my wheelchair have wings and fly.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>That sounds like a lot of fun. Where would you go?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Around the world.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>What color would it be?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Pink.</p>
</speech>
<p>The girl was sitting in her pink power wheelchair as she made these comments, which provided revealing insight into the ways she had incorporated her wheelchair into her sense of herself, even extending into an imaginary world of possibilities. In another instance, warm-up discussion about imagined super powers provided a reference point later in the interview to prompt a discussion about “ideal” mobility devices.</p>
<p>The game did not always facilitate the desired rapport. When interviewing the first study participant, the interviewer realized that the 10-year-old participant was unable to read the cards, which she had not anticipated. This could potentially have contributed a sense of failure and anxiety at the very onset of the interview. The situation served as a reminder to refrain from making assumptions about participants’ developmental skills and abilities based on age or diagnosis. In all subsequent interviews, the interviewer asked participants whether they wanted to read the cards, or whether they preferred the interviewer to read the cards. We also noted an issue related to the order in which the card game progressed. The researcher always offered participants the first chance to play the role of interviewer in the game. Participants frequently repeated the researcher’s responses when the roles reversed. It might have been that participants judged the researcher’s responses to be appropriate and safe answers, which highlighted participants’ susceptibility to responding in ways that they perceived the researcher would find satisfactory.</p>
<p>Also notable was that this warm-up activity was not engaging for the oldest participant, an 18-year-old youth who had just begun his first year of university:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>You can pick any one of these, and ask me a question first, then, I’ll ask you one of them.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Youth (Y):</speaker>
<p>I don’t want to ask you anything.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Can I ask you one of these?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Y:</speaker>
<p>Sure.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>I’m going to start with this one: What is your best talent?</p>
</speech>
<p>Although the youth went along with this one-sided version of the game, the interviewer judged the teen’s cues as indicative that he was more comfortable participating in ways that he perceived as being “adult.” He was receptive to other methods, including discussing a vignette and discussing his preferred mobility choices in reference to a selection of photographs of various environments. The interviewer did not present the options of cartoon captioning or role play, judging that he was likely to view these as too childish. The experience with this youth demonstrates how, in some cases, older teens and young adults who are keen to establish recognition of their maturity might interpret game-like activities as being childish. However, activities such as games, vignettes, and role play might be very engaging for other participants, including adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312468063">Guillemin, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312468063">
<title>Role play with puppets</title>
<p>Researchers have used puppetry in qualitative interviewing with children to shift dialogue from what might feel like an intense focus on the children themselves toward a position where they can share their views through the perspective of a puppet during a role play activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312468063">Aldiss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312468063">Epstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312468063">Jager &amp; Ryan, 2007</xref>). Epstein and colleagues noted in their research with children with disabilities that the puppet’s gender, ethnicity, and physical appearance influenced the children’s conduct during the interview, suggesting that children might relate more easily to puppets that appeared more “like” them.</p>
<p>In previous research with children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312468063">Teachman (2006)</xref> offered a choice of boy or girl puppets and found that every participant chose his or her same-gender puppet to act out a role play activity. When she outfitted the puppets with splints typically used in rehabilitation, children with disabilities acted more engaged. Building on those findings in this study, participants were offered a choice from among five dolls representative of different genders and ethnicities (different hair and skin color) with arm or leg splints. They could also choose to position the doll with either a doll-sized walker or wheelchair (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312468063">Figure 1</xref>). The interviewer explained that she would use a doll that was going to play the mother character. This doll was slightly larger than the other dolls and was dressed to appear more like an adult.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1049732312468063" position="float">

<p>Dolls used as puppets with “toy” mobility aids</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732312468063-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>As the interview unfolded, the interviewer made decisions about which methods to present from the toolkit and how to individualize them. The following reflective memo describes the cues used to decide on the use of the puppets to structure part of an interview with a 13-year-old girl:
<disp-quote>
<p>The girl seemed interested in the puppets as I prepared for the interview. My initial impressions led me to decide to include this role-play activity in the interview, based on my impression of her level of maturity and sense of playfulness. She did quite easily relate to that activity, choosing the blonde, girl doll and placing her in a wheelchair.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interviewer introduced the role play by saying, “We are going to pretend,” or “Let’s act out a story.” She then set up a story line explaining that the participant could act the role of a child who had cerebral palsy. The interviewer asked the child to pretend his or her character was at home watching his or her favorite television show when the mother interrupts to say that it is time to go to therapy. The interviewer would then introduce herself in the voice of the mother puppet, animating the doll as she was speaking. This role play scenario had been prepared with a potential script that could allow the interviewer to probe, depending on the direction of the emergent dialogue. For example: It’s time to get ready to go to therapy. I know it’s your favorite show, but we need to get going. Yes, I know you don’t want to stop but we’ll be late. Don’t you want to keep working on your walking? Let’s talk about why you’re going to therapy every week. If you could choose by yourself, whether to go to therapy or not, what would you like to do? What would happen if you didn’t go to therapy?</p>
<p>We designed this scenario to elicit children’s views about attending therapy, its role and importance, along with ways that they valued therapy goals for walking. We interpreted children’s dialogue as reflections of their understandings of the everyday discourses within their home and school life. One 10-year-old boy showed considerable interest in the puppets and asked about them at the onset of the interview, so the interviewer used the puppets within both the role play and the vignette activities. The boy related immediately to the boy puppet and talked directly to the puppet as well as “through the puppet” within the role play.</p>
<p>The interviewer did not use puppets with all of the participants. The interviewer made a judgment call based on how the child presented. For example, she selected alternate methods for an 18-year-old male youth and a 12-year-old boy based on their cues regarding how they wished others to view and treat them. Although the 12-year-old boy appeared comfortable throughout the interview and engaged with the vignette, photograph, and cartoon activities, he often responded with, “I dunno [don’t know]” to probes. He periodically leaned back in his chair while yawning in an exaggerated way. When given the opportunity to take a break or end the interview (which was consistent with our ethical approach to observe for and address indications of possible fatigue), he denied being tired and became more visibly engaged. He also frequently ended thoughtful responses by saying, “And blah, blah, blah, blah,” as if detached from his own comments. In these ways, this boy was establishing a particular identity, reinforcing his desire to be involved while simultaneously signaling a “cool” detached teenager identity.</p>
<p>Fernqvist has similarly described the work of “doing age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312468063">2010</xref>, p. 1321), where youth might challenge the interviewer’s control by actively calling on internalized age-related behaviors. For example, she suggested that frequent “I don’t know” responses from a child who is otherwise sharing rich insightful commentary might be a signal that the topic is uncomfortable for that child, who reverts to “doing child”; that is, playing the role of a child who does not have knowledge of importance. Similarly, our research team interpreted the 12-year-old boy’s frequent yawning and repetition of the phrase “blah, blah, blah” as indications that he was asserting himself by “doing teen.” This strategy might have been oriented to deflecting dialogue about feelings and topics that were less comfortable. In spite of his frequent “doing teen” responses and behavior, he shared rich, detailed descriptions about walking, mobility devices, and therapies.</p>

<title>Vignettes about an imaginary child with cerebral palsy</title>
<p>Vignettes are short stories about hypothetical characters in specified circumstances that researchers can use to elicit participants’ values, meanings, and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312468063">Finch, 1987</xref>, p. 105). Miles suggested that vignettes offer opportunities for interviewers to combine a “systematic structured approach with the expression of ‘emic’ or personal meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312468063">1990</xref>, p. 38). Miles developed a method wherein adult research participants wrote a series of vignettes based on their own experiences. The purpose of the vignettes was to record and reflect on specific situations and experiences. Among the advantages noted was the notion that vignettes reflecting common experiences convey to the reader a sense that “I am not alone” (Miles, p. 41). In later modifications of the vignette method, researchers provided prewritten vignettes to participants within the course of a qualitative interview and asked participants how they might resolve a described situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312468063">Barter &amp; Renold, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312468063">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312468063">Wilks, 2004</xref>). With well-constructed vignettes, researchers aim to provide sufficient context to resonate with participants but remain ambiguous enough to prompt judgments, decision making, and descriptions of the views or experiences that influence participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312468063">Barter &amp; Renold, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, the interviewer typically introduced a vignette by pairing it with an image of a same-gender child who was using a mobility aid and was of similar age to the participant. The purpose was to provide a visual representation that would contextualize the vignette and engage the child in the story. Below is a sample of a vignette used in our study:
<disp-quote>
<p>I want to tell you a story about Andrew. This is Andrew in the picture. He is in Grade 3 and he has CP [cerebral palsy]—like you do. He does some things at school differently than the other kids in his class but mostly he tries to be the same as the other kids. One thing that is different for Andrew is his walking—he uses a walker and he needs extra time to get around his school. Sometimes, he has a hard time keeping up with the other kids. Lots of times, he gets tired and has to take a rest. He gets upset about that. One day last week, his teacher said, “I think that you should use your wheelchair when we go out for recess.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sample probes included: What do you think Andrew will say? How do you think he will feel about it? What does he decide to do? Do you have a story like that?</p>
<p>All of the participants acted engaged and responded easily to the vignettes. In several instances, children described similar personal experiences and shared their views and feelings about those experiences. Participants moved with ease between their views about the vignette and their views of their own experiences. The vignettes were particularly helpful in eliciting discussion about ways that participants viewed themselves and wished for others to view them. A 12-year-old girl commented on the importance of using her walker and standing tall, which she identified as a highly valued aspect of being “like everyone else.” She shared that when using a walker, she felt people saw her as being the same as everybody else who walks. She contrasted this with concerns regarding how others view her when she is using her wheelchair:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>I like that I get exercise, ’cause everybody else walks. I don’t want to be like a person that doesn’t walk at all.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Is it important to try to be like everybody else when you can?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it’s pretty important to me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>What do you think it would be like for somebody like the one in the story if she used the wheelchair?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Well, she knows that she can walk; it’s just that people see that she maybe can’t walk. She keeps having to tell people that, like, she can walk. It’s just that she doesn’t.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>What about the walker—do you think that about the walker?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>No, because they see that I just use it for, like support, and not for, just using it.</p>

<title>Cartoon captioning</title>
<p>Cartoon captioning is a projective technique that researchers have used successfully with adult participants in market research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312468063">Broeckelmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312468063">Doherty &amp; Nelson, 2010</xref>) and in educational research with children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312468063">Catterall &amp; Ibbotson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312468063">Warburton, 1998</xref>). Researchers present participants with a cartoon drawing and ask them to suggest ways that they might fill in empty “speech bubbles.” Catterall &amp; Ibbotson noted that this method is especially engaging because it is novel and it generates curiosity, while being conducive to interaction. Cartoon captioning requires the participant to imagine how others might respond to the situation portrayed in the cartoon, in much the same way as vignette methods.</p>
<p>Two cartoons were trialed in our pilot study. We presented the cartoon images using a laptop computer. One cartoon depicted two youths of indeterminate age on a sidewalk. One, a girl, is seated on a power scooter; the other is a boy holding a skateboard. The speech bubbles above their heads are blank (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312468063">Figure 2</xref>). In another cartoon, two figures are poised at the top of a set of steps in an outdoor space. One figure is standing, the other is seated in a wheelchair. Again, the speech bubbles above their heads are blank. This activity was included toward the end of the interview, and modified depending on the sophistication of language and other cues from the participant. In some cases, the interviewer simply provided the cartoon with blank speech bubbles and asked participants to comment on how they might fill the speech bubbles. In other instances, the interviewer verbally provided dialogue for one speech bubble and asked the participant how he or she would fill the other speech bubble.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1049732312468063" position="float">

<caption><p>A cartoon captioning activity</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732312468063-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>This method, although shown to be effective in other research, proved to be challenging with some participants, who struggled to compose captions. In those cases, responses were typically short and proved difficult to probe in depth. Participants might have assumed that their responses needed to be humorous, like a cartoon. As well, in retrospect, some situations portrayed in the cartoon images might have been unfamiliar to the participants, making it more difficult for them to respond meaningfully. Overall, cartoon captioning was an engaging and promising method that elicited perspectives that might otherwise have been missed. For example, a 9-year-old boy who used a walker and a wheelchair for mobility provided some insight into his own experiences related to schoolyard races when he suggested the following sequence of captions:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Scooter girl (G):</speaker>
<p>Let’s have a race.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Skateboard boy (B):</speaker>
<p>No, I don’t want to race.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>G:</speaker>
<p>Why not?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>Because I hate racing you because you go faster than me.</p>
</speech>

<sec id="section10-1049732312468063">
<title>Photographs depicting children’s geographies</title>
<p>Researchers increasingly use photographs to scaffold and elicit dialogue in qualitative interviews with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468063">Kirk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312468063">Morrow, 2001</xref>). We presented a series of photographs depicting a variety of everyday environments that children and youth might navigate to elicit responses about their mobility challenges and preferences. The series included several variations of school classrooms, a school gymnasium, an outdoor playground, a home kitchen, a sidewalk, and various park or natural environments. As with the cartoon images, we presented the photographs in sequence as a slide show presentation on a laptop computer. We asked participants a series of questions related to ways they would choose to mobilize in each environment.</p>
<p>The photographs elicited discussion easily with all participants and at times provided a “break” from more abstract discussions of feelings. They were especially helpful when interviewing a 10-year-old boy who was anxious and struggled with some of the concepts discussed in the interview. He was not able to read the questions for the “Interviewer” warm-up game and was quick to say, “I don’t know.” In responding to the vignette, he quickly gave a response that seemed directed at pleasing the interviewer. However, he relaxed and appeared very engaged when using the laptop computer to control the slideshow and comment on the photographs. The images contextualized the discussion in a very concrete way that helped him to feel more confident in responding. The photographs were also highly engaging for a 12-year-old boy, who reacted to the photographs by becoming animated and imaginative in his comments. The following is an extract from the interview notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The boy, who had been acting bored and frequently yawning, became very engaged by the photographs. I used language like: “If you could walk right into this picture” or “How would you like to get around if you were right here?”, because he was actually touching the screen, asking, “Where am I in the picture?” He seemed to be imagining himself in the picture so I tried to match my prompts to his cues.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312468063">
<title>Sentence starters</title>
<p>Finally, in our toolkit of methods, we were prepared with a variety of sentence starters. This is a technique often used in qualitative interviews when a participant is having difficulty initiating responses, or is uncertain of how the dialogue “should” proceed. Sentence starters give participants permission to talk about sensitive topics or to express views that they might otherwise deem “inappropriate” to express to an adult. This method also tends to decrease the sense that the participant is under pressure to identify and share his or her own views, because the interviewer is responsible for beginning the sentence and the sentence can be framed as a general statement rather than a personal opinion. For example, instead of asking participants to specify whether they liked or disliked elements of their own therapy, the interviewer asked them to complete sentences such as, “The best thing about therapy is . . .,” and, “The worst thing about therapy is . . . .”</p>
<p>Critics might express concern that this technique is leading participants toward specific responses, yet we found a surprising range of responses, including deflection of the topic area. The following excerpt of a sentence-completion activity with a 12-year-old girl demonstrates that the technique does not necessarily lead participants toward a predictable response:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>I think you’ve also tried some Botox? [a drug injected to treat muscle spasticity]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Okay. So if I said, “I like Botox because . . .,” can you fill in that blank? “I like Botox because . . . ”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Ah, no, I can’t say anything.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Okay, that’s fine. How about this one: “I didn’t like Botox because . . . ”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Because it’s, um, painful, and it’s like, for me it doesn’t really help anyways because I just have them because sometimes it helps, but sometimes it doesn’t.</p>
</speech>
<p>The girl went on to explain that other people felt the treatments were helpful and she would likely have them again because “they’re good for me.” Her responses provided insights into her perspective about the relative merits of the treatment.</p>
<p>The toolkit of methods outlined facilitated an individualized, flexible interview process that elicited dynamic interaction and rich information exchange. It also proved useful in shifting the focus of an interview from the participant to a projected “other” whose imagined views and actions were informed by the participant’s own experiences, beliefs, and understandings. In doing so, the methods collectively functioned to help create a safe space for children to share their views, added aspects of “fun” to the experience, and stimulated dialogue.</p>

<title>Strategies to Address the Power Differential Inherent in Child–Researcher Interactions</title>
<p>By providing a range of methods within a single interview, we aimed to deflect attention from the child’s anxiety about needing to provide “right” answers and facilitate opportunities for more open dialogue—sometimes with the interviewer and sometimes with imagined characters or peers. We considered methods to build rapport and address power inequities that were congruent with the critical childhood studies perspectives framing the research. To achieve these aims, we incorporated the following considerations and strategies.</p>
<sec id="section13-1049732312468063">
<title>Building rapport while explicating participants’ rights in the interview</title>
<p>Christensen suggested that child interviewers should “take on and perform themselves as an unusual type of adult, one who is seriously interested in understanding how the social world looks from children’s perspectives but without making a dubious attempt to be a child” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468063">2004</xref>, p. 174). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468063">Irwin &amp; Johnson (2005)</xref> suggested that rapport is a working relationship between the child and the interviewer, as opposed to a “friendship” with the child. They noted that within a social context in which children are actively encouraged not to talk to strangers, interviewers might expect to encounter some difficulty in building rapport with young children, especially during a first or single interview. However, in our experience, children and youth with disabilities have become accustomed to the attentions and interventions of numerable adult professionals. Children with disabilities learn to “go along” with professionals even—perhaps especially—when it is uncomfortable, because it is “for their own good.” Boundaries around privacy and trust might be blurred. Therefore, they might be more trusting of the interviewer and less guarded about sharing intimate, personal insights into their world views.</p>
<p>To address these influences, we explicitly rehearsed ways participants could signal that they wanted to stop, take a break, or refrain from answering a question. Researchers typically review parameters for participating or withdrawing from research with participants. Children who have learned to defer to adults might not easily act on their option to withdraw. To address this, we offered detailed scripted examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468063">Kirk, 2007</xref>), such as, “If you don’t want to talk about something, you can just say, ‘I don’t want to talk about that,’ and it will be okay.” The interviewer also explained that she would interrupt and ask specific questions if the youth showed signs of fatigue or seemed anxious. These reminders served to demonstrate that the interviewer and the participant would share responsibility within the interview. The interviewer gave examples of situations in which she might suggest taking a break, or might remind the child that he or she could choose not to answer any question. To minimize the likelihood that children would feel any sense of failure or confusion during the interview, the interviewer provided explicit examples of this type of question prior to beginning the interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312468063">
<title>Interviewing at home</title>
<p>Whenever feasible, researchers asked children and youth to select a location within their home for the interview. Home interviewing was desirable to address power differentials and create rapport, and it maximized opportunities to observe the participant in a preferred personal space. One participant, a 10-year-old boy, chose his hockey-themed bedroom as the interview location. His choice of interview location established a sense of intimacy, comfort, and privacy, where he readily “took charge” of some aspects of the interaction. During the interview, he frequently pointed to furnishings, photographs, and other favorite possessions to illustrate a point he was making. The setting and the artifacts it contained provided opportunities to elicit dialogue while adding rich descriptive data through observations. He was able to play “host,” which allowed him to share power, at least to some extent, within the interaction.</p>
<p>Even under less than ideal circumstances, interviewing within a participant’s home setting was advantageous. For example, on arriving to interview a 13-year-old girl and her mother, we found the family home under heavy reconstruction with significant noise and interruptions. Yet even in those difficult circumstances, the home environment provided contextual grounding and opportunities for discussion that another location would not have elicited. The girl took the opportunity to share her excitement about the renovations, including an elevator, which would make her home more accessible. This opened further dialog about walking and mobility issues.</p>
<p>Interviewing children in their homes can provide rich complexity along with some degree of unpredictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312468063">MacDonald &amp; Greggans, 2008</xref>). For children who might struggle to sit in one place throughout an interview, the home environment can offer a safe and familiar environment for them to move about more actively in what Irwin and Johnson termed a “kinetic conversation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468063">2005</xref>, p. 826).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have reviewed ways that we adapted and combined interview methods, strategies, and techniques to optimize elicitation of data during single interviews with children and youth with disabilities. To build rapport and provide a supportive, safe interview frame wherein children and youth were able to tell their own stories and share their views, we found it helpful to collaborate with parents, gathering contextual information that served to inform our interviewing methods. Kortesluoma et al. emphasized, “Children certainly know more about what they know than interviewers do” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312468063">2003</xref>, p. 440).</p>
<p>We would suggest that parents also know more about their child than interviewers do, and that multiple sources of information, when used reflexively, can enhance data collection and interpretation. At a minimum, collaboration with parents prior to an interview can get the interviewer “into the same ballpark” so that they are introducing topics and asking questions that will resonate with individual children’s experiences. Researchers might not consider this collaboration with family members “necessary” when interviewing most adults, but it might be tremendously beneficial in some types of research, for example, when adult participants have difficulties with communication.</p>
<p>For this study, we assembled a toolkit of interview methods and customized each interview. This somewhat improvisational approach allowed us to be responsive to participants’ unique experiences, contexts, abilities, and ways of communicating, as well as the evolving interactions within an interview. We learned that even though individual children and youth of a certain age might tend to be more comfortable with particular methods, it was optimal to be prepared to select and combine methods within an interview based more on the participant as an individual than on his or her age. It was helpful to avoid making assumptions about a child or youth based on his or her age or diagnosis. Instead, we aimed to implement methods in a dynamic interview process that would neither overestimate nor underestimate participants’ abilities and communication preferences.</p>
<p>The methodological approaches reported in this article reflect our learning in a small pilot study with children with disabilities across a relatively wide age range. Further work would help to specify how to apply different techniques with different children (not only based on age). The quality of data generated through interviews with children (and adults), regardless of method, is always reliant on the skills of the interviewer; the toolkit is an adjunct to those skills. We suggest that a toolkit of interview methods that can be readily adapted to individual differences among participants might be equally effective with participants of varying ages and varying abilities. Continued implementation and refinement of these methods might yield more in-depth information about the merits of various components and provide more guidance regarding ways to combine these approaches skillfully in a single interview.</p>
