<sec id="section1-1071100712460365">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare questions from outcome questionnaires with items generated by preoperative and postoperative ankle reconstruction patients (using the open-ended questions of self-reported Patient-Specific Index [PASI]) to determine whether existing questionnaires address patients’ concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460365">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Patients (n = 142) completed the PASI. Questions from 6 standardized questionnaires (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Questionnaire [AAOS], patient-reported portion of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Clinical Rating System Ankle-Hindfoot Scale [AOFAS], Foot Function Index [FFI], Lower Extremity Functional Scale [LEFS], Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment [SMFA], Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]) and PASI were matched by 3 reviewers to corresponding categories in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Standardized questionnaires were then compared with the patient responses produced by the PASI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460365">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Patients identified 690 items corresponding to 45 ICF categories. Most PASI concepts fell into Activities and Participation (60.3%) and Body Functions (29.0%) components, including the categories “walking” (19.1%), “pain” (16.5%), and “recreation and leisure” (15.4%); 237 items were identified in questionnaires and linked to 39 ICF categories. Core issues in questionnaires (“pain,” “walking,” “stairs”) were important concerns for patients, but other key patient concerns (“swelling,” “recreation and leisure,” “sports”) were seldom included in questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460365">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>No single questionnaire captured all patient concerns, and standardized questionnaires differed largely in content. This analysis may help guide development of a more comprehensive instrument for evaluating outcomes following ankle reconstruction.</p>

<body>
<p>Traditional objective measures of outcome in ankle reconstruction have included radiographic assessment, alignment, range of motion, and gait analysis; however, these factors may have little correspondence with patients’ perception of their results. Accordingly, clinical researchers and physicians have placed an increased emphasis on patient-reported outcome questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction and function following surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460365">9</xref></sup> Standardized measures of patients’ perspectives not only broaden the medical community’s definition of an “acceptable result” but also improve the ability of health care providers to educate patients anticipating surgery. Furthermore, good patient-reported outcome questionnaires allow clinicians to track individual patient changes over time based on the patient’s perspective as well as to compare this perspective across patients with similar clinical characteristics.</p>
<p>A wide range of patient-reported outcome questionnaires are used to evaluate foot and ankle outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460365">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460365">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460365">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460365">16</xref></sup> and there is little agreement regarding which one best captures the patient’s day-to-day experiences, perceptions of illness, and treatment outcomes. An important first step in deciding between available patient-reported outcome questionnaires is to verify that the content is relevant for the target population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460365">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460365">16</xref></sup> Our clinical knowledge of this patient population leads us to believe that current patient-reported outcome questionnaires may not capture all of the issues relevant to this patient population; therefore, there is a need to revisit the evaluation of the content validity of these measures. One way to determine the specific content needed for a population is to use a patient-specific index whereby patients nominate their own items<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460365">12</xref></sup> (ie, issues that concern them). The items nominated through these measures therefore reflect the most salient issues for patients. In the current study, the open-ended questions of the Self-Reported Patient-Specific Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712460365">24</xref></sup> (PASI) were used as a tool to generate items due to their emphasis on symptoms and activities.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the content validity of standardized patient-reported questionnaires commonly used in assessing lower extremity outcomes from the patients’ perspective by comparing it to the content generated using the PASI.</p>

<sec id="section7-1071100712460365">
<title>Patients and Survey</title>
<p>This study included patients from an orthopedic surgeon’s practice at an urban teaching hospital. A cohort of postoperative patients who had surgery between 2001 and 2007 were contacted as well as all patients on the waiting list for ankle reconstruction. All patients were contacted regardless of their clinical outcome. Postoperative patients were at least 6 months post surgery to reduce the effect of postoperative morbidity. Additional inclusion criteria required that patients be at least 18 years of age and have the ability to complete the informed consent process and questionnaire in English. Institutional ethics approval was obtained.</p>
<p>Potential participants were contacted by mail with telephone follow-up and were provided the consent form and information about the study. Those who agreed to receive the study survey were mailed the survey and a postage-paid return envelope. The survey included the PASI, standardized patient-reported outcome questionnaires, demographic information, and diagnosis and treatment information, although only the results of the PASI are examined here.</p>
<p>One hundred and ninety patients were considered for study enrollment; 48 were ineligible because they did not complete the consent process (n = 35) or declined to participate (n = 13). One hundred forty-two patients consented and participated in the survey (74.7% response rate). This study included data collected from 82 (57.7%) total ankle arthroplasty patients, 18 (12.7%) ankle arthrodesis patients, and 42 (29.6%) patients anticipating surgical treatment for ankle arthritis. The mean age of preoperative patients was 59 years (range, 35-77); 52% of these were male. The mean ages of the arthrodesis and arthroplasty patients were 54 years (range, 22-74) and 64 years (range, 38-92), respectively; 44% of these were male. The average follow-up length for all postoperative patients surveyed was 2.5 years (8-65 months). Detailed patient demographics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712460365">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Self-Reported Patient Specific Index: Open-Ended Questions</title>
<p>The PASI is a standardized outcome measure that can be used to elicit the most salient aspects of patients’ experiences following surgery. Although the PASI contains fixed questions, we focused on the open-ended questions, which allow patients to raise other concerns not covered in the fixed content. Patients were asked to provide 2 symptoms or feelings associated with their ankle problem and to identify 3 activities that were difficult or impossible to perform because of their ankle problem. The validity of this scale has been supported in a total hip arthroplasty population and was strong in terms of its ability to capture relevant areas of impact on patients’ lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712460365">24</xref></sup> Given the exploratory nature of this study, we believed this tool to be appropriate for use in an ankle population.</p>

<title>Standardized Patient-Reported Outcome Questionnaires</title>
<p>Six patient-reported outcome questionnaires were chosen for evaluation of their content validity. They either were stand-alone scales or were the functional component of an aggregate measure of outcome. <italic>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Clinical Rating System Ankle-Hindfoot Scale</italic> (AOFAS) is a combination of subjective and objective questions administered by a clinician that assess function and alignment of the ankle and hindfoot. It is also commonly administered in a mixed clinician- and patient-reported fashion by having patients answer the subjective questions directly, after which the clinician completes the objective questions. The current study included the 5 subjective questions of the tool that evaluate ankle pain and function in daily life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460365">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460365">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>The Foot Function</italic> Index (FFI) includes 23 questions that assess pain, disability, and activity limitations on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). The FFI was developed to assess the patient’s current state and changes over time and has been tested for reliability and validity in patients with conditions affecting the foot and ankle. It has strong internal consistency (α = .96) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.87).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460365">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>The Lower Extremity Functional Scale</italic> (LEFS) assesses the functional ability of the legs and feet to complete 20 common tasks, with each task measured on a 5-point NRS. It has excellent internal consistency (α = .96) and test–retest reliability (<italic>R</italic> = 0.86) and good validity relating to the SF-36 Physical Function Subscale (r = 0.80).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460365">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>The Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment</italic> (SMFA) dysfunction index includes 34 questions assessing functional problems associated with patients’ musculoskeletal disorders. It has excellent reliability (ICC = 0.93), and the test’s convergent validity in relation to clinical measures was measured using Spearman’s rho correlation (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>S</sub> = 0.10-0.46).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460365">20</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index</italic> (WOMAC) has 24 questions assessing pain, stiffness, and physical dysfunction in patients with osteoarthritis. It has been shown to be responsive when compared with Likert and visual analog scales and is reliable preoperatively (Pain: α = .80; Stiffness: α = .88; Physical Function: α = .93) and postoperatively (Pain: α = .93; Stiffness: α = .88; Physical Function: α = .97).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460365">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Questionnaire</italic> (AAOS) has 30 questions assessing symptoms and functional status related to foot and ankle problems. It has excellent internal reliability (α = .93) and construct validity in that it correlates moderately to strongly with other measures of pain and function, such as physician ratings and the WOMAC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460365">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health</title>
<p>To facilitate content comparison of the PASI and the standardized patient-reported outcome questionnaires, the ICF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460365">23</xref></sup> was used as a coding system. The ICF is deemed to be a comprehensive categorization of the way a health condition can affect the life experience of an individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460365">23</xref></sup> Along with providing a set of definitions, it provides the theoretical relationship between concepts, which helps underscore the location of any gaps in content. This type of approach has been used to develop core sets of content for different disease groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460365">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460365">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460365">19</xref></sup> and to compare the content of instruments in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460365">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460365">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ICF consists of 4 components that are coded. Each component includes numbered categories (up to 4 digits), which are unique codes. The first digit in the code represents the category number, and subsequent digits represent second-, third-, and fourth-level categories. For example, within the Activities and Participation component (d), the code d4 indicates a general “mobility” issue, d450 indicates a more specific “walking” issue, and d4501 clarifies the concern even further as “walking long distances.” (Refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460365">Table 1</xref> for a detailed description of the different components of the ICF.)</p>

<p>Linking concepts from the PASI and standardized outcome measures to the appropriate ICF category was performed using rules developed by Cieza et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460365">6</xref></sup> When a question contained a number of different meaningful concepts, multiple ICF codes were linked to the question. For example, “How much pain have you had . . . when going up or down stairs?” WOMAC includes concepts of “pain” and “going up or down stairs,” which can be linked to separate ICF categories. If a question could not be linked because it was unclear, it was labeled <italic>nd</italic> (not defined). If the question was not covered by the ICF, it was labeled <italic>nc</italic> (not coded).</p>
<p>Individual questions from each of the 6 patient-reported outcome questionnaires and the PASI were coded to the ICF independently by a registered nurse and 2 trained research coordinators with experience in clinical arthritis and orthopedic research. The codes for each question were then compared. If there was disagreement, the question was discussed until consensus was reached among all 3 members of the coding team. The concepts from the patient-reported outcome questionnaires were then compared with the PASI concepts identified to broadly identify trends.</p>

<title>PASI Linked to ICF Codes</title>
<p>Patients generated 610 items with the PASI, from which 690 concepts were identified and matched to 45 ICF categories. PASI concepts fell into the components Activities and Participation (416/690 responses, 60.3%), Body Functions (200/690 responses, 29.0%), Body Structures (43/690 responses, 6.2%), and Environmental Factors (11/690 responses, 1.6%). An additional 20 responses (2.9%) were not definable (nd = 16) or not coded (nc = 4). The most frequent patient responses fell into the categories “walking” (132 responses, 19.1%), “pain” (114 responses, 16.5%), and “recreation and leisure” (106 responses, 15.4%). Within “walking,” 40 responses (5.8%) pertained to “walking long distances” and 20 responses (2.9%) to “walking on different surfaces.” The category “recreation and leisure” included 47 responses (6.8%) related to “sports” (d9201). Nineteen responses (2.8%) were also linked to “recreation and leisure, other specified” to account for “dancing,” for which there was no other appropriate ICF code. Three concepts of concern to patients that were seldom included in the patient-reported outcome questionnaires were “swelling” (34 responses, 4.9%; or 34/142 patients, 23.9%), the category “recreation and leisure” (106 responses, 15.4%), and within “recreation and leisure,” “sports” (47 responses, 6.8%).</p>

<title>Standardized Patient-Reported Outcome Questionnaires Linked to ICF Codes</title>
<p>A total of 237 unique concepts were identified among the questions from the 6 patient-reported outcome questionnaires; these fell into 39 ICF categories. Only 7 categories were common to at least 4 out of 6 of the patient-reported outcome questionnaires: “pain,” “changing basic body position,” “maintaining a body position,” “walking,” “moving around,” “dressing,” and “doing housework.” One hundred and forty-five of the concepts (60.9%) fell into the Activities and Participation component, of which 88 were linked to the category “mobility” and 25 were linked to “domestic life.” Within “mobility,” the categories most frequently included in the instruments were “walking” and “maintaining a body position,” specifically, “maintaining a standing position.”</p>
<p>Of all linked concepts, 44 (18.5%) fell into Body Functions with 24 concepts linked to “sensory functions and pain” and 12 concepts linked to “neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions.” Questions involving pain fell primarily into the category “pain in joints,” which was linked to 19 concepts. The only concept (0.4%) linked to Body Structures was associated with the category “structures related to movement,” specifically at the level of the ankle with a qualifier denoting an unspecified degree of fluid accumulation (ie, swelling).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460365">23</xref></sup> Twenty-six concepts were linked to “products and technology” within the Environmental Factors component, including different types of shoes, orthotic devices, and mobility aids.

<title>Comparing PASI Items to Standardized Patient-Reported Outcome Questionnaires</title>
<p>In comparing the 690 PASI concepts and the 237 patient-reported outcome questionnaire concepts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460365">Figure 1</xref>), SMFA addressed the most number of second-level categories (n = 28) and contained the closest proportion of Body Functions (23.0%) and Activities and Participation (68.9%) concepts to PASI. The patient-reported portion of AOFAS addressed all ICF components but contained only 5 questions and the fewest ICF categories (n = 7). LEFS only contained concepts pertaining to the Activities and Participation component and was the only patient-reported outcome questionnaire that did not include “pain.” LEFS and SMFA touched on “recreation and leisure” activities, and LEFS and AAOS were the only patient-reported outcome questionnaires to include “sports.” AAOS was the only patient-reported outcome questionnaire to address “swelling,” a concern raised by 23.9% of all patients (4.9% of all responses). AOFAS covered the broadest range of walking issues with questions about walking long distances and walking on different surfaces, whereas SMFA and WOMAC only asked about walking in a general sense (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1071100712460365">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Along with assessing the common areas of function that clinicians and researchers find important, patient-reported outcome questionnaires must measure areas that are important to patients to ensure that outcomes are on target. The content of the 6 patient-reported outcome questionnaires examined was congruent with the majority of patient concerns elicited by the PASI, but they also lacked certain issues that were important to patients and were extremely brief in their coverage of others. The ICF proved to be a useful classification system for comparing concepts found in the PASI responses and patient-reported outcome questionnaires. By linking the concepts from the patient-reported outcome questionnaires and PASI to the ICF categories, we saw a clear picture of their differences and similarities emerge.</p>
<p>Three concepts, in particular, were found to be of concern to patients but were rarely mentioned in the patient-reported outcome questionnaires. These included “swelling” (34/142 patients, 23.9%), the category “recreation and leisure” (106 responses, 17.4%), and within “recreation and leisure,” “sports” (47 responses, 7.7%). The AAOS included 2 questions that asked about sporting activities and LEFS included 1, but the FFI, AOFAS, WOMAC, and SMFA did not include any sports-related questions. Ankle arthroplasty has been shown to increase the overall sports activity rate of patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460365">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460365">22</xref></sup> but these patient-reported outcome questionnaires used to assess the surgery do not address this issue. Swelling was mentioned only once in the patient-reported outcome questionnaires (AAOS), and yet 23.9% of patients commented on this symptom. The issue of swelling should be further examined to see whether it is associated with concerns about pain, appearance, comfort, or some factor yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Aside from sports-related concerns, PASI responses that fell into “recreation and leisure” were mostly concerns related to traveling, exercise, and dancing and were not addressed by the patient-reported outcome questionnaires. The SMFA included 2 questions covering the area of “recreation and leisure” and LEFS included 1 such area.</p>
<p>There were concepts in both the patient-reported outcome questionnaires and PASI that could not be assigned ICF codes. Approximately 11.3% of patient-reported outcome questionnaire concepts and 2.9% of PASI responses could not be linked to the ICF framework. Some concepts were simply not covered in the ICF model, such as “appearance,” “comfort,” “different types of footwear” (AAOS), and “standing on tiptoes” (FFI). PASI responses that could not be linked included the concepts of “appearance,” “dress shoes/high heels,” and “inconvenience.” Other concepts were too general or ambiguous to code, such as “activity limitations” (AOFAS) and “How often does too much in one day affect what you do the next day?” (SMFA). The most frequent PASI responses that could not be linked to ICF categories for this same reason were “mobility” and “disability.”</p>
<p>As the not-coded and not-defined items illustrate, assigning ICF codes was not a perfect process. Another interpretive challenge was the fact that the ICF endeavors to divest itself of culture, which can influence the meaning behind patients’ responses. For example, the SMFA asks about difficulty performing one’s usual physical recreational activities, such as bicycling, jogging, or walking. These examples are all considered recreational activities by the patient-reported outcome questionnaire and often by patients, but the ICF does not allow the purpose of the action to be taken into account. Although most of our patients consider cycling a recreational activity, the ICF classifies it as human-powered transportation. Similarly, gardening is classified in the ICF as “taking care of plants, indoors and outdoors,” falling into the “domestic life” category, whereas patients may consider it a hobby, which would fall under “recreation and leisure.” If activities like bicycling, jogging, hiking, and gardening could be classified under “recreation and leisure,” the importance that patients place on recreational activities and the impact that their ankle condition has on this aspect of their daily lives might be even more evident. FFI, WOMAC, and AOFAS did not address recreation and leisure at all. Thus, patients were concerned not only about issues relating to pain and function but also about their ability to participate in active life. This may be because the majority of our subjects were retired (54.0%) and as a result may be more concerned about recreation and leisure activities as opposed to issues like remunerative employment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712460365">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Of the 39 ICF categories found in the patient-reported outcome questionnaires, only 7 are covered in at least 4 of 6 of the outcome measures. This indicates that the different standardized patient-reported outcome questionnaires greatly differ in content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712460365">Tables 3a</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1071100712460365">3c</xref>). Tools such as the AOFAS are limited in their scope. All of the concepts from the AOFAS were found in the PASI issues, but it did not address any issues relating to how their condition affects their daily lives. The AOFAS covered the fewest ICF categories out of all of the tools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712460365">Tables 3a</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1071100712460365">3c</xref>). WOMAC covered a broader range of activities, and FFI fell in between the two. These 3 questionnaires did not address concepts relating to swelling, sports, or recreation and leisure. LEFS and the AAOS both did adequate jobs covering the majority of patient issues, although both missed at least 1 of the most commonly identified PASI concerns (“pain” and “recreation and leisure” activities, respectively) and were extremely brief in their coverage of others. The SMFA had the closest proportion of Body Functions (23.0%) and Activities and Participation (68.9%) concepts to the PASI responses and addressed the most number of categories. However, the SMFA is designed to assess daily functioning for any musculoskeletal disorder and does not focus on the lower extremity. An instrument should only include questions assessing issues that are important to the intended patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460365">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>The tendency for foot and ankle outcome measures is to focus very closely on the typical criteria for assessing foot and ankle function and symptoms, such as pain, walking, standing, and climbing stairs. Yet PASI responses included a broader spectrum of concerns. A combination of general questions as well as focused foot and ankle questions might better appeal to patients because end-stage ankle arthritis affects many aspects of daily living, even beyond issues of basic mobility.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the phrasing of the questions in the PASI may have shaped patients’ answers to a degree. Patients were asked to provide 2 symptoms or feelings associated with their ankle problem and to identify 3 activities that are difficult or impossible to perform because of their ankle problem. Consequently, the item content, symptoms, and activities were predetermined as was the number of items elicited (despite many patients’ decision to ignore the item limit). Although some patients did provide more abstract concepts, others may have been missed, such as redefinition of goals, adaptation to living with the disorder, or avoidance. In addition, patients’ responses showed a cursory confirmation of the ICF osteoarthritis core set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460365">8</xref></sup>; however, further study of its use for patients with end-stage ankle arthritis is necessary for validation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study provides clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive overview of patients’ concerns related to end-stage ankle arthritis as well as the content of the patient-reported outcome questionnaires frequently used in lower limb functional assessment. Identifying the meaningful concepts from these 2 sources and linking them to the most appropriate ICF category or categories made it possible to assess whether commonly used patient-reported outcome questionnaires accurately reflect patients’ day-to-day experiences and limitations. The patient-reported outcome questionnaires differed largely in their content, and no single questionnaire captured all of the concerns identified by patients in the PASI. Therefore, when choosing a patient-reported outcome questionnaire, clinicians and researchers should carefully consider the content and focus of the available measures in comparison to their research or clinical question. It is important for physicians to be aware of patients’ concerns and expectations surrounding surgical outcomes in order to improve doctor–patient communication and avoid misconceptions or disappointment. This analysis will guide us in the development of a more comprehensive instrument for evaluating functional outcomes in patients undergoing surgical management of end-stage ankle arthritis.</p>
