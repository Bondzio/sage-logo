<p>Economic sociology emerged in the United States in the 1980s as a distinct sub-field. With a pair of pathbreaking articles in <italic>American Journal of Sociology</italic> – Harrison White’s 1981 piece on ‘Where do markets come from?’ and his student Mark Granovetter’s influential 1985 manifesto on ‘Economic action and social structure’ – the new sociology of economic life superseded at once Parsonian and Marxist frameworks. Drawing on the pioneering insights of Karl Polanyi, as well as intellectual inspirations as disparate as functionalist economic anthropology and the Annales School of history, White, Granovetter, and their colleagues sought to dethrone the dominance of neoclassical economics in the study of economic action and institution. No phenomenon or institution was more central to the new intellectual endeavor than the study of ‘markets’, which is the topic of Patrik Aspers’ book.</p>
<p>Aspers has two central aims in <italic>Markets</italic>: ‘to review the existing literature’ and ‘to offer a sociological approach to markets’ (p. x). Postgraduate students seeking the lay of the land called economic sociology will readily find charismatic figures and mega-cited articles (and books) in the author’s competent conspectus. He also provides a short history of markets as well as of market ideology. There is nothing particularly exceptionable about Aspers’ account of the literature, however. Readers seeking a more comprehensive intellectual genealogy of economic sociology or a thicker and more robust account of the making of markets or market ideologies will be disappointed. The author’s stress is clearly analytical and his ‘sociological approach’ informs his review of the literature and of the histories. This strategy probably accounts for the curious neglect of the state’s role in the making of markets, a point amply stressed by Adam Smith in Book 3 of <italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic> (1776), Karl Marx in Part 8 of <italic>Capital</italic>, Vol. 1 (1867), and of course Karl Polanyi in his classic study <italic>The Great Transformation</italic> (1944).</p>
<p>The central value of <italic>Markets</italic> is Aspers’ concise but comprehensive conceptual discussion of ‘markets’, the second of his two main aims. In what should be especially helpful to interested but ignorant students, he enunciates a series of clear definitions and distinctions. ‘All exchange in markets is trade, but not all trade takes place in markets’ (p. 7). Market is not trade <italic>tout court</italic> because it presupposes ‘interchangeability of the roles of buyers and sellers’ and ‘competition’ (p. 7). He proposes three prerequisites of markets: (1) it must be ‘clear what is traded in the market’; (2) there are ‘rules … in the market’; and (3) market exchange ‘must obtain an economic value’ (p. 9). In addition, there are other functional prerequisites for markets, such as ‘trust, shared cognitive frameworks and rules’ (p. 80). Markets in turn constitute one of the three fundamental forms of social coordination: the other two being hierarchy (organization) and networks. These three modes of coordination are interrelated, as are markets themselves. In contradistinction to the singular market of neoclassical economic theory, the new economic sociology regards ‘markets’ as empirically diverse and overlapping. Just as the ostensibly economic institution is in fact deeply sociological or structural, so too is economic action fundamentally social or sociological. Economic action, far from being utility-maximizing behavior, is ‘constrained and conditioned by social relations’ (p. 175). Sociological analysis of economic action goes hand in hand with structural analysis of economic institution. Elaborating on White’s theory of markets, Aspers highlights the centrality of status in production markets: ‘a social construction which is unintended and self-reproducing; producers reproduce the niches they have created’ (p. 137). Moving from micro to macro, then, the new economic sociology – at least the version that Aspers advocates and delineates – seeks to supplant economic theory.</p>
<p>In the concluding section, Aspers advances seven claims that are at once points of divergence from mainstream economic theory and agendas for future research. These few pages distill what is good and bad about his book. Good because the author has read widely, thought seriously and systematically, and has written something of a state-of-the-art book on the new economic sociology. Bad because he hasn’t read or thought widely enough, and in so doing manifests a symptomatic shortcoming of the sociological sub-field.</p>
<p>Consider one of Aspers’ seven points. He underscores the limitations of ‘economic man’ and argues for the necessity of replacing it with ‘the social human being’: ‘This book has pointed at the notion of identity as one way to establish a truly social foundation of economic action’ (p. 175). US-based academic economists have made precisely this sort of argument, such as George Akerlof (<italic>Identity Economics</italic>, co-authored with Rachel Kranton, 2010). Akerlof is no crank, being a Nobel-Prize recipient, but the more general point is that in the past two decades one of the most powerful intellectual movements in US economics has been the behavioral or psychological turn, inspired above all by the work of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. By ignoring the recent advances in economics, both theoretical and empirical, economic sociology risks irrelevance.</p>
<p>The same sort of reservation can be made about Aspers’ next point: ‘The labor market is not a special form of market. … The existing research … has largely accepted the neoclassical market model’ (p. 175). This would strike labor economists, whether working in US universities or elsewhere, as bizarre. After all, one of the mantras of post-Second World War US economic orthodoxy was that the labor market is precisely ‘a special form of market’ for which the standard neoclassical model did not seem to work very well. Not surprisingly, historical and institutional approaches remained germane, and sociologists ignore their achievements, such as the work of Albert Hirschman, Claudia Goldin, and Richard Freeman, at their peril.</p>
<p>Indeed, even as economic sociologists seek to challenge the hegemony of economists in the study of the economy, what impresses me more is how much economists have made major strides in areas that were monopolized by sociologists until very recently. Few would have questioned the sociological primacy in the study of inequality, crime, or the city two or three decades ago, but economists – extremely proficient in statistical and econometric techniques and comfortable with very large data sets – have been making important, and increasingly influential, contributions (consider for inequality the contributions of among others Amartya Sen, Timothy Smeeding, and Emmanuel Saez).</p>
<p>Lest sociologist readers worry that I am raising the white flag to economists, my intention is far from proclaiming intellectual capitulation. If anything, as much as Aspers’ criticisms of economic thinking are valid, what tends to get short shrift in both mainstream economics and economic sociology are systematic concerns with history and institutions (the study of which Polanyi, as well as Weber and Marx, excelled) as well as power and ideology (think again of Polanyi, Weber, and Marx). The institutional and epistemological dominance of economic thinking is nowhere more salient than in the world of high finance where the mere whisper of power – and its correlate, historical, institutional, and discursive analysis – is eschewed. Here mainstream economics is close to intellectual bankruptcy. As an economist acquaintance quipped, before the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and the consequent economic recession, he and his colleagues were busy assuring everyone of the stability and efficiency of financial capitalism. After the collapse and the looming depression, he and his colleagues are busier than ever explaining their causes and consequences (as well as remedies). The few accounts that cut through the fancy verbiage and the conceptual fog of financial-economic theory were done by the anthropologist-turned-journalist Gillian Tett’s <italic>Fool’s Gold</italic> (2009) and the documentary-filmmaker Charles Ferguson’s <italic>Inside Job</italic> (2010), in which either ethnographic observation or undergraduate Marxism seemed to do a much better job of understanding and explaining the financial crisis. Should it be surprising that an intellectual approach that ignored the state and power is unable to make sense of contemporary high finance that is a curious and complex amalgam of power and knowledge, state policy, and high tech?</p>
<p>Patrik Alpers has written a concise and coherent book on an important intellectual movement and a central economic and social institution. I am just not sure if the former adequately apprehends the latter. As much as I appreciate the achievements of new economic sociology, I wonder to what extent it has supplanted either mainstream economics – as tottering as its intellectual edifice remains – or the classical social-theoretical stress on historical and institutional analysis as well as on power and ideology.</p>
