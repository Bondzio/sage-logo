<speaker>MR. ERIC JENKINS (Dexter, Michigan):</speaker>
<p>We have also been using zero-balanced ultrafiltration (Z-BUF) for our circulatory arrest cases, but we are not using this PrismaSate<sup>®</sup> solution (Gambro). How are you replacing that solution?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. DANIEL FITZGERALD (Boston, Massachusetts):</speaker>
<p>We place a target level on our reservoir, we begin the ultrafiltration and, then, we just maintain the level in the reservoir by adding solution into the circuit. We do not drip it into the reservoir. We just replace the volume as needed.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. JENKINS:</speaker>
<p>For a circulatory arrest case, you would not give 50mEq of sodium bicarbonate, you would just start ultrafiltrating?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CO-MODERATOR VINCENT OLSHOVE (Columbus, Ohio):</speaker>
<p>You can take Normosol-R<sup>®</sup> (Hospira), just add 20 mEq of sodium bicarbonate and 200 mg of calcium chloride, and, basically, you have PrismaSate<sup>®</sup>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. JENKINS:</speaker>
<p>That is what we do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. KEITH SAMOLYK (Windsor, Connecticut):</speaker>
<p>The PrismaSate<sup>®</sup>? Is that the same as the PrismaSol<sup>®</sup> solution they use for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. FITZGERALD:</speaker>
<p>It is a similar solution. These are renal replacement fluids that are often used in continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in the Intensive Care Unit. That is a different manufacturer. I do not think that you can get the PrismaSol<sup>®</sup> solution dextrose free. So, that is why we prefer the PrismaSate<sup>®</sup> solution.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. JEFFREY RILEY (Rochester, Minnesota):</speaker>
<p>How many liters of ultrafiltrating did you do on this patient?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. FITZGERALD:</speaker>
<p>It typically requires about ten liters. Basically, two bags of the PrismaSate<sup>®</sup> solution, which is a total of ten liters of that solution. Sometimes, we use three bags. It depends upon the patient’s size.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. RILEY:</speaker>
<p>Is the PrismaSate<sup>®</sup> solution qualified for intravenous use?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. FITZGERALD:</speaker>
<p>It is used extracorporeally during CVVH. I do not know, specifically, if it is an intravenous solution.</p>
