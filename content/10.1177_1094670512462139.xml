<p>Businesses rely on knowledge interfaces to gather and integrate knowledge that drives innovation and builds competitive advantage. But key knowledge interfaces such as cross-functional teams (CFTs), frontline employees (FLEs), and learning orientation have not shown consistent effects on innovation outcomes in prior research. This study addresses that problem by testing a mediation model that extends the service-dominant logic service innovation framework developed by Ordanini and Parasuraman. Based on analyses of 160 new service development (NSD) projects, the authors find that CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation consistently influence NSD sales and process efficiency outcomes when they first create a service having (1) superior attributes and expert frontline employee service delivery (service marketability) and/or (2) a well-targeted launch with formal promotion to internal and external markets (launch effectiveness). Those NSD project characteristics in turn yield favorable new service performance results. Specifically, service marketability and launch effectiveness mediate the influence of CFTs on NSD outcomes. Launch effectiveness mediates the influence of learning orientation, and service marketability mediates the impact of FLEs. In ranking the organizational resources, the study finds that CFTs and learning orientation have greater effect on NSD sales performance than do FLEs. The results highlight the importance of aligning CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation with NSD project characteristics in order to maximize sales performance and process efficiency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is becoming increasingly critical for firms to leverage internal resources to gather and integrate knowledge necessary to drive innovation performance and financial outcomes. When used effectively, cross-functional teams (CFTs), frontline employees (FLEs), and a strong learning orientation are key internal organizational resources facilitating the design, development, and introduction of new services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman 2011</xref>). CFTs have the potential to improve functional coordination in new service development (NSD) and reduce development time and costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670512462139">Huth 2008</xref>). FLE involvement in NSD and implementation may help maintain a balance between the firm’s productivity and efficiency goals and the objective of meeting customer needs in the new service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512462139">Schneider and Bowen 1984</xref>). Likewise, strong individual and team-level learning orientations lead to generative learning, which enables firms to accomplish not only incremental product improvements but also paradigm shifting breakthroughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670512462139">Baker and Sinkula 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the effects of CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation are mixed. Although several studies have found a positive relationship with new product or service performance for CFTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670512462139">Cooper 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670512462139">Froehle et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670512462139">Larson and Gobeli 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094670512462139">Roberts 1995</xref>), other studies have found a nonsignificant relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512462139">Henard and Szymanski 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512462139">Sethi, Smith, and Park 2001</xref>) or a negative association of cross-functionality and team outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670512462139">Ancona and Caldwell 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512462139">Keller 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512462139">Lovelace, Shapiro, and Weingart 2001</xref>). Studies have found that FLE involvement improves NSD outcomes when they contribute ideas for new services reflecting consumer latent needs and for design of the appropriate level of customization, user-friendliness, and customization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512462139">De Brentani 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512462139">Martin and Horne 1995</xref>). But other empirical research has found that FLE involvement in the NSD process does not distinguish between successful and unsuccessful NSD projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094670512462139">Ottenbacher, Gnoth, and Jones 2006</xref>). Learning orientation has been found to have a significant, positive influence on the financial, competitiveness, and quality performance of new services, and cuts cost and speed and improves effectiveness of the NSD process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512462139">Tajeddini 2009</xref>). However, in other studies, learning orientation has been found to only indirectly influence new product or firm success; the extent of innovativeness mediates those relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670512462139">Baker and Sinkula 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094670512462139">Keskin 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>These inconsistent findings suggest the need for further analysis of mediating processes that influence the impact of those internal organizational resources in the NSD process. The current study addresses this need by specifically focusing on the development of new services and providing strong empirical support for a model in which service marketability and launch effectiveness directly impact NSD sales performance and process efficiency outcomes. Service marketability is the degree to which the new service offers a superior package of core performance attributes, product familiarity, product quality, and expert FLE service delivery. Launch effectiveness involves a well-targeted launch with formal promotion to the target market and employees. Prior empirical research has shown that the service and project characteristics represented by service marketability and launch effectiveness are among the most important NSD success factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512462139">Atuahene-Gima 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512462139">de Brentani 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512462139">Johne and Storey 1998</xref>). We reason that CFT involvement, FLE involvement, and learning orientation influence NSD performance outcomes indirectly, and their influence is mediated by the two key NSD success factors, service marketability and launch effectiveness.</p>
<p>Service-dominant logic (SD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512462139">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512462139">2008</xref>) offers a theoretical perspective on how these internal organizational resources are connected to innovation outcomes. CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation are important internal organizational resources that the firm uses to gather, assess, and utilize information needed to create successful new services. In the terminology of SD logic, they are operant resources (capable of acting on other resources) and primary sources of competitive advantage. Since the focal constructs are important for creating the knowledge and skills the firm exchanges with consumers, they are knowledge interfaces and key drivers for NSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman 2011</xref>). The SD-logic inspired service innovation framework developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref> identifies antecedents and consequences of service innovation outcomes. This study adopts that framework by concentrating on the influence of specific knowledge interfaces (i.e., CFTs, FLEs, and learning innovation) on NSD process and service characteristics, which mediate the influence of the knowledge interface elements on sales and process outcomes.</p>
<p>We demonstrate empirically in an integrated model that merely having CFT and FLE involvement and individual participant-level learning orientation as aspects of the NSD process is not sufficient. These variables must have a positive effect on service marketability and launch effectiveness in order to significantly influence performance outcomes such as sales performance and project cost efficiency. The study contributes to the service innovation literature by demonstrating the mediating mechanism by which three key operant resources taken together can consistently influence performance outcomes.</p>

<title>SD Logic Framework for Studying Service Innovation</title>
<p>In their SD-logic service innovation conceptual framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref> propose that collaborative competencies, dynamic capability of customer orientation and knowledge interfaces are key drivers for NSD. Their empirical research found strong, significant effects of knowledge interfaces (FLE participation and knowledge integration mechanisms) on volume and/or radicalness of organizations’ service innovation programs. The current study extends that work by examining a broader set of knowledge interfaces/integrators and their role as innovation antecedents at the project level.</p>
<p>In SD-logic, service is “the application of specialized competencies (knowledge and skills) through deeds, processes and performances for the benefit of another entity or the entity itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512462139">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>, p. 2). Service is exchanged for service, and is provided directly to another market participant, or through tangible goods (i.e., appliances or means of distribution for service provision). Value is not added to products sold by the producer, but instead is determined by the consumer as value-in-use (FP7 “The firm cannot deliver value, but only offer value propositions,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512462139">Vargo and Lusch 2008</xref>). Therefore, a firm achieves competitive advantage as a function of how well it uses its operant resources to respond to needs of the market relative to how other firms use their operant resources. To acquire the knowledge necessary to continually innovate and achieve competitive advantage, the firm should have collaborative competence. Due to specialization within the firm, acquisition and application of knowledge (and effective use of other operant resources) are aided by the firm’s ability to collaborate across specialized areas. Collaboration can result in resource integration and new high potential service offers. Collaborative competence (e.g., collaboration across functional areas or collaboration with FLEs) assists in building absorptive competence, which is the firm’s ability to understand external environment trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512462139">Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A firm uses FLEs as operant resources to gather knowledge about customers and competitors, build adaptive and absorptive competence, and develop capabilities that yield superior firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670512462139">Melancon et al. 2010</xref>). Learning orientation, as the ability to engage in higher order learning, is an operant resource that affects how a firm interprets and uses acquired knowledge to create novel and superior value propositions to address customer needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512462139">Baker and Sinkula 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study employs the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref> SD-logic inspired service innovation framework to interpret the role of CFTs, FLEs, and the organization’s learning orientation in enabling successful service innovation. As resource integrators, they are key to enabling the firm to gather, assimilate, interpret, disseminate, and act on relevant knowledge from outside and within the firm to develop and deliver new services that build competitive advantage for the firm in the marketplace.</p>

<sec id="section4-1094670512462139">
<title>CFTs</title>
<p>The use of CFTs in the NSD process positively influences the effectiveness of the process and increases the number of service innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670512462139">Froehle et al. 2000</xref>). The multidisciplinary, cross-functional approach to NSD is an important means for using diversity as an intellectual resource to facilitate sharing ideas and knowledge across functional boundaries within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512462139">Brown and Eisenhardt 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670512462139">Froehle and Roth 2007</xref>). CFTs also play a coordinating role in providing a forum for communication and interaction during the development stages for the various functional stakeholders who will play primary roles in the deployment and operation of the new service.</p>
<p>The innovativeness of a new product is significantly affected by the extent of “encouragement given to a cross-functional product development team to take risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512462139">Sethi, Smith, and Park 2001</xref>, p. 78). Sethi, Smith, and Park (2001) reason that developers who propose ideas substantially different from the status quo face some professional risk; therefore, the organization has to let developers know that trying a new unproven approach is acceptable, and may lead to a more creative and financially successful solution. Questioning of assumptions and norms and promoting team psychological safety (i.e., shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking and will not ostracize a member for speaking up) will more likely yield creative product concepts and successful innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670512462139">Edmondson 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the previously mentioned positive results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512462139">Keller (2001)</xref> found the CFT functional diversity had no direct effect on technical quality and a strong negative effect on project budget performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512462139">Lovelace, Shapiro, and Weingart (2001)</xref> found that greater team functional diversity leads to more task disagreement, which can diminish innovativeness and efficiency unless the disagreements are communicated collaboratively. More work is needed to understand how the dynamics of CFTs can yield positive sales and efficiency outcomes for NSD projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1094670512462139">
<title>FLEs</title>
<p>Few studies have empirically examined the role of FLEs in NSD, and some recent empirical work has contradicted conceptual roles assigned to FLEs by earlier researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref> found a moderately strong positive impact of FLE involvement on service innovation volume and radicalness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512462139">Melton and Hartline (2010)</xref> found that FLE involvement in the launch stage (i.e., roll out of the service to the entire target market) positively affects service marketability (e.g., perception of superior value and FLE expertise). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512462139">Schneider and Bowen (1984)</xref> argue that FLEs are a valuable source of new service ideas and are even more useful in determining ways to implement a new service to get a favorable customer response. Schneider and Bowen contend that FLE involvement in NSD improves the technical quality of the new service, improves the climate and employee morale in the service establishment, and positively affects customer loyalty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512462139">Melton and Hartline (2010)</xref> tested a model of FLE involvement in various stages of the NSD process and did not find a significant impact on new service performance outcomes when FLEs were involved in the planning and development activities identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512462139">Schneider and Bowen (1984)</xref>. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512462139">Ottenbacher, Gnoth, and Jones (2006)</xref> found that involving FLEs in idea generation, planning, or design of the service was not a significant predictive factor when distinguishing successful from unsuccessful projects in a sample drawn from the German hotel industry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1094670512462139">
<title>Learning Orientation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512462139">Calantone, Cavusgil, and Zhao (2002)</xref> define learning orientation as “organization-wide activity of creating and using knowledge to enhance competitive advantage . . . [and involves] obtaining and sharing information about customer needs, market changes, and competitor actions, as well as development of new technologies to create new products that are superior to those of competitors” (p. 516). Whereas marketing orientation promotes acquisition of market-related information, dissemination throughout the firm, and firm-wide response to identified market needs, learning orientation “influences what kind of information is gathered, and how it is interpreted, evaluated, and shared” (p. 516). In their study, learning orientation had a strong positive effect on firm innovativeness, and they reason that learning orientation improves innovativeness because the organization is committed to continually acquire information on customers, competitors, and other aspects of the marketing environment. This open-mindedness leads to questioning established norms and an increase in psychological safety, which creates more opportunity for creative, “out of the box” thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512462139">Edmondson and Nembhard 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512462139">Sethi, Smith, and Park 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study proposes a mediated influence of learning orientation on NSD performance. The model is consistent with the significant work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512462139">Baker and Sinkula (2007)</xref> who demonstrate that learning style (generative or adaptive learning) first affects innovation priority (emphasis on radical or incremental innovation), which then influences new product success. The current study develops a more comprehensive model to explain the effects of learning orientation and other knowledge interfaces on the development and performance of new services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1094670512462139">
<title>NSD Process, Mediators, and Outcomes</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670512462139">Johnson et al. (2000)</xref> model describes the basic steps found in most process models in the NSD literature. The four general stages of the process are design, analysis, development, and full launch. Design involves generating and screening new service ideas that are consistent with the organization’s new service strategy and objectives. In the analysis stage, managers assess the project’s potential return on investment and likelihood of meeting stated objectives, and obtain the organization’s approval to proceed. In the development stage, the business develops and tests the core service, delivery system, and marketing program, trains operational and frontline personnel, and gets user and FLE feedback to improve the offering. The full-scale launch stage introduces the new service to the entire target market, and the postlaunch review evaluates performance and modifies the initiative, as needed. We expect CFTs to be active throughout all stages, and learning orientation to influence gathering, interpretation, and diffusion of information throughout the NSD process. The extant literature primarily limits FLE involvement to idea generating, development, and implementation, therefore we expect FLEs to participate in all but the analysis stage.</p>
<p>Two key outcomes of NSD initiatives are sales performance and process efficiency. We define sales performance as exceeding sales, market share, or profit margin objectives, and define project efficiency as lower than expected development costs, less than planned concept to launch time, and operation of the innovation below expected costs. Sales performance is closely tied to market attractiveness (i.e., service responds to clearly identified customer needs), effective NSD management (i.e., use of specialized functional resources and marketing of the service to the frontline), a formal and detailed development process, and expert people-based service delivery. Efficiency is significantly associated with effective implementation, service newness to the firm, and a formal and detailed development process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512462139">de Brentani 1991</xref>). We propose that the influence of CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation on NSD outcomes is mediated by key characteristics that are important to the sales performance and efficiency of development projects. Two primary product and project characteristics shown in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512462139">de Brentani 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512462139">Henard and Szymanski 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512462139">Johne and Storey 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512462139">Melton and Hartline 2010</xref>) to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful new service/product development projects are:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Service marketability—the new service offers (a) a superior package of core performance attributes and supporting services, (b) product familiarity to customers or ease in learning how to use it, (c) product quality, effective brand communications, FLE expertise, and extensive distribution systems.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Launch effectiveness—the new service offer has (a) a formal, full-scale, well-coordinated, well-targeted launch followed by a postlaunch evaluation to identify what went well or wrong in order to appropriately modify the offer or delivery, and (b) formal promotion of the offer to the target market and internal markets.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Prior research has identified NSD success factors related to sales and costs and provided support for how cross-functional teamwork, FLEs and learning orientation separately make beneficial contributions in the NSD process. What remains is to demonstrate empirically in an integrated model that these key internal organizational resources do not have a significant, direct effect on sales performance and project cost efficiency outcomes, but instead have an indirect effect. Rather, their influence is mediated by service marketability and launch effectiveness.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Consistent with the SD-logic inspired service innovation framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref>, the current study models three key operant resources as knowledge interface antecedents of innovation outcomes. Knowledge interfaces enable transfer of knowledge within organizations and are essential for knowledge gathering, absorption, integration, and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094670512462139">Madhavan and Grover 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670512462139">Sherwood and Covin 2008</xref>). As operant resources, CFTs, FLE participation, and learning orientation are used by the organization to refine and integrate its collection of competences and acquire and apply knowledge that builds competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512462139">Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien 2007</xref>).

<p>The more that a NSD project uses the diverse, yet integrated resources of a CFT across all stages of the process, the more the project benefits from team outcomes such as (1) control of complexity, (2) efficiency, and (3) creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670512462139">Huth 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670512462139">Wurst 2001</xref>). The interactions of specialists from relevant functional areas, working together as a cohesive, goal-oriented team throughout the project phases should result in a product that meets both target market and organizational needs. As a knowledge interface, a diverse and effective team scans and assesses information from the external environment, yet knows enough about the organization’s resources, capabilities, and limitations to be realistic about how innovative they can be in responding to or anticipating the demands of the marketplace. By exercising collaborative competence, a cross-functional group can work together to design and implement a new service with the attributes, level of quality, image, and methods of delivery that appeal to the marketplace. CFTs improve launch results due to the varied individual history and competencies of team members that extend the potential experience of the group and make it better able to respond to the diverse challenges of development and launch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670512462139">Stevens and Dimitriadis 2005</xref>). Launch effectiveness is therefore positively influenced by the extent that a coordinating cross-functional team is driving the process. </p>
<p>Therefore:</p>

<title>Knowledge Interfaces: FLEs</title>
<p>FLEs can certainly influence how consumers judge the quality of a new service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094670512462139">Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry 1990</xref>). The knowledge and competence of FLEs build the consumer’s trust and confidence in the brand and new service. Clearly, FLE involvement in the full launch phase of the NSD process, and especially effective delivery of the offer in the full launch phase, contributes to consumer perceptions of the service as possessing superior value, ease of use, and expert staff delivery (i.e., enhances service marketability). Often, the promotion of the new service to the target market involves communication of features and benefits by FLEs to the prospect (e.g., life insurance, mutual funds sales), therefore competently trained and properly motivated FLEs play a critical role in effectively launching a new service and delivering successful sales results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670512462139">de Jong and Vermeulen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512462139">Johne and Storey 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512462139">Schneider and Bowen 1984</xref>). Although FLEs may contribute valuable ideas for new services and process improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094670512462139">Umashankar, Srinivasan, and Hindman 2011</xref>), their greatest contribution may be as operant resources that convey the knowledge, skills, competences, and value propositions of the organization to the target market in the SD-logic envisioned exchange of service for service.

<title>Knowledge Interfaces: Learning Orientation</title>
<p>In NSD projects, a high level of learning orientation means that individuals and groups affiliated with the project are highly motivated to gather, interpret, evaluate, and share information about customer needs, competitors, and other aspects of a dynamic external environment, as well as relevant information about internal organizational conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670512462139">Calantone, Cavusgil, and Zhao 2002</xref>). The radical innovativeness resulting from higher levels of learning orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670512462139">Baker and Sinkula 2007</xref>) stimulates insights in planning that help the organization to target the most appropriate markets, carefully coordinate distribution, and creatively design and implement promotions that attract buyers to the new value proposition. Learning orientation can influence decision making in a way that produces an innovative service of superior perceived value and a launch process characterized as creative, thorough, and effective. Therefore:</p>

<title>Mediation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512462139">De Brentani (1991)</xref> found that several service offer and development characteristics explained a substantial amount of the variance in sales performance among NSD initiatives. Among the key characteristics were: (1) services respond to clearly defined customer needs, (2) a well thought out offer, that is well tested and promoted to employees and customers, and (3) use of expert personnel to deliver and promote the new service. These characteristics closely correspond to the success factors of this study. Also, a new service rated highly on some characteristics of service marketability (e.g., somewhat familiar and easy to learn and use) should require less promotional or customer service support, and result in lower product and development cost and shorter development time. Service innovations utilizing the latest technology or effectively responding to rapidly changing market trends are more likely to have been first to market or developed in a shorter time period relative to competitor offerings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094670512462139">Kessler and Chakrabarti (1996)</xref> in their review of the innovation speed literature found substantial evidence of a positive relationship between product quality (the extent to which the product satisfies customer requirements) and innovation speed. Therefore:</p>

<p>In a sample of industrial and service firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670512462139">Ledwith and O’Dwyer (2008)</xref> found support for a strong, positive association of product launch proficiency to new product performance and organizational performance. Proficiency in launch tactics was significantly correlated with overall new product performance, as well as market level and financial measures of performance. We would expect similar relationships in a context consisting entirely of service innovation initiatives. Extensive launch activities involved in effectively promoting the new service to the firm’s employees and target market will likely not increase speed-to-launch or lower project development costs, so we do not hypothesize a significant relationship between launch effectiveness and process efficiency. Therefore:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Launch effectiveness is positively associated with <italic>sales performance</italic>.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The positive effect of learning orientation and cross-functional and FLE involvement on NSD outcomes is supported in the literature, but the mediation of their influence, which could more fully explain how they affect NSD outcomes, has not been extensively researched. Some prior empirical research suggests that the influence of knowledge interfaces on sales and process outcomes of innovation is indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670512462139">Baker and Sinkula 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094670512462139">De Luca and Atuahene-Gima 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512462139">Melton and Hartline 2010</xref>). Knowledge interface antecedents must first have a significant effect on key service innovation product and process characteristics, which then in turn positively affect sales and efficiency outcomes. We have presented arguments supporting relationships between the antecedents, mediator, and performance outcome constructs. The final hypothesis formally proposes that the effect of the knowledge interfaces on performance outcomes is mediated by the service product and process characteristics of service marketability and launch effectiveness.</p>

<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected from a diverse sample of firms in the financial, health care, education, technology, legal, transportation, government, agricultural, public records research, and entertainment service sectors. Targeted sectors were chosen because of their relatively high levels of innovation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670512462139">Djellal and Gallouj 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670512462139">Droege, Hildebrand, and Forcada 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670512462139">Horn 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512462139">Rivero 2012</xref>). With information derived primarily from business websites, a list was compiled of key contacts likely to have responsibility for and extensive knowledge of service innovation activities in their organization. The organization president, marketing vice president, planning officer, college dean, or medical practice executive received a survey with cover letter asking them to choose a new service developed and introduced by their organization within the prior 3 years. All recipients were offered an executive summary of study findings as an incentive for completing the survey. Surveys were sent to service providers in all major regions of the United States.</p>
<p>Personalized e-mails with links to an online survey or printed cover letters and surveys were distributed to 3,773 service executives; 244 were completed and returned. The sample of usable surveys was reduced to 160 due to incompleteness of some of the surveys received (4.2% response rate). The challenge of identifying executives responsible for service product development, the extent of the full survey, and a continuing trend of declining response rates to all types of surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670512462139">Cook, Heath, and Thompson 2000</xref>) affected efforts to generate a sizable sample. Nevertheless, the authors felt that the sample was diverse and large enough to allow a reliable and valid test of the hypothesized model. A test for nonresponse bias indicated no significant difference in responses to key measures between groups of early and late respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512462139">Armstrong and Overton 1977</xref>). Therefore, the low response rate should not threaten the validity of the study findings.</p>
<p>The largest representation in the sample came from the education (50%), health care (30%), and financial services (13%) sectors. Typical positions held by survey respondents included dean, vice president, director, administrator, president, CEO, or owner. Surveys were received from all regions of the United States, with most responses coming from Florida (17%), Illinois (13%), and New York (13%). The sample included both large and small enterprises, with over two thirds of respondents reporting annual revenue of $10 million or more.</p>

<p>Before testing the psychometric properties of the six measures used in the study, the data were assessed for the extent of missing values. Of the 43 items in the survey, values were missing for 102 of the 6,880 possible responses (1.48%), and a review of the data determined that values were missing completely at random. Therefore, the mean substitution method was used to replace missing values. Using analysis of moment structures (AMOS), all measures were tested simultaneously on a confirmatory factor model with each item allowed to load on only one factor and the pattern coefficient of 1 item per factor fixed at 1.0. The items were evaluated based on the significance of the indicator’s estimated pattern coefficient on its construct factor, whether the standardized regression weight exceeded |.5| (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512462139">Anderson and Gerbing 1988</xref>), and whether the standardized residual covariances exceeded |2.5|. The initial CFA model demonstrated poor fit, with nine standardized regression weights below |.5|, although all item loadings were significant. Therefore, those and other items with low standardized regression weights were dropped, and the reestimated model demonstrated acceptable fit, with significant loadings on all items and all standardized regression weights above |.5|. Only five standardized residual covariances exceeded |2.5|, and the largest value was below |3.37|. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670512462139">Table 1</xref> for items retained, their factor loadings, and items deleted.</p>
<p>Construct reliability and discriminant validity were assessed based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512462139">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</xref>. Construct reliability for all scales exceeded .76 (above the minimum threshold recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512462139">Nunnally 1978</xref>). The average variance extracted (AVE) for all scales exceeded .50. The AVE for each scale exceeded the shared variance for the construct with every other construct, thereby demonstrating discriminant validity. The overall fit of the CFA model was acceptable (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.581), and other fit indices were within the recommended ranges (Tucker–Lewis Index [TLI] = .918, Comparative Fit Index [CFI] = .932, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .06). Construct reliabilities, correlations, AVE, shared variance, and model fit statistics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1094670512462139">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Because survey responses were gathered from a single key respondent within the service provider, the measures were assessed for potential common methods bias. A review of the research design determined that the potential for common methods bias was reduced due to use of lengthy scales with varying numbers of scale points, and scale items that are concrete, clear, and unambiguous (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1094670512462139">Podsakoff et al. 2003</xref>). Post hoc tests found no evidence of a single factor to account for all or most of the covariance among the variables. Using the marker-variable technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512462139">Lindell and Whitney 2001</xref>) to remove the potential effect of a common method factor, we found that the differences between the original and corrected correlations were all very small (▵<italic>r </italic>&lt; .049; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670512462139">Malhotra, Kim, and Patil 2006</xref>). This result provides evidence that common methods bias does not significantly influence the parameter estimates of this study.</p>

<title>Structural Model Results</title>
<p>The hypothesized structural model examines the direct influence of exogenous knowledge interface variables (CFT team and FLE involvement in the NSD process and learning orientation) on service marketability and launch effectiveness, and indirect, mediated influence on sales performance and process efficiency. Given that the measurement model exhibited sufficient levels of validity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670512462139">Fornell and Larcker 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670512462139">Hu and Bentler 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512462139">Nunnally 1978</xref>), the study assessed the hypothesized structural model. Since multicollinearity can pose problems when SEM is used to test theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512462139">Jagpal 1982</xref>), the variables were assessed using the variance inflation factor (VIF) measure. The mean VIF for the five independent and mediator variables was 1.26, which suggests that multicollinearity is not a problem. All VIF values were below the threshold of 10 recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670512462139">Hair et al. (2006)</xref>, and below 4.0 where standard error doubles due to multicollinearity.</p>
<p>The analysis continued with an assessment of the structural model using multi-item measures for each construct. Although the sample size slightly exceeded the minimum recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512462139">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</xref>, and the hypothesized model was relatively complex, the authors chose to use multi-item measures instead of summated, single-item measures. This is a more rigorous test of the model and the sample size is large enough to produce parameter estimates with standard errors low enough for practical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512462139">Anderson and Gerbing 1988</xref>). </p>
<p>Paths were freed in the structural model in accordance with the nine nonmediation hypotheses. The hypothesized model was assessed by examining the <italic>t</italic> values of the paths and their standardized regression weights. Eight paths were significant at <italic>p </italic>≤ .05, each having small to moderately strong standardized regression weights (.177 to .487). The fit statistics indicated an adequate fit of the model to the data, with χ<sup>2</sup> = 341.98, <italic>df</italic> = 218, <italic>p </italic>≤ .001, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.57, TLI = .92, CFI = .931, and RMSEA = .060.</p>
<p>A new model, where the one insignificant path was dropped, demonstrated good fit (χ<sup>2</sup> = 342.52, <italic>df</italic> = 219, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.56, TLI = .92, CFI = .931, and RMSEA = .060). All eight paths in the reestimated model were significant (<italic>p </italic>≤ .05) and had modest to moderately strong standardized regression weights (.177 to .506). The fit of the model was not significantly different from the fit of the initial model (▵χ<sup>2</sup> = .54, ▵<italic>df</italic> = 1); therefore, the alternate model was accepted as the final model due to higher parsimony. The final path model is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512462139">Figure 1</xref>, while the final structural model results are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670512462139">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Mediation Analysis</title>
<p>The study also examined the extent to which service marketability and launch effectiveness mediate the relationship between the exogenous variables and the project performance variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512462139">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> require a significant direct effect of the independent on the dependent variable and an insignificant or diminished effect when the mediator is added to the model. They also recommend the Sobel <italic>z</italic>-test of the significance of the indirect path from the independent variable through mediator to the dependent variable. Recent research has demonstrated that a significant indirect effect is the only condition necessary to establish mediation, and that a bootstrap test is always more powerful than Sobel’s <italic>z</italic> for testing significance of the indirect effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1094670512462139">Preacher and Hayes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094670512462139">Zhao, Lynch, and Chen 2010</xref>). The sampling distribution of the indirect effect is skewed and the confidence interval generated by Sobel’s <italic>z</italic> will often include zero and improperly determine a nonsignificant indirect effect. Conversely, a bootstrap test generates samples of the indirect effect and derives bias-corrected confidence intervals from the cumulative distribution. </p>
<p>Our study ran the bootstrap procedure in AMOS to test the significance of all indirect paths in the final model. The number of bootstrap samples was set to 5,000 and confidence level set at 95%. AMOS only calculates total indirect effects (i.e., all paths between two variables), so we were initially able to determine mediation for five of the six relationships. Significant indirect effects were found for FLE to sales performance (<italic>p</italic> = .012), FLE to process efficiency (<italic>p</italic> = .02), CFT to sales performance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), CFT to process efficiency (<italic>p</italic> = .028), and learning orientation to sales performance (<italic>p</italic> = .006). There was no significant indirect effect from learning orientation to process efficiency (<italic>p</italic> = .107).</p>
<p>Using the technique developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094670512462139">Macho and Ledermann (2011)</xref>, we were able to represent specific indirect effects as total effects in AMOS, and thereby generate <italic>p</italic> values and confidence intervals for each specific indirect effect to test the nine mediation hypotheses. We found support for six of the nine mediation hypotheses (results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670512462139">Table 4</xref>) and conclude that (1) service marketability mediates the relationships of CFT and FLE involvement to sales performance and process efficiency and (2) launch effectiveness mediates the relationships of CFT involvement and learning orientation to sales performance. Put another way, service marketability is the only mediator for FLE effects on NSD performance, launch effectiveness is the only mediator for learning orientation effects on NSD performance, and CFTs influence outcomes through both service marketability and launch effectiveness. A separate analysis found that in a structural model with only direct paths from the three internal organizational resources to NSD performance, CFTs, and learning orientation did have significant effects on sales performance, but not on process efficiency (χ<sup>2</sup> = 172.66, <italic>df</italic> = 110, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.57, TLI = .943, CFI = .954, RMSEA = .060). FLE involvement did not have a significant direct effect on NSD performance.</p>

<title>Results Summary</title>
<p>The data supported 14 of the 18 hypotheses regarding the mediation model. Paths from CFT involvement to service marketability and launch effectiveness were significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) with modest and moderately strong standardized regression coefficients (.18 and .51, respectively). Therefore, Hypotheses 1a and 1b are supported. The path from FLE involvement to service marketability was significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) with a modest standardized regression coefficient (.22). The relationship between FLE involvement and launch effectiveness was not significant in the initial model, and was dropped in final model. Therefore, Hypothesis 2a is supported and Hypothesis 2b is not supported. These findings indicate that FLEs play a key role in communicating the value and establishing the distinctiveness of the service when interacting with prospects, but do not significantly affect the results of the broader aspects of launch strategy and tactics. Paths from learning orientation to service marketability and launch effectiveness were significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) with modest and moderately strong standardized regression coefficients (.21 and .33, respectively). Therefore, Hypotheses 3a and 3b are supported. The concept that generative learning leads to more innovative solutions and products of higher perceived value received strong support.</p>
<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512462139">Melton and Hartline (2010)</xref>, the paths from service marketability to sales performance and process efficiency are both significant (<italic>p </italic>≤ .02) and have modest to moderately strong coefficients (.44 and .21, respectively). Therefore, Hypotheses 4a and 4b are supported.  The path from launch effectiveness to sales performance was significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) with a moderately strong standardized regression coefficient (.30). Therefore, Hypothesis 5 is supported. As previously indicated, six of the nine mediation Hypotheses 6 are supported.</p>

<title>Additional Analyses</title>
<p>Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the utilization and impact of CFTs vary across NSD stages. A recent meta-analysis of cross-functional integration (CFI) and new product success recommends a stage-by-stage analysis to determine where CFTs have their greatest effect on product success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670512462139">Troy, Hirunyawipada, and Paswan 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The extent of CFT involvement at each stage of the NSD process was measured on a 6-point scale ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>a great deal of involvement</italic>. A correlation analysis of the CFI/NSD stage, service marketability, and launch effectiveness items shows the strongest relationship was between “CFI in the Full Launch Stage” and the launch effectiveness item “the NSD project included formal promotion of the service offer to the target market” (<italic>r</italic> = .36, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001). Moderately strong associations were found for “CFI in the Full Launch Stage” with the launch effectiveness item “. . . formal promotion of the service to the firm’s employees (i.e., internal marketing) and for CFI in the Development Stage” with the two previously mentioned launch effectiveness items (<italic>r</italic> ranging from .300 to .347, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001). Surprisingly, the correlations with success factors were weaker for CFT involvement at the earlier stages (average significant correlations for the design, analysis, development, and full launch stages were .256, .216, .273, and .268, respectively). Because of the advantages expected for having coordination across functions early in the product development process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670512462139">Troy, Hirunyawipada, and Paswan 2008</xref>), we expected strong CFI associations with success factors for the early stages. However, we conclude that the cross-functional team potentially makes the greatest contribution to project success through extensive involvement and coordinative communications during the development and full launch stages. The modest size of the correlations suggests a need for further research to provide stronger evidence of the differential impact of CFTs across the stages of NSD.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study contributes to the service innovation and SD logic literatures by empirically demonstrating the mediation mechanism by which knowledge interfaces influence service innovation performance. Consistent with the integrative SD-logic inspired service innovation framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref>, we focused on three key knowledge interfaces that aid in the gathering, integration, and diffusion of knowledge needed to drive innovation and impact financial performance. Our model expands on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref> framework and identifies service product and development process characteristics that mediate the effect of those knowledge interfaces on NSD performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Specifically, this study offers strong evidence that there is a positive indirect relationship between CFT involvement in NSD and sales performance when mediated by service marketability and launch effectiveness. Therefore, to have a meaningful impact on NSD performance outcomes, CFTs must collaborate and coordinate in a manner that creates a new service with superior performance attributes, a level of familiarity enough to warrant quick adoption by consumers, and expert FLE service delivery; and they must effectively launch the new service. Likewise, this study provides evidence that CFTs have a positive indirect impact on process efficiency by engaging in development of a service with high service marketability. Although cross-functional team activity may result in a more marketable product, there is still a risk that the functional diversity, and the time and effort it takes to build superordinate identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512462139">Sethi, Smith, and Park 2001</xref>) and resolve conflicts may increase the time and cost of development. Functionally diverse teams can use the methods, language, and tools of Multilevel Service Design to communicate, brainstorm, and pursue new ideas when developing interdisciplinary service designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1094670512462139">Patrício et al. 2011</xref>), and thereby enhance their positive impact on mediators and outcomes of NSD.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that CFTs have far greater impact on launch effectiveness than on service marketability; and FLEs have slightly greater impact on service marketability than do CFTs. The total effect (indirect effects plus direct effect) of CFTs on sales performance is substantially greater than the total effect of FLEs on sales performance. Also, learning orientation has a substantial direct effect on launch effectiveness, a modest effect on service marketability and meaningful total effect on sales performance. In ranking the importance of these operant resources on sales outcomes of new services, CFTs and learning orientation are clearly the most important, and FLEs have far less impact. FLEs make their greatest contribution by enhancing the product’s service marketability. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094670512462139">Umashankar, Srinivasan, and Hindman (2011)</xref>, we find that innovation outcomes are enhanced when firms involve FLEs in the NSD process. Total effects for all three antecedents are greater in the mediated model than in the direct, nonmediated model.</p>
<p>The post hoc correlational analysis provides some evidence of the impact of CFT involvement at specific NSD stages. Most of the effect of CFT impact on service marketability and launch effectiveness comes from cross-functional coordinative participation in the development and launch stages, than from their contribution to innovative idea generation and screening in the design and analysis stages.</p>

<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>The SD-logic perspective emphasizes the collaboration of market participants to jointly create the value-in-use experienced by the customer. The current study contributes to the service innovation literature by expanding the notion of employee collaboration in a SD-logic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman 2011</xref>), and demonstrating the impact of CFTs (resource integrators), FLEs, and learning orientation on service characteristics and process outcomes that assist customers in their process of value cocreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512462139">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>). This study provides evidence that learning orientation improves innovativeness and acceptance of new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670512462139">Calantone, Cavusgil, and Zhao 2002</xref>), which lead to value propositions, service offerings, launch strategies, and tactics that create competitive advantage for the service provider in the marketplace. Learning orientation by definition plays a key role in the acquisition of particular operant resources (i.e., knowledge, skills, and competencies) that build competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512462139">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512462139">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512462139">2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>While there are many diverse factors that can affect the success of new service initiatives, our results suggest that managers must align operant resources with project characteristics for optimal results. In terms of sales performance of the new service, managers would be wise to instill and promote a strong learning orientation within the firm’s culture. As learning orientation fosters a shared vision, open-mindedness, and knowledge sharing, the firm enhances its ability to deliver a superior, new service (i.e., launch effectiveness), resulting in increased sales performance. Similarly, by employing extensive use of CFTs in the NSD process, managers are able to create higher quality services that are more easily launched into the marketplace. Given their daily interactions with customers, FLEs can help ensure that customer requirements are designed into the new service from the outset, and that training and internal marketing make FLEs knowledgeable about the new service and motivate them to promote it enthusiastically and effectively.</p>
<p>Given the importance of aligning operant resources with project characteristics, one of the most significant implications of our study may be that managers must change their mind-set regarding NSD projects. Merely having CFTs, FLE involvement, and a learning orientation as aspects of the NSD process is not enough. These operant resources must be clearly and carefully aligned with core service attributes, customer requirements, brand communication, and a well-coordinated service launch in order to maximize sales performance and process efficiency. Our results suggest that CFTs play the strongest role in this alignment. Their involvement throughout the NSD process has a strong mediated impact on both NSD performance outcomes. Managers should utilize CFTs across all stages of the NSD process, but should especially focus on team involvement in the development and full launch stages to maximize their impact on launch effectiveness and sales performance. Of the three operant resources, learning orientation has the second strongest impact on performance outcomes. However, developing a culture that supports a learning orientation is a long-term process.</p>
<p>In the short term, two issues are key for managers. First, FLEs should be involved in the NSD process with the explicit goal of making the service more marketable. This involves having the organization develop more effective ways of capturing, sharing, and acting upon FLE insights about customer preferences and service delivery process refinements. Second, CFTs should have dual goals of increasing marketability and making the new service launch more effective. The multidisciplinary nature of CFTs ensures diversity of opinion and knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries. This is especially critical for improving coordination during implementation and postlaunch evaluation. This study benefits managers by clarifying the mediating mechanism through which key operant resources increase the likelihood of a NSD project’s success.</p>

<title>Strengths, Limitations, and Future Research</title>
<p>This is one of the few studies that empirically examine the simultaneous influence of CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation in NSD. The study builds on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512462139">Ordanini and Parasuraman (2011)</xref>, who demonstrate the effect of knowledge interfaces on <italic>program-level</italic> outcomes (i.e., innovation volume and radicalness). The current study adds to the literature by demonstrating the positive direct and indirect effects of employee collaboration and learning orientation on important <italic>project-level</italic> outcomes. This research contributes to the NSD literature by increasing our understanding of how previously identified antecedents work together in an integrated model to increase the likelihood of new service product success. The study’s findings are reliable and generalizable due to the size of the sample and the broad variety of service sectors represented.</p>
<p>The research findings are subject to limitations regarding response rate, cross-sectional design, and use of single-source self-reports. Due to challenges of gaining participation of NSD managers in survey research, the response rate for the study is comparatively low. But the respondents are from a broad variety of service sectors, are geographically dispersed across the United States, represent large- and small-scale organizations, and hold senior management positions that give them a broad perspective of the phases and outcomes of the NSD project they report on. Also, the size of the sample is adequate for the structural equation modeling techniques used in this study.</p>
<p>The use of cross-sectional survey research and single-source self-reports raises concerns about potential common methods bias and limits on the ability to draw causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512462139">Rindfleisch et al. 2008</xref>). However, this study directly addresses those threats to validity by employing the highly reliable marker-variable technique, which provided substantial evidence that common methods bias does not significantly influence the parameter estimates of this study. </p>
<p>Since the process under study occurs over time, there is the potential that our cross-sectional approach has over- or underestimated longitudinal mediation effects. When the antecedent and mediator variables are relatively unstable, the indirect effect measured in a cross-sectional design may be negatively biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670512462139">Maxwell and Cole 2007</xref>). There is a future research need for longitudinal studies of NSD mediation processes that model causation occurring over time.</p>
<p>Future studies should expand the current study’s model to examine the simultaneous effects of involving the CFT, FLEs, and other operant resources such as customers and other business partners (stakeholders) in the NSD process, in an organizational context that supports continuous learning, flexibility, team empowerment, experimenting, and risk taking. As an example, in planning use of internal organizational resources, it would be beneficial to know if the use of CFTs and FLEs in NSD does or should vary according to less controllable market variables such as the level of competitiveness in the service category, product category life cycle stage, and market growth rate.</p>
<p>A consolidated look at which types of participants are engaged in the development process, at what stages of the process, and within what organizational culture and climate may empirically identify the best mediated model of resources, and context for developing creative and financially successful new service products. More empirical research is required in order to develop an integrated model of process, participants, culture, and NSD project outcomes.</p>
