<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: The Lachman and pivot-shift tests are 2 standard manual tests to diagnose anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency. However, the global variation of these testing procedures is not known.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: To survey currently used testing techniques and to measure the knee movement during manual tests among various expert surgeons from across the globe.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Part 1: descriptive survey. A questionnaire asking about testing procedures of Lachman and pivot-shift tests was conducted among 33 ACL surgeons. Part 2: knee kinematics comparison. Lachman and pivot-shift tests were performed on a unilateral ACL-injured patient by 5 surgeons, while knee kinematics was recorded by an electromagnetic system. Tibial translation was measured during the Lachman test, while tibial translation, rotation, and pivot-shift acceleration were calculated during the pivot-shift test.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Part 1: Tibial anterior drawer by a medially placed hand was widely advocated for the Lachman test. Flexion type of the pivot-shift test maneuver was supported by two thirds, while extension type was supported by one third. However, the “feeling” of subluxation or reduction during the pivot shift was the primary evaluation method used by the vast majority of surgeons. Part 2: Increased tibial translation during the Lachman test was observed in the ACL-injured knee with significant variation between examiners (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Tibial translation and pivot-shift acceleration during the pivot-shift test increased in the ACL-injured side (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), but tibial rotation was too diverse to find any trend (<italic>P</italic> = .31). Tibial translation and acceleration of the pivot shift in the ACL-injured knee showed no significant difference between examiners (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The Lachman test can display a wide variation of actual movement despite maneuver similarity, while the pivot-shift test could possibly be measurable by tibial translation and/or acceleration beyond their procedural variation.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance</bold>: We should recognize the limitations of these manual tests and the possibilities of their objective measurement.</p>

<body>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency is clinically diagnosed by manual tests, such as the Lachman test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423634">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511423634">32</xref></sup> and the pivot-shift test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423634">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423634">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511423634">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423634">23</xref></sup> not only for a primary ACL injury but also as an outcome measure for ACL reconstruction. Both tests are often described in a grading system for further clinical or academic comparison, most commonly using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form (available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/research/ikdc.aspx">http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/research/ikdc.aspx</ext-link>). However, the clinical evaluation of the manual tests is subjectively determined by the examiners’ hands because of the lack of simultaneous measurement systems, resulting in inconsistency across examiners,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423634">26</xref></sup> and the manual testing maneuver has wide variation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546511423634">§</xref></sup> Especially for the pivot-shift test, 3 different testing procedures, such as Losee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511423634">20</xref></sup> Noyes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423634">23</xref></sup> and Jakob,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423634">15</xref></sup> can be similarly utilized in the IKDC form despite their technical diversity, whereas several other types of testing maneuvers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511423634">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423634">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511423634">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423634">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423634">30</xref></sup> are also employed around the world. On the other hand, although the KT-1000 arthrometer measurement is commonly used as an alternative and repeatable test of the anterior laxity in place of the manually performed Lachman test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423634">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423634">28</xref></sup> the manual procedure is still prevalent in the clinical setting where the amount and the direction of the anterior drawer force have not been fully defined and could lead to inconsistency of the resultant knee kinematics. In addition, clinical accuracy in the diagnosis of ACL injuries is also variable in many studies, and this may be because of part of the variability of the manual testing techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423634">26</xref></sup> Therefore, a variation of the manual procedure is assumed to exist across the world, but it is unknown how different or similar the manual testing procedures and the knee kinematics during the manual tests are. It would be beneficial to understand the similarities and differences of these manual tests when considering the reported clinical assessments before and after ACL reconstruction. Also, this knowledge could contribute to more consistent testing protocols for future clinical and basic research related to the ACL reconstruction.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was 2-fold: (1) to investigate the descriptive difference in the manual testing procedure utilized by experts around the world, and (2) to measure the actual knee kinematics during the Lachman and the pivot-shift tests by experienced ACL surgeons from different regions of the globe. Our hypothesis was that the manual testing procedure and the resultant knee kinematics during the tests would be widely varied but that some kinematics measurements would be consistent and provide comparable evaluation between different surgeons and regions.</p>

<title>International Questionnaire Survey</title>
<p>A questionnaire survey related to the manual testing procedure and interpretation was conducted for the 33 attendees at a complimentary preconference meeting before the 7th Biennial ISAKOS (International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine) Congress 2009 in Osaka, Japan. The attendees were selected from all over the world as recognized ACL surgeons and officially invited by Kobe University and/or Osaka University. The attendees had 29 ± 6 years of orthopaedic experience and came from Asia (n = 12), North America (n = 10), Europe (n = 6), and other areas (n = 5).</p>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of 7 multiple choice questions, with additional descriptions allowed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511423634">Table 1</xref>). The first 3 questions were related to the Lachman test, while the remaining 4 asked about the pivot-shift test. All attendees signed the consent form to use their answers for future research and publication.</p>

<title>Patients and Examiners</title>
<p>Five surgeons (each from a different global region: Asia, North America, and Northern, Southern, and Eastern Europe; 28 ± 5 years of experience as an orthopaedic surgeon) were selected from the attendees to perform the Lachman and the pivot-shift tests on an ACL-deficient patient with simultaneous recording of the knee kinematics by an electromagnetic measurement system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511423634">Figure 1</xref>). The patient (a 33-year-old man) had a unilateral ACL injury and was scheduled to undergo ACL reconstruction surgery. Time after injury was 7 months at the time of the experiment. The signed informed consent form was obtained before this experiment, and this experiment was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at Kobe University as a part of ongoing research studies. The manual tests and simultaneous knee kinematics recordings were performed under anesthesia before the scheduled ACL reconstruction. After the testing, the examiners were asked to describe their own technique especially related to the applied rotational stress. After the experiment, the ACL reconstruction was performed as scheduled, and the patient followed a typical postoperative course of treatment without any complication caused by prolonged anesthesia.</p>

<title>Electromagnetic Knee Kinematics Measurement</title>
<p>Six degrees of freedom knee kinematics during manual tests was recorded by using an electromagnetic knee kinematics measurement system. The same system was used for previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423634">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511423634">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423634">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511423634">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511423634">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511423634">33</xref></sup> where the detailed measurement technique was described. An electromagnetic motion tracking system (LIBERTY, Polhemus, Colchester, Vermont) was utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511423634">Figure 1</xref>). The knee kinematics coordinate system defined by Grood and Suntay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423634">12</xref></sup> was computed by digitizing the 3-dimensional (3-D) position of the anatomic landmarks. The accuracy and reliability of the knee kinematics measurement system were reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423634">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Preliminarily, the knee kinematics during passive knee flexion with no rotational stress was recorded for providing baseline kinematics. The manual tests and the Lachman and pivot-shift tests were repeated 3 times using the technique of choice by each examiner in a random order while recording the knee kinematics data. The descriptive assessments of the manual tests were also documented according to the IKDC form. To blind the manual testing procedures and the results between one another, only one examiner performed the tests in the operating room, while others stayed out of the room.</p>
<p>The anterior tibial translation during the Lachman test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511423634">2</xref></sup> was calculated in each testing movement and defined as the distance (in millimeters) from the most posterior tibial position to the most anterior tibial position relative to the femur. In the meantime, the tibial anterior translation and rotation during the pivot-shift test were measured as the difference from the baseline data of knee kinematics, which were recorded during passive knee flexion. Additionally, the acceleration of the pivot-shift movement was also computed as reported by Hoshino et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423634">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0363546511423634">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the 3-time intraobserver repeatability was calculated for kinematics measurements of the Lachman and pivot-shift tests. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine if there was a difference between the injured and intact knees, and the difference between examiners in each ACL-injured and contralateral knee was also tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was set at α = .05. All statistical calculations were performed using PASW Statistics 18 (formerly SPSS Statistics, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<p>As for the pivot-shift test, 20 surgeons (60.7%) advocated the “flexion from extended position” maneuver, while “extension from flexed position” was still supported by 13 surgeons (39.3%). Although valgus stress was applied during the pivot-shift test almost exclusively, there was a mixed opinion as to which, internal or external, rotational stress is applied for the pivot-shift test, while internal rotational stress was more advocated (n = 19) than external rotational stress (n = 8). In addition, axial loading was commonly employed to examine the pivot shift (60.7%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511423634">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The IKDC score was the documenting method of choice for the pivot-shift test result, supported by 30 surgeons (90.9%), whereas patients’ apprehension was additionally described by some surgeons. Also, the surgeons had similar evaluation criteria for grading the pivot-shift test. Except for 3 surgeons (9.1%) who appraised tibial translation, all of the surgeons depended on the “feeling” of either dislocation (24.2%) or reduction (70%). None of our survey respondents evaluated rotation for grading the pivot-shift test.</p>

It was of note that examiner C performed the test relatively slowly but seemingly powerfully with sufficient posterior drawer stress before pulling forward. All the examiners agreed on the grading of the Lachman test as 2-B in the ACL-deficient knee according to the IKDC form.</p>
<p>The tibial translation during the Lachman test was widely varied across the examiners (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511423634">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423634">Figure 2</xref>), whereas the ICC of intraexaminer repeatability was .99 by the 3-time repeated test. The range of the tibial translation across examiners was more than 15 mm in the ACL-deficient knee and more than 20 mm in the contralateral knee. The tibial translation was different between examiners in both ACL-injured and -intact knees (both <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). However, on average, there was a statistically significant increase of the tibial translation in the ACL-injured knee compared with the intact knee (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<p>As for the pivot-shift test, although all examiners performed the “flexion from extended position” type of maneuver, diversity of the testing maneuver was visually recognized between the examiners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511423634">Figure 3</xref>). All the examiners applied the valgus torque close to the joint line with the hand placed around the fibula head, but noticeable variation was shown in the usage of the other hand. According to the examiners’ descriptions of their own technique, 2 examiners applied tibial internal rotational stress, whereas another 2 put external rotational stress on the tibia. The fifth one tried to avoid rotational loading on the tibia. The manner of stress loading was varied, that is, using a hand on the foot (examiner C), a hand on the shank (examiner A), and body force (examiner E). In addition, most of the examiners stopped flexing the knee just after they got the feeling of reduction, which appeared to occur at around 40° based on the kinematics result, but the maximum flexion angle during the pivot-shift test reached around 60° because of the follow-through after the pivot shift. Four examiners determined the grading of the pivot-shift test as clunk (++) in the ACL-deficient knee according to the IKDC form, while one examiner (examiner C) assessed it as gross (+++).</p>

An abrupt change of the tibial translation occurred just before the end of the test, around 40° of knee flexion, while there was no noticeable change in the rotational angle at the same range of flexion angle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As opposed to our hypothesis, a relatively similar technique was used for the Lachman test across the world. However, the actual knee kinematics of the manual tests was revealed to be highly diverse between examiners. On the contrary, a wide variety of manual testing procedures for the pivot-shift test was recognized by an international survey, while quantitative measurement of the knee kinematics during this test provided the similarly larger tibial anterior translation and acceleration of the tibial reduction in the ACL-deficient knee in spite of different examiners.</p>
<p>The results in this study could indicate that the clinical assessment of the anterior translation by the manual Lachman test is not consistent across examiners when it is described in millimeters. On the other hand, the performance of the pivot-shift test is variable but similarly evaluated by the “feeling” of the abnormal movement. Although it seems to be difficult to measure the “feeling,” the instrumented measurement of the knee kinematics during the pivot-shift test could deliver comparable measures across the different surgeons. When reviewing or planning the clinical or research report of ACL treatment outcome, it is important to pay attention to the diversity in manual examinations and to consider potential application of objective measurement.</p>
<p>The similar testing techniques would not necessarily result in equivalent knee kinematics. Even though the Lachman test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423634">31</xref></sup> has few variations in technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511423634">32</xref></sup> and was similar across our selected surgeons for this experiment, significant discrepancy of the tibial anterior translation was identified among examiners. This result could mainly stem from the diversity of the applied stress, which cannot be avoided as long as the test is manually performed. Although instrumented measurement of the Lachman test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423634">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423634">28</xref></sup> is suggested by the IKDC evaluation form to reduce manual variation, it still has some possibility to vary between examiners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423634">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423634">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423634">29</xref></sup> Further progress in the evaluation method for the Lachman test is still needed to obtain a more reliable measurement.</p>
<p>In contrast, the testing maneuver for the pivot-shift test has not been standardized whatsoever. A majority of the surgeons supported the “flexion from extended position” type of maneuver for reproducing the reduction movement of the subluxated lateral tibial plateau, while some favored assessing the dislocation feeling using the “extension from flexed position” type of maneuver. Even when we focus on the “flexion from extended position” maneuver, various techniques have been introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423634">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423634">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423634">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423634">30</xref></sup> McIntosh and Galway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423634">11</xref></sup> originally described the pivot-shift test with applying the internal rotational stress, while Jakob et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423634">15</xref></sup> recommended using 3 different rotational loading conditions. Such differences of the applied stress during the manual test procedure could lead to the diversity of the resultant knee kinematics, which was confirmed by this study in the rotational angle measurement.</p>
<p>Objective assessment of the pivot-shift test cannot be achieved by a simple kinematics measurement. A variety of techniques induce different knee kinematics, where the maximum anterior tibial translation or internal rotation was obtained at different knee flexion angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423634">24</xref></sup> Thus, measuring the tibial translation or rotation at a fixed angle is likely to miss the occurrence of the pivot-shift phenomenon. Tracing the tibial translation throughout the range of the pivot-shift test might be better to capture the largest change of the tibial translation and to detect the pivot-shift phenomenon as shown in this study, which could also be related to the grading of the pivot-shift test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423634">13</xref></sup> Meanwhile, greater tibial anterior shift during the pivot-shift test could be obtained by measuring the tibial translation on the lateral side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511423634">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511423634">25</xref></sup> As for the tibial rotation, there was no consistent change in the rotational angle during the pivot-shift test, similarly to previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423634">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423634">24</xref></sup> Bull et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423634">6</xref></sup> also reported the variation of the tibial rotation during the pivot-shift test using a similar type of electromagnetic measurement. Therefore, it seems to be problematic to depend on the tibial rotation for evaluating the pivot-shift test. In fact, no surgeons in our survey relied on the tibial rotation for grading the pivot-shift test. Even the effect of the ACL on the rotational angle during the pivot-shift loading has been called into doubt by robotic experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511423634">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinicians’ opinions could provide direction for accomplishing more clinically relevant measurement of the pivot-shift test. Our survey showed that the surgeons similarly determined the grade of the pivot shift based on the “feeling” of the abnormal movement, either dislocation or reduction. Although it is quite difficult to quantify the “feeling” in general, we believe that our kinematics measurement, that is, tibial anterior translation and acceleration, of the pivot-shift movement has a potential to provide the quantitative measurement. Previous reports using the same system used in this study demonstrated that both the tibial translation and the acceleration of the tibial reduction movement were related to the clinical grading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423634">13</xref></sup> Some others demonstrated similar results by measuring the acceleration using other systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423634">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511423634">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423634">21</xref></sup> Interestingly, Hughston et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423634">14</xref></sup> already described in their work written in 1976 that the pivot-shift movement involved “a sudden change in the relative velocities of the tibia and the femur: that is, there is a sudden change in the rate of acceleration of the two surfaces.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423634">14</xref></sup> Even though their technique is one of the “extension from flexed position” types of maneuver, the tibial anterior dislocation movement is assessed similarly to our examiners’ technique. Thus, as they suggested decades ago, the change of the acceleration could be observed during the pivot-shift test. As of now, the pivot-shift test depends largely on the level of experience,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423634">26</xref></sup> but the measurement of a dynamic parameter as acceleration could provide potential measure of the pivot-shift instability for general use.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was a significant difference in anterior tibial translation and acceleration across examiners in the contralateral intact knees, while there was no difference in the ACL-deficient knees. This difference may be mainly because of the presence of the pathological pivot-shift movement. Because the intact knee does not provoke the pivot shift during the test, the tibial anterior translation and acceleration stem largely from the balance between original knee laxity and applied stress. Thus, the resultant tibial translation and subsequent acceleration would vary according to the different applied stress. On the other hand, the ACL-deficient knee demonstrates the pathological pivot-shift movement induced by the pivot-shift test. Once the pivot shift occurs, the translation and acceleration of the movement would increase similarly regardless of the amount of applied stress. Therefore, it is assumed that the variation of the translation and acceleration in the ACL-deficient knee was relatively consistent compared with those results in the contralateral intact knees.</p>
<p>There are some limitations for this study. First, the examiners were selected without knowing their preferred pivot-shift maneuvers, and the number of the examiners was small (n = 5). As a result, their pivot-shift test maneuvers were somewhat similar, that is, “flexion from extended position” type of the pivot-shift test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423634">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423634">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423634">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423634">30</xref></sup> although the “extension from flexed position” type of the pivot-shift test was supported by 39.3% of surgeons in this current survey. This might have some effect on the similar resultant kinematics, that is, translation and acceleration during the pivot-shift test, in this particular study, but it is of note that there was still a significant difference in other measurement parameters across surgeons. Also, the reduction type of the pivot shift is usually provoked by the “flexion from extended position” type of maneuver, while the dislocation of the pivot shift is reproduced by the “extension from flexed position” maneuver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423634">5</xref></sup> It is still unknown if the knee kinematics of the dislocation and reduction during the pivot-shift test are simply opposite and can be similarly assessed by the analogous measurement. However, Maeyama et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423634">21</xref></sup> demonstrated an increase of the acceleration measured in the dislocation phase of the pivot-shift test. This could suggest that the acceleration might be used in a similar way for dislocation and reduction types of the pivot shift. Second, the patient in this study was tested under general anesthesia to focus on technical difference in manual testing procedure and resultant kinematics. Clinical tests are mostly conducted in the examination room with patients awake when the patient’s relaxation is an additional factor affecting the kinematics assessment. Thus, some types of the testing maneuver could induce a patient’s guarding to mask the abnormal motion under waking condition, while others might achieve better relaxation, resulting in obvious kinematics differences. Lastly, the applied force during the manual tests was not measured and/or controlled in this study in spite of its considerable influence on knee kinematics. Because the examiners knew the preoperative diagnosis of the ACL injury in this experiment, they could adjust the applied force consciously or unconsciously according to their anticipation of the pivot shift. Even though consistent forces are supposed to be applied to fairly compare both knees, they might apply a different amount of force to the injured knee to exaggerate the side-to-side difference. Appropriate force measurement might have revealed the difference. However, it is still technically difficult to measure the multidirectional forces separately in each direction during manually performed tests.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Lachman test is performed in a similar fashion but has a wide variation in the amount of tibial translation across the surgeons, while the pivot-shift test has variability in performance of the maneuver but could possibly be measured reliably by the tibial translation of the pivot shift and/or its acceleration. A standardized method of performing the manual tests and quantifying the examiners’ “feeling” would be warranted to attain a truly comparable measure of these clinical assessments.</p>
