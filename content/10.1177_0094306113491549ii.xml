<p>It is striking how many young people today work on a small organic farm, seeking an experience they have not found elsewhere in their lives. Many young people in my generation did something similar—we worked on a kibbutz, a commune in Israel. This 20-chapter book analyzes 100 years of kibbutz life, from 1909–2009, focusing on important changes and contemporary challenges. Of the 24 scholars who contributed to this volume, half were either current or previous members of a kibbutz and several authors teach in an institute or college connected to kibbutz education. This creates an unusual perspective from scholars rooted in communal life and all its issues.</p>
<p>By 2009, there were hundreds of kibbutzim and while they constituted only 2 percent of the total Jewish population in Israel, they contributed approximately 40 percent of the agriculture, 7 percent of industrial output, and 10 percent of tourism to the economy. In other words, they are extremely important for at least their agrarian production.</p>
<p>The roots of the kibbutz can be traced back to early Ashkenazi settlers in Palestine. Kibbutz ideology was based on socialist Zionism where labor was valued and working the land was central to building a Jewish homeland. Indeed, the image of the male <italic>chalutz</italic> (pioneer) was a predominant one in Zionist ideology—a healthy, young, strong male body (think Paul Newman in the film <italic>Exodus</italic>) that countered an image of the weak, emasculated, scholarly Eastern European Jew who was constantly battered by anti-Semites.</p>
<p>In the kibbutz, all services such as meals and childcare were collectivized, freeing up women to work at other needed jobs. Children, even babies, lived in children’s houses that were run by kibbutz members. Biological parents and children spent time together but did not sleep in the same residence. While some children adjusted easily to living with their friends full-time, later films and novels reveal the difficulties some children experienced with nightly separation from their parents. This radical experiment where boys and girls mixed freely and grew up as a cohort was like Candy Land for many scholars interested in organizational sociology, communes, and Marxist ideology, as well as gender. As was the case in most every experiment or revolution, women ended up doing the traditionally gendered work, either in the kitchen, the children’s homes, or the laundry.</p>
<p>Political splits in the kibbutz movement ensued early on as did important shifts in the kibbutz economy. In the 1960s, many kibbutzim began some kind of industrial output on the premises. However, the greatest challenge to the moral backbone of the kibbutzim came with hiring outsiders as laborers: local Arab men or Palestinians, and now mostly Thai immigrant workers. These outside workers thwarted the very basis of kibbutz ideology, creating a moral crisis for many members. The economic crash of the 1980s affected the kibbutz movement and its economic viability as government subsidies declined. Many kibbutzim were forced to institute more radical changes in order to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The most striking change in the kibbutz noted frequently in this volume has been the shift from a communal orientation to an individualized one which has privatized many activities including family life; children’s houses are now defunct and children live with their parents. In some cases, all meals are privatized and at home instead of in the communal dining room. The kibbutzim have had to reinvent themselves, and the process and results have not been easy. While many nostalgically recall when working on a kibbutz felt as though one was serving a higher purpose, this new and “reconstituted” kibbutz, according to some, is no longer worthy of the name it bears.</p>
<p>To stay solvent, kibbutzim have tried to diversify economically as much as possible, including developing guest houses for tourists. However, one of the most popular approaches that happens to be interesting sociologically, has been to develop a particular area of the kibbutz with housing for families who live alongside the kibbutz but are not members. Many of these families include someone who grew up on a kibbutz but moved away, and living near the kibbutz without being a member is a unique way to enjoy the advantages of communal life while maintaining personal autonomy. It is less expensive than a house in the city and their children have access to open spaces, sometimes swimming pools, and the kibbutz schools. These novel communities sound very appealing—however, many of these enclaves have been rocked with conflict. It is not simply the “two Jews-three opinions” problem but more complicated and concrete issues regarding what these non-members are paying for and what services are available to them. Many kibbutzim are finding themselves locked in conflict over these issues and both sides feel a “we versus they” antagonistic relationship. In a minority of cases, it has worked out.</p>
<p>Unlike a more traditional social science edited volume, this book includes several chapters on the representation of kibbutzim in Israeli literature and film, enriching the reader’s perspective with a fuller sense of the human experience. Less positive aspects of the volume are that several chapters are dryly written—most of these authors are not native English speakers. This is not a highly theoretical volume yet there is a wealth of empirical material for those interested in intentional communities. Finally, there is no mention of the Palestinians who ended up suffering considerably from the initial Zionist project of establishing the kibbutzim and their ongoing presence.</p>
<p>This book will be of interest to sociologists focused on intentional communities, social movements, and organizations. In Batya Gur’s beautifully written <italic>Murder on a Kibbutz: A Communal Case</italic>, detective Michael Ohayon, a Jew of Mizrahi extraction, is investigating a murder. He is warned by the highly ideological Ashkenazi kibbutz members: “if you’ve never lived on a kibbutz…you’ll never understand anything” (p. 183). If, however, you have lived on a kibbutz and are a sociologist, you will understand and perhaps even take pleasure in reading this volume.</p>
