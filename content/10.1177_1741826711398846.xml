<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Although statins have indisputably proven to reduce fatal and nonfatal events in patients with cardiovascular disease, many patients with established cardiovascular disease do not receive them. Research into the effective and efficient implementation of current guidelines on secondary prevention is therefore needed.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> A cluster randomized implementation trial was conducted between September 2006 and February 2008.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Experimental pharmacists received an intensive implementation programme, whereas control pharmacists received an educational manual only. Pharmacists in both the groups were asked to identify eligible patients and to provide general practitioners (GPs) with lists of these patients. Physicians received instructions from the pharmacists to review the patients regarding a statin indication and to start a statin when they considered this as appropriate. Main outcome measure was the percentage of identified patients who received one or more statin prescriptions at 6 months follow-up.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Although twice as many patients were reviewed for a statin indication by a GP in the experimental group (19.7 vs. 10.8%, <italic>P = </italic>0.023), an equally low number of patients in the experimental group and the control group received statins (5.8 vs. 5.3%, <italic>P = </italic>0.104).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The intensive implementation programme had an impact on pharmacists and GPs, but did not result in more patients receiving statins.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711398846" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A guideline of the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398846">1</xref></sup> that was published in January 2006 recommends treatment with statins for patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) whose low-density lipoprotein concentrations are above 2.5 mmol/l (100 mg/dl). Yet a quarter to a third of Dutch outpatients with established CVD is still not treated with a statin (unpublished data from 2006). Similar, worse or only slightly better percentages of nontreated patients have been observed in other European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711398846">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398846">4</xref></sup> These results show that better insight into the effective and efficient implementation of guidelines on cardiovascular risk management is essential. As successful implementation generally requires a comprehensive approach, in which barriers and facilitators to change in a specific setting are targeted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398846">5</xref></sup> we developed an intensive implementation programme directed at pharmacists that consisted of an educational manual, an interactive educational meeting, reminder and feedback telephone calls and reminder newsletters.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that this intensive programme would improve the implementation of appropriate prescribing of statins to eligible patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711398846" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>A cluster randomized trial was conducted between September 2006 and February 2008. The medical ethical committee Arnhem-Nijmegen gave approval for this trial.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711398846"><title>Setting</title>
<p>In The Netherlands, all patients have an obligatory health insurance, which covers most medication and all patients are registered to a single general practitioner (GP) who has a gatekeeper role in coordinating medical care. Most patients are also registered in a single pharmacy, although this is not obligatory; patients can get their prescriptions in any pharmacy they like. Nonetheless, pharmacy shopping behaviour was very limited at the time of this study in the Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398846">6</xref></sup> and all prescriptions are routinely registered in the pharmacy computer system. Pharmacists do not routinely receive information on indications for prescribed drugs in the Netherlands and they cannot independently or complementarily prescribe drugs. As GPs’ morbidity records are an imperfect source for the identification of patients who are likely to have CVD (unpublished data from 2006), the pharmacy computer system provides an additional resource for the identification of these patients and for the monitoring of statin prescribing.</p>
<p>Most pharmacists and GPs in the Netherlands take part in pharmacotherapy audit meetings (PTAMs), which are held an average of five or six times a year to discuss pharmacotherapy topics, often on the basis of GP prescription data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398846">7</xref></sup> PTAM groups generally involve one pharmacist with a minimum of three GPs and a maximum of 12 persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398846">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711398846"><title>Participating pharmacies</title>
<p>Community pharmacies were recruited through mailing to all 211 pharmacies in the south of The Netherlands in April 2006. Participation was voluntary, though encouraged by one of the two major health insurance companies in this part of The Netherlands: pharmacies participating in this study were exempted from presenting an annual plan and from reporting of patient care activities, which is normally required for a pharmacy to obtain full reimbursement of medication dispensed. There was no financial incentive for participation in the project other than the usual dispensing fee per prescription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711398846"><title>Randomization</title>
<p>To avoid that pharmacies in the control group would benefit from the intensive implementation programme through collaboration with pharmacies in the experimental group, we clustered such collaborations of pharmacies before randomization. There were 17 clusters of one pharmacy, 10 clusters of two pharmacies, six clusters of three pharmacies, three clusters of four pharmacies and one cluster of five pharmacies. The (clustered) pharmacies were numbered by a research assistant. An independent statistician performed a block randomization, in which each block consisted of two pharmacy clusters and in which the cluster size (number of pharmacies in each cluster) was balanced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711398846"><title>Interventions</title>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711398846"><title>Directed at patients</title>
<p>In all participating pharmacies, both in the experimental and in the control groups, patients were automatically selected in the pharmacy computer system if they had at least one prescription for an antiplatelet drug (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification B01AC) in the 12 months preceding the moment of selection, without any prescription for a lipid-modifying agent (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical C10) in the same period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398846">9</xref></sup> As anti-platelet drugs are recommended only for patients with established CVD in The Netherlands,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398846">1</xref></sup> selected patients were all likely to have established CVD and thus they all had a potential statin indication. In a PTAM with GPs, pharmacists discussed the national guideline ‘Cardiovascular risk management’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398846">1</xref></sup> and handed over a gross list of eligible patients to the GPs (T0). GPs who were not present at the PTAM could be approached by the pharmacist individually for handing over the list. GPs were instructed to mark patients whom they considered eligible for addition of a statin on the basis of the new guideline with a ‘ + ’, and patients for whom they did not intend to prescribe a statin, for example, because the low-density lipoprotein was below 2.5 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) or because the patient had a statin intolerance, with a ‘–’. They were also asked to prescribe a statin to the selected patients.</p>
<p>The experimental and the control group pharmacies received a different intervention for the implementation of the same patient-directed service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711398846"><title>Directed at pharmacies</title>
<p><italic>Experimental group:</italic> Experimental pharmacists received a written educational manual in September or October 2006, which consisted of information about the project, step-by-step instructions on how to make the patient selection, suggestions for presenting the project to GPs and pharmacy technicians, suggestions for reminding the GPs about statin prescription and a flow-chart for the planning of the project. The project had a planned duration of 12 months. Pharmacists were also invited to an interactive educational meeting, which was based on the literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711398846">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711398846">11</xref></sup> and on the extensive experience of two professional communication advisors who were well informed about daily practice in community pharmacies. The pharmacists were challenged by a communication advisor to identify and tackle potential barriers for implementation and to plan the steps required for the project on the basis of a predefined flowchart. Four reminder telephone calls were planned with each pharmacist.</p>
<p><italic>Control group:</italic> The control group pharmacies received a written educational manual in October 2006, which was the same as the manual for the experimental pharmacies. No further intervention was applied.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711398846"><title>Measurements</title>
<p>Baseline characteristics of pharmacies were measured at the start of the study by means of a written inventory. Baseline characteristics of the selected patients and prescription outcomes were extracted from a national prescription database (The Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics directly gathers data from more than 1670 of the 1850 community pharmacies in The Netherlands. The participating pharmacies serve about 13.5 million people, and dispense drugs or medical aids some 140 million times per year. <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sfk.nl/algemeen/english.html">http://www.sfk.nl/algemeen/english.html</ext-link></italic>) from 6 months before T0 until T0, which could vary per pharmacy. Descriptive information regarding the implementation process was obtained through a written questionnaire, which was returned by the pharmacists at the end of the project. All pharmacists who had not returned the questionnaire by March 2008 were called to obtain information on the implementation process. Pharmacies from which no questionnaires were received and whose pharmacists were not reachable for telephone interview after several attempts were considered not to have started the project; these pharmacies were included in the data analyses by recording a value of zero for each step of the implementation process. For pharmacies that did not hand over any list with selected patients to any GP, T0 was calculated as the median date for T0 from the other pharmacies. Statin prescriptions were extracted from the national prescription database from T0 until 12 months after T0, which could vary per pharmacy, but not later than February 2008.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711398846"><title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcome was the percentage of selected patients receiving one or more prescriptions of a statin in the 6 months after the GP had received the list of selected patients (6 months after T0). Additional outcomes, which were related to the implementation process were the percentage of selected patients who were reviewed for an actual statin indication by a GP; the percentage of patients reviewed who had an actual statin indication according to the GP, the percentage of selected patients who received a statin 12 months after T0 and the percentage of patients with a statin indication according to the GP who received a statin 6 and 12 months after T0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711398846"><title>Sample size</title>
<p>We assumed that the average number of patients with antiplatelet therapy and without any lipid-modifying drug was 300 in each pharmacy, and that 40% of these patients would receive at least one prescription for a statin if their pharmacy belonged to the experimental group compared with 30% of the selected patients in control pharmacies.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we computed that 38 clusters of pharmacies were required, based on a power of 0.8 to detect a significant difference (P<italic> = </italic>0.05, two sided) and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711398846"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The impact of the intensive implementation programme on the implementation process and on prescribing of statins was examined in a random coefficient logistic regression model, which took into account that patients were grouped within pharmacy clusters. The primary analysis was quasi intention-to-treat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398846">12</xref></sup> Differences in baseline characteristics between the control and the experimental groups of pharmacists and patients were tested for using unpaired t-tests and <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> tests. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 15.0 software package (Chicago, Illinois, USA), except the random coefficient logistic regression analysis, which was performed using the SAS 9.1.3 software (Cary, North Carolina, USA) by means of the Glimmix procedure for the dichotomous outcomes and the mixed procedure for the continuous outcomes.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1741826711398846"><title>Participating pharmacies, loss to follow-up and data completeness</title>
<p>The flow of participants is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711398846">Figure 1</xref>. In total, 71 eligible pharmacies registered for participation in the study between May and August 2006, which were grouped into 36 clusters (taking into account local collaborations). Randomization resulted in a control group of 34 pharmacies in 18 pharmacy clusters and an experimental group of 37 pharmacies in 18 pharmacy clusters.

<p>Six pharmacies withdrew between September and November 2006. As a consequence, baseline data on pharmacies were available for 65 pharmacies. Data on the implementation process were obtained from 64 pharmacies. The other pharmacy was considered not to have started the project. Patient data at baseline and follow-up were available for 52 pharmacies. More detailed information about data completeness is shown in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Only about 5 and 10% of the selected patients received a statin in the first 6 and 12 months, respectively after the pharmacists had handed over the lists to GPs, both in the control and in the experimental groups. The 10% corresponds to only 3% of all patients with CVD. Although the intervention in the experimental group resulted in almost twice as many patients being reviewed and marked as eligible by a GP for a statin indication compared with the control group, this did not lead to a difference in statin prescribing between the two groups.</p>
<p>The intensive implementation programme in this study resulted in moderately better pharmacist performance (i.e. more lists handed over to more GPs and lists retrieved from more GPs) and in a considerably higher percentage of patients being reviewed by the GP for a statin indication. Apparently, our intervention tackled the main barrier perceived by the pharmacists — engaging GPs in the project - reasonably well, but it did not overcome GPs’ barriers to actually prescribe statins. Our study was not designed to clarify the root causes of the prescribing barriers. Earlier studies in the UK and in The Netherlands indicate that organization of general practice, complexity of guidelines and changing guidelines, problems at the secondary-primary care interface and patient factors generally seem to be the most important barriers to prescribe statins to patients at high-cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711398846">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398846">16</xref></sup> Cabana et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711398846">17</xref></sup> identified seven general categories of barriers to physician adherence to practice guidelines in relation to behaviour change. Of these seven categories, lack of awareness, lack of familiarity, lack of agreement with the guideline on cardiovascular risk management and lack of outcome expectancy were not likely to be applicable, especially for the GPs who reviewed the lists with selected patients. A lack of self efficacy, lack of motivation or inertia of earlier practice and external barriers, like patient factors, lack of time or organizational constraints could have contributed to the limited prescribing of statins in this study. An earlier audit in 95 practices in The Netherlands supports this assumption, except for the finding that most GPs had positive self-efficacy expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711398846">18</xref></sup> The relationship between pharmacists and GPs was rated good or very good by less than two thirds of the pharmacists. Possibly, this might also have played a role in the limited cooperation of GPs in this study. Next, a television broadcast in March 2007, which was very negative about preventive use of statins, may have discouraged one or more GPs from discussing the need for prescribing a statin with their patients. It remains unclear to which extent the observed statin prescriptions were a direct consequence of this study, or to which extent it resulted from other programmes for improving statin prescription. Whether additional interventions directed at GPs, for example, an educational meeting, an organizational intervention or additional remuneration on top of the fixed fee per prescription can overcome the prescribing barriers for GPs, is a subject for further research.</p>
<p>This study has strengths and limitations. Among the strengths were the randomized design, large sample size and low drop-out rates for the pharmacies in addition to the high degree of validity for the prescription data extracted from the national prescription database. The use of a clinical guideline by the Dutch College of General Practitioners with clear recommendations, with a solid scientific foundation was a strength as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711398846">19</xref></sup> A limitation was that antiplatelet therapy, which was used for identification of patients who were likely to have CVD in this study, is not a perfect tool. Only about two thirds of the antiplatelet users in general practice has a recorded diagnosis of CVD (unpublished data from 2006) and the GPs who reviewed the selected patients in this study assessed that about 40% of them had a statin indication. The ineligibility for a statin could only explain a small part of the ultimately limited statin prescription, however, as only 15% of the patients with a statin indication according to the GP received a statin after 6 months.</p>
<p>Of the 211 pharmacies invited for participation, only 71 actually registered for our study. Unfortunately, we were not able to determine why pharmacies chose not to participate or whether they were comparable with the pharmacies that were enrolled in the study. It is therefore unclear to which extent voluntary participation may have lead to bias. Another limitation comprises the substantial number of pharmacies for which no patient data could be obtained. The performance of those pharmacies was comparable with the pharmacies of which we did have patient data. Therefore, we do not expect that the outcomes were biased as a result of this limitation.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that pharmacists can play a significant role in primary care in the identification of patients at high cardiovascular risk who are yet to receive optimal preventive pharmacotherapy and that an intensive implementation programmme can improve the performance of pharmacists in their cooperation with GPs. Future studies should investigate how the reach of the implementation programmme can be extended to actually improving statin prescribing either by extending the implementation programme to the GPs or by extending current possibilities of pharmacists to prescribe statins themselves (of course within the framework of a formal agreement with the local GPs).</p>

As a consequence, baseline data on pharmacies were available for 65 pharmacies. All participating pharmacists in the control and the experimental groups received the educational manual. Twenty-nine of the 34 pharmacists in the experimental group were present in one of the educational meetings at the start of the project. Pharmacists had between three and nine telephone calls with a research assistant, the median frequency of calls was five times. All experimental pharmacies received the three newsletters concerning the progress of the project. Questionnaire data on the implementation process were obtained from 62 pharmacies. Of the three remaining pharmacies, the actual performance of the implementation activities could be established by telephone interview for two pharmacies. Patient data at baseline and follow-up were available for 52 pharmacies: one pharmacy did not give authorization to the national database administrator for data extraction, one pharmacy had opened in October 2005 and did not have 12 complete months of patient data before the start of the project and for 11 pharmacies data extraction was impossible because patient identification numbers changed during the project because of a switch of the pharmacy to another computer system.</p>
