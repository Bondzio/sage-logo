<abstract>
<p>The use of patient stories in decision aids is a highly controversial practice. However, the resulting debates and research have yielded little consensus about the impact of patient stories due to vague operational definitions of narratives. In this article, we argue that narratives are not homogeneous in either content or effect and hence should not be considered a single construct in research. The purpose of this article is to provide a taxonomy that guides both the development of decision aids and future research on this topic. We define three dimensions of narratives that are likely to moderate their impact on decision making: 1) the purpose of the narrative, 2) the content of the message, and 3) the evaluative valence, or overall tone, of the message. In addition, we describe predicted effects of different types of narratives on decision making and discuss their potential interactions. Our taxonomy provides a framework that will allow for the precise documentation of different narrative types, the use of appropriate outcome measures, and a systematic evaluation of narratives in all types of decision aids. Failures to recognize the complex structure of narratives will result both in research that does little to inform our understanding of the impact of patient stories and in the use of narratives in patient education materials that have unintended consequences on both decision processes and behavior.</p>

<body>
<p>Patient narratives, or stories, are illustrative examples of other patients’ experiences with a disease or disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12463266">1</xref></sup> Patient narratives are popular among decision aid developers; 84% of publically available aids include at least one patient story.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12463266">2</xref></sup> However, researchers consider this practice to be highly controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12463266">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12463266">4</xref></sup> for two reasons: First, there are compelling theoretical arguments from cognitive and social psychology that suggest narratives are more powerful than other message formats. Second, studies of their effect on health care decisions have yielded mixed results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12463266">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerns about the use of patient stories stem from several areas of research in psychology that suggest narrative information will have a stronger influence on decision making than statistical information. This implies that patients would base their treatment decisions on the experiences of few while ignoring data from many. Research on attitudes and persuasion suggests that narratives are more persuasive than other message formats because narrative messages have the ability to “transport” the reader or viewer into the story,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12463266">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12463266">7</xref></sup> narrative messages are likely to cause greater elaboration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12463266">8</xref></sup> and people tend to underuse statistical information relative to case studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12463266">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, both dual-process models and the affect heuristic suggest that narratives might influence health care decisions by facilitating different modes of information processing than other message formats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12463266">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12463266">20</xref></sup> which could result in greater weight given to narrative information during decision making. Together, these literatures suggest that narratives will have a more powerful impact on decisions about health care than other types of messages and outline processes by which narratives may influence decision making. However, no theory makes <italic>specific</italic> predictions about how narratives will influence decision making. These theories provide broad, general hypotheses about proposed mechanisms and effects of narratives but provide no guidance about different types of narratives that might be useful when designing decision aids or other health care messages.</p>
<p>Narratives also remain controversial among researchers because studies about their impact on healthcare decisions have yielded conflicting results. A review by Winterbottom and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12463266">5</xref></sup> identified 17 studies that examined the effect of narratives on decision making in medically relevant contexts. Although the majority of these studies demonstrated that patient narratives have very little influence on decision making when compared with no additional information and/or statistical information,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12463266">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12463266">29</xref></sup> five studies reported that providing narratives altered health-related decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12463266">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12463266">32</xref></sup> In addition, recent work has demonstrated that narratives affect preferences for end-of-life care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12463266">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X12463266">34</xref></sup> have a greater effect on hypothetical choices for dialysis treatment than advice from a physician,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12463266">35</xref></sup> and increase risk perception for colorectal cancer and interest in screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12463266">36</xref></sup> We hypothesize that these conflicting findings are actually the result of an insufficient and vague operational definition of patient narratives.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12463266">
<title>Narratives are Multidimensional</title>
<p>In this article, we argue that to fully understand the role of narratives in decisions about health care, we need to go beyond simply considering narratives as homogeneous and instead systematically consider the impact of both the format <italic>and</italic> content of a narrative message. Unfortunately, existing research that has examined the effect of narratives on health care decisions has generally provided few details about narrative content, with most simply mentioning that narratives were included. We believe that systematic research to investigate the effects of different narrative types is essential to disentangling their effects.</p>
<p>We therefore propose a taxonomy of narratives that can guide future research in hopes of providing a better understanding of when and why narratives affect decisions about health care. In this taxonomy, we define three dimensions of narratives that are likely to moderate their impact on decision making: 1) the purpose of the narrative, 2) the content of the message, and 3) the evaluative valence, or overall tone, of the message. We chose these three specific dimensions because in our review of the literature on narratives, several aspects of these dimensions varied between studies. Furthermore, attempts to roughly categorize studies by these dimensions yielded clusters of studies with similar results. However, several categories in these dimensions were not explicitly provided in the studies on narratives. The taxonomy, therefore, grew out of our attempts to explain a conflicting body of literature and our hypotheses about the explanatory power of other dimensions not previously considered in the literature.</p>
<p>We address each of these three dimensions separately and discuss their potential interactions. The goal of this taxonomy is to provide a better understanding of when and why narratives affect decisions in health care. To do so, we will first describe different categories of patient stories that could appear in all types of health care materials. Although not all of these types of stories would appear in a patient decision aid, we believe it is more instructive to create a comprehensive taxonomy. We will then return to the context of patient decision aids to discuss the implications of this taxonomy for the development of decision aids and to make recommendations for future research.</p>
<p>Our taxonomy is designed to be a functional framework that sets a blueprint for future work but does not specify the mechanisms through which narratives affect decisions. Before a comprehensive cognitive framework that identifies specific mechanisms can be proposed, we need to be able to clearly categorize the various types of stimuli used in current research so that we can gather systematic experimental evidence about how and when different types of narratives result in different effects. As a result, in this article, we restrict ourselves to providing illustrative examples of the possible pathways through which each of our described types of narrative information may affect decision making. We want to be clear that these proposed mechanisms are purely hypothesized relationships that require both empirical support and future refinement.</p>

<sec id="section2-0272989X12463266">
<title>Purpose of the Narrative</title>
<p>The first important dimension of patient narratives is their purpose: Why were they included in the health care materials? After reviewing the literature, there appear to be five distinct purposes for using narratives in health care materials, each of which is hypothesized to result in different outcomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12463266">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>First, narratives can be used to <italic>provide information</italic> about various health care issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12463266">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12463266">38</xref></sup> For example, narratives can be used as an alternative format for presenting technical information about diseases and treatments. Cognitive learning theories suggest that narrative information will have a processing advantage over didactic information, allowing people to process, store, and retrieve information more effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12463266">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X12463266">40</xref></sup> Therefore, narratives may be more effective at communicating basic information about health care (screening tests, disease facts, treatments, etc.) than traditional nonnarrative approaches. Alternatively, narratives can also be used to convey other types of information that go beyond traditional presentations of factual, disease-based information, such as experiential information.</p>
<p>Second, narratives have also been used to make health materials more <italic>engaging</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12463266">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12463266">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12463266">42</xref></sup> As research by Cox and Cox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12463266">22</xref></sup> demonstrated, people were more involved with narrative messages than with statistical messages, and the narrative messages were deemed to be more relevant. We believe that engagement is a separate category from others in this dimension because increasing engagement suggests an increased depth of processing that is not a necessary consequence of the other purpose categories. Using narratives has been a particularly effective technique in promoting the use of health care materials by low literacy populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12463266">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12463266">43</xref></sup> In these contexts, narratives have been used to present educational messages within entertaining stories such as soap operas.</p>
<p>Third, narratives have been used to <italic>model targeted behaviors</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12463266">42</xref></sup> Target actions can be positive health behaviors, such as exercise, healthy eating habits, or sunscreen use, or positive decision processes like participation in health care or shared decision making. Research on entertainment education has demonstrated that narratives can be an effective method of modeling desired behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12463266">44</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is evidence that modeling can be used to promote the increase of specific health behaviors, such as breast self-exams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X12463266">45</xref></sup> and exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12463266">46</xref></sup> and participation in decisions about health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X12463266">47</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Fourth, narratives are often used to <italic>persuade</italic> a target population to engage in healthy behaviors or to cease unhealthy behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12463266">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X12463266">48</xref></sup> For example, narratives have been used in smoking cessation efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X12463266">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272989X12463266">50</xref></sup> and efforts to increase behaviors related to early cancer detection, such as screenings or self-exams (e.g., Erwin and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272989X12463266">51</xref></sup>). Narratives have been used extensively for this purpose in communications about cancer prevention and control; see Kreuter and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12463266">41</xref></sup> for a review. Narratives can have a persuasive effect by providing specific types of information, engaging a target audience, and/or modeling specific behaviors. However, narratives can also be used for those purposes and <italic>not</italic> result in persuasion. Therefore, we chose to keep “persuasion” as a separate purpose to reflect the fact that using narratives does not always result in persuasion.</p>
<p>Fifth, narratives can also be used to <italic>provide comfort</italic> to patients and families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12463266">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272989X12463266">52</xref></sup> We consider comfort to be a separate category in this dimension because it is a very specific outcome that is not a necessary consequence of the other categories. Although it is possible that providing information or modeling a behavior such as shared decision making could provide comfort, it is equally plausible that comfort could decrease with these purposes as well. In addition, many large-scale national cancer control projects such as Reach to Recovery, Man to Man, and The Witness Project have used narratives specifically to provide support to other cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272989X12463266">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272989X12463266"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272989X12463266">55</xref></sup> For example, some of these programs allow patients to ask questions of cancer survivors and to have discussions about their fears and concerns with trained survivor volunteers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X12463266">
<title>Content of the Narrative</title>
<p>The second dimension of narratives is their content; this dimension differs from the purpose dimension in that it describes a characteristic of the message content itself. Although there are many different ways to describe the content of a message, we created the categories in this dimension of the taxonomy by reviewing the narratives used in previous research and forming hypotheses about how key aspects of their content relate to the outcomes measured and considering our collective research experiences using patient narratives. The resulting categories map nicely onto existing work about distinct types of regret in cancer-related decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272989X12463266">56</xref></sup> The content dimension contains three categories of information that we hypothesize to have differential effects on patient decision making: outcome, experience, and process (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X12463266">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As described in the “purpose” dimension of our taxonomy, narratives can be used in health care materials for other purposes than influencing decision making (e.g., providing comfort). However, we argue that although affecting decision making is not always a goal, it is a likely and sometimes underappreciated secondary effect of including patient stories in health care materials. This section of the article outlines the hypothesized primary effects of each category of narrative content on the decision-making process.</p>
<p>The first category of narrative content is information about outcomes, which we will refer to as <italic>outcome narratives</italic>. Outcome narratives describe the psychological or physical health outcomes associated with a treatment decision. Physical health outcomes can include information about an individual patient’s survival, local recurrence, symptoms, or side effects experienced. Common psychological health outcomes reported are an individual patient’s quality of life, regret, distress, worry, and satisfaction. The following are examples of outcome narrative elements about the decision to have a lumpectomy and radiation after a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer: 1) “I chose to have a lumpectomy, and after ten years, I’m still cancer free” (outcome information about local recurrence) or 2) “I really regret my choice to have a lumpectomy. I am constantly checking for new lumps and worrying about whether the cancer will return” (psychological outcome information).</p>
<p>The second category of narrative content is information about the patient experience, which we will refer to as <italic>experience narratives</italic>. Experience narratives describe experiential aspects of diseases or treatments and essentially provide information about what it is like to have a given disease or treatment. Information provided in experience narratives is typically more experiential than cognitive. An experience narrative will discuss feelings, visceral experiences, or the time and energy involved in dealing with the disease or treatment. The following are examples of experience narrative elements associated with lumpectomy and radiation: 1) “The surgery part was pretty much what I had expected. I was in some pain when I woke up from the surgery, but the pain medications made it tolerable” (information about discomfort after surgery) or 2) “I went to radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. This caused me to miss a number of important events with my family” (information about the time and energy associated with the treatment).</p>
<p>The third category of content is information about a patient’s decision-making process, which we will refer to as <italic>process narratives</italic>. Broadly, process narratives describe <italic>how</italic> a patient made a particular health care decision, and they typically focus on cognitive aspects of the decision that are characteristic of normative or prescriptive models of decision making (e.g., subjective expected utility theory). Although understanding experiences associated with different treatments is relevant to making a decision, process narratives specifically refer to the search for information, the discovery of the relevant decision dimensions, the assignment of weights to the different decision dimensions, and the process through which these steps are combined that results in the final decision. The following are examples of process narrative elements that describe the process of choosing a surgery for the treatment of early stage breast cancer: 1) “After I spoke with my doctor, I also talked to other breast cancer survivors, and looked for information about the two surgeries on the web” (strategies for information acquisition); 2) “I knew I needed to consider my appearance after both surgeries and how that would make me feel and how worried I would be about the cancer coming back” (identification of important decision dimensions); and 3) “Coming to a decision was hard. I did not want to lose my entire breast, but I felt that lowering the chance of the cancer coming back was even more important than keeping my breast” (assignment of weights to decision dimensions).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that each of the three narrative content categories will be processed differently, leading to unique effects on decision making. There are a number of plausible mechanisms through which this could occur. For example, experience and process narratives might promote different modes of processing as described by dual-process models. Providing outcomes may change information processing in other ways. Research on the hindsight bias and creeping determinism has shown that providing people with outcome knowledge affects decision processes by impacting evidence selection, evaluation, and integration (e.g., Hawkins and Hastie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272989X12463266">57</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>As with the “purpose” dimension, different types of effects also are naturally associated with each category of narrative content (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12463266">Table 3</xref>). Below we outline what we believe to be the primary effects of each category of narrative content, but there may also be a number of secondary effects of narratives on the decision-making process. We hypothesize that the primary effect of process narratives is to prime patients to follow a particular decision process. Most of the time, this would mean considering additional dimensions of the decision process they might not have otherwise considered. However, a process narrative could also recommend that patients <italic>not</italic> think about dimensions A and B and instead focus on dimensions C and D. Secondary effects resulting from changing the decision process could be observed in several measures of information processing, including the number and type of resources gathered, the quality of information considered, or the duration of information search or deliberation (total or within each dimension). Process narratives may also highlight important information and facts, which would affect recipients’ ability to answer knowledge questions. Last, the change in information search may lead to more positive evaluations of the decision process (e.g., feelings of being better prepared for decision making) because recipients may find it easier to identify relevant information.</p>

<p>Experience narratives provide experiential information about diseases and treatments. We hypothesize that their primary effects will be to increase knowledge and the perceived ability to imagine future health states. This could result in an important secondary effect, an improved ability to make affective forecasts (forecasts of future feelings). Such an effect could be quite significant, as there is considerable evidence that people have difficulty predicting how they will feel about disabling health conditions or difficult health procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272989X12463266">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272989X12463266">60</xref></sup> Increasing knowledge could also lead to a secondary positive effect on evaluations of the decision process. Therefore, interventions and research studies using experience narratives should measure knowledge, affective forecasting, and decision preparation as relevant outcomes.</p>
<p>In contrast, outcome narratives are hypothesized to have their primary effect on likelihood perception by influencing the availability of the outcome described in the narrative. Several studies suggest that narratives affect perceptions of personal risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272989X12463266">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272989X12463266">63</xref></sup> This could have a number of important secondary effects, including influencing health care decisions. Several studies of treatment decisions have tested the effect of providing outcome knowledge in narrative form (albeit not labeled as such), and these studies have reported that inclusion of such narratives resulted in changes in decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12463266">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12463266">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12463266">33</xref></sup> Therefore, studies employing outcome narratives would be advised to measure screening/treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Finally, although each of the three narrative content types is predicted to have unique effects on decision making, we recognize that narratives will not always fit perfectly into these three categories. Often, a single narrative will embody elements of multiple categories. For example, a specific narrative may have largely outcome components but may also have experiential elements. Future research will need to tease apart these effects to determine how content categories may interact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X12463266">
<title>Evaluative Valence</title>
<p>The third dimension of narratives is their evaluative valence, which we define as a patient’s general expression of his or her satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the process of making a health care decision, his or her experiences associated with a disease or treatment, or the outcome of a health care decision. The concept of this dimension and the choice of terminology were motivated by work from Peters and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272989X12463266">64</xref></sup> who demonstrate that evaluative categories affect health judgments and choices. Like the content dimension, evaluative valence describes a characteristic of the message content. The evaluative valence of a message classifies an outcome, side effect, process, and so forth as good, bad, or mixed, much like a gist processing approach. Although affective and emotional messages typically have a strong evaluative valence, the evaluative valence component of a message does not need to be highly affective or emotional. Evaluative valence is theoretically a continuum ranging from an extremely positive narrative on one end to an extremely negative narrative on the other end. For example, a positive narrative could indicate that although a treatment was challenging, it was not as bad as expected and increased the bond with family members. In contrast, a negative narrative could describe dissatisfaction with the decision-making process or unexpected difficulties with a treatment. Any individual narrative could fall anywhere on this continuum and could include both positive and negative elements. However, for simplicity, our discussion will focus on narratives that are either entirely positive or negative.</p>
<p>There are also a number of plausible mechanisms through which the evaluative valence of a narrative will influence decision making. Evaluative valence may influence decision processes by inducing different processing modes. For example, a narrative with a negative evaluative valence may promote analytical reasoning over our typical default processing mode, intuition. Alternatively, evaluative valence may affect decision making via changes in mood elicited by the narrative, and a large body of evidence suggests that mood or affect influences how people process information (e.g., Clore and Huntsinger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272989X12463266">65</xref></sup> and Schwarz and Clore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0272989X12463266">66</xref></sup>). For instance, positive moods have been shown to induce creativity, flexibility, and efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272989X12463266">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0272989X12463266"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0272989X12463266">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with the other dimensions of the taxonomy, we hypothesize that positive and negative evaluative valence will have different effects on decision making. Specifically, we anticipate that the evaluative valence of a narrative will enhance the effect generated by the particular narrative content. However, we hypothesize that negative narratives are likely to have a stronger effect on decision making than positive narratives. For example, a process narrative about surgical decisions for early stage breast cancer may highlight the need to consider postoperative appearance as well as local recurrence (e.g., “I thought it was important to consider how I would feel about my appearance”). Although a negative process narrative may also highlight the same dimension (e.g., “I really wish I had considered how my appearance might make me feel, and I didn’t. I really regret that.”), the negative tone could cause a patient to spend even more time reading about postoperative appearance than a patient who had been exposed to only positive process narratives. As with the other dimensions, researchers must be deliberate about their selection of outcome measures to fully capture the effect of evaluative valence. Because we hypothesize that the evaluative valence of a narrative will amplify the effect predicted by its content, the choice of an outcome measure should be determined by the content of the particular narrative.</p>

<title>Relationships between Narrative Dimensions</title>
<p>Although the three dimensions of this narrative taxonomy have been discussed separately, they are not truly orthogonal. First, the content of narratives will be closely related to their purpose. For example, if the goal of using narratives is to inform patients about treatments for a particular disease or disorder, decision aid developers could use process narratives to highlight important decision dimensions or experience narratives to provide rich, personalized information about experiences with the treatments. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12463266">Table 4</xref> for all hypothesized relationships between purpose and content.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the narrative is designed to increase patient engagement with the health materials, any of the three types of narrative content would be suited for this purpose, as engagement is more likely to be tied to the format of the message than its content. In contrast, if the patient narrative is intended to model a positive behavior, such as shared decision making, a process narrative will almost always be employed. In this case, process narratives would be the most effective at demonstrating shared decision making and providing patients with examples of how to adopt this approach.</p>
<p>However, if the purpose of a narrative is to persuade a population to engage in a specific health behavior, such as breast self-exams, outcome narratives may be the most effective choice, as a rich literature suggests that outcome information strongly influences judgments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12463266">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12463266">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272989X12463266">57</xref></sup> For example, one narrative might tell the story of a woman who practiced routine exams, detected a lump early, and as result was successfully treated. Another might describe a woman who, because of the lack of regular self-exams, failed to detect a lump that, when noticed by her doctor, was already in an advanced stage.</p>
<p>Last, narratives that are designed to provide comfort to other patients would most likely include information about experiences and/or outcomes. It is often comforting for patients to hear that others have had similarly challenging experiences. Likewise, it can be reassuring for patients to learn about other individuals who have had difficult experiences but positive outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition to the close ties between the content and purpose dimensions, content and evaluative valences are also considered to be highly dependent dimensions. We hypothesize that these two dimensions will have an interactive effect on decision processes. As previously mentioned, positively valenced narratives are not likely to influence decision processes much beyond what is predicted by their content. However, negatively valenced narratives are hypothesized to strengthen the effect of the narrative’s content. Evaluative valence will also be important to consider with the narrative’s purpose. As evidenced by the examples above, in some cases, positive narratives will be more effective than negative narratives for a particular purpose and vice versa. Because of the predicted relationships between the three dimensions of this taxonomy, we argue that it will be important to study these dimensions together in a factorial design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272989X12463266" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we challenge the prevailing discussions of narratives as homogeneous communication tools that can be considered and implemented as a single construct. We argue instead that narratives are multidimensional, varying systematically in their purpose, content, and evaluative valence. Understanding these variations is essential for both researchers and patient educators, because narrative characteristics appear likely to moderate the impact that narratives have on health care decisions. However, research is needed to test the validity of the framework presented in this article. We hope that all users of patient narratives will consider how the stories they use fit within our structural taxonomy. Using the taxonomy in this way will allow researchers to identify and isolate the specific roles that these stories play in patient (and perhaps clinician) decision making.</p>
<p>We believe this taxonomy will help researchers in several ways. First, this article provides a framework for explaining the contradictory findings about the effect of patient stories on health care decisions. We hope that our taxonomy can help to disentangle the inconsistent findings of previous research by recasting the debate in terms of the effect of different narrative types. For example, several studies demonstrated that providing outcome information in the patient narratives (although not explicitly identified as such) significantly affected hypothetical treatment decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12463266">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12463266">32</xref></sup> Thus, the relevant argument may not be whether patient narratives are “good” or “bad” per se, as the current body of literature attempts to do, but rather whether certain narrative types are suited for certain purposes.</p>
<p>Second, this taxonomy can provide a platform for future research on patient narratives. We have recommended specific content dimensions to be tested and described their predicted effects on decision making. Whether or not our specific hypotheses prove accurate, we believe that a more systematic research agenda about narrative characteristics will yield rich benefits. Future research should focus on testing the effects of narrative content and evaluative valence on decision preparation, information search, knowledge, affective forecasting, screening/treatment decisions, and other behavioral intentions. Additional studies could explore whether an interaction between the content and evaluative valence dimensions exists. Of primary importance would be determining when the use of negative narratives is appropriate.</p>
<p>Third, by identifying the relevant effects of narratives on the decision process, we have suggested specific outcome measures that are likely to be related to the particular narrative content used.</p>
<p>We believe that an adoption of this taxonomy will also have important consequences for decision aid developers. Most important, the taxonomy forces designers to have a specific purpose in mind when using narratives instead of including patient stories simply because they might increase the appeal of the decision aid. The taxonomy also helps designers to realize that including narratives for a specific purpose could result in unintended consequences unless the context is appropriately matched. Finally, this taxonomy assists designers with identifying stories with the most appropriate content for their needs. This will be particularly important if designers are using real patient stories instead of fictionalized examples of the “typical” patient experience. Although further research is needed to test the hypotheses behind this taxonomy, the taxonomy itself can be used to develop preliminary recommendations about the use of narratives in patient decision aids. For example, because decision aids are typically created for preference-sensitive decisions and outcome narratives are hypothesized to produce the greatest effects on health care decisions, we would suggest that outcome narratives <italic>not</italic> be used in decision aids. In contrast, because experience narratives are hypothesized to improve affective forecasting, we would suggest that experience narratives might be a helpful component of patient decision aids. Furthermore, process narratives may increase deliberation, which suggests that process narratives could also be a useful component of a patient decision aid, if increased deliberation was a desired outcome.</p>
<p>The controversial practice of using patient stories in decision aids has spurred great debate among academics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12463266">3</xref></sup> and several recent studies on the topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12463266">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12463266">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12463266">36</xref></sup> However, we are no closer to understanding the effect of this potentially powerful tool because we are using an insufficient and vague definition of narratives. In this article, we argue that narratives must no longer be considered a single construct and should instead be described and tested by their different dimensions. We have outlined a taxonomy of narrative types that includes what we hypothesize are three important dimensions to consider in research and practice: purpose, content, and evaluative valence. We argue that future work should be built on this taxonomy to precisely document the effects of different narrative types, use appropriate outcome measures, and thereby allow for systematic evaluation of narratives in all types of decision aids. Failures to recognize the complex structure of narratives will result in research that does little to inform our understanding of the impact of patient stories and in the use of narratives in patient communications that have unintended consequences on both decision processes and behavior.</p>
