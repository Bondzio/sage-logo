<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Pediatric home parenteral nutrition (PN) patients present a unique challenge with risks of catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs), sometimes requiring subsequent catheter removal. Recurrent infections can lead to line removal and potential loss of venous access in the future. <italic>Objective</italic>: Demonstrate that weekly ethanol lock therapy decreases CABSIs in long-term home PN patients and decreases line removals due to infections. <italic>Methods</italic>: Beginning August 2007, patients receiving PN with a history of multiple previous CABSIs were started on ethanol lock therapy. Seventy percent ethanol solution was instilled into the central venous catheter (CVC) for 2 hours weekly. Episodes of CABSIs and catheter removal due to infection were documented in patients prior to and after ethanol lock therapy. <italic>Results</italic>: Fourteen patients were followed for an average of 690 days after ethanol lock therapy was initiated. These patients were found to average 9.8 CABSIs per 1000 catheter days prior to starting ethanol lock therapy and only 2.7 CABSIs per 1000 catheter days after ethanol lock therapy (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Prior to ethanol lock therapy, the group averaged 4.3 catheter removals per 1000 catheter days but only 1.0 catheter removal per 1000 catheter days after ethanol lock therapy. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Our group of patients showed a 73% reduction in CABSIs and a 77% reduction in catheter removal due to infection after ethanol lock therapy. In our patient population, weekly ethanol lock therapy for 2 hours is an effective technique to reduce CABSIs and catheter removal in long-term home PN patients.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Pediatric home parenteral nutrition (PN) patients present a unique challenge with risks of catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CABSI). These infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality, often times requiring subsequent catheter removal. Since patients with intestinal failure continue to require PN as a critical source of nutrition and fluid intake, a central venous catheter (CVC) continues to be the standard of care for a patient with intestinal failure. Loss of vascular sites due to catheter removal and liver injury worsened by repeated CABSIs are key criteria that lead some patients to intestinal transplant or death. Infection rates in patients with intestinal failure have been reported to be 8–26.5 CABSI per 1000 catheter days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612468009">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612468009">2</xref></sup> Each CABSI episode has an estimated hospital cost of up to $56,000 and an additional hospital stay of 6.5 days in critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612468009">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams have shown to improve the overall survival of patients with intestinal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612468009">4</xref></sup> These teams have helped develop multiple strategies to help prevent recurrent infections and thus decrease their associated morbidity and mortality. It is now standard of care to have tunneled catheters inserted under sterile conditions, maintained with a sterile occlusive dressing, and closely monitored for signs of infection. Antibiotic lock therapy is another strategy used in an effort to prevent infection and treat CABSIs. Although guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America include antibiotic lock therapy as an option for CABSIs, there are concerns associated with their use, including development of antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612468009">5</xref></sup> Such resistance is especially true with CABSIs because biofilms have shown to increase resistance and may require antibiotic levels to be as much as 1000 times greater than those routinely required to kill free-floating bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612468009">6</xref></sup> There is also the risk of side effects from antibiotics used in the lock therapy since antibiotic blood levels can reach those associated with toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612468009">7</xref></sup> Because of these concerns and the early case reports showing ethanol’s efficacious antimicrobial effects, ethanol lock therapy (ELT) was found to be a useful technique to help treat bacterial catheter infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612468009">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612468009">9</xref></sup> Further cohort studies showed that ethanol could not only treat bacterial catheter infections but also play a crucial role in preventing infections when used prophylactically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612468009">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612468009">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612468009"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612468009"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612468009"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612468009">14</xref></sup> Most recently, a case series showed that ethanol has the ability to treat fungal-associated catheter infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612468009">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ethanol is a disinfectant that is bactericidal and fungicidal by nonspecifically denaturing cell membrane proteins. As a result of this mode of action, ethanol is less likely than antibiotics to promote antimicrobial resistance. In vitro studies show that 40% ethanol can inhibit bacterial growth in existing biofilms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612468009">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, 70% ethanol can kill biofilm-forming microbes consisting of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> after 1 hour and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> after 4 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612468009">17</xref></sup> Since ethanol has the ability to penetrate catheter biofilms, does not promote antimicrobial resistance, is cleared readily from the body, and is relatively inexpensive to produce, it is a promising agent to help prevent and treat CABSIs.</p>
<p>Since pediatric patients on long-term PN due to intestinal failure are at a high risk of infection, we aimed to assess if ELT could decrease the rate of CVC infections in this high-risk population at our center. If infections could be decreased, then we hoped to reduce liver damage, decrease catheter removals, and improve the morbidity and mortality associated with long-term PN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0884533612468009" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was a retrospective review of patients’ medical records performed with the approval of the Stanford University Investigational Review Board protocol 22061. All patients included in this study had intestinal failure requiring the placement of a CVC to administer PN, with no minimum age or weight requirements. The patients had to have a silicone tunneled CVC to be included in the review. Patients were followed by the Nutrition Support Team at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford and received their home PN supplies, including ethanol, from the Children’s Home Pharmacy of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford. Patients who used another home pharmacy service were excluded from this analysis. Data were analyzed for patients starting ELT from August 2007 through June 2011.</p>
<p>Patients started receiving a regimen of 70% ethanol catheter lock after having at least 2 CABSI episodes. The solution was prepared sterilely by our home pharmacy for home use or by our inpatient pharmacy if the patient happened to be in the hospital. One to 2 mL of ethanol was instilled into a 5-mL syringe and given a 9-day sterility expiration date. The catheter was flushed with normal saline prior to instilling the ethanol. One milliliter of ethanol was instilled into the catheter of patients weighing &lt;30 kg, and 2 mL was instilled into the catheter of patients weighing &gt;30 kg. The ethanol was left in the catheter for a dwell time of 2 hours once a week. Since our infant patients were cycled off PN for at least 2–4 hours and the earliest case series had some patients undergoing only 2 hours of lock time, we decided this would be an acceptable, uniform, minimalistic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612468009">10</xref></sup> The ethanol was then aspirated from the catheter, and then the catheter was flushed with normal saline before instilling a heparin lock or initiating the routine PN infusion. The other 6 days of the week, the patients’ parents heparinized the CVC in their routine fashion. These locks were initiated in the hospital setting by the nursing staff but were then instituted in the outpatient setting once the patients’ parents were taught the proper technique. No medication restrictions were imposed upon the patients because of concern for a disulfiram-like reaction, but patients were monitored and counseled appropriately if placed on a medication that could possibly react with ethanol.</p>
<p>In the event that a patient was admitted to the hospital and found to have a positive blood culture, the patient would be started on 5 days of consecutive ELT for 2 hours each day. Empiric antibiotics would be infused through the CVC until antibiotic sensitivities returned on the causative organism, and a tailored antibiotic regimen would be designed. The patient would then continue infusing the appropriate antibiotic regimen via the CVC until completion. The patient would also return back to a weekly ELT schedule after finishing the 5-day consecutive treatment course.</p>
<p>Data collected from the retrospective review included demographic information (sex, age, and weight at initiation of ethanol lock and primary diagnosis), number of CABSIs prior to and after starting ELT, type of catheters, number of catheter removals due to infection prior to and after starting ELT, and dates of catheter placements and removal. CABSI was defined as at least 1 positive blood culture drawn from the CVC without any other confirmed source of infection that could lead to bacteremia or fungemia. Data were also collected on the organisms isolated from the blood cultures. The data were summarized with means for continuous variables and by frequency with percentages for categorical data. Hypothesis testing was performed using the paired <italic>t</italic> test. Significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 20 home PN patients were started on ELT from August 2007–June 2011 at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford. Six patients were excluded from the study: 4 patients were followed by outside home pharmacy services, 1 patient was started on ELT at an outside hospital, and 1 patient was never compliant with following the protocol and discontinued the therapy soon after starting. Fourteen patients were analyzed since they were followed by both the Nutrition Support Team at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford and our Home Pharmacy and met inclusion criteria. The patients’ demographic information is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612468009">Table 1</xref>, documenting the patients’ age, sex, weight, catheter type, and diagnosis.</p>

<p>Patients tolerated the ELT well, with only 1 patient reporting side effects. The patient reported facial flushing and irritability while receiving an ethanol lock of 1 mL. The side effects subsided as the dose was decreased to 0.8 mL. There were no thrombotic catheter events or other catheter-related issues documented in the cohort during follow-up visits.</p>
<p>Although all patients included in the study had a diagnosis of intestinal failure, they all received some enteral nutrition. None of the patients were nil per os (NPO) as part of their medical management. It is also noteworthy to mention that none of the patients were treated with steroids during the course of the study.</p>

<sec id="section4-0884533612468009" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As long as PN remains the mainstay of therapy for patients with intestinal failure, maintenance of CVC will continue to be a major focus for healthcare professionals. The most serious risk facing these patients is sepsis secondary to this indwelling foreign body. In pediatrics, this is especially true since Goulet et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612468009">18</xref></sup> documented that most septic episodes occurred in patients younger than 2 years. Multidisciplinary care, family education, and sterile technique will continue to remain the hallmark of home PN care, but ELT is proving to play a crucial role in minimizing infection rates and catheter removal rates.</p>
<p>Only silicone catheters were used in this study since this had been a precedent set by other studies, and they have been in general clinical use due to concern about ethanol lock use in polyurethane catheters. The safety of ethanol lock use in silicone and polyurethane catheters, however, seems to show no significant clinical difference between the 2 catheters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612468009">19</xref></sup> Cohen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612468009">20</xref></sup> recently compared tunneled polyurethane and silicone catheter durability in 192 patients and 211 catheters. They found that silicone catheters fractured in 8% of patients, whereas there were no catheter fractures with the polyurethane lines. This indicates that silicone catheters may be more prone to catheter fracture than polyurethane catheters even at baseline. Crnich et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612468009">21</xref></sup> tested both types of catheters locked with 70% ethanol for 10 weeks compared with a no-lock solution. The catheters then underwent mechanical testing to evaluate their integrity during multiple intervals over those 10 weeks. There was a minimal reduction in the elasticity of both catheters and a minor increase in the wall thickness of the polyurethane catheter. The authors concluded that ethanol would not appreciably alter the integrity of either catheter. Guenu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612468009">22</xref></sup> used electron microscopy to evaluate for damage of the internal lumen of silicone catheters after being immersed in 95% ethanol for 15 days. They found no damage to the internal catheter after viewing it at 1000–2000× magnification. Bell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612468009">23</xref></sup> performed in vitro studies on polyurethane catheters involving 3 locking solutions that included heparin 5000 IU/mL, 4% trisodium citrate, and 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate. The ethanol locked catheters showed significantly lower force at break and elongation at break, indicating that less applied force and stretch to the catheter would result in catheter breakage. Although it was statistically significant, the polyurethane catheter could still be stretched 22 times its length and could withstand 11.5 kg of force compared with the control catheter, which could be stretched 42 times its length and could withstand 23.4 kg of force. Therefore, the authors felt that clinically, polyurethane catheters could be used with ethanol locking solutions. A case report of a chemotherapy patient receiving etoposide (VP-16) describes degeneration of the internal wall and micro-cracking of a polyurethane catheter when viewed under electron microscopy. The group then subjected polyurethane catheters to each individual component of VP-16 and suggested that the ethanol component may have been the factor leading to the catheter degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612468009">24</xref></sup> Some data show that both silicone and polyurethane catheters are minimally affected by ethanol lock solutions, but none of the studies concluded that there was any clinical difference in their performance over a long-term period, yet clinically providers appear to have concern over using ELT with polyurethane catheters. It does not appear that there is any published evidence to support these concerns, which again supports the overall safety profile of ethanol use with a CVC.</p>
<p>Our data show a significant decrease in infection rates from 9.8 to 2.7 CABSIs per 1000 catheter days (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) with the initiation of ELT. Catheter removal rates decreased by over 4-fold, 4.3 to 1.0 catheter removals per 1000 catheter days (<italic>P</italic> = .05). These results are similar to many of the other studies using 3 times a week or even daily ethanol locks with longer dwell times than 2 hours (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533612468009">Table 4</xref>). Our results are seen after an extensive follow-up period after instituting ELT with a mean follow-up period of 690 days, which is the longest follow-up period of any study to date. Only 1 patient had minimal side effects that subsided with titration of the ethanol lock dose. These side effects perhaps could have been avoided if we had measured the catheter volumes better. Instead of using 1-mL and 2-mL predetermined locking volumes, we could have measured the aspirated volume until blood return was noted. We had no thrombotic events with our patients’ catheters like those seen in studies using daily ethanol locks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612468009">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612468009">25</xref></sup> Our minimalistic approach allowed for the gold standard, heparin lock, to be used as much as possible to maintain catheter patency. Ethanol is a relatively inexpensive intervention that is typically in ample supply, but during 2011, there were many PN component shortages, including ethanol. A weekly ELT regimen is an available strategy to ration the available supply of ethanol and, it is hoped, avoid shortages in the future while decreasing cost and significantly decreasing infection and catheter removal rates in pediatric patients with intestinal failure.</p>

<p>As our study was limited by its retrospective design and limited numbers (although it had the longest follow-up period of any pediatric cohort with intestinal failure), further prospective studies are needed to compare the different ethanol lock strategies being implemented at various intestinal rehabilitation centers. A multicenter trial comparing weekly, 3 times a week, and daily ethanol lock therapies could be implemented looking at both silicone and polyurethane catheters to determine which regimen is the safest and most efficacious since it is clear that this technique has proven its role as a potent method to decrease CABSI rates and maintain vitally important vascular access sites by limiting the need to remove catheters.</p>
