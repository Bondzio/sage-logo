<abstract>
<p>Baltimore City formally began recycling in 1989 with all neighbourhoods having residential collection by 1992. Although the city of 637 000 has recycled for approximately 20 years, almost all residents in multi-family residential (MFR) housing have been and are still barred from participating at their residences. Discussions with City officials and residents have verified this antiquated policy of exclusion within MFR housing. Yet, the policy is still observed by the Department of Public Works even though the updated single-stream Code states that the ‘Director of Public Works must collect all. . .recyclable materials. . .from all dwellings, including multiple-family dwellings’. The purpose of this study’s is to provide policies, regulations, and recommendations for implementing requisite MFR recycling within Baltimore City. The study’s methodology follows a case study approach by examining three cities in the United States that currently mandate MFR recycling: Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; and Arlington, Virginia. Post-analysis suggests that while some cities’ MFR programmes perform poorly, each city’s strengths aid in creating specific proposals that can produce a successful MFR recycling program in Baltimore City. These tenets of a future MFR recycling program form the basis of a successful MFR recycling program that will allow all city residents to participate via initiatives in the categories of both programme, accessibility, and informing and self-review.</p>

<title>Introduction and understanding for research</title>
<p>With the 2008 implementation of single-stream recycling in Baltimore City, most residents receive increased recycling opportunities with respect to the quantity of materials collected, the frequency of collection, and the increased convenience of participating in a single-stream recycling programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City Code, 2009</xref>;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11433529">Baltimore Commission on Sustainability, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11433529">Recycle Baltimore, 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, the majority of Baltimore City residents living within multi-family residential (MFR) buildings are barred from participating within on-site residential recycling. MFR residents must physically pack-up all of their recycling and walk, take public transportation, or drive to the nearest of eight city drop-off centres while carrying their recyclables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11433529">Scott, 2009</xref>). This study follows a case study approach to answer: <italic>How can a successful multi-family residential recycling programme be initiated within Baltimore City, Maryland</italic>?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X11433529">
<title>Baltimore City recycling roots and expansion</title>
<p>Formal recycling in Baltimore City began in October 1989 when ‘six drop-off centers operated jointly by the City and local community groups. . .collected fifty to sixty tons of recyclables’ per month; this occurred during the same period that the first few states (not including Maryland) began enacting state-wide recycling laws and programmes (Balog et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11433529">Scheinberg, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>During the ensuing years, the types of items that were acceptable for recycling grew, as did the population of Baltimore City who received household recycling collection. In 1992 a ‘’blue bag’ system was established, which delivered ‘recycling instructions, calendars, sample blue bags’ and other announcements to residents within the collection zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11433529">Balog et al., 1992</xref>). ‘Volunteer Recycling Block Captains’ were chosen since ‘peer influence’ and ‘community esprit de corps. . . [were] identified as a key element of a successful recycling programme’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11433529">Balog et al., 1992</xref>). The innovations, technologies, and methodologies of outreach to communities has changed in the past 20 years and in 2010, most Baltimore City residents (not including MFR dwellers) have access to household trash and recycling pickups once per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City FAQ Database, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, Baltimore City has historically refused to collect recyclable materials from the majority of MFR buildings – only some low-rise MFR buildings receive service, due to their populations not exceeding certain city quantity limits that actually do not apply within the modern sanitation code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City Code, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11433529">Scott, 2009</xref>). Baltimore Ordinance 09-175, signed by Mayor Sheila Dixon on 2 June 2009, states that MFR dwellings and residents ‘must collect all mixed refuse [and] recyclable materials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City Council, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, Article 23 §2-3(b) of the 2009 Baltimore City [Sanitation] Code states:
<disp-quote>
<p>Director of Public works must collect all mixed refuse, recyclable materials, and yard waste from all dwellings, including multiple-family dwellings. . .subject to the quantity limitations specified in this section” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City Code, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For each designated collection day, the amount to be collected from each place is:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X11433529" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For mixed refuse, limited to 96 gallons;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For recyclable materials and yard waste, if bundled or contained separately from mixed refuse, unlimited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City Code, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Thus, there are discrepancies between what is actually law and the current Department of Public Works (DPW) practices.</p>

<sec id="section3-0734242X11433529" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>As a ‘case study is preferred in examining contemporary events’, and its ‘unique strength is its ability to deal with a full variety of evidence – documents, artefacts, interviews, and observations’, this approach aids in answering the question: <italic>how can a successful multi-family residential recycling programme be initiated within Baltimore City, Maryland</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X11433529">Yin, 1991</xref>)? Baltimore’s MFR population comprises approximately 21% of the total housing units in Baltimore City – 54 101 units – but they are disregarded by the city’s single-stream recycling programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11433529">Scott, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Three cities in the United States that currently mandate MFR recycling were chosen for this case study: Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; and Arlington, Virginia. Chicago, with 2.85 million residents, is about six times as large as Baltimore City in terms of population. The number of inhabitants from which Chicago must collect recycling may aid in illustrating how larger cities address issues of MFR recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11433529">Chicago City, 2009</xref>). Boston is similar to Baltimore in that they are both historic east-coast cities and have populations that are between 609 000 and 637 000 residents. This may allow for policy similarities due to the number of residents within both cities’ recycling programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11433529">Boston City, 2009</xref>). Arlington, with approximately 210 000 residents, is one-third of Baltimore’s population of 637 000. Form-wise, both cities are coterminous with their counties (the city limits are the same as the county limits) which may allow for similarities regarding governance and implementation of policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11433529">Arlington County, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433529">Baltimore City, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The research process began in autumn 2009 and continued into spring 2010. Contact was initiated with a public official of each of the three case study cities in order to acquire different datasets assembled by or on behalf of the cities, and to arrange possible site visitation opportunities. Each of the three cities provided (either by website or by electronic mail), their publicly available published studies, which vary from an audit-type approach, to having a city commission their own MFR study. Unfortunately, all three cities were neither able to provide in-person visits nor further opportunities aside from the publicly available data.</p>
<p>A literature review was conducted in order to elicit commonalities and discordance between published studies and the three case study cities. <italic>How can a successful multi-family residential recycling programme be initiated within Baltimore City, Maryland</italic> begins with a review of pertinent MFR literature. Subsequently, the three case studies are presented to juxtapose their findings with those published from domestic and international examples.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X11433529">
<title>Review of MFR published studies – infrastructural design, waste collection procedures, and behaviours</title>
<p>Prior to analysing MFR recycling in the three cities, this study aspires to utilize ‘multiple sources of evidence’ to better ground the forthcoming results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X11433529">Yin, 1991</xref>). This can be accomplished via the following three categories of relatable, published studies: infrastructural design, waste collection procedures, and recycling behaviours.</p>
<p>Housing types vary considerably within cities themselves, and while each city has a slightly different definition of what constitutes a MFR housing unit, a concern is how to design for this vastly different constituency. Can a small apartment complex with a dozen apartments be successfully governed by the same MFR regulations as a forty-five storey building? A 2001 United States Environmental protection Agency (USEPA) study found that ‘successful (20% or higher diversion rate)’ MFR housing units ‘tended to have large and numerous containers provided by the recycling service. . .emphasis[ing] the importance of convenience in yielding high waste-diversion rates. . .with some ‘record-setting’ programmes using strategies like doorstep pickup of recyclables in high rise’ MFR buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433529">Ando and Gosselin, 2005</xref>). This gives credence that residents are willing to recycle when it is convenient and does not present a nuisance to their way of life. In an Urbana, Illinois study, it was determined that MFR ‘recycling rates are higher in households that report having adequate interior space available for sorting and storing recyclables’ versus households that do not have enough space for storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433529">Ando and Gosselin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>An English study undertaken during 2005 and 2006 found that ‘further research is needed specifically in this area’ of studying how to better interface mixed refuse and recycling disposal so that they can be accomplished in a convenient manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11433529">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>). In MFR high-rises within inner-city London, the study discerned ‘chutes can be effectively incorporated into the interface for recycling collection’ and the easiest way to accomplish this is when there is a dedicated recycling chute, or an alternative locale to ‘place recycling containers near existing chutes’, while respecting safety requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11433529">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>). The Urbana and London studies illustrate that in cases where space is very limited and at a premium, such as some MFR apartments, the ability of the residents to dispose of recycling in an easier or equally as easy manner as their mixed-refuse assists in having a successful MFR recycling programme.</p>
<p>Waste collection procedure improvements in MFR recycling programmes can be closely synchronized with the aforementioned infrastructural improvements. For example, in 2005 the City of Seattle mandated that ‘space for recycling is required in new [MFR] construction’. This forethought of location may assist new buildings becoming more convenient due to mixed-refuse and recycling disposal being thought of from the onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X11433529">Touart, 2000</xref>). Effectively, simply creating a mandatory law will not automatically place the ease of recycling collection on a par with that of mixed-refuse. For example, the Urbana study found that within MFR housing, ‘the lateral distance that recyclers must walk to put out their recycling has a significant negative effect on container recycling’ because recycling bins ‘are bulky, messy, heavy. . .and not readily tucked under one’s arm for a trip to the recycling bin en route to carrying the rest of the trash out to the dumpster’, even though the ‘recycling bins and dumpsters are located near each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433529">Ando and Gosselin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This concept is further demonstrated in an example of a small MFR complex in Portland, Oregon with half of the MFR units on one side of the creek and half on the other; a walking bridge over the creek allows access from one side to the other. Although each side of the complex had its own mixed-refuse dumpster, only one side had a recycling station. It was ‘found that the residents on the other side weren’t bringing their recyclables over to the recycling station because they had no other reason to come over’ and cross the pedestrian bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11433529">Farrell, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The Urbana study also concludes that ‘bin distance [will only] have an effect on [MFR] recycling if by choosing to recycle an item of waste one commits to taking an extra trip to the waste-disposal area’, which interestingly relates back to infrastructural challenges where MFR ‘households with enough interior space to sort and store their recyclables are. . .more likely to’ recycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433529">Ando and Gosselin, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it can be deduced that while there may not be a clear answer about how people adapt to situations in which recycling is more difficult than utilizing mixed-refuse containers, it can be concluded that when the ease with which a person recycles is placed on a par with the effort they need to deposit mixed-refuse, the likelihood and rate of recycling is bound to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11433529">Farrell, 1996</xref>). Finally, the collection areas to which MFR residents bring their recyclable materials need to have the same amount of access rights as mixed-refuse. As an example in the London study, one of the reasons given for many residents no longer recycling is past experiences where ‘elderly residents described climbing down several flights of stairs only to find the banks [recycling drop-off areas] closed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11433529">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Attitudes and behaviours exhibited by residents in MFR dwellings have an effect on how the residents use their home, which can aid or mar the quantity of material recycled. The type of lifestyle within which MFR residents currently live (single vs. partnered vs. with children, etc.) also affects recycling behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11433529">Lebersorger, 2005</xref>). Although it would be feckless to discern the exact demographical structure of a building’s residents, knowing different strategies for the possible groups of residents living within a building can serve to strengthen recycling strategies and enforcement procedures.</p>
<p>A 2002 Vienna, Austria ‘case study was conducted in six [MFR buildings] with highly divergent per-capita quantities of residual waste’, which aimed to ‘identify possible reasons for these differences’ in waste accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11433529">Lebersorger, 2005</xref>). The study hypothesized and concluded that ‘generation of waste is primarily determined by the situational context, [meaning] by economic, familial, spatial and other, objectively definable circumstances, and not by individual attitudes’. The findings are remarkable because, as an example, ‘families with infants show a lot of habits, which are related to a high waste generation, whereas older couples report more conserving consumption habits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11433529">Lebersorger, 2005</xref>). Notwithstanding, the study also mentions that ‘before activities relating to waste minimisation or recycling are implemented’, further studies or research into a certain populations’ adaptations or abilities should be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11433529">Lebersorger, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional area of study in MFR recycling behaviour focuses on peers and tactics and how they may influence a person to recycle – without contamination for instance. A study from Ann Arbor, Michigan analysed strategies such as commitments or pledges signed by residents, postcards sent to residents detailing ‘cumulative, biweekly averages of the amount of material recycled in the resident’s complex’, and newsletters giving general feedback and highlighting broad MFR recycling information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11433529">DeYoung et al., 1995</xref>). The study concluded that ‘contamination can be reduced by <italic>any</italic> of the three treatments in middle sized complexes’, but none ‘improved recycling behaviour in the very large complexes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11433529">DeYoung et al., 1995</xref>). A fourth strategy used a ‘volunteer coordinator’, something that ‘has been considered effective in single family programmes, did not significantly improve recycling behaviour in this study of [MFR] dwellings’. Finally, the study finds that ‘even the most successful technique in one setting should not be presumed to work, unmodified, in all other settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11433529">DeYoung et al., 1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0734242X11433529">
<title>MFR recycling in case study city 1 – Chicago, Illinois</title>
<p>In 1986, the State of Illinois passed the Illinois Solid Waste Management Act aiming to ‘address solid waste handling’ based upon five tenets: ‘volume reduction…, recycling and reuse, combustion with energy recovery, combustion for volume reduction, and disposal in landfill facilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11433529">Annual Landfill Capacity Reports, 2010</xref>). Approximately two-fifths of municipal waste in the State of Illinois is either recycled or composed while the other three-fifths of solid waste is landfilled throughout Illinois and other jurisdictions in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11433529">Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Chicago’s high density residential buildings, which are included in the State’s 25% recycling goal, are defined as having ‘more than four residential units and which receives waste collection service from a private waste hauler’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11433529">Chicago City Code, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11433529">Schilling, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Passed in late 1993 and taking effect on 1 January 1995, the Chicago High Density Residential and Commercial Source Reduction and Recycling Ordinance requires the ‘owner of each high density [a building containing more than four residential units and which receives waste collection service from a private waste hauler] residential building shall provide to the residents of each building an effective recycling programme’. Each building owner is required to complete a Recycling Plan, detailing which recyclable items, from a list of potential items, will be recycled within a building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11433529">Chicago City Code, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, building owners provide educational outreach and reminders to new and existing tenants to remind them and reinforce recycling procedures. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11433529">Table 1</xref>, there is a point system in Chicago where building owners can either recycle more materials or utilize sustainable practices within their buildings to lessen their impact upon the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11433529">Chicago City Code, 2009</xref>). For example, building owners can utilize a mulching lawn mower and compost yard waste in lieu of allocating space for an additional recyclable material to be sorted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11433529">Chicago City Code, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>MFR recycling in case study city 2 – Boston, Massachusetts</title>
<p>The City of Boston established its recycling programme in 1990 and in 2002 added a specific ordinance that mandates recycling within ‘large residential buildings with more than six units’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>). These requirements were developed from ‘source reduction and recycling goals’ discussed within <italic>Massachusetts Solid Waste Master Plan, 1990</italic>, and updated in the Commonwealth’s <italic>Beyond 2000 Solid Waste Master Plan</italic>, which sets a baseline for requirements and activities by which jurisdictions of Massachusetts must abide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11433529">Cellucci, 2000</xref>). A December 2000 Memorandum by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs states that one of the ‘key new initiatives’ in the <italic>2000 Plan</italic> includes ‘pursuing multi-family residential [MFR] recycling legislation to ensure access;’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11433529">Cellucci, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The City of Boston’s Recycling Programme, §7-13.5, mandates that ‘at least twenty-eight (28%) percent by weight of the residential wastestream is recycled citywide during. . .1992; at least thirty-eight (38%) percent. . .[in] 1995; and at least fifty (50%) percent [in] 1998’ if appropriate facilities are secured by the City. In the case that the City is unable to acquire such facilities after a ‘diligent effort’, those percentages would be reduced to 20, 25, and 36% in 1998 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>). City code §7-13.7 stipulates the reporting requirements that must ‘includ[e] but not [be] limited to rates of participation and volume…attained for each district for the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>). The City of Boston has visible and legally adopted recycling requirements to constantly analyse and view their performance.</p>
<p>In 2002, MFR buildings in Boston were specifically included within Boston’s Recycling Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, it is not until a MFR resident requests that recycling be established within a certain building that an owner has thirty days to comply and ‘provide access to…recycling programmes and services of the City of Boston by installing and maintain an adequate number of recycling carts in a common area…and as close as practicable to the current waste/trash removal dumpsters or containers for the large residential building’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Collection of materials often occurs via ‘toters’, also known as recycling carts, which are usually 30–90 gallon plastic or metal containers, ‘clearly marked/and or identifiable as a container for recyclables’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>).

<title>MFR recycling in case study city 3 – Arlington, Virginia</title>
<p>Arlington, Virginia’s mandatory recycling programme began in September 1994 and has contained a MFR requirement since inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433529">Arlington County Code, 2007</xref>). When at least one tenant moves into a MFR building, the owner has thirty days to ‘establish a separate system from refuse collection for the collection of newspapers, glass bottles and jars, and metal food and beverage cans from all tenants of that property’, and, the owner must submit implementation plans to the City with reports every third year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433529">Arlington County Code, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There are approximately 600 MFR properties containing more than 58 000 housing units – about 57% of Arlington’s 210 000 population. These MFR properties are defined as a ‘building, or portion thereof, designed for occupancy by three (3) or more families living independently, or a town house not individually metered for water’; the owner of the building is the ‘responsible party’ in charge of recycling conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433529">Arlington County Code, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The Solid Waste Committee’s Recommendations within the June 2004 solid waste management plan (SWMP), Arlington suggested implementing ‘performance standards’ for MFR housing. This suggestion by the Committee is due to MFR ‘properties [being] contacted only once every three years’, and it is therefore both difficult to ‘determine the success’ or correct any inefficiencies without more frequent monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>). This lack of frequent contact, combined with less-stable variables in MFR housing, such as high turnover rates, gives MFR housing ‘the greatest opportunity for significantly increasing their recycling rate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Arlington’s most recent Solid Waste Management Plan from June 2004 ‘includes an analysis of and strategy for solid waste management activities in Arlington County [City of Arlington] for the next 20 years’, while aiming to ‘meet the Commonwealth’s [of Virginia]’ 25% recycling mandate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>). In 2002, Arlington already reached a 31.7% recycling rate and the City of Arlington ‘has established a set of voluntary goals’ that exceed Virginia’s mandate so that it can ‘be a leader in solid waste reduction and in recycling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>). Seeking to increase their recycling percentage rate in five or ten year intervals, Arlington’s future recycling goals are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11433529">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth of Virginia’s 25% goal is from 1990; and, in 2006 the code was changed to allow Solid Waste Planning Units (SWPUs) with a ‘population density. . .less than 100 persons per square mile. . .or if their civilian unemployment rate is 50% above the state-wide average’, to only have a recycling goal of 15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433529">Bryant and Paylor, 2009</xref>).

<title>Analysis: Chicago, Illinois multi-unit recycling study project [April 2009]</title>
<p>Throughout 2008, the Multi-Unit Recycling Study Project occurred in Chicago’s 46th Ward, and included twenty MFR buildings – all of which went through a prescriptive four-stage analysis with benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). It should be noted that five of the twenty buildings were chosen for ‘three comprehensive waste and recycling audits’, and those are the buildings for which detailed figures are available; the other fifteen buildings did go through the four-stage analysis, but ‘were assessed by interviews and outreach’ and do not contain the same amount of detailed data as the five heavily-studied buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). The four stages within the analysis are:</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X11433529" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 1: Baseline assessment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 2: Recycling plan and toolkit implementation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 3: Final assessment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 4: Ordinance recommendations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The three waste and recycling audits occurred as follows: audit #1 was performed during Stage 1, the baseline assessment stage; audit #2 was performed as a ‘revised baseline’ between Stages 1 and 2, because some of the barriers and other issues that were exposed during the baseline assessment stage had started to become instituted. Finally, audit #3 occurred during Stage 3, final assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Buildings ID1 and ID2 are both large MFR buildings containing 594 and 272 units, respectively; and buildings ID3A and ID3B have about 75 and 14 total condominium and apartment units, respectively. The fifth structure, building ID4 is a ‘small-sized rental building with nineteen units’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the Project, after the baseline (first) audit, the rationale for an updated (second) recycling percentage is to provide ‘a revised baseline recycling rate so that the effects of the recycling toolkit could be more accurately measured’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). Had the Project not taken audit #2 between stages 1 and 2 then the actual effects of the recycling toolkit would not be known and any increase or decrease in the amount of recycling may or may not have been attributed to the recycling toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Within audit #2, building ID1 went from a 6% to a 36% recycling rate, building ID2 from 0 to 1%, buildings ID3A and ID3B from 43 to 71%, building ID4 from 0 to 44%, and the overall recycling rates almost tripled from 4 to 11%, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433529">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>After audit #2, the development and implementation of the recycling plan and recycling toolkit commenced (Stage 2) – these activities sought to provide recourse for any of the barriers identified during Stage 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). The recycling plan ‘was developed to provide a roadmap for developing the recycling toolkit’ and ‘build upon the key findings and baseline data. . .and upon current best practices for recycling at [MFR] buildings’. The City’s goal per the report is a 12% recycling rate for MFR buildings and 37.5% overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, towards the end of Stage 2, the recycling toolkit was reviewed and commented upon by various stakeholders ‘including Alderman, the Chicago Recycling Coalition (CRC), [MFR] building residents, and property managers’. Afterwards, the buildings were given 4 months to implement the toolkit, Stage 3 was initiated with audit #3, the third and last audit for the five intensely-studied buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It appears perplexing at first why some MFR buildings improved over time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433529">Figure 2</xref>, due to increased awareness by owners and residents while others improved only to flounder when audit #3 was taken about 4 months later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). Chicago’s Department of the Environment investigated the reasoning behind each change in recycling rates for the five buildings:</p>
<p>Building ID1 contains trash chute rooms on each floor and recyclables are collected in two places within the building. After audit #1, procedures were clarified, and the recycling rate rose quite markedly in audit #2. The slight increase at Audit #3 was due to the owners unsuccessfully trying to bring convenience by switching the function of the trash chute to a recycling chute during some hours; however, this idea was terminated due to confusion, and the original programme was reinstated. The City of Chicago states that ‘there is only limited signage directing residents to the recycling collection points’, and items such as more flyers and posters could aid in increasing recycling even further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Building ID2 went from having no recycling programme to having a puerile system in place by audit #2. Subsequent to receiving the recycling toolkit, the building ‘used the Recycling Poster and Flyer to educate residents about recycling in the building’ which caused a ‘significant increase in the recycling rate’ to 18% at 4 months after implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Buildings ID3A and ID3B have a ‘property manager who actively promotes and supports the building’s recycling programme’ although the management use their own literature rather than the outreach provided by the City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the buildings’ increase from 43 to 71% between audit #1 and audit #2 is believable; but, what within audit #3 causes the buildings’ recycling rates to plummet to 28%? According to the City, this ‘can most likely be attributed to the third audit being conducted the day after the Thanksgiving Holiday, which resulted in significant increased food waste’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Building ID4 went from a non-existent recycling programme, to a rate of 44% after the ‘building implemented a source-separated single stream recycling programme’ during audit #2; yet, ‘the building did not use any recycling toolkit components’ after Project members had met with the building’s management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>). After a significant increase, building ID4 recanted to a paltry recycling rate of 3% at audit #3 which may be due to ‘high resident turnover between the last two audits’ and because the ‘building does not provide recycling education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis: Boston, Massachusetts 2009 annual [MFR recycling] report</title>
<p>In contrast to Chicago’s variable-intensive <italic>Survey</italic>, Boston’s 2009 Annual <italic>Report</italic> is smaller both in breadth and the information it analyses. Owners of buildings containing seven or more units are required to provide recycling. In order to ‘evaluate the effectiveness of the recycling programmes of the City of Boston and [for] large residential building[s]. . .the Department shall annually prepare a report regarding. . .the tonnage of recycled materials collected. . .specifically and separately detail[ing] the recycled tonnage collected from large residential buildings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">City of Boston Municipal Code, 2008</xref>). Boston’s Public Works Department contracts recycle haulers to collect recyclables from MFR units instead of building owners independently paying haulers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The City of Boston analyses its recycling programme in a peculiar manner. MFR building owners need to provide recycling when at least one tenant requests that it be installed; and, it is only thereafter that the MFR Ordinance takes effect. The Public Works Department bases its ‘success’ upon the number of ‘buildings [that] had either a tenant request for recycling services or had already been visited by [the] Recycling [Department]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>). At the close of 2008, ‘only 68 [buildings] remained without recycling programmes’, meaning that ‘Recycling had evaluated 632 – a success rate of 90%’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>). However, this rationale of thinking is flawed in many aspects:</p>
<p>The <italic>Report</italic> does not elaborate as to whether the 700 MFR buildings that had tenant requests for recycling or were visited by recycling reflect all MFR dwellings that would be genuinely applicable under the code. While important to determine what can be implemented, it is misleading that the actual ‘success rate’ is the success rate of the Recycling Department in evaluating a building’s potential to have recycling instituted.</p>
<p>Positively, Boston does send ‘violation letters’ to MFR building owners that are not abiding by Boston’s recycling ordinances. These letters are furnished by the Inspectional Services Department and cause ‘[m]ost building owners [to] respond’, and effectively enables the City to expand the number of properties actively recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>). Additionally, due to single-stream recycling expanding into parts of the City, buildings that had been exempt due to storage limitations are now obliged to participate via clear plastic bags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Report</italic> further states that the purpose of the Recycling Ordinance is for all residents to have access to recycling, but even though it specifically states how to ‘evaluate the effectiveness of the recycling programme’ the <italic>Report</italic> says that what the Ordinance asks for does ‘not provide a measure for recycling access for two reasons’. The reasons are that ‘tonnage from only large buildings is not available’ due to trucking routes, and the second reason is because ‘providing access does not necessarily or immediately increase tons recycled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433529">Boston City Code, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In other words, it appears that the City of Boston within its <italic>Report</italic> is ignoring the requirements by which it is bound. Boston offers an inadequate rationale as to why the information is not attainable; and, while ‘recycling of household waste includes many aspects’ and the ‘perception of what is important depends on the stakeholder’, the city is not following the instructions of the recycling ordinance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11433529">Dahlén and Lagerkvist, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis: Arlington, Virginia multi-family and commercial solid waste and recycling survey findings</title>
<p>Commissioning a report in 2004–2005, the Ecodata, Incorporated study was prepared for the Department of Environmental Services (DES) and the Environmental Policy Solid Waste Bureau, which sought ‘to determine how waste is being managed in multi-family’ residential housing within Arlington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11433529">Stevens, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 91 MFR responses gained from the survey, 25.3% of them were from high-rise MFR whereas the remaining 74.7% were from low-rise MFR buildings. Arlington’s MFR units have a great diversity of collection characteristics – but the single item which stands out as a trend for the city is that almost all MFR housing utilize a wheeled cart in their recycling process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11433529">Stevens, 2005</xref>). These ‘toter’ types of recyclable materials are at the scale of individual households and may reinforce the finding that the majority of the MFR survey respondents did not live in high-rise buildings – where toters would probably be less useful.</p>
<p>It is curious that not all MFR buildings within Arlington adhere to the rule requiring the recycling of ‘two or more commodities’, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11433529">Stevens, 2005</xref>). Regulation and enforcement, which is stipulated in §10-34 of Arlington’s Article IV Recycling Code, can fine owners of non-complying complexes up to US$300 per day; nonetheless, this enforcement does not appear to have been utilized to-date according to information contained within the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The final diversion percentage – 12.5% for MFR housing – indicates that approximately one-eighth of all refuse is recycled, which would not meet the state’s 25% first tier diversion rate nor even the less strict second tier requirement of 15% diversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433529">Bryant and Paylor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11433529">Stevens, 2005</xref>). Therefore, one can deduce that other forms of recycling counterbalance Arlington’s poor MFR diversion rate, since the city rate has been above 31% and is forecasted to increase in the coming years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11433529">Virginia Department of Environmental Services, 2004</xref>). In other words, Arlington’s MFR recycling programme is actually a burden upon the recycling programme as a whole due to its poor diversion rate.</p>
<p>A last item to consider within the Arlington recycling programme analysis is its cost– and if there are any incentives to recycle rather than throwing an item into the trash receptacle. Within the <italic>Survey</italic> it was revealed that approximately 64% of the fees paid by MFR housing and commercial services cover both the solid waste and recycling services with fees paid per cubic yard of pickup. The survey does not elaborate whether the fee charged of cubic yards of recyclable material collected is charged at a lower rate than mixed refuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11433529">Stevens, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>Within Chicago’s Project, there are key items to analyse, even though the sample size is limited. One central concept is the act of ‘prompting’ or notification of property owners and management about the recycling programme. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433529">Figure 2</xref>, the increase in recycling rates post-communication from the city caused a 175% increase even though the aforementioned Ann Arbor study suggested that some forms of prompting ‘did not significantly improve recycling behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11433529">DeYoung et al., 1995</xref>). It is important to note that the Chicago study evaluated some buildings that did not recycle at all, whereas the Ann Arbor study suggests an evaluation of an established system already in place. The utilization of a baseline approach to evaluate goals gives a benchmark from which to improve recycling diversion. This method could be utilized in Baltimore City to find where the strengths and weaknesses are, similarly to Chicago’s discovery that some building owners were oblivious to many recycling requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433529">City of Chicago Department of the Environment, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In Boston, some of the favourable outcomes of the <italic>Report</italic> found that the city’s flexibility with constrained areas – such as the clear plastic bag approach for buildings with no common area for recycling – illustrates adaptability to several different dwelling arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433529">Annual Report [Boston], 2009</xref>). This strategy can be duplicated in Baltimore City’s future recycling requirements, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X11433529">Table 3</xref>, to ensure compliance across the city in terms of accessibility and ability to recycle. As a lessons-learned approach from Boston, Baltimore City can hold a responsible party liable for not following laws, such as performing required annual audits.</p>

<p>Initiation of a future Baltimore City recycling programme should be straightforward and not contain the seemingly strange Boston qualification that residents ask for recycling within an MFR building before an owner is required to provide such an area. Perhaps a better approach would be similar to Arlington’s where an owner has a certain amount of time after the first tenant moves in to institute recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433529">Arlington County Code, 2007</xref>). To maintain compliance, the USEPA suggests ‘mandatory participation, with sanctions available to local governments for enforcement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X11433529">USEPA, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Arlington and Boston mention scale in terms of equating the collection method of recycling to the population served. Toters could be a successful component to a future Baltimore City recycling programme by offering a smaller-sized and easily transportable means to recycle for building owners and residents alike. However, a tactic utilized by Arlington that Baltimore should avoid is their “separate system” of separating different types of recyclable material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433529">Arlington County Code, 2007</xref>). Thus any Baltimore City programme should require MFR building owners to subscribe to haulers that collect via a single-stream – as Baltimore City currently does for non-MFR residences.</p>
<p>What effect would a new ordinance in Baltimore City have upon new and existing buildings? While studies have shown that adequate indoor space is essential for a successful recycling programme, how does one find space to accomplish this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433529">Ando and Gosselin, 2005</xref>)? While there are several ways to address the issue from an architectural, procedural, and managerial viewpoint, a requirement of a new recycling programme should be equal access to mixed-refuse and recycling opportunities. While buildings are different, people can be discouraged from recycling when the effort to recycle is greater than the effort needed to dispose of mixed-refuse – as evidenced in the London and Portland studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11433529">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11433529">Farrell, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Baltimore City can sincerely pursue MFR recycling by initiating the programme requirements and adhering to the policies illustrated within <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11433529">Table 3</xref>. These policies are derived from the literature review and case studies. The 40% diversion rate exceeds the USEPA’s standard of a ‘successful’ MFR diversion rate, but is a goal to strive towards and a goal that has been surpassed by some of the case study examples within this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433529">Ando and Gosselin, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0734242X11433529">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study did not delve into the advantages and complexities of pay-as-you-go mixed-refuse and recycling systems nor the differences in collection rates between municipal versus private or contractually collected recycling programmes and their employees. While differences of diversion rates have been noted in collection procedures, Baltimore City residents do not typically pay for mixed-refuse or recycling collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X11433529">USEPA, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, examination of literature related to goal-setting regarding diversion rates was not examined within this study. Lastly, the author was a resident of low-rise and high-rise MFR buildings in Baltimore City from 2006–2010, and has endeavoured to separate any personal bias from the content of this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Exploration and research into a successful MFR Recycling Programme for Baltimore City investigates how several other cities within the United States are managing their recyclable materials – some are successful and attain ‘over 40% recycling of household waste [while] others as little as 1%’ (Barr and Gilg, 2005). While Baltimore City’s unique recycling history has undoubtedly aided the process toward a user-friendly, semi all-inclusive system, its current policies toward excluding MFR residents from participating can be corrected via the implementation of the items illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X11433529">Table 3</xref>. With the incorporation of elements within programme, accessibility, and informing and self-review, these tools can aid in the creation of a future successful MFR Recycling programme. This programme will effectively allow all Baltimore City residents to participate, enjoy the convenience of, and take pride within a successfully implemented MFR recycling programme.</p>
