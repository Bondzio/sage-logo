<abstract>
<p>Dhaka’s community-based decentralized composting (DCDC) is a successful demonstration of solid waste management by adopting low-cost technology, local resources community participation and partnerships among the various actors involved. This paper attempts to understand the model, necessary conditions, strategies and their priorities to replicate DCDC in the other developing cities of Asia. Thirteen strategies required for its replication are identified and assessed based on various criteria, namely transferability, longevity, economic viability, adaptation and also overall replication. Priority setting by multi-criteria analysis by applying analytic hierarchy process revealed that immediate transferability without long-term and economic viability consideration is not advisable as this would result in unsustainable replication of DCDC. Based on the analysis, measures to ensure the product quality control; partnership among stakeholders (public–private–community); strategies to achieve better involvement of the private sector in solid waste management (entrepreneurship in approach); simple and low-cost technology; and strategies to provide an effective interface among the complementing sectors are identified as important strategies for its replication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dhaka’s community-based decentralized composting (DCDC) model was developed by <italic>Waste Concern</italic>, a non-governmental organization, active in environmental services and particularly in solid waste management in Bangladesh, with its head office in Dhaka. The project, which involved local people, local technology and also multi-stakeholder partnerships, is regarded as innovative urban practice in solid waste management. However, similar attempts in other cities of South Asia have failed due to various reasons such as poor quality compost, poor marketability of compost and poor returns on the investment. With its widespread success in Bangladesh, DCDC has been identified as a potential alternative for solid waste management in developing cities of this region. However, the policy/decision makers have no idea about where to put more emphasis and the policy measures that are required to successfully replicate DCDC in their respective cities.</p>
<p>Impacts assessment has become mandatory for all development projects and for a complete assessment it is argued that alternatives need to be analysed, based on multiple criteria instead of any single criterion. Multi-criteria assessment of alternative options brings out the comprehensive potential of the alternatives and makes the comparison and selection easy for policy/decision makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X10380116">Yedla and Shrestha, 2003</xref>). Such an approach provides scope for comprehensive assessment covering inter- and intra-sector impacts. Thus, this approach can be effectively applied in assessing the replication of successful practices in environmental management. Efforts have been made in this study to present complete details of this innovative and successful process and also identify, analyse and prioritize important elements for its successful replication in other developing cities in Asia, based on criteria such as immediate transferability, longevity, economic viability and adaptability.</p>

<title>Solid waste management in Dhaka, Bangladesh</title>
<p>Dhaka city generates 3000–3500 tons of solid waste every day whose composition is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X10380116">Figure 1</xref>. Only 42% of the waste is collected by the Conservancy Department of Dhaka Municipality (DCC) leaving the rest on roadsides, drains and low-lying areas. Only 22% of the urban poor have access to municipal waste collection bins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X10380116">World Bank, 1998</xref>). The compostable fraction dominates Dhaka’s municipal solid waste (MSW) with almost 80% of its solid waste compostable.</p>

<p>DCC, the formal sector, collects ‘mixed’ waste from community bins and transports it in uncovered and dumper trucks of capacity varying between 1.5 and 5 tons and disposes it in an open area. DCC spends as much as Tk. 2045 to dispose a ton of waste every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X10380116">Enayetullah, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X10380116">DOE, <italic>Waste Concern</italic> and ITN-BUET, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X10380116">Zurbrugg et al., 2005</xref>). However, due to lack of proper coordination and poor stakeholder participation and partnerships the efficiency of solid waste management is at its worst and needs immediate attention from the various actors involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X10380116">JICA, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the formal collection and disposal by DCC, there are 120 000 rag pickers involved in recycling of waste in the city retrieving about 15% of the waste generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X10380116">GOB-ADB, 1996</xref>). Rag picking activity can be found at different stages of waste management such as collection bins, transfer stations and dump sites. It has been reported that the value of such retrieved material is around 2.63 million US$ every year which indicates the important role of the informal sector in waste management in Dhaka. However, these rag pickers – mostly women and children – retrieve only inorganic material (including waste paper), which has a direct economic value and leave behind the organic and degradable garbage which has no direct market value. Adding another dimension to the complication, the land availability in DCC is very scarce and the existing dump sites are close to their capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10380116">World Bank, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Dhaka model community-based decentralized composting</title>
<p>Solutions, for their short and long term success need to be based on local conditions, local strengths and weaknesses. They should use the local resources and conditions to their favour. In the developing Asian cities, the conditions of high organic content in waste, prevalence of poverty, the dominant presence of the informal sector, scope for organic farming (as they are mostly agriculture-based economies), and cities that have difficulty in introducing efficiency and in financing civil services, favour the community-based decentralized composting approach to manage municipal solid waste. <italic>Waste Concern</italic>, for the first time in Dhaka, had initiated a community-based decentralised composting project at Section-2, Mirpur, Dhaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X10380116">Sinha and Enayetullah, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10380116">UNESCAP, 2004</xref>). This model involved partnerships among civil societies, the informal sector, the private sector and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10380116">Figure 2</xref> presents the multi-faceted approach taken up by <italic>Waste Concern</italic>.

<sec id="section4-0734242X10380116">
<title>Community mobilization for waste collection</title>
<p>Community participation is an essential element in this practice and <italic>Waste Concern</italic>, before initiating the project, had conducted a survey in the neighborhood of the Mirpur site to determine the opinion of the local population on the problems of waste management and their willingness to participate and contribute (WTP) in any development programme related to waste management. The majority of the respondents (&gt;80%) have indicated displeasure with the existing waste management run by DCC and showed willingness to contribute (Tk 15–16 per month) towards door-to-door collection. The community was mobilized to separate their waste into wet and dry, which was collected by waste pickers supported by <italic>Waste Concern</italic>. This segregated waste was used for composting. A waste collection fee is collected from the households on a voluntary basis and used to provide salaries for the workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10380116">UNESCAP, 2004</xref>). Sale of the inorganic recyclable materials by the workers gave them additional income.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734242X10380116">
<title>Identification of appropriate technology</title>
<p><italic>Waste Concern</italic> had previously conducted experimental runs to identify a suitable method of composting by trying out the ‘Chinese covered pile system’ and the ‘Indonesian windrow technique’. It was found that odour control was effective in the case of the Indonesian method and also it produced better quality compost in comparison with the Chinese method. Hence, <italic>Waste Concern</italic> adopted the Indonesian windrow technique in their demonstration plant in Mirpur. Details of the composting process, the technical details and composition of the compost under the two methods can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X10380116">Enayetullah and Sinha (1999a)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X10380116">
<title>Establishment of a demonstration unit</title>
<p><italic>Waste Concern</italic> established a 3-ton capacity composting unit at Mirpur, which acted as a demonstration plant. It was used to establish the process and also provide training to various groups, who participated subsequently in this decentralized approach to waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X10380116">Enayetullah and Sinha, 1999b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734242X10380116">
<title>Marketing strategies for compost</title>
<p><italic>Waste Concern</italic> had their compost tested by the National Laboratories of Soil Science and the quality was found to be better than that of the organic compost available on the international market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X10380116">Enayetullah and Sinha, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X10380116">Zurbrugg et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Waste Concern</italic> signed a partnership agreement with Pam Agro Industries – a fertilizer marketing company – to sell all the compost produced in different community-based composting plants in Dhaka. This company purchases the bulk of the compost produced by <italic>Waste Concern</italic> at Tk 2.5 kg<sup>−1</sup>, enriches it to meet the needs of different crops and, with the help of their existing network of fertilizer and pesticides dealers, markets the product at Tk 5 kg<sup>−1</sup>. This makes the model successful as the compost, if not accepted by the farmers, becomes solid waste by itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X10380116">
<title>Partnerships and sharing of benefits among actors</title>
<p>Since the beginning of the project in 1995 <italic>Waste Concern</italic> has adopted partnerships with a number of actors involved in solid waste management. The partnerships have been in different clusters linking the public sector (UNEP, Government of Bangladesh, Public Works Department, Dhaka City Corporation, Lions Club), the private sector (<italic>Waste Concern</italic>, Map and Alpha Agro Ltd.) and the community (households and rag pickers). Equitable benefit sharing is one among many important factors behind the success of this innovative urban practice in the capital city of Bangladesh. A list of the actors involved, their actions and the benefits shared are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10380116">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Financial viability of DCDC</title>
<p>Community-based decentralized composting in Dhaka was found to be financially viable on both short- and long-terms application. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X10380116">Table 2</xref> presents the fixed and variable costs involved in a 3-ton capacity composting plant at Mirpur (demonstration plant) in Dhaka (More details on this can be obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10380116">UNESCAP (2004)</xref>). With house-to-house collection charges and the value of the compost adding up to 14 805 US$ (from compost and house-to-house waste collection charges), the net annual earning from the project, excluding the land value was reported to be 4598 US$ with a payback period of 23 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10380116">UNESCAP, 2004</xref>). Other benefits of DCDC include inter-sectoral impacts such as land savings and reduced waste disposal cost for the city corporation; empowerment of women and the urban poor; employment generation and improved community participation; increased crop yield and soil quality; impact on agriculture enterprise; impact on agriculture and trade policies; impact on fertilizer industries and need for pricing regulation; and impact of fuel pricing policies.

<title>Replication</title>
<p>With its successful demonstration and replication in and around Dhaka, DCDC has the potential to serve cities in other Asian countries. The key factors contributing to its success and the criteria for its replication based on which this method can be assessed for its replication needs to be identified.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734242X10380116">
<title>Strategies needed for the replication of DCDC in the other developing cities in Asia</title>
<p>Based on the analysis presented in the previous sections, an assessment study conducted by the author in Dhaka during September 2004 and also personal interviews conducted with various actors involved in the whole process of DCDC the following strategies have been identified as key measures for the replication of DCDC in the other developing cities of Asia.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X10380116" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Appropriate technology and its adaptation to the local needs (M1) – The technology has to be appropriate and suitable to the local conditions. Need for higher capital investments dampen the initiative and burden the progress with a set of constraints such as the need to maintain a certain scale of operation irrespective of the conditions, the need for the expertise in handling the equipment and so on.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Utilization of local human resources for O&amp;M (M2) – DCDC is a labour intensive and a local initiative. It can only be sustained when it can become an integral part of the community. Utilization of local human resources in its operation and maintenance is the key to achieve such integration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Public–private–community partnership and appropriate risk sharing (M3) – Partnerships not only enhance the investment and efficiency but also provide a feeling of ownership to all important actors – community, public and private sector in the present case. Moreover, partnership provides the continuity in the process chain. Hence, partnership is an essential strategy for DCDC and its replication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Community participation (social capital) (M4) – Involvement of community and its active participation is essential for the success of this practice. Waste segregation is the key without which this process could be another case of failure; community participation is important in achieving this.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Need for championing organization (Ambassador) (M5) – Initiatives such as DCDC need a persistent effort and there is a need for a championing organization or ambassador to achieve such continuity in efforts. Many such initiatives in South Asia have failed due to lack of a championing organization. Thus ambassadors are important to make a successful implementation of DCDC.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach) (M6) – Embedded entrepreneurship and a business plan have been identified as among the most important strategies to replicate DCDC in other developing cities of Asia. DCDC has a business approach which essentially embedded the ‘market character’ within it and that has created much needed ‘efficiency’ in the system. Hence, for better replication of DCDC in other cities it is essential to examine what are the strategies to achieve better involvement of the private sector in solid waste management.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Product quality control (M7) – More than its production, marketing of the compost generated in this process is a major challenge and its disposal, in the long term perspective, depends on its quality and acceptability in the market. Hence, measures are needed to ensure the product quality control.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sustainable benefits sharing (M8) – As DCDC has many actors involved, sustainable benefit sharing is important to maintain the equity and balance in the process to enable the operation to be sustained in the longer run.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regulatory framework to promote partnerships (M9) – Multi-stakeholder partnership is an essential strategy for DCDC and hence, the government needs to develop a regulatory framework to initiate and execute such partnerships. In Asia, the absence of such regulations is a major bottleneck which hampers the building of such partnerships.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identification of other complementing sectors (organic and inorganic) and designing the interface between them (M10) – Complete execution of DCDC deals with many sectors, namely the formal waste management department, informal sector, recycling industry, fertilizer industry, pesticides marketing agencies and farmers (the end users). Unless these interacting sectors complement each other, there is a possibility of an unsustainable flow of material. Hence, providing a platform where these complementing sectors can interact is an important aspect to consider when attempting to replicate this process in other cities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Demand-supply dynamics (M11) – Assessment of demand–supply dynamics for the compost generated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pricing policies (compost, fertilizers and fuels) and regulation of compost price (M12)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Macro-economic impacts (e.g. employment generation, support to the economy say by helping to achieve better recycling, more agricultural productivity) (M13).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Among the list of measures some would be very important and indispensable whereas others may be less important, and their importance level would depend on the criteria of measure. Hence, to identify the most important strategies and prioritize them one has to undertake multi-criteria analysis. The following section presents one such attempt to prioritize these strategies.</p>

<sec id="section13-0734242X10380116">
<title>Multi-criteria approach to prioritization – development of multi-criteria framework</title>
<p>In this section the previously identified strategies are ranked based on a systematic analysis using multiple criteria process and by adopting analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach, which was developed by Thomas L. Saaty during the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10380116">Saaty, 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section14-0734242X10380116">
<title>Analytic hierarchy process</title>
<p>For priority setting based on qualitative and or quantitative criteria, AHP was found to be one of the most widely applied methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X10380116">Ramanathan and Ganesh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X10380116">Yedla and Shrestha, 2003</xref>) as it combines a deductive approach and a systems approach to resolve problems into one integrated logical framework. The three guiding principles in AHP are decomposition, comparative judgment and synthesis of priorities. This simple, practical, systematic and effective method has been widely used for conducting exercises such as analysis of energy planning, distribution of resources planning, conflict resolution, selection of projects, ranking of barriers and selection of alternative choices, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X10380116">Yedla and Shrestha, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X10380116">Yedla, 2010</xref>). The fundamental principle of AHP is the ‘pair-wise comparison of different variables which are given numerical values for their subjective judgments on relative importance of each of the variable following a hierarchy and coming out with assigning relative weight to those variables’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10380116">Saaty, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Application of AHP-based multi-criteria approach to replication of DCDC</title>
<p>Questionnaire survey was conducted to collect responses from the managing directors of <italic>Waste Concern</italic> and an environmental expert and a common matrix was arrived at by following simple arithmetic method of group aggregation.</p>
<p>From the analysis it is clear that ‘economic viability’ was chosen as the most important criteria (score of 0.53 over a maximum of 1) to attempt the replication of DCDC in other developing cities in Asia. It is followed by ‘adaptability’ (0.23) and ‘longevity’ (0.21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X10380116">Figure A2</xref>, shown in Appendix). Thus, any attempt to replicate DCDC should not go by the immediate transferability criteria but also look for economic viability and long-term sustainability of the project. All 13 strategies identified in the previous section are prioritized based on each of the four criteria individually. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X10380116">Appendix Figures A3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0734242X10380116">A6</xref> present these results. Finally rankings based on various criteria are aggregated to present an overall priorities matrix. Based on their ranking, the measures are presented as a primary set and a secondary set.</p>
<sec id="section17-0734242X10380116">
<title>Transferability</title>
<p>Based on the criteria of <italic>Transferability</italic> the ‘Need for a champion organization (ambassador) (M5) was chosen as the most important measure to replicate DCDC. It is an understandable argument that, such innovative practices need persistent efforts to make the project a reality. It has been proved in many cases that the lack of a champion organization resulted in the collapse of the effort after the initial start up. Hence, it is important to have a champion organization for the immediate transferability of DCDC. Following this, ‘Public–private–community partnerships and appropriate risk sharing’ (M3), ‘Product quality control’ (M7) and ‘Appropriate technology and its adaptation to the local needs’ (M1) were chosen as important measures to achieve immediate replication of DCDC. As a next tier of important measures, ‘Embedded business plan’ (M6), ‘Community participation’ (M4) and ‘Utilization of local human resources for O&amp;M’ (M2) were chosen.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that the replication of DCDC can be achieved on immediate scale even if measures such as sustainable benefit sharing, complementing with other sectors, regulatory frameworks, pricing control policies and assessment of macro-economic impacts are not considered. However, this would question the long-term success of such replication. It can be concluded from this prioritization that DCDC can be replicated even in cities where such institutions (regulatory frameworks, pricing regulations and so on.) do not exist. But any such replication might have long-term uncertainties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0734242X10380116">
<title>Longevity</title>
<p>As a proactive approach DCDC needs to be sustainable in the longer run and needs certain and specific measures to achieve sustainable replication of this innovative practice on a long-term basis. The analysis shows that ‘Public–private–community partnership and appropriate risk sharing’ (M3) is the key for the replication of this ‘innovative urban practice’ for its long-term application. It is followed by ‘Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach)’ (M6), ‘Product quality control’ (M7) and ‘Appropriate technology and its adaptation to the local needs’ (M1) in their order of importance.</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe the fact that among the primary set of measures, ‘Appropriate technology’ (M1), ‘Public–private–community partnership and appropriate risk sharing’ (M3) and ‘Product quality control’ (M7) are the common measures both for immediate and long-term replication of DCDC. For long-term replication ‘Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach)’ (M6) was found to be one of the most important measure whereas for immediate replication it was the ‘Need for championing organization (ambassador)’ (M5) that was given top priority. Embedded business plan is the uniqueness in DCDC compared to other similar efforts in other cities of South Asia such as Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai. Waste cannot be handled successfully by somebody ‘other than a State or State owned body’ unless it introduces entrepreneurship in the approach. This analysis endorses such a general conception. As a general conclusion it can be said that ‘community-based decentralized composting needs “brand ambassadors and a championing organization” for its immediate replication whereas for long-term sustainability it is essential to have an “embedded business plan”’.</p>
<p>Among the secondary set of measures, ‘Community participation (social capital)’ (M4) is as critical as ‘Utilization of local human resources for O&amp;M’ (M2) for immediate replication and ‘Identification of other complementing sectors (organic and inorganic) and designing the interface between them’ (M10), and ‘Demand-supply dynamics’ (M11) for long-term application. As a community-based approach it is essential to have community participation irrespective of its replication term. For a long-term application of this innovative method of DCDC it is essential to find the channel through which the product can be effectively used for long term. Otherwise it would have problems with disposal of the product. Hence it is important to identify various complementing sectors and develop a proper interface among them. As a general conclusion it can be said that ‘utilization of local resources’ is important for immediate replication whereas ‘identifying the other complementing sectors and designing interface among them’ is important for long-term sustainability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0734242X10380116">
<title>Economic viability</title>
<p>‘Product quality control’ (M7) was chosen as the most important measure to achieve economic viability of the replication of DCDC in other Asian cities. It is followed by other measures viz. ‘Public–private–community partnership and appropriate risk sharing’ (M3), ‘Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach)’ (M6), ‘Appropriate technology and its adaptation to the local needs’ (M1) and ‘Identification of other complementing sectors (organic and inorganic) and designing the interface between them’ (M10) in the order of their importance.</p>
<p>Quality of the product commands the market and based on that argument it should be an essential element for the economic viability. Business plan, partnership and suitable technology are important to achieve good chain for the product in the market. However, it is also important to identify the complementing sector and design an affective interface to achieve economic viability of DCDC replication. Although it was also identified as an important element for the long term replication, its importance is substantially high for its economic viability.</p>
<p>Unlike the other two criteria, economic viability has a different set of secondary measures for the successful replication of DCDC. It was found that ‘Utilization of local human resources for O&amp;M’ (M2) is the most important secondary level measure followed by ‘Sustainable benefits sharing’ (M8), ‘Demand-supply dynamics’ (M11), ‘Pricing policies (compost, fertilizers and fuels) and regulation of compost price’ (M12), in their order of importance. As it is a community-based decentralized approach, utilization of local resources holds the key for its economic success. Unsustainable sharing of benefits would shift the advantage to one side triggering the failure of this innovative practice. Hence sustainable benefit sharing is also important.</p>
<p>Markets are driven by demand and supply dynamics and decentralized compost generation is not an exception. Hence, for its economic viability the actors have to give consideration for the demand-supply dynamics. It is indeed interesting to see the ‘pricing regulation’ picked up as an important measure for the economic viability of DCDC. At present there are no traces of this regulation in Dhaka. However, from this analysis it is apparent that ‘pricing regulation on compost’ is important not only for long-term application but also for its economic viability. As a general conclusion it can be said that ‘product quality control’ is important not only for the long-term sustainability of this practice but also for its economic viability. As in the case of long-term application, for economic viability of this project it is essential to have ‘embedded business plan’ along with ‘sustainable benefits sharing’ and ‘pricing policies’ for the compost in the market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0734242X10380116">
<title>Adaptability (reducing resistance)</title>
<p>Among the primary set of measures to reduce resistance for the replication of DCDC ‘Product quality control’ (M7) was chosen as the most important measure followed by ‘Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach)’ (M6). A distinct point is that product quality control was chosen as a sole and most important factor to reduce the resistance of replication of DCDC. As explained earlier, most of the similar efforts have approached this practice as an isolated effort without any business approach, which finally led them to failure. Hence, it is the lack of product quality and entrepreneurship in approach which makes the replication of DCDC difficult and measures to improve these two would provide a better adaptability for DCDC.</p>
<p>Among the set of secondary measures both ‘Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach)’ (M5) and ‘Regulatory framework to promote partnerships’ (M9) were selected as important. A lack of regulation to promote partnership is a major barrier to the introduction of the private sector into the service sector of environmental goods. Hence, to reduce the resistance for the replication of such innovative measures as DCDC it is essential to have a regulatory framework to support partnerships among various important actors.</p>
<p>All the priorities are aggregated into ‘overall priorities’ based on a bottom-up approach using the AHP technique which was executed using <italic>Expert Choice</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0734242X10380116">
<title>Overall priorities</title>
<p>Based on overall priority determination it was found that ‘Product quality control’ (M7) was the most important measure followed by ‘Public–private–community partnership and appropriate risk sharing’ (M3), ‘Embedded business plan (entrepreneurship in the approach)’ (M6), ‘Appropriate technology and its adaptation to the local needs’ (M1) and ‘Identification of other complementing sectors (organic and inorganic) and designing the interface between them’ (M10) in their order of importance.</p>
<p>Apart from the ‘product quality control’, business approach and multi-stakeholder partnership which are ‘Business measures’, proper technology adoption and providing interface among complementing sectors was found to be the key for sustainable replication of DCDC which meets important criteria, namely longevity and economic viability.

<title>Policy recommendations and conclusions</title>
<p>This model was accomplished with a fair degree of success and has been sustained for a long time and spread to the other areas within Dhaka and also other cities in Bangladesh. Based on the present analysis it appears that attempting an immediate transferability of this model without long-term and economic viability consideration is not advised as this would result in unsustainable replication of this practice. The following list presents a few more recommendations.</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X10380116" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>From the analysis it was found that <italic>product quality control</italic> was one of the most important measures to ensure successful and sustainable replication. More than its production, the disposal of compost is a major challenge and that, in the longer term perspective, depends on its quality and acceptability in the market. Hence, measures are needed to ensure the maintenance of product quality control. <italic>Waste Concern</italic> has taken special care in monitoring compost throughout its production. The quality of compost is tested by established national laboratories to win the confidence of the private sector company who markets it and also the end user (farmers in this case). Cultivation plots are employed to demonstrate the quality of the compost. Such efforts are very important to maintain the quality of compost and keep the trust of farmers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multi-stakeholder partnerships are the new trends in Asia in providing or improving the environmental services. This analysis endorses that trend by identifying the measures to achieve <italic>public–private–community partnership</italic> as one of the most important aspect in replicating this innovative composting practice. Partnerships not only enhance the investment possibilities but also improve the systemic efficiency which is the key for the provision of environmental services.Partnerships also provide a feel of ownership equally to all stakeholders. Moreover, partnership provides the continuity in process chain. For instance, the composting process has different steps such as segregated waste collection, transportation, composting, enrichment to meet plant needs, marketing of compost, application of compost in agriculture and disposal of the inorganic/inert material in dump site. This chain involves various actors including households, rag pickers from the informal sector, NGOs, private sector, farmers and the government department. Excluding any of these actors would create a gap and dampens the flow. Such thing essentially leads to the failure of the system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Embedded entrepreneurship and business plan</italic> has been identified as one of the most important replication strategies. Hence, for better replication of DCDC it is essential to examine what are the strategies to achieve better involvement of the private sector in solid waste management.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>technology has to be appropriate</italic> and suitable to the local conditions. A need for higher capital investments dampen the initiative and burden the progress with set of constraints such as the need to maintain a certain scale of operation irrespective of the conditions, expertise in handling the equipment and so on. Hence, a simple and low-cost technology is preferred for a better replication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complete execution of DCDC deals with many sectors, namely the formal waste management department, informal sector, recycling industry, fertilizer industry, pesticides marketing agencies and farmers. Hence, <italic>interfacing complementing sectors</italic> has been chosen as one of the most important aspects for replication. Unless these interacting sectors complement each other, there is a possibility of an unsustainable flow of material. For instance, if agriculture farmers and the dealers do not support the compost generated from waste, instead of managing the waste, it would add to the problem with the compost produced being left in piles in the back yard of the composting plant. This is particularly important for the long-term replication of DCDC.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section23-0734242X10380116">
<title>Determinants of DCDC application and the limitations</title>
<p>As for any other innovations DCDC also has limitations or pre-conditions for its implementation. Dhaka’s community-based decentralized composting is a labour-intensive (management of 3 tons of waste would need 16 workers) and less capital-intensive option (fixed cost for a 3-ton unit is as low as 8800 US$ with a relatively shorter pay back period of 23 months) mostly suitable for cities with less systemic efficiency in waste management, lack of land for landfilling, considerable activity of rag picking by the informal sector and the existence of an urban poor population which derives a living from scavenging activity.</p>
<p>Agriculture is a major complementing sector for DCDC. There should be enough demand for the compost generated and also acceptability. Major agriculture activity is a pre-condition for DCDC with an existing network of agriculture commodity distributors which provides a potential channel for waste-derived compost to reach the farmers. These are the pre-requisite socio-economical conditions, apart from the required atmospheric conditions, for the application of DCDC.</p>
