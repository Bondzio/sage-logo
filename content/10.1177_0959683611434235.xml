<abstract>
<p>Landscape dynamics in the periglacial belt of a high mountain Mediterranean environment is a process of rapid evolution but complex reconstruction. Following this purpose, in this paper we discuss data from two sources concerning the past evolution of the present-day periglacial environment in the Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula): mountain lake sediments and documentary sources. La Mosca lake sedimentary record provides information about the palaeocological evolution in the Mulhacén cirque over the last three millennia, while documentary sources enable us to reconstruct the landscape evolution in the high lands of this massif over the last eight centuries. During the late Holocene cold and wet phases have favoured the activity of geomorphic processes, with ephemeral development of glaciers in the highest northern cirques, abundance of late-lying snow patches and a decrease of the vegetation cover in the highest catchments. By contrast, warm periods have been more conducive to geomorphic stability, with an extension of the vegetation grass cover, but without glaciers and with a lower density of snow patches in summer. The comparison of the palaeocological evolution and associated palaeoclimatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada with other regional proxies shows evidence of the moderate sensitivity of the geomorphological processes occurring in the massif during the late Holocene with respect to the climate variability prevailing in the Iberian Peninsula and neighbouring areas. According to lake sedimentary records, the ‘Little Ice Age’ has been the coldest period during the late Holocene. Historical sources suggest a temperature increase of 0.93°C since the middle of the 19th century.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Periglacial and paraglacial (cold-climate) environments, located outside the margins of past and present ice sheets but responding to similar climate forcings, are key to identifying climate change effects upon the Earth system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683611434235">Warburton, 2007</xref>). Polar regions and high lands of mid-latitude ranges are the periglacial environments where present and past geomorphic processes have been more and better studied owing to the fact of being places where settlements, infrastructures and equipments sit and are susceptible to being affected by the changing geomorphological dynamics caused by the ongoing warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611434235">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>). By contrast, in periglacial environments of mid-latitude semi-arid mountains, such as the Sierra Nevada in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, studies centred on the past activity of cold-climate processes are scarce because of their reduced extension and limited effect on contemporary human activities. In the context of the high Iberian mountains, there has been a major interest in understanding the extension and timing of glaciations during the Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611434235">Hughes and Woodward, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611434235">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683611434235">Palacios et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683611434235">Pérez-Alberti et al., 2004</xref>), whereas for the Holocene much attention has been given to the understanding of palaeoecological dynamics and the role of climate variability through the study of sedimentary records in lacustrine and peat bog environments, mainly from northern Iberia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434235">Morellón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611434235">Pla and Catalan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683611434235">Riera et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Likewise, until now no studies have reconstructed the operation of cold geomorphological processes in the past – and the associated climate variability – by combining data from sedimentary records and documentary sources. The use of historical documents to derive the past activity of cold processes has reached its maximum diffusion in the Alps and Scandinavia, where these studies have mostly focused on the historical fluctuations of the alpine glaciers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611434235">Holzhauser and Zumbühl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611434235">Nussbaumer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683611434235">Zumbühl et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The massif of the Sierra Nevada constitutes a border area between Europe and Africa, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and the high pressure subtropical belt and the mid-latitude westerlies, where we have reconstructed the past dynamics of cold-climate geomorphic processes taking into account the analysis of high mountain lake sediments and historical documents. Both sources provide evidences that enable to infer the changing extension and magnitude of glacial and periglacial processes in the present-day cryonival belt over the Late Holocene.</p>
<p>The goals of the present paper are:</p>

<title>Regional setting</title>
<p>The Iberian Peninsula sits between the subtropical climatic area and the mid-latitude influence. Sierra Nevada is a massif located at 37°N and extends east–west for more than 90 km, including the highest peaks in Iberia in its western fringe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434235">Figure 1</xref>): Mulhacén (3478 m a.s.l.) and Veleta (3398 m a.s.l.). The eastern part of this massif contains lower peaks (2000–2500 m a.s.l.) and its climate is more influenced by the warmer Mediterranean Sea. The height, compactness and extension of the Sierra Nevada control the regional climate and impose a wide climatic spectrum in the massif and neighbouring areas. The only high-altitude meteorological station is located at 2507 m in the northern face of the massif and reports a mean annual temperature of 4.4°C and 702 mm of precipitation (1965–1992), falling mostly during the cold semester. Air-temperature loggers recorded a mean annual temperature at the Veleta summit of −0.8°C between 2006 and 2009, with 90 days recording freeze-thaw cycles. Snow cover lasts generally from November to beginning of June in the summit area, with snow patches lasting until mid summer in the northern cirques.</p>

<p>Our study area is situated in the high lands of the western Sierra Nevada, where the Nevado-Filabride complex can be found occupying the nucleus of the massif and the Alpujarride complex forming a fringe around it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683611434235">Puga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683611434235">Sanz de Galdeano and López Garrido, 1999</xref>). Today’s landscape is a result of the combined action of the Pleistocene glaciations and the postglacial activity of periglacial processes that tends to smooth the glacial footprint carved by the last glaciation. Both erosional and depositional landforms are widespread features shaped on strongly altered micashists and quartzites of the summit area. Besides, the extremely low vegetation cover above the timberline (~2200–2300 m) enhances the potential for periglacial activity on this friable bedrock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2011</xref>). The high summer evapotranspiration rates determine the scarce vegetation cover of the hillslopes, which results in the typical landscape of the high semi-arid Mediterranean mountains.</p>
<p>The lake studied in this paper – La Mosca lake – is located at 2895 m in the northern cirque of the Mulhacén peak. Present-day geomorphic activity in this wide glacial amphitheatre is mainly controlled by periglacial processes. In this seasonal-frost environment, isolated permafrost patches have been also detected under the large talus slopes that connect the Mulhacén north wall with La Mosca lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683611434235">Schulte et al., 2002</xref>). A small number of snow patches still persist today in summer time at the foot of the steep wall of the Mulhacén peak, of almost 400 m height. La Mosca lake is located in a glacial depression dammed by one of the several moraine loops distributed at the base of this cirque (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611434235">Figure 3</xref>). Debris flows are also present on the steeper talus slopes.</p>
<p>References of historical documents also focus on the summit area, generally above 2500 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434235">Figure 1</xref>). The fact that both sources refer to the same elevation band (2500–3100 m) – the present-day periglacial environment – allows to complement the palaeoenvironmental history inferred from them in order to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the late-Holocene landscape dynamics in the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<title>Geomorphic activity and glacier development inferred from lake sediments</title>
<p>In the present paper we introduce data from La Mosca lake sediments (core LM-1), whose properties have been analyzed at 1 cm resolution. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) was measured using a Bartington MS2E High Resolution Surface scanning system at the Geographisches Institut of the University of Bern (Switzerland). The proportion of organic carbon (OC) and the C/N ratio of the sediments were determined with an Elemental Analyzer Macro at the same laboratory. The organic matter content provides information about climate variability and anthropogenic effects on the local and regional ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611434235">Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1995</xref>). Texture was quantified by x-ray diffraction at the Limnogeology Laboratory of the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule of Zürich (Switzerland) with a Malvern laser Grain size analyzer. Sediments required a pretreatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to remove the organic constituents and quantify solely the mineral fraction. Significant variations in grain size may reflect changes in the source of sediments, transport mechanisms and depositional environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683611434235">O’Sullivan, 2004</xref>). Finally, the abundance of K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu and Sr in counts per second (cps) was determined by a non-destructive X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanner at the MARUM Center of the University of Bremen (Germany); only Ti is discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>The temporal framework of the palaeoecological change inferred from La Mosca lake has been established with three Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS)-<sup>14</sup>C dates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611434235">Figure 2</xref>), which were processed at the Angström Laboratory of Uppsala (Sweden). Sediment accumulation rate in the core varies from 0.028 to 0.053 cm/yr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611434235">Figure 2</xref>), with an overall sedimentation rate for the upper 61 cm of the core of 0.034 cm/yr. Owing to the absence of enough dateable materials in the lowest part of the sequence, we used this rate to project to the core bottom at 90 cm depth, providing a calculated bottom age of 2850 cal. yr BP.</p>

<title>Historical documents as a source of palaeoenvironmental information</title>
<p>Since the 12th century several accounts of geographers, travellers, romantics, naturalists and scientists describe the Sierra Nevada’s landscape. We have reviewed up to 18 descriptions between 1137 and 1947 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434235">Table 1</xref>), although their accuracy is unevenly distributed over time. These descriptions focus on different features of the massif, but in this paper we have only selected those specifically referring to the natural landscape of the summit area. Obviously, we have adopted a reasonable and cautious approach concerning the interpretation of the geomorphological processes suggested in these accounts. Besides own books (original works, copies of originals, facsimiles, etc.), we have consulted documents and publications in several libraries and archives, namely: Library of the Museum Casa de los Tiros (Granada), Municipal Archives of Granada, Library of the University of Granada, Archive of the Royal Chancery of Granada, Library of the Natural History Museum (Madrid), Andalusia Virtual Library and Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library.</p>

<p>Variations in sand content along the core are very significant allowing to differentiate up to seven lithostratigraphic units in LM-1. Some units are characterized by a very high sand proportion (60–90%), others have a moderate content (40–50%) and the rest contain lower percentages (&lt;30%). Unit G, D and B show very high proportions of sands, which correlate with sharp peaks of MS, increments of 5-6 units of C/N, significant increases of Ti and drops of OC in the order of 1–1.5%. In contrast, units F, E, C and A show light increases of OC with a relative stability of the fine-grained particles, even though brief pulses with coarser sediments are also detected. In the upper part of unit A, a very significant increase of OC and C/N is observed.</p>

<sec id="section9-0959683611434235">
<title>Discussion: Palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic significance</title>
<p>According to the chronological model for LM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611434235">Figure 2</xref>), the interpretation of the data provides detailed information about the geomorphological processes and palaeoecological evolution that have taken place in this cirque over almost the last two millennia, as well as about the environmental repercussions that came about through variations in the late-Holocene climate. However, the accuracy of the chronology is only approximate between 2.8 and 1.8 cal. kyr BP, since no datings could be performed on the bottom part of the core.</p>
<p>This core reveals an enhanced activity of geomorphic processes in this cirque than in the catchments of the southern slope of the massif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>), particularly during phases G<sub>1</sub>–G<sub>3</sub> and M<sub>1</sub>–M<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611434235">Figure 4</xref>). Phases G<sub>1</sub>–G<sub>3</sub> are characterized by low OC and very high proportion of sands, especially in G<sub>3</sub>, where they represent almost the entire mineral fraction of the sediments (&gt;95%). These coarse-grained units are also accompanied by sharp peaks of MS and increases in Ti content, denoting a period with a greater amount of surface runoff and more vigorous weathering and erosion processes in the catchment. Moreover, the fact that increases of C/N are parallel to decreases of OC is consistent with an increase of erosion in the catchment, since it means that the terrestrial organic matter has been eroded, transported and deposited to the lake.</p>
<p>The magnitude of change in the geochemical and textural properties of G<sub>1</sub>–G<sub>3</sub> with respect to the rest of the core is very significant, which suggests that environmental conditions during these periods must have been controlled by different geomorphological processes. Only the existence of a glacier in this cirque could generate a very significant water runoff capable of transporting and depositing a large proportion of coarse-textured particles in the lakes during the melting season.</p>
<p>The appearance of a small glacier in the Mulhacén cirque would have been driven by appreciably wetter and colder climatic conditions (much colder than present) that led a slow snow melting at the end of spring and beginning of summer. Data of LM-1 suggest the occurrence of three glacial events during the last 2850 cal. yr BP: 2800–2700 (G<sub>1</sub>), 1400–1200 (G<sub>2</sub>) and 510–240 cal. yr BP (G<sub>3</sub>). Thus, some of the moraine loops of the Mulhacén morainic system may have developed during these very cold and wet stages of the late Holocene.</p>
<p>Hence, more water availability along with longer-lasting seasonal frozen ground created the right conditions for saturation of the topsoil during the melting season and therefore favoured periglacial slope activity. The prevailing colder temperatures would have conditioned a shortening of the ice-free period in the lake, therefore reducing its biological activity. The shortening of the warm season implied that the ground remained frozen for longer and limited the vegetation cycle to just a few weeks and made it difficult for it to develop. The Mulhacén catchment remained mostly free of vegetation and the periglacial area in the massif must have expanded to lower elevations.</p>
<p>According to these data, the last glacial event (G<sub>3</sub>) – which coincides with the timing of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611434235">Grove, 2004</xref>) – is likely to have been the coldest and wettest period of the late Holocene in the Sierra Nevada, with also the highest accumulation rates of sediment of the last three millennia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611434235">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In turn, data also reveal other phases (M<sub>1</sub>–M<sub>7</sub>) with coarse sediment deposition, decreases of OC and increases of C/N, MS and Ti, although the magnitude of the variations in them is less significant than in phases G<sub>1</sub>–G<sub>3</sub>. Abundant surface runoff also conditioned fairly high erosion rates and remobilization of mineral particles, helped by a low vegetation cover to act as a brake, although the size of grains set in motion was smaller (40–50% sands). These units are interpreted as being deposited during periods with appreciably low temperatures and high humidity levels – but not as cold and wet as phases G<sub>1</sub>–G<sub>3</sub> – that also brought about active geomorphological processes. This intense geomorphic activity was probably related to the existence of large and abundant late-lying snow patches in the Mulhacén cirque, but without the presence of a glacier.</p>
<p>By contrast, units in which the sedimentation was mainly composed of fine-grained sediments and higher OC values correspond to phases with low geomorphic activity probably driven by warm stages. The fact that the increase of OC is generally accompanied by rather stable C/N values suggests conditions conducive to increased biological productivity, both terrestrial and lacustrine. Besides, the longer duration of the ice-free period on the lakes owing to higher temperatures also promoted higher lacustrine productivity. Warmer phases conditioned greater slope movement stability and development of soil in many environments of what today is periglacial ground. On the edges of the lakes, warmer temperatures associated with the high humidity inherent to the lacustrine microenvironment favoured peaty development, with a thick blanket of plant life surrounding the lake. Less periglacial process activity, helped by a slight extension of vegetation in the catchment that slowed down-slope dynamics, resulted in less erosion, mineral mobilization and deposition in the bottom of the lakes. The early melting of snow impeded the development of large snow fields and glaciers in this cirque, and reduced the duration of the deep-frozen ground. Therefore, unfavourable conditions for active geomorphic processes prevailed.</p>
<p>Human footprint, namely grazing activities, is likely to have affected the natural sedimentation pattern over the last decades, when the largest content of OC together with a sharp peak of C/N are observed. Recent pollen studies from Rio Seco lake sediments reveal little evidence of human impact on the high elevation environments in the Sierra Nevada over the last millennia, with the exception of grazing during the last 100 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611434235">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>). In this line, still today in summer the cattle grazes on the meadows surrounding the lakes.</p>

<title>Chronological framework for landscape changes inferred from historical sources</title>
<p>Documentary sources provide evidence for the dominance of cold geomorphological processes in the summit area of the Sierra Nevada over the last 870 years with a varying temporal resolution, covering the Muslim occupation of the south of the Iberian Peninsula and the subsequent Reconquest.</p>
<p>The nature and purpose of these relates varies substantially over time. While the first Arabic texts were mere geographical descriptions of the landscape in the summit area, the documents of the 19th century and early decades of the 20th century show an increasing scientific basis. A clear transition is observed in these historical relates between the 18th and 19th centuries, moving from the Biblical flood theory towards encompassing the scientific approach promoted by the Enlightenment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434235">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Arab documents confirm the occurrence of cold environments in the highest parts of the massif, where cold, snow, ice and wind were widespread during the 12th and 13th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683611434235">Torres Palomo, 1968</xref>). These descriptions suggest that the slopes in the Sierra Nevada remained snow-covered during several months per year. However, regarding the Arabic authors, only the first reference describes specifically the existence of glaciers and their characteristics, whereas the others basically report the significant presence of snow in the massif.</p>
<p>No written proofs are available about the landscape of the massif from the last decades of the 13th century to the beginning of the 17th. From this century onwards descriptions are very similar to those narrated by the Arabic authors but more precise. Written information, supported sometimes by graphic documents, seems to define a morphogenic environment dominated by cryonival processes, with small glaciers installed next to the cirque walls in the headwaters of the highest northern gullies. Documents suggest that the spatial domain of periglacial processes was larger than present day. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434235">Rojas Clemente (1809)</xref> established the lower limit of this environment at 2900 varas (2436 m), minimum altitude at which snow patches would persist for most of the summer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434235">Figure 1</xref>), which were also decisive for snow trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683611434235">Rodrigo, 1994</xref>). In the same manner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611434235">Boissier (1845)</xref> states that above 8000 feet (2438 m) the persistence of snow cover in the ground extended for more than 8 months per year.</p>
<p>Descriptions of travellers also document the existence of everlasting ice fields on the higher reaches of the mountain inside the glacial cirques, especially in places sheltered from the effects of the wind and sun. In south-facing slopes some permanent snow patches also persisted favoured by the over-accumulation of snow because of wind redistribution. References to the glaciers and snow fields housed at the Mulhacén and Veleta cirques are abundant from the 17th century to the first decades of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434235">Table 1</xref>). The last explicit mention of the presence of an ice field in the Mulhacén cirque was done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611434235">Madoz (1849)</xref>. By contrast, in the Veleta cirque since the end of the 19th century and throughout the first half of the 20th century, documents confirm the existence of a glacier at the foot of the Veleta peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434235">Figure 5</xref>), though descriptions point to a decrease of the glacier volume and a reduction in the number of snow patches in the massif and their earlier melting. In this sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683611434235">Quelle (1908)</xref> states that the lower limit of the snow patches in summer at the beginning of the 20th century had already moved to 2850–3000 m. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611434235">Obermaier (1916)</xref> described the glacier existing in the Veleta cirque as an ice field despite its reduced area and low dynamism. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611434235">García Sainz (1947)</xref> made the last reference to the presence of a small glacier in the Sierra Nevada.

<title>Complementing information from sedimentary records and historical documents: Summary of results and discussion</title>
<p>Interpreting the data obtained from lake sedimentary records and historical documents enables to compare and reconstruct the palaeoecological evolution in the Mulhacén cirque and neighbouring summit areas for a period exceeding the last 870 years.</p>
<p>As far as the chronology of the sedimentary records is concerned, and with the purpose of reaching a more accurate history of the environmental change for the late Holocene, we have also compared the data inferred from La Mosca lake sediments with the geomorphic activity derived from solifluction landforms in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434235">Oliva, 2009</xref>). Thus we can check the geomorphological processes that occurred in the Sierra Nevada – as determined from natural records – against the observations and descriptions left by people who travelled widely through the massif in the course of the last few centuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434235">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The earliest documented references to the Sierra Nevada landscape date back to the 12th century, and already the role of snow was highlighted as a defining element of the summit landscape in this semi-arid Mediterranean massif. Arab texts note the presence of ice and snow at higher altitudes during the warm season, with snow being visible even from the city of Granada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683611434235">Torres Palomo, 1968</xref>). Nowadays, only small snow patches remain in summer at the bottom of the highest cirques, on sides adjacent to the steepest north-facing walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434235">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The first Arab account refers specifically to the existence of glacial areas in the massif, although later accounts do not. LM-1 sediments confirm a period of greater remobilization and transport of detrital material (M<sub>5</sub>), probably due to a greater water supply (i.e. profusion of snow) than during the preceding ‘Mediaeval Warm Period’ (MWP), when geomorphic stability prevailed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434235">Figure 6</xref>). Solifluction records also point to there being less vegetation cover, with moderately active slope processes above 2500 m between the 12th century and the first half of the 13th (S<sub>2</sub>). Therefore all three sources of information suggest that climate conditions were more humid and colder than today’s, favourable to maintaining a relatively high number of summer snow patches in the Sierra Nevada and possible isolated appearances of glacial events.</p>
<p>After this, there is a lack of documents recording how the massif landscape evolved, which lasts from the end of the 13th century to the beginning of the 17th. However, although written references are unavailable, lacustrine sediments confirm a period of relative geomorphic stability and solifluction records point to a period of regosol formation until the 16th century (E<sub>2</sub>). Sedimentological evidence therefore suggests higher temperatures and lower rainfall (i.e. less snow), which would favour incipient edaphological development, greater revegetation of the higher valley bottoms and slope stabilization.</p>
<p>Between the 17th and 19th centuries the explosion of rationalism brought by the Enlightenment resulted in countless descriptions of the natural and landscape features to be found in the Sierra (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434235">Table 1</xref>). In most of them two elements are repeatedly mentioned: the existence of small glacial areas in the highest northern cirques (i.e. Mulhacén and Veleta cirques) and the profusion and duration of late-melting snow patches. Along the same lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683611434235">Rodrigo (1994)</xref> highlights how dynamic the Sierra Nevada ice trade became in the 17th century because of the abundance of snow patches, which extended to levels below 2500 m, with a network of ice houses spread out at different altitudes to facilitate transportation to the provincial capitals of Andalusia.</p>
<p>The chronology deriving from La Mosca lake record reveal the existence of a glacial area in the Mulhacén cirque present between the middle of the 15th century and the beginning of the 18th, which includes the coldest and wettest phase of the LIA in Andalusia that took place between 1590 and 1650 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2006</xref>). There was also enhanced slope instability in the periglacial belt of the Sierra Nevada, which had less vegetation cover than it has today (S<sub>1</sub>). Solifluction was very active near late-melting snow patches, the presence of which is a key factor in activating periglacial mass-wasting processes in the massif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2009</xref>). However, the glacier in the Mulhacén cirque appears almost a century before solifluction activity in the massif becomes more pronounced, possibly as a result of the different altitude and different nature of the geomorphological processes in question. The Mulhacén glacier would have been closer to the climate limits needed for it to appear, while solifluction processes require a certain response time: decrease in plant and root density, release of clastic material, mineral mobilization, etc.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, travellers of the Romantic Era leave a written record of the gradual reduction in volume of the glacier in the depths of the Veleta cirque, undoubtedly the most frequently and most thoroughly studied feature in the Sierra Nevada thanks to its uniqueness and easy access from Granada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611434235">Gómez Ortiz et al., 2010</xref>). It should be noted that La Mosca record suggests that the Mulhacén glacier disappeared during the first decades of the 18th century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434235">Figure 6</xref>). Graphic sketches also confirm the earlier melting of the Mulhacén glacier with respect to the Veleta glacial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611434235">Figure 7</xref>). The topographical position of the Mulhacén cirque (NNW aspect), located at an average altitude of 2950 m – about 150 m lower than the Veleta cirque (N aspect) – constitutes a key factor in explaining the virtually complete retreat of its glacier two centuries before the Veleta glacier disappearance, which written testimonies suggest melted in the mid 20th century. These microclimatic conditions are noticeable today, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434235">Figure 1</xref>, which clearly shows that there is a greater number of snow patches in the Veleta cirque than in the Mulhacén cirque. Thus, during the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th, the Equilibrium Line Altitude must have fluctuated at around 3000 m, conditions which would favour glacier development in the Veleta cirque and greater coverage of the Mulhacén snow patches, though without glacier presence here. Since then, periods of a certain return to cooler and wetter conditions resulted in large snow fields in the Mulhacén cirque, implying greater liquid resources and a higher mineral contribution to La Mosca lake (M<sub>6</sub> and M<sub>7</sub>). It is in this geomorphological context that we should understand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611434235">Madoz’s (1849)</xref> description indicating the existence of ‘perpetual, hard-packed snow’ at the foot of the Mulhacén in the mid 19th century.</p>

<p>The Veleta glacier started to melt more quickly at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th because of the gradual increase in temperature recorded since the end of the LIA and the marked decrease in rainfall at the start of the 20th century caused by fewer recurring low-pressure systems over the Gulf of Cadiz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2006</xref>). The mid 20th century sees the disappearance of glacial ice in the Veleta cirque, which until then had been the southernmost glacial stronghold in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611434235">Gómez Ortiz et al., 2001</xref>), and a trend towards an earlier melting of snow patches. Still today in marginal enclaves of the Veleta and Mulhacén cirques previously occupied by glaciers there are masses of fossil ice trapped within an active glacier-derived rock glacier and permafrost patches, although monitoring points to a loss of mass and a rapid deterioration of the internal ice and frozen sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611434235">Gómez Ortiz et al., 2004</xref>). Owing to the ascending temperature inertia of the last few decades cold processes tend to lose intensity and affect higher altitudes. Consequently, edaphic development and vegetation cover have extended across valley bottoms over 2500 m, these being key elements in slowing down periglacial slope dynamics at ravine heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As regards the LIA, and considering that the lower limit of the cryonival belt in the Sierra Nevada during the early decades of the 18th century was to be found at 2436 m according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434235">Rojas Clemente (1809)</xref> and later confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611434235">Boissier (1845)</xref>, the vertical dimension of the cryonival environment reached an altitude difference of 1042 m with the top of the massif. Nowadays this difference is 853 m if 2625 m is taken to be the lower limit of current cryonival processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611434235">Gómez Ortiz et al., 2009</xref>), which determines an altimetric difference of 189 m. Considering that today’s vertical temperature gradient between the observatory situated at 2507 m and the massif summits is 0.49°C/100 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434235">Oliva, 2009</xref>), the temperature increase since the end of the LIA would be around 0.93°C. However, climate was not cold enough to imply widespread permafrost conditions in the summit area, which may have only occurred sporadically in isolated areas inside the highest northern cirques, adjacent to small glacier locations.</p>

<title>Late-Holocene palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic evolution in the Sierra Nevada in relation to regional climate variability</title>
<p>During the second half of the Holocene, several records point to a strengthening of the arid conditions in southern Iberian Peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611434235">Carrión et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683611434235">Pérez-Obiol et al., 2011</xref>). In the Sierra Nevada, this aridification trend conditioned the migration of cold-climate geomorphic processes (i.e. solifluction) up-valleys during the mid–late Holocene as late-lying snow patches remained progressively confined to higher elevations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the palaeoecological dynamics and climate conditions inferred from La Mosca sediments must be framed within this large-scale arid trend detected also in the whole western Mediterranean basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611434235">Jalut et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the environmental interpretation of the sedimentary facies, texture and geochemical proxies, three alternating cold-warm stages – which clearly correspond to the sedimentary units previously defined – are interpreted from La Mosca sedimentary sequence for the late Holocene. Chronology yields a higher resolution record for the last 1.8 cal. kyr BP, but the accuracy between 2.8 and 1.8 cal. kyr BP is only approximate.

<title>Until 1.4 cal. kyr BP</title>
<p>In the Iberian Peninsula numerous sedimentary records point to a gradual evolution towards a warmer temperature regime with higher rainfall starting around 2.8–3 cal. kyr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611434235">Martínez-Cortizas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611434235">Pla and Catalan, 2005</xref>). Around 2.8 cal. kyr BP takes place a period of glacial formation in the Mulhacén cirque (G<sub>1</sub>), which correlates with a phase of cold sea temperatures in the North Atlantic region (Bond event 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611434235">Bond et al., 1997</xref>) and remarkable low solar activity forcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683611434235">Wanner et al., 2011</xref>). This cold phase was already documented in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula and identified as the Subatlantic Cold Period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611434235">Desprat et al., 2003</xref>). Solifluction records in the massif also point to a cold and wet climate around 3–2.8 cal. kyr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2011</xref>). In southern Iberia a shift to wetter conditions is also detected around 2.8 cal. kyr BP in the close Zoñar Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611434235">Martín-Puertas et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>After this period, data of LM-1 suggest that temperatures gradually rose until 1.6 cal. kyr BP. However, within the confines of this warmer phase, there were three brief consecutive periods before 2 cal. kyr BP in which there was an upsurge in slope activity in the massif that occurred around 2.5 (M<sub>1</sub>), 2.4 (M<sub>2</sub>) and 2.1 cal. kyr BP (M<sub>3</sub>), probably related to relatively cooler and moist conditions. In the nearby Alboran sea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611434235">Combourieu Nebout et al. (2009)</xref> detected several rapid climatic oscillations between 2.6 and 2.3 cal. kyr BP from pollen data, contemporaneously to high lake levels in Zoñar Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611434235">Martín-Puertas et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Between 2 and 1.6 cal. kyr BP, the significant increase of OC and decrease of sands content in LM-1 are indicative of the prevailing geomorphic stability dominating in the summit area, interrupted by a brief phase of enhanced geomorphic processes around 1.6–1.5 cal. kyr BP (M<sub>4</sub>). Solifluction records and lacustrine sediments from the southern slope of the Sierra Nevada also reveal formation of very organic soils and a spreading blanket of vegetation in the valley bottoms of the present-day cryonival environment during these centuries that include the ‘Roman Warm Period’ (RWP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683611434235">Oliva and Gómez Ortiz, 2011</xref>). In general, there is wide agreement in defining the RWP as a phase with significantly warm temperatures and wet conditions in the Iberian Peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611434235">Desprat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611434235">Gil García et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611434235">Martín-Puertas et al. (2009)</xref> suggest a transition from arid conditions between 2.1 and 1.8 cal. kyr BP to a wet regime between 1.8 and 1.6 cal. kyr BP. For the RWP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611434235">Martínez-Cortizas et al. (1999)</xref> have estimated temperatures as higher than current ones by 2.2°C in the NW Iberian corner.</p>

<sec id="section14-0959683611434235">
<title>From 1.4 cal. kyr BP to 870 cal. yr BP</title>
<p>The ‘Dark Ages Cold Period’ (DACP) refers to a period of decreasing temperatures after centuries of warm conditions during the RWP. The DACP is a relatively well-defined cold episode, with significantly colder temperatures than during the preceding RWP in many European records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683611434235">Wanner et al., 2011</xref>). This climate cooling, that coincides with Bond event 1, is likely to have promoted the development of a glacier inside the Mulhacén cirque, probably with two episodes of colder and wetter conditions between 1.4 and 1.2 cal. kyr BP (G<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>After this phase, the OC curve shows a clear increase that may be associated to higher temperatures in the massif, especially between 1.1 and 1 cal. kyr BP, which may correspond to the warmest century of the MWP in the Sierra Nevada. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611434235">Martínez-Cortizas et al. (1999)</xref> have quantified a temperature increase of 1.9°C for NW Iberia. In contrast to the RWP, that has been identified as a warm and wet period, the MWP was a phase with lower rainfall both in the north (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434235">Morellón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683611434235">Riera et al., 2004</xref>) and south of Iberia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611434235">Gil García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611434235">Martín-Puertas et al., 2008</xref>) and North Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611434235">Lamb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611434235">Marquer et al., 2008</xref>). In this sense, the proportion of OC in the sediments is significantly lower during the MWP than during the RWP, which is probably indicative of a more arid regime during the former. Arid conditions coincide with a decline in solar irradiance between 1.2 and 1 cal. kyr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611434235">Mayewski et al., 2004</xref>). But this arid climate pattern that induced geomorphic stability in the Sierra Nevada affected a broader area than the Iberian Peninsula, since a prolonged period of aridity has been also detected for the western Mediterranean basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611434235">Jalut et al., 2000</xref>), leading to glacier retreat and low lake levels in the Alps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611434235">Holzhauser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611434235">Hormes et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Climate variability in the Mediterranean area has alternated cold periods with warmer phases during the last millennium, which have driven the geomorphological processes prevailing in the Iberian mountains. Hence according to lake sediments, in the Sierra Nevada there occurred several periods of remarkable geomorphic activity, with a similar timing detected in solifluction records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434235">Figure 6</xref>). The first phase occurred between the 12th century and the first half of the 13th (late ‘Medieval Warm Period’, M<sub>5</sub>), when a transition towards colder and more humid climate is detected in some Mediterranean areas, with increased flooding in the Atlantic river basins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611434235">Benito et al., 2003</xref>). Arab texts draw attention to the presence of year-round snow in the Sierra, even during the summer months in this period, with the possible appearance of glaciers in northern cirques. The prolonged presence of snow provided water, which is a key element for triggering periglacial slope activity in the massif.</p>
<p>Before the last phase with the most active cold-climate geomorphic processes (G<sub>3</sub>), there occurs a period of relative geomorphic stability as detected in La Mosca lake and solifluction records, with regosol development in high valley floors between 700 and 400 cal. yr BP (E<sub>2</sub>). This fact points to the prevalence of relatively more arid and possibly warmer temperatures in the massif. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611434235">Carrión (2002)</xref> also recorded a desiccation phase for the same period in a lake record from southern Iberian Peninsula, although other studies suggest cold and very wet conditions in the SW Iberian corner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683611434235">Rosa et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>From 510 cal. yr BP to the present</title>
<p>The LIA has been the coldest period of the late Holocene in the Northern Hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611434235">Grove, 2004</xref>). Although most sedimentary records confirm appreciable cooling over the last few centuries, many studies have identified a sequence of cold and wet events during the LIA in the Iberian Peninsula, with significant variations regarding the timing of the coldest and wettest conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611434235">Desprat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611434235">Gil García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611434235">González Trueba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611434235">Martínez-Cortizas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434235">Morellón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611434235">Pla and Catalan, 2005</xref>). In this sense, La Mosca lake sediments suggest that the coldest and wettest period in the Sierra Nevada took place between 510 and 240 cal. yr BP, with glacier development in the Mulhacén cirque and enhanced periglacial processes in the highest valleys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>). Morphogenesis in high areas was controlled by more active cryonival processes than those today, mainly linked to the existence of seasonally frozen ground. The appearance of glaciers in the northern cirques of the Sierra Nevada was not only dependent on the cold temperatures but also on the increase in humidity detected between 1590 and 1650 in Andalusia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611434235">Martín-Puertas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683611434235">Rodrigo et al., 1999</xref>). Solifluction records confirm very intense geomorphic activity in the Sierra Nevada between 400 and 150 cal. yr BP, with solifluction reactivating down to below 2500 m and intense mineral remobilization on the slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434235">Oliva, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The rise in temperatures inferred from historical sources in the Sierra Nevada has been estimated at 0.93°C since the mid 19th century. This temperature increase is in line with that estimated for the Pyrenees since the end of the LIA, where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611434235">Chueca et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611434235">González Trueba et al. (2008)</xref> suggest a temperature rise of 0.9–0.95°C and 0.9°C, respectively. As well as it happened in the Sierra Nevada, glaciers in the Pyrenees and Picos de Europa also expanded during the LIA, reaching their peak around the 17th to 19th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434235">González Trueba, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611434235">González Trueba et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Sierra Nevada, as observed in other Iberian records, a warming trend has been detected since the middle of the 19th century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959683611434235">Figure 8</xref>). This temperature increase has brought about the disappearance of glaciers and a migration of periglacial processes towards higher altitudes, despite brief phases of relatively increased geomorphic activity during cooler and moister stages (M<sub>6</sub> and M<sub>7</sub>). Warmer temperatures have also helped very organic soils to develop in the high valley floors (E<sub>1</sub>), sustaining dense herbaceous vegetation in sectors previously dominated by geomorphic processes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Lacustrine records from the Mulhacén cirque confirm the LIA as the coldest period of the late Holocene in the Sierra Nevada, with a drop in temperatures that historical sources have enabled to be quantified at around 0.93°C below current values since the middle of the 19th century. According to the geochronological studies performed on La Mosca lake sediments, a small glacier existed in the Mulhacén cirque between 2800 and 2700 (G<sub>1</sub>), 1400 and 1200 (G<sub>2</sub>) and 510 and 240 (G<sub>3</sub>) cal. yr BP. Glacial phases G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> correlate well with Bond events 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The comparison of the data inferred from written sources and the data derived lake records reveals notable agreement in the chronology of the environmental dynamics that has taken place during the last millennium in the Sierra Nevada. The sensitivity of the cold-climate geomorphological processes in this massif is a consequence of its being close to their climatic limits, thereby bringing about rapid environmental responses to external forcings.</p>
<p>The palaeoecological evolution inferred from both records must be framed within an aridification trend that started in the Sierra Nevada around 4.2 cal. kyr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611434235">Oliva et al., 2011</xref>). Despite this long-term arid trend, there has been an alternation of cold and warm phases during the late Holocene in the Sierra Nevada, with varying moisture conditions. During cold and wet periods there were abundant late-melting snow patches and glaciers appeared in the highest northern cirques, as confirmed by lacustrine sediments (e.g. Mulhacén cirque) and written sources (e.g. Mulhacén and Veleta cirque) for the last few centuries. Geomorphic processes were very intense, the cryonival belt extended to lower elevations and had less vegetation than today, and lake productivity was also lower because of the long persistence of ice conditions in the lake. By contrast, phases in which higher temperatures predominate favoured the disappearance of glaciers and the early melting of snow patches, slope stability prevailed, periglacial processes migrated up-valleys and there was a higher lacustrine biological productivity thanks to a longer duration of ice cover on the lakes.</p>
