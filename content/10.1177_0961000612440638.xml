<p>If <italic>Read to Succeed</italic> has a familiar ring to it, there is a good reason. Google it, and about 500 entries appear, most as the title of local library or school programmes in the US and UK, a few as commercial packages, one as Read2Succeed, and just one as a conference title. That conference <italic>Read to Succeed: Why Children Need to Read and the Crucial Role of School and Public Libraries and Librarians</italic> was the UK’s Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) Youth Libraries Group Annual Conference for 2009. Although there is no reference to the conference in the book’s index, its role in its conception seems likely through the contribution to the conference and the book of four people, in particular Joy Court, the Chair of the CILIP Youth Libraries Group (YLG).</p>
<p>The UK in 2008 held its second National Year of Reading, which has provided an exemplar for other countries, including Australia’s 2012 National Year of Reading. Such events require enduring outcomes to be worthwhile, as identified by Court in her introduction to the 2009 conference programme:
<disp-quote>
<p>2009 is the year in which we see the launch of the ongoing Reading for Life campaign, which grew from the success of the National Year in 2008 … We in YLG are campaigning for the right of every child to make the most of their life chances by becoming readers and also campaigning for adequate provision of libraries and librarians to help them achieve that goal. We will be looking at how children learn to read, how teachers and librarians can work together, some exciting new partnership working, some inspirational ways of capturing readers and how to overcome common barriers and difficulties.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In essence, Court’s last sentence is also the stuff of the book and its 13 chapters. Those chapters are an eclectic mix of innovative and good practice, and case studies by a range of contributors who, from the six pages of information about them at the beginning of the book, are well-credentialled. However, whilst recognising that persuading authors to follow autobiographical statement guidelines can be a challenge, tighter requirements of the relevance and length of their entries would have minimised extremes such as entries of 14 or so lines, and one entry with a meagre 2 lines. An email address to enable readers to quickly contact each of the authors about their contribution would also have been useful. Even the editor has no contact information.</p>
<p><italic>Read to Succeed</italic> has a foreword by children’s author and organizer for Campaign for the Book, Alan Gibbons, who as a working class child ‘got the reading habit at Crewe Library’ in the north of England. He has some evocative turns of phrase to encourage librarians and others in their reading mission, for example ‘reading is the most basic of basics’; ‘Without the guidance of many dedicated librarians I would have not have gained access to the inspirational power of the written word’; and ‘libraries gave me power – and that also means the librarians that staff them. A library without a librarian is … a room’ (p. ix). In stressing the need for advocacy for reading for pleasure, he commends the book as ‘a stepping stone on the way to a more literate and more informed society’ (p. x).</p>
<p>Court’s wide-ranging and well-referenced 14 page introduction to the issues and the book does fairly note that that although 11 of the 13 contributors are British, ‘the issues faced and strategies developed are more universal’ and that the chapters range from ‘the very youngest potential readers, to young people on the fringes of deprived socioeconomic society’. Nor can one argue with her assertion that they cover ‘some of the most innovative and yet longstanding and successful reading promotion strategies in the world’ (p. xvii) – because that is the reality of the reader development initiatives and achievement in the UK − from Bookstart on.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, of interest would have been the editor’s information on how the authors were selected, to what end, and why there is one Australian and one New Zealand contribution − but none, for example, from Canada and the USA. The only, broad, criterion is in her introduction, where she states that all of the contributors, whatever their professional background and area of expertise, are indeed fundamentally concerned with maximising the opportunities for every child to develop that love of reading.</p>
<p>They do this in chapters ranging from ‘It’s never too soon to start’, ‘Creating young readers: teachers and librarians at work’, ‘A case study linking libraries and schools to inspire reading for pleasure’ and ‘The hard-to-reach reader in 21st century’. ‘It’s never too soon to start’ contains a good review of the impact of Bookstart since its first trial in the UK in 1992, and as the provider of the first evidence of the benefits of reading to children from the very start of their lives – research which has since been confirmed in Western Australia by Edith Cowan University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612440638">Edith Cowan University School of Education, 2010</xref>). That evidence of the return on the UK Bookstart investment presumably helped convince the new UK Government to reverse its disquieting decision in 2011 to discontinue funding for it.</p>
<p>A theme of the book is, according to Court, that confident, successful readers cannot be grown in the classroom alone. In response, it is replete with ideas, suggestions, and good practice which can be considered individually, and in partnership, by teachers, teacher/school librarians, and public librarians. Its value as an advocacy resource, too, should not be overlooked. Its publication comes at a time when, as Court observes at the end of her introduction:
<disp-quote>
<p>…the overwhelming weight of evidence and supported amassed over the past 10 years … should be signposting a positive future for the readers still to come, and yet the timing of the crisis in public expenditure around the globe could not be crueller. We owe it to all those future readers not to let these advances gained and lessons learned be forgotten. (p. xxviii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Don’t be too put off by the book’s £44.95 cost (it is cheaper for CILIP members). The library profession in the UK and elsewhere should be grateful that CILIP remains one of the few national library associations supporting a decent publishing programme. In <italic>Read to Succeed</italic> it has published another attractive, well copyedited and, most importantly, useful and timely title.</p>
